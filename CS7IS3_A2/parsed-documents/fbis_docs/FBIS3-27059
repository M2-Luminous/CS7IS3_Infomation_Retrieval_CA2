The Republic of China [ROC] must further strengthen regional economic cooperation with other countries, and this is the true way to promote China's economy to a new level of development. Therefore, he believes it necessary to spend his holidays in relevant countries with which the ROC has no diplomatic relations, discussing regional economic cooperation. Li adds: "The visit produced fairly good results. I think it is very important for establishing all-directional economic cooperation in Asia in the future." Li goes on to state that he learned by his visit that the respect shown by these three countries toward the Republic of China in Taiwan is "more than we can imagine at home." He also thanks the leaders of the three countries for their hospitality during his visit. The president expresses regret over not being able to visit the overseas Chinese in these countries, saying he had to "respect the host countries' arrangements." Li states that "China's further development must be separated from ideology," pointing out the orientation -- "peace, cooperation, and prosperity" -- for efforts to be made. Li concludes: "We helped the mainland achieve development just like we helped Southeast Asia achieve progress and development. We expect to use Taiwan's experience to help the entire Asian region achieve progress and development." Commenting on a Central News Agency reporter's question regarding the president's emphasis on "pragmatic diplomacy," letting other countries know about the ROC's existence, and on a reasonable position within the international community, President Li replies that the countries he visited adopted a very pragmatic attitude to discussing Communist China's protest. He says they know the ROC is a peace-loving country, and wish to make friends with it. He calls for patience and long-term efforts in this regard. In response to a question on ideology raised by a reporter from the Taiwan Television Enterprise, Ltd., President Li Teng-hui urges all Chinese to understand that the ROC must develop, and that the ROC is a state separate from China. He asks people not to consider his "unofficial visit" as "creating one China, one Taiwan, or two China's." "Quite obviously, that is impossible," he concludes. A reporter for the Broadcasting Corporation of China asks if Li has any plans for a second trip abroad in the same informal manner following his great success in the Southeast Asia visit he just concluded. President Li replies: "I will visit countries with which we have official diplomatic relations, and I will visit countries with which we have unofficial relations." He says it is still too early to say at the moment, but the press will learn about such plans in due course once all preparations are completed. A reporter for TZU LI WAN PAO quotes the memoirs of Hsu Chia-t'un [Xu Jiatun], former director of the Hong Kong Branch of the NEW CHINA [XINHUA] NEWS AGENCY, as saying the PRC leadership considers Taiwan's vigorous efforts to occupy international space as aimed at gaining independence in a disguised form, and the PRC does not agree. The attitude of the Chinese Communist leadership will certainly affect the president's informal visit as well as regional political and economic activities, the reporter adds. He asks President Li if the latter has any policy or countermeasures against such an attitude. In his response, President Li questions the reliability of Hsu Chia-t'un's remarks. "It is very hard to judge future trends on the mainland by his remarks," Li says. Responding to a question by a CHUNG YANG JIH PAO reporter on regional economic cooperation, President Li says he discussed the establishment of free economic zones in the Philippines and rural construction in Indonesia, and the ROC's experiences in promoting development on Taiwan over the past few decades is very valuable to these countries. A reporter from LIEN HO PAO asks Li about protests from Communist China against his informal visit. President Li says every country in the world is "very practical" and attaches importance to its own economic development. He urges people not to treat the issue as "very serious." Li says: "The ROC is a mature country. I do not think it is necessary for us to flinch on account of such a minor issue as an immature statement." In response to a question by a TAIWAN JIH PAO reporter on the ROC's overseas investments, President Li states the ROC still needs to rely on foreign trade to promote economic development as it is a country without natural resources. He points out that there is no so-called southern or western policy, and the ROC must work in all directions so long as they are conducive to further development. He adds: "We want to invest in the mainland, Indonesia, and the Philippines. All these investment projects are different from each other." Li stresses: "We must understand the ROC wants to develop trade. It is the most important factor for economic development. If we want to increase the trade volume, we must transfer our capital, which is the most favorable condition enjoyed by the ROC now, to all relevant countries. After our capital is transferred, the volume of our trade will naturally increase." A reporter asks President Li for his thoughts about the trip. President Li replies that during his visits to the Philippines and Indonesia, local officials called him Doctor Li or Professor Li. The president notes: "The main reason is quite simple. Whether they are ministers or business leaders, they know Li Teng-hui accomplished many things in the academic field or in Taiwan's agricultural development, and all this proved very successful." Li then talks about how he sent two of his books to a foreign leader, saying: "To me, it is very significant that other people respect my past works in the academic field and in other areas. It is very pleasant if one can help his country by his personal achievements or by what he has done. [words indistinct] I am already at this age; the fire from this candle will burn for the people of my country and for this region so they can live in stability and so their standard of living can improve. I think this is very [?good]. Thank you." A reporter from CHUNG HWA JIH PAO questions President Li about what is the biggest achievement of his informal visits, and how he feels at the moment. President Li responds: "It is not good for me to appraise my own performance, for no one should appraise himself. However, I am very happy." He continues on to say: "I think all these problems are [words indistinct]. Currently the leaders of all countries have a common view. What is this common view? It is that politics should be democratic, should be free and democratic [words indistinct]. The economy should be a market-based free economy. No one [words indistinct] except leaders of a few socialist countries [words indistinct]. Even they are now inclined toward a free economy. What does this mean? It means world leaders have this common view, and this enables them to communicate easily with each other. Any problems between countries can be solved right away if leaders of those countries concerned sit down and talk. I have always thought there would not be any world wars in the future, maybe only minor conflicts because people have common views, and there would not be differences between them [as heard]. Will the civil war in Yugoslavia spread to the entire world? I don't think it will. World War I broke out there, but now [words indistinct]. Thus I hope everyone knows that almost all world leaders have common views. [passage indistinct] Whether it is the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, I think [words indistinct]. Like the U.S. President, Japanese prime minister, British prime minister, and French president [words indistinct]. Although Taiwan is very small, [words indistinct]." A reporter asks Li about Taiwan's investment plans in ASEAN countries. President Li answers: "Now it is between us and the Philippines, not Indonesia." He then explains Taiwan's plans to invest in and cooperate with Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, saying: "Especially Indonesia, because Indonesia is the largest country and has many rural problems. Actually, I made a very sketchy proposal there and talked with them. I think we should review this problem at home. Many experiences in Taiwan's rural construction will be very helpful to them. We took a special trip to see how they harvest rice, how their irrigation system works, and what their rural organization are like. These areas are where we can help them. The trip helped us understand the situation." When asked about the investment climate in the Philippines and Indonesia, and if improving the domestic investment climate is more important then helping local businessmen invest in foreign countries, President Li responds: "Improving the domestic investment climate is one thing, and investing in foreign countries is another. There is no competition between the two. The only competition may be on which side we should spend more money." He then explains why Taiwan should invest in Indonesia, saying: "How can the ROC develop without energy? Investing in Indonesia is necessary to the country's long-term interests. We cannot express the entire thing just by saying making investment and encouraging our businessmen to establish small factories there. I don't think that is the way." Answering a reporter's question about the ROC's foreign and PRC policies, Li Teng-hui says: "Our mainland policy and our foreign policy can be characterized by what we now call pragmatic diplomacy. As far as the mainland is concerned, we are working towards promoting mutual trust between the two sides." Li continues: "In my view, our talks with the mainland and our relations with it on many other issues need not be conducted in conjunction with ideological matters. The mainland should also understand this. We need not take our ideology into consideration and think that only our ideology is the best." As Li concludes: "I said a while ago we should work for peace, progress, and prosperity. These are the objectives the entire world is looking for. Even the Chinese Communist Party wants these things. This being the case, there should not be conflicts between our foreign and mainland policies. Diplomacy should be described as a very important piece of our mainland policy. "During my visit to the three Southeast Asian nations, the issue about forming a collective Asian security system was not discussed. The reason why this issue was not discussed is we cannot simply ask people who are still strangers to become our friends and fight alongside us. If others misunderstand us, the outcome would be unthinkable. So we should cooperate first in the economic field." The president adds that he feels Taiwan should proceed step by step. "I had the economy in mind when I proposed the establishment of a collective Asian security system." Li concludes: "I don't think we should consider military cooperation as an important base." Li states his impression about the leaders of the three countries he visited was that they, including the Thai king, are very sagacious. "They have a profound understanding of the issues concerning this region." Li cites as an example Indonesian President Suharto. He has been president for 25 years, but does not enjoy life in his villas. He understands many issues thoroughly, including small issues. "These leaders know very clearly the situation with the ROC. This is the case with President Ramos of the Philippines as well as the Thai King." As Li states: "World leaders today do not simply manage the affairs of their own countries; they are very attentive to their relations with other countries and the situations in those countries. They realize the strengths of the Republic of China [words indistinct]. I admire them greatly. My talks with them were very congenial. They understood what I said, and I understand what they said." Li says that among world leaders, Chinese Communist leaders are the most stubborn. "It is quite impossible to ask the Chinese Communists to renounce the concept of one country, two systems." The president states that he deeply feels Taiwan should work even harder. "We should not evaluate ourselves too highly. We should not think we can fool around and do things which are improper, thinking we have several billions of dollars in our hands. We should do something about our cultural and ethical conduct so people will respect us in these areas. Maybe this is more important. "I did not invite the Thai King to visit. I do not know in what way the invitation should be extended. But I did officially invite the other two leaders to visit." Hong Kong MING PAO reporter Lai Hsiu-ju asks: "Many Southeast Asian nations still hold conflicting views on the sovereignty over the South China Sea. Do you think Taiwan's southern policy can assist those countries in dealing peacefully with the sensitive sovereignty issue, and do you think it possible for countries in that part of the world to work together in exploring the resources there?" Li Teng-hui responds: "I share your view. But I just cannot tell friends I meet for the first time what we should do. Is it not better that we talk once we have met two or three times? So, as I said a while ago about the collective security system, I tried my best not to discuss sensitive issues like that when the time available was so limited, otherwise people might be scared to death by me and refuse to see me in the future." Li says that after they have met two or three times, he will certainly speak out. An ECONOMIC DAILY reporter asks Li to comment on the possibility of cooperation between the Republic of China and Indonesia in the aerospace industry. Li Teng-hui replies: "I asked a lot of questions when I visited the aircraft plant in Bandung. I asked a lot of questions about the plant's operations, management, and sales. But I did not suggest cooperation. Why? I know our situation, what we should do, and our level of development. The plant did not mention their problems, but I understood. So bilateral cooperation is impossible. The planes it produces are for commercial use. Because Indonesia has over 17,000 islands, planes are badly needed for transportation. The plant's monthly output of planes is about 270. I said something ridiculous: Buying planes is different from buying cars. They understand what I said. Plane purchases require a lot of money. Where will the money come from? Without money or loans, how are you going to pay? Problems like these are many." On whether his unofficial summits with leaders on the Southeast Asian trip might help the ROC's UN membership, Li Teng-hui says: "I think if the road to the United Nations is 100-km long, we have covered only one meter. So we have to continue to work hard. This is not easy. We must work hard so other countries will understand better that the United Nations will not get anything from us if we are not a member, and then all countries, including large countries, will help us. This is the direction toward which we should work hard."
