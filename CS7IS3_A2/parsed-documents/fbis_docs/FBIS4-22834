Medvedev and B.G. Korshunov, Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys; UDC 669.053.4:669.2/8] [Abstract] Methods of intensifying hydrometallurgical processes currently used in the nonferrous industry and unconventional methods of accelerating lixivation of raw minerals are reviewed on the basis of recent research done at the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys. As the point of departure is considered the classical relation da/dt= (+/-)KC[.sup]n[/]S (a- degree of conversion, t- time, S- area of interphase boundary, C- concentration of reactant of component, n- order of process with respect to reactant or component, K= Ae[.sup]-E/RT[/]- empirically determined process rate constant, E- activation energy, R- universal gas constant, T- temperature, A- coefficient) describing lixivation, crystallization, cementation, and ion exchange processes. Use of _g_-radiation from sources such as [.sup]60[/]Co or [.sup]137[/] Cs for radiolysis of water intensifies oxidation-dissolution of uranium and its use for electrolysis or photolysis of Eu salts (sulfate) intensifies reduction-precipitation for separation of Eu from other rare-earth elements. Ultrasonic processing of ionite intensifies ion exchange. Ultrasound is also used for completing lixivation of Pb cake by dissolution of Zn,In,Cd admixtures and for overcoming barriers which limit chemical reactions such as A(solid) + B(in solution) C(solid) + D(in solution) by limiting internal diffusion through solid product layers. A simpler new method of overcoming these barriers during lixivation of ores and concentrates has been proposed by the authors, namely implantation of additives in the pulp which will act as crystallization centers. Such an additive should contain calcite or preferably dolomite for lixivation of scheelite with soda in an autoclave, or tungstic acid (powder) for decomposition of scheelite with nitric acid. Lixivation of Pb cake and of concentrates with more precious contents is also being intensified by mechanical activation: in centrifugal planetary grinding mill with drums which rotate both about their common axis and in the opposite sense about their own axes. Modification of minerals such as wolframite scheelite during comminution is being intensified either by mechanochemical activation, namely addition of a calcium salt, or by thermal activation into the phase-transformation range and subsequent quenching. Cementation of metals such as Cd and Cu is being intensified by mechanical activation in a continuous-action vibratory reactor. Figures 5; bibliography will be included in next part of this article.
