As an observer at the recent elections in the Republic of Moldova, the PD-FSN believes that the opposition parties have been systematically hampered in addressing the electorate, while the ruling party, with the support of the presidency, benefited from unlimited access to the television station. The communique points out that the organization, a week after the election and during the absence of observers, of the sociological poll entitled Consulting the People, is viewed as something futile and the possible transformation of the poll into a referendum on the basis of a presidential decree is inacceptable.
