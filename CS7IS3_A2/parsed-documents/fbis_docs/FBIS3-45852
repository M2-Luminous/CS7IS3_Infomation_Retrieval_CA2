He said: [passage omitted] There is a need to: Strengthen the position of agriculture as the foundation; bring into full play the role of large and medium enterprises; pay attention to the main points of economic growth; strengthen the construction of basic facilities and basic industries; alleviate bottleneck restrictions; expedite scientific and technological progress; strengthen the weak links in textile and other light industries; improve economic results and quality; and to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. In terms of work methods, we must increase the momentum in four aspects, namely, we must continue to increase the momentum: Of reform, to ensure the implementation of the party central committee and the State Council's reform measures in Hubei; of opening up to the world, particularly to Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States; of development and promoting the good trend of Hubei's overall and speedy economic development since Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour talks; and we must continue to increase the momentum of implementing policies. The general target of endeavor for this year is to catch up with the rest of the country by focusing on economic construction so that breakthroughs are made in all trades and undertakings. To ensure the fulfillment of this year's tasks and objectives, he stressed: 1. We must put agriculture in the first place of economic work, optimize the rural economic structure, invigorate rural markets, explore employment avenues, and invigorate the rural economy. 2. We must improve large and medium state enterprises by means of reform and opening up. This is the central issue in this year's economic work. It is necessary to continue to implement "Enterprise Law" and the relevant regulations, to put into effect all decisionmaking rights of enterprises, to orient enterprises toward markets, to reduce enterprises' burdens, to create a relaxed external environment for enterprises, and to make a breakthrough in establishing a new enterprise system. 3. We must strengthen the construction and technical transformation of key industries and key enterprises so that they are updated. In particular, we must pay attention to the construction of the Three Gorges project and provide good services for its construction and Hubei's development. 4. We must continue to widen the scope of opening up and raise the proportion of the export-oriented economy; foreign economic relations and foreign trade are aimed not only at increasing foreign exchange earnings but also at providing international market information for Hubei's economic development and providing services for the improvement of its economic quality and modernization. 5. We must strengthen the construction of transportation, energy, telecommunications, and other basic facilities to create good conditions for reform, opening up, and economic development. He said: This is the third year of sustained economic development since the province entered a fast development track in 1992. The basic figures we have set are high and nor is the development rate slow. However, facing sharp market competition, we must understand that our fraternal provinces and cities are also working with enterprising spirit. If we make slow progress, we will fall behind. We must stand on the heights of the era and strengthen our sense of urgency, our sense of responsibility, and our sense of historical mission. Guan Guangfu pointed out: We must pay full attention to the main subject of reform and development and correctly handle the relations between reform, development, and stability. Reform can help emancipate the productive forces. Without reform, there can be no major development, nor will there be prolonged social stability. This will be a year in which the most reform measures will be introduced. The current reform has an important bearing on the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. We must work in a down-to-earth manner with full political enthusiasm and a clear-cut attitude to score a complete victory in reform. To carry out this reform, we must bring about upsurges in study. First, we must study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and his new concept, knowledge, and methods about the socialist market economy. Second, we must further emancipate the mind and seek truth from facts. Third, we must correctly handle the relations between local and overall interests. [passage omitted] Fourth, we must be good at proceeding from our actual conditions and carrying out our work creatively. Fifth, we must persist in dialectical materialism to reduce the faults in our work to a minimum. Guan Guangfu pointed out: This year, in the course of deepening reform, we must continue to preserve the good trend of speedy economic development, uphold the fact that development is a fixed principle, persist in the principle of three favorable's, maintain a firm grip on development, and regard development as the central issue in handling the relations between reform, development, and stability. Speeding up development is needed in developing the economy, ensuring supply, and in maintaining social stability. [passage omitted] Guan Guangfu stressed: First, we must make a breakthrough in the structural adjustment; second, we must develop our economy to a certain scale; third, we must seek new opportunities for more key projects; fourth, we must pay attention to the method of using talented people to build Hubei into a capital pool; fifth, we must further widen the scope of opening up; sixth, we must expedite economic development along the Chang Jiang and bring Wuhan City's leading role into play. Guan Guangfu pointed out: Maintaining stable economic order, as well as social and political stability, is a prominent issue which should be given full attention this year. Stability is the basic condition for smoothly carrying out reform, opening up, and modernization. All localities should strengthen the comprehensive management of social order, strengthen their clean administration, and further improve the relations between the party and the masses and between cadres and the masses. They should properly resolve the arrears of wages for government cadres before 1 February. Guan Guangfu stressed: Strengthening leadership and ensuring the implementation of policies are the crux of deepening reform and expediting development this year. First, the implementation of the party's basic line and major policies should be ensured; second, leading groups at all levels should be further improved because this is the organizational guarantee for implementing policies; third, early preparations should be made for all tasks; fourth, leaders and departments at all levels should form a responsibility system for the fulfillment of targets during their terms of office; fifth, leading cadres in all departments should do actual work and tell the truth; sixth, collective leadership should be combined with work distribution and assuming responsibility for individual work; seventh, general calls should be integrated with specific guidance. Departmentalism is not allowed, nor is anyone permitted to keep the advantages for himself and leave the difficulties for others. [passage omitted] During this economic work meeting, Governor Jia Zhijie held discussions with comrades in charge of prefectures and cities on this year's reform and development. Li Daqiang, standing committee member, explained the participants' demands and questions during the discussions.
