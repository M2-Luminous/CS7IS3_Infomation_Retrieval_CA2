Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov today questioned NATO's decision to establish "military exclusion zones" around the Bosnian towns of Bihac, Srebrenica, Tuzla or Zepa if they were attacked. "The reply goes beyond the request" of U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for air strike threats around Gorazde, Vorontsov told reporters after an informal Security Council session, which he required to convene, on possible NATO air strikes and the current situation around Gorazde. He said his country was "in full agreement" with the U.N. chief's request to NATO. "We are of the opinion that the human tragedy at Gorazde should be stopped and if it cannot be stopped by political means it should be stopped by other means." But he said there are some elements in NATO's decision that the U.N. chief did not request. There are some paragraphs of threat of "striking the infrastructure, striking all kinds of important economic areas. We do not understand why it is needed," he said. According to NATO's North Atlantic Council decisions on Friday [22 April], "If any Bosnian Serb attacks involving heavy weapons are carried out on the U.N.-designated safe areas... [ellipses as received] These weapons and other Bosnian Serb military assets, as well as their direct and essential military support facilities, including but not limited to fuel installations and munitions sites, will be subject to NATO air strikes... [ellipses as received]" The Russian ambassador said the Security Council would continue to discuss the Bosnian problem on Monday.
