Narasimha Rao, to visit the United States played in unrolling the red carpet for Ms Robin Raphel? It is now clear that the Prime Minister's office (PMO) over-rode caution and the home minister, Mr S.B. Chavan's reluctance to ensure that the visitor was treated with due deference. Since the invitation was conveyed to the PMO more than a week before the arrival of the U.S. assistant secretary of state for South Asia, it can be inferred that it did play a role. It is no secret that Mr Rao has been most keen to visit the United States and his office has been working hard to ensure that his visit is a success. However, given its position as the nodal body which co-ordinates government policy between various ministries, it may be that the PMO has allowed its bias to cloud its judgment. Perhaps, signals emanating from this office, reflecting the desire for the Prime Minister's success in the United States, has given the wrong impression--that India would be willing to compromise key elements of its national policies for the purpose. That the Clinton administration may have indeed sensed an opportunity in this also squares with the fact that the invitation to Mr Rao and the decision of the deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, to visit New Delhi was taken around the same time. The problem the PMO, and indeed the government, now faces is whether or not to accept this invitation or seek dates later in the year. They are aware that the Prime Minister's visit to the United States must stand up to the already high level set by the recent U.K. tour, described by Mr Rao as the "most successful" of his foreign visits as Prime Minister. Unfortunately, the government is now confronted with a situation where, even as Mr Rao is being received with honours at the White House lawns, 38 F-16s fighter jets, hitherto embargoed by the Pressler amendment, may begin landing in Pakistan. Dealing with this is giving the government a major headache, because no matter how it looks at the issue, there are nothing but negative consequences for India. The United States has promised unspecified "incentives" for gaining India's acceptance of this deal, but as of now there is nothing that the United States has to offer. The more ominous possibility is that the United States may proffer some disincentives instead, should India appear difficult. In short, the United States may threaten India with the internationalisation of the Kashmir dispute through the United Nations, if it does not play ball on its nuclear non-proliferation plans. The main reason for the success of Mr Rao's visit to Britain was that country has more or less given up even the pretence of being a world power and, viewing the world from a commercial point of view, decided that making up to India is more important than making a point on human rights or Pakistan. So the English have gone out of their way to woo India and have made it possible to take the relationship onto what appears to be a new plane. This is not the case with the United States, which wishes to be the world policeman and arbiter. While U.S. investors are willing to see India in a new light, and indeed explore the new dimensions of the relationship, the U.S. Government persists in looking at India in a somewhat old-fashioned way, as a function of its relationship with Pakistan, or of its concern for retaining its global hegemony.
