FR940822-2-00134 FR940822-2-00061 5. Project Management A detailed management plan including the starting and completion date for each task; the time commitments to the project of key staff and their responsibilities regarding each project task; and the procedures that will be used to ensure that all tasks are performed on time, within budget, and at the highest level of quality. In preparing the project time line, Gantt Chart, or schedule, applicants should make certain that all project activities, including publication or reproduction of project products and their initial dissemination will occur within the proposed project period. The management plan must also provide for the submission of Quarterly Progress and Financial Reports within 30 days after the close of each calendar quarter (i.e., no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). Package grant applications must include a management plan for each project included in the package with the same project title and alphabetic identifier describing the project in the program narrative, as well as a plan embracing the package as a whole. 6. Products A description of the products to be developed by the project (e.g., training curricula and materials, videotapes, articles, manuals, or handbooks), including when they will be submitted to the Institute. The application must explain how and to whom the products will be disseminated; describe how they will benefit the State courts including how they can be used by judges and court personnel; identify development, production, and dissemination costs covered by the project budget; and present the basis on which products and services developed or provided under the grant will be offered to the courts community and the public at large (i.e. whether products will be distributed at no cost to recipients, or if costs are involved, the reason for charging recipients and the estimated price of the product). Ordinarily, applicants should schedule all product preparation and distribution activities within the project period. Applicants also should provide for the preparation of a one-page abstract summarizing products resulting from a project for inclusion on the Institute's electronic bulletin board. Package grant applications must discuss these issues with regard to the products that would result from each of the projects included in the package. The type of products to be prepared depend on the nature of the project. For example, in most instances, the products of a research, evaluation, or demonstration project should include an article summarizing the project findings that is publishable in a journal serving the courts community nationally, an executive summary that will be disseminated to the project's primary audience, or both. Applicants proposing to conduct empirical research or evaluation projects with national import should describe how they will make their data available for secondary analysis after the grant period. (See section X.W.) The curricula and other products developed by education and training projects should be designed for use outside the classroom so that they may be used again by original participants and others in the course of their duties. Applicants must provide for submitting a final draft of the final grant product(s) to the Institute for review and approval at least 30 days before the product(s) are submitted for publication or reproduction. No grant funds may be obligated for publication or reproduction of a final grant product without the written approval of the Institute. Applicants must also provide for including in all project products a prominent acknowledgment that support was received from the Institute and a disclaimer paragraph based on the example provided in section X.Q. of the Guideline. The ``SJI'' logo must appear on the front cover of a written product, or in the opening frames of a video product, unless the Institute approves another placement. Twenty copies of all project products, including videotapes, must be submitted to the Institute. In addition, a copy of each product must be sent to the library established in each State to collect the materials developed with Institute support. (A list of these libraries is contained in Appendix II.) To facilitate their use, all videotaped products should be distributed in VHS format. For all wordprocessed products, grantees must submit a diskette of the text in ASCII. For non-text products, a copy of the summary or a brief abstract in ASCII must be submitted.
