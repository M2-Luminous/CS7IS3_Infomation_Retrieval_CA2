Following the acceptance of the veto, Congress enacted the law without Articles 42 and 47, which had been vetoed by the executive branch. Even though according to standard procedure, the partial veto -- which already had been approved in the Senate -- had to be discussed in committee, Colorado Party Deputy Bernardino Cano Radil moved that the matter be discussed in a plenary session and his motion was adopted. In light of the arguments made during the debate, deputies agreed to accept the president's decision to veto two articles of the law and the latter was carried with unanimous approval. As of the moment it is notified of the enactment of the law by Congress, the Executive branch has 20 days to promulgate and publish the law, but, according to what congressmen pointed out, the Executive branch is expected to deal with the issue in an urgent manner so as to establish the Council for Magistrates as soon as possible.
