Political analysts believe that the Zionist regime's impudence in the attack on Lebanon, which is contrary to all the international conventions, is the natural outcome of the UN Security Council's double-dealing in the face of this regime's repeated acts of aggression. Thanks to U.S. support for Tel-Aviv, the Security Council, which is supposed to maintain international security, either ignores criminal acts of the Zionist regime or releases a vague and ineffective resolution. Several days ago the Zionist regime, within the framework of its hostile behavior against the regional countries, abducted a leader of the Believers Resistance Group from his residence and took him to the occupied territories. Continuation of these acts of aggression proves the point that, contrary to its peace-seeking slogans, the Zionist regime's criminal behavior remains. Neither is the Zionist regime's claim that it launched an attack on the Hezbollah center in retaliation for jihad operations by the Islamic resistance combatants acceptable under any logic: The Zionist regime has occupied some part of the Lebanese territory, and the Lebanese people enjoy the legitimate right, in accordance with international regulations, to fight for the liberation of their occupied territories, whereas the Zionist regime is forbidden from retaliation even if it is attacked in Lebanon. It is obvious that the renewed silence of the Security Council vis-a-vis today's aggression of the Zionist regime, which brought death and destruction to another group of Lebanon's innocent people, once again proves the fact to the people of the world that the existing international system, comprising the UN as a major part of the system, is incapable of defending nations, thanks to the bullying structure of the system. The system is incapable of bringing real peace and security to every corner of the world.
