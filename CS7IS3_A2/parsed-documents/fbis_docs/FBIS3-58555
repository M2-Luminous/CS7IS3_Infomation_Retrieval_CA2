Could the countries in Eastern Europe become NATO members? The main aspect of that question was either ignored or pushed aside... Considering the fact that NATO is a defense alliance, it has to defend its members. However, against which enemy will it do so? Obviously, the agreement for the North Atlantic alliance clearly defined the enemy when it was first drawn up. However, it is common knowledge that many changes have taken place since then. The effort that was made to define the new enemy after the Soviet Union disintegrated failed to yield results. The Statements on the situation by the NATO secretary general have not sufficiently clarified the situation. It is a fact that a state of confusion still exists in NATO. Undoubtedly, the desire of the countries in Eastern Europe to join NATO to establish security against Russia for themselves in today's uncertain world has created a two-sided problem. On the one hand, Washington deemed it useful to have NATO under its hand; on the other hand, it felt the need to consider the problems that may be created if NATO moved to place the countries in Eastern Europe under its protection against Russia. A middle way had to be found. Consequently, the concept of a Partnership for Peace was proposed. It opened NATO's door to the countries in Eastern Europe. A decision was adopted in Brussels to begin a new process that will eventually allow those countries to become NATO members. How would Russia react to that state of affairs, however? In a statement to CUMHURIYET, Albert Chernyshev, Russians ambassador to Turkey, replied as follows: "We do not want the new NATO structure. If a new security system is to be drawn up for Europe, then we should do it together. In principle, the CIS may adopt a firm approach if NATO is enlarged." Considering the matter from the point of view of international politics, Ambassador Chernyshev may be described as justified. That is because the countries in Eastern Europe have been observed to prepare to join the restructured NATO against Russia. The point that has drawn Turkey's attention is this: Chernyshev has mentioned the CIS as a force to counter NATO. Obviously, he regards Russia as being integrated with the republics in Central Asia. How the Turkic republics in Central Asia will react to his opinion is an interesting question. It seems that the NATO summit in Brussels will make a serious blunder while trying to rectify the situation. Obviously, the main reason for that is NATO's inability to define the new enemy. The Western world headed by the United States seems to have found itself confronted with a problem of principle in the "new world order." Washington used the UN organization and the UN Security Council in the Gulf War. However, neither that organization nor NATO have been effective in Bosnia. Considering all that, will NATO be the military force in the new world order? It is a fact that NATO regarded the Soviet Union as an enemy force in the past. Will it regard the CIS in the same way now? Many questions can be asked on that subject. However, it is a fact that the participants in the NATO summit did not represent the entire world. Not only does it not represent the entire world, NATO has been unable to represent all of Europe. That is because its door to Eastern Europe is neither open nor closed. Furthermore, Europe's borders cannot be drawn up without Russia being included in the process.
