FR940620-2-00072 FR940620-2-00045 [Release No. 34&hyph;34206; File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;06] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval on a Temporary Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Revisions to the Standards for Letters of Credit Deposited as Margin June 13, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on May 27, 1994, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared primarily by OCC. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change through June 30, 1995. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change extends the Commission's previous temporary approval of OCC's modifications to its rules setting forth the standards for letters of credit deposited with OCC as margin. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Previously, OCC has filed with the Commission and the Commission has temporarily approved rule changes which modify the standards for letters of credit deposited with OCC as margin. 2 Like the previous filings, this filing makes several modifications to Rule 604, which sets forth the standards for acceptable forms of collateral deposited with OCC as margin. With respect to letters of credit constituting an acceptable form of margin, the following standards must be followed. First, in order to conform to the Uniform Commercial Code and to avoid any ambiguity as to the latest time for honoring demands upon letters of credit, letters of credit must state expressly that payment must be made prior to the close of business on the third banking day following demand. Second, letters of credit must be irrevocable. Third, letters of credit must expire on a quarterly basis. OCC also is adding to Rule 604 language to make explicit its authority to draw upon letters of credit at any time, whether or not the clearing member that deposited the letter of credit has been suspended or is in default, if OCC determines that such draws are advisable to protect OCC, other clearing members, or the general public. 3 2 Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29641 (August 30, 1991), 56 FR 46027 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;91&hyph;13] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through February 28, 1992); 30424 (February 28, 1992), 57 FR 8160 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;06] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through May 31, 1992); 30763 (June 1, 1992), 57 FR 24284 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;11] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through August 31, 1992); 31126 (September 1, 1992) 57 FR 40925 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;19] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through December 31, 1992); 31614 (December 17, 1992) 57 FR 61142 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;37] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through June 30, 1993); and 32532 (June 28, 1993), 58 FR 36232 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;93&hyph;14] (order temporarily approving proposed rule change through June 30, 1994). 3 For a detailed discussion of the modifications to OCC's rules governing letters of credit deposited as margin, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29641, supra note 2. Since approval of its original letters of credit filing, OCC has received no adverse comments or complaints from any of its clearing members, banks, or other interested parties with respect to the modifications to Rule 604 or to the implementation of the revised letter of credit standards. Accordingly, OCC is requesting that the Commission again approve the revisions. OCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of Act and the rules thereunder. 4 Specifically, OCC believes the proposed rule change promotes the protection of investors by enhancing OCC's ability to safeguard the securities and funds in its possession or subject to its control. 4 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1.
