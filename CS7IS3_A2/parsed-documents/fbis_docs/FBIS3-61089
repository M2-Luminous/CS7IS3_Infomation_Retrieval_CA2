That all state institutions, industrial, commercial, financial, and transport enterprises, banks, and private individuals under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation shall proceed from the fact that the restrictions established as of 1962 by the UN General Assembly on relations with the Republic of South Africa in the political, economic, financial, scientific and technological, cultural, sports, and other fields are canceled. 2. That the abolition of the restrictions specified in Clause 1 of this decree shall not extend to military and military-technical cooperation prohibited by current decisions of the UN Security Council. [Signed] O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation [End box] "Russia, as distinct from the United States, where the 1986 Anti-Apartheid Act has been in operation, never adopted independent decisions restricting trade relations between the two countries--it subscribed to the sanctions imposed against South Africa by the United Nations," was how Leonid Safonov, chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Africa Desk, commented to KOMMERSANT on the title of the Council of Ministers' decree. Nonetheless, it is well known that (aside from the sanctions) trade with South Africa in Soviet times was held back by one further essential factor--ideology: relations were maintained merely with the ANC, the opposition at that time, and its leader, Nelson Mandela. Now both the ideological and economic restrictions have been lifted. But Boris Kolokolov, deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia, specified in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT correspondent that together with the restrictions on arms supplies, the embargo on trade with South Africa in oil and petroleum products imposed by the UN Security Council in 1977 remains in force also. It is expected that all restrictions will be abolished only after the first free elections have been held in South Africa, a black and white government of national trust created, and a constitution adopted, that is, not before May 1994. It should be observed for fairness' sake that trade between Russia and South Africa, in spite of the international sanctions, has been conducted, nonetheless, and particularly actively in recent years. It is interesting here that the information on the extent of bilateral trade made available to KOMMERSANT by Russian and South African departments differs considerably. According to data of the Russian side (the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the Trade and Industry Chamber of Russia), commodity turnover in the past year was not in excess of $800,000, with the significant preponderance of Russian exports ($500,000), what is more. South African statistics, meanwhile, put reciprocal commodity turnover in the first half of 1993 alone at $100 million. Russian specialists see as the reason for this disagreement in the data the fact that South Africa's statistics record contacts at all levels--as distinct from the Russian statistics, which only take account in practice of deals between major (primarily state-owned) companies. Indeed, "unclassified commodities" in fact representing nothing other than small-scale wholesale consignments of wine (of excellent quality, in experts' estimation) and a variety of consumer goods, costly and not so costly, and not necessarily manufactured in South Africa, what is more, account in the South African statistical summary for a large part of the trade turnover--$80 million. In the trade in "classified" commodities, on the other hand, imports into Russia of products of agriculture and food industry (approximately $3.5 million), textiles and wool ($7 million) and electronic equipment and precision instruments ($370,000) accounted for the bulk of these. In addition, a pronounced place in trade is occupied by products of chemical industry (imports from South Africa, $290,000; exports, $80,000). Civil servants from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of Russia and the South African Embassy believe that the very modest amounts of commodity exchange do not correspond to the two countries' possibilities and interests. As Leonid Safonov put it, "One has the impression that Russian entrepreneurs' ideas of Africa are shaped on the basis of the novels of Louis Boussenard." Meanwhile, according to him, not so much merchandise as unique technology could represent the main interest in South Africa for the Russian side. The knowhow of the Sasol firm, for example, permitting the production of liquid fuel from coal. It is this technology that under the conditions of the embargo on oil supplies has enabled South Africa to provide for 70 percent of the country's liquid fuel requirements. The technology of South African mining companies permits mining operations in very deep mines--up to 5 km. Many of South Africa's medical developments are assessed as being far above those of America and Europe. As we know, it was in South Africa that the world's first human heart transplant operation was performed, almost entirely with local equipment, what is more. In turn, as specialists of the Russian Trade and Industry Chamber believe, national entrepreneurs also have things to offer contracting parties in South Africa. According to information from the Trade and Industry Chamber, the well-known South African firms Strategic Material Supplies, Balmoral, Feninx Steel, and Development Resource Group have given the Russian side their requests for structural and high-alloy stainless steel, pig iron, hot-rolled sheet steel, and billets for rolled products. The firms Ace, P.B. International, Latitude Links, Plumb Contracts, and Bregowa are interested in supplies from Russia (and, possibly, other CIS countries) of cathode copper, tungsten, aluminum, zinc, titanium, magnesium, electric cable, and wire. Through the mediation of the Trade and Industry Chamber office in Pretoria, they have established direct contacts with the Tsvetmeteksport and Sovkabel all-Russia joint-stock companies, the Inferkom group, and the Zarubezhtsvetmet VAP [expansion unknown], and, according to KOMMERSANT information, precontract agreements have already been concluded. Interest is being shown in South Africa in Russian cement also. In addition, the Trade and Industry Chamber office has reached agreement on the sale via the Rusaf Trading, MANNCONN, Cinofoto, and Midas firms of test consignments of motorcycles, Krasnogorskiy Plant cameras, experimental Aviatika airplane models, and Vikhr boat engines, and also 3 million meters of viscose fabric. As the Trade and Industry Chamber observed, the prospects of supplies to South Africa of aviation equipment on leasing terms and the creation of a system of its maintenance are considered quite good, and there are opportunities for the joint creation of a system of passenger shuttle helicopter routes. Purchases of tropical fruit and animal husbandry products (which are not inferior in terms of quality to their American and Australian counterparts, but which are cheaper) could be of interest in South Africa to Russian importers. Specialists of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations advise entrepreneurs to think seriously of consolidating on the South African market to consider the quite complex domestic political situation in this country. Despite the fact that President De Klerk and the leaders of the ANC are endeavoring to avoid civil war, both white and black extremism is a reality, nonetheless. And even after the elections on 27 April 1994 and the formation of a coalition government, racial conflicts cannot be ruled out. It would thus be advisable to take account of the political instability factor when concluding contracts--and, accordingly, stipulating the parties' responsibility in the event of drastic changes in the political situation. In addition, it is essential to take account also of the following fact. An agreement on trade and economic cooperation has been concluded between Moscow and Pretoria which proclaims the principle of most-favored-nation status in trade. It was signed on 22 October, that is, before the Council of Ministers' adoption even of the decree on measures in connection with the abolition of sanctions in respect to South Africa. But the cooperation agreement is of a framework nature, that is, it describes merely the most general principles of mutual relations. Two documents of fundamental importance for the development of business--on the protection of investments and the avoidance of dual taxation--have yet to be signed. Mutual contacts at expert level on these matters continue, but owing to the general situation in South Africa, these documents will not be signed before the elections. Thus, prior to the conclusion of these agreements, a favorable customs tariff will operate in respect to the commodities imported into Russia from South Africa, but taxes on the profits obtained from commercial activity will be collected by both sides. The same thing applies to the income tax for persons who are not public servants--if a citizen of Russia receives his earnings in South Africa, he must pay tax both in Russia and in South Africa. Foreign citizens working in South Africa are taxed here, according to this country's laws, on a par with ordinary citizens of the country and are required to pay a progressive income tax. True, the interest computed for foreign individuals and companies (which are not managed and not controlled by South Africa) has since 3 June 1993 been exempted from income tax. KOMMERSANT NOTE: According to information of the Embassy of South Africa, foreign shareholders are taxed at the rate of 15 percent of the sum total of the dividend. The maximum rate of income tax in South Africa is 43 percent, and the level of income subject to the maximum tax depends on sex and family situation. Thus, for married men this income has to be 80,000 rand (approximately $27,000) or higher, and for single men, $56,000 rand ($18,600). Value-added tax is 14 percent. The rate of profits tax is 40 percent. To return to the question of how promising South African technology is for Russian entrepreneurs, it is worth mentioning that the purchase thereof would seem highly beneficial from the taxation viewpoint. The point being that in accordance with Russian legislation--even with the absence of an agreement excluding dual taxation--Russian entrepreneurs are exempted from the payment of VAT when purchasing rights to technology. Customs duty, on the other hand, may be paid off in equal installments over the whole of the period of which these rights are acquired (and in practice such terms make it possible to reduce annual payments to negligible amounts). And, finally, it is essential to take account of the fact that there is in South Africa the concept of "white" and "black" business, and even the interests of entrepreneurs of different races are represented by particular associations--the Afrikaner Businessman Institute of Commerce (AHI, represents the interests of "white" business) and the National Federative South African Trade and Industry Chamber (NAFKOK, the association of black entrepreneurs). The commercial interests of Russian businessmen in South Africa are protected by the Trade and Industry Chamber of Russia office, which opened in Pretoria in the summer of 1992. In the year that it has been working in South Africa, the Trade and Industry Chamber office has concluded an agreement on cooperation with both the above-mentioned associations, and also with the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB). In addition, protocols on cooperation with the South African Foreign Trade Organization (SAFTO) and the Mining Chamber have been signed. All these organizations represent the interests of about 80,000 South African companies--practically all which are of more or less note among the country's entrepreneurs. Inasmuch as trade relations between Russia and South Africa are as yet of a sporadic nature and Russian entrepreneurs lack, as a rule, permanent partners in South Africa, the Trade and Industry Chamber office could help them in their search.
