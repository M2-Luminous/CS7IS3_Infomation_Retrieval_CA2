Was the People's Party one of these factions? [Al-Najjab] We are not one of them. We did not accept the Cairo agreement which carefully defines the authority's marginal powers as evident in all the agreement's articles and appendixes. We still believe that the Palestinian people's main task is to end the occupation, achieve national independence, and find a solution to the refugee problem in accordance with the UN resolutions. We do not see anything in any of the Cairo agreement articles that will take us closer to that objective. That is why we will continue to struggle, outside the authority, for liberation, but we will support the authority if it contributes to the struggle against the occupation. [Al-Barqawi] But how can you support the authority without being part of it? [Al-Najjab] There are some tangible issues such as the Arabism of Jerusalem, resisting settlements, the detainees, and the Israeli repressive measures. If the authority contributes to the defense of these causes, it would find us with it in the same trench. [Al-Barqawi] So there are points of agreement. [Al-Najjab] We want to remain in touch with the authority, with the common objective of resisting occupation, preventing intensification of national division, and preventing inter-Palestinian fighting, and at the same time secure the opposition's right to struggle against the agreement by political and democratic means. [Al-Barqawi] Is there a danger of inter-Palestinian fighting on the horizon? [Al-Najjab] We are satisfied with the statements issued by all parties prohibiting infighting, but it is not just a matter of intentions. There are gaps in the agreement itself. For instance, under the agreement, the authority is committed to hand over everyone considered by Israel to be a threat to its security. If the Palestinian police implemented that provision, then there would be a threat of collision. Israel also insists that arms should only be in the possession of the police, hence the call for arms to be collected from the people. Some of these arms, used against the honor, property, and lives of the public, should be taken away because that would fulfill a national need. However, some arms could be used against the occupation so long as it is there. Administrative decisions do not solve that problem. It is, above all, a political issue and the dispute over it could lead to friction. That is why our party has suggested to both the authority and the opposition the idea of forming an authoritative national committee, with representatives from both sides, that would have the task of dealing with this sensitive issue and making decisions in the interest of national unity provided it is equally binding on all parties. [Al-Barqawi] Has that proposal produced any results? [Al-Najjab] Everyone has expressed appreciation and saw it as a serious proposal, and we are waiting for the replies. [Al-Barqawi] Regarding the agreement which you oppose, do you not see a possibility of improving its terms? [Al-Najjab] That would have been possible before the agreement was signed, and that is what we called for during the negotiations. The articles of the agreement that have been made public fully restrict the authority. We are watching its implementation, and that includes the approach to the various disputed issues such as the detainees issue. The [released] detainees' residence has been confined to Jericho until the expiry of their prison term. That is stipulated in the agreement. The same kind of thing applies to the authority's offices in Arab Jerusalem and the laws to be enforced in the transitional period. The agreement commits the authority to maintaining all the laws and military orders which were in force when the agreement was signed. There is also another provision which stipulates that the authority can only have offices in Gaza and Jericho. Israel is trying to use that provision as a cover for its known policy of clearing Palestinian national institutions out of Jerusalem. The authority should take a firm position on all these issues, the same position taken by the patriotic forces including the People's Party, upholding struggle for the release of all the detainees, return of the deportees, deletion of anything preventing that from the provisions of the agreement itself, and defense of the national institutions in Jerusalem. [Al-Barqawi] You are in Tunis for the closure of the office of the Social Affairs Department which you head. How is that to be interpreted? [Al-Najjab] There is some confusion which should be cleared up, and awareness should be heightened. The PLO is one thing and the authority quite another. The PLO is necessary because it still has not completed its national program specified in the peace initiative approved by the [Palestine] National Council in 1988. The PLO is still the Palestinian people's moral home and the symbol of their unity and common cause. The PLO has made major achievements including the vast world recognition of the Palestinian state, and it is the only body that can protect these gains. The authority, according to the agreement, is not allowed to have diplomatic relations with anyone, and its responsibilities are kept within the confines of the agreement and its implementation. It is not permitted to raise issues that have been postponed until the final phase, such as Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, and the settlements. Therefore, the PLO should alone continue to mobilize and concentrate on these issues and urge the United Nations, the Security Council, and the international community [to tackle them]. It should also insist on the resolutions pertaining to these issues and should resist Israeli practices aimed at perpetuating the status quo. The PLO should continue to seek to dispel the widespread delusion that the Palestinian question has been resolved just as the South African question has been resolved. True, the authority does, for instance, have a social security department in the occupied territory with specific powers, but the Palestinian people in the diaspora still have social issues which the PLO and its departments should continue to shoulder the responsibilities for, and the same applies to most departments. What is important now is that the PLO should create new departments for such issues as Jerusalem and settlement, and should keep the Returnees Affairs Department and the Political Department. We have submitted these ideas to the leadership and we hope that it will study them and respond in a way that would serve continuation of the national struggle. [Al-Barqawi] The supporters of the agreement consider what has been accomplished as just an interim step to be followed by other steps such as legislative elections in the future. What is your position on such elections? [Al-Najjab] Yes, it is a step, but in what direction? It should be in the direction of ending the occupation, and the transition should be from a reality of occupation to a reality that would rid us of that occupation. We do not see anything in the agreement that would help that. The agreement adopted the Israeli concept of the transitional period and its function. That, at best, would only lead to the implementation of the Israeli Labor Party's program based on withdrawal from the densely populated areas, which are small areas not appropriate for the Palestinians to exercise their right of self-determination in. As regards elections, the danger is that according to the agreement, they should merely be elections for the present authority's council with some "legislative and executive powers." If that is the case, it would be difficult to participate. The battle should be started from now for a separate legislative council that would form and supervise the work of an executive council. [Al-Barqawi] If the Palestine Central Council was summoned to a meeting, would you participate in its work? [Al-Najjab] We are surprised that the Central Council has not been summoned to a meeting to consider the agreement. The question we ask now is: What would be the Central Council's agenda if it indeed was called to a meeting?
