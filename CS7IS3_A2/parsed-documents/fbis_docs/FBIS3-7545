This was the first visit to Japan as a state guest by a South Korean president in four years and the first time that the focus of summit talks has not dwelled on the two nations' past history. The mass media of both countries reported on the summit and on the emperor's remarks in a calm manner. It is true that his visit took place at a time when the issue of DPRK (North Korean) suspected nuclear weapons development has become critical. However, it is believed that many Japanese and South Koreans have begun to basically share President Kim's view, which he expounded at the Imperial Palace banquet, that "the past should no longer be allowed to obstruct the future." Nothing is more futile than to allow the past to damage present and future relations between Japan and the ROK. We want to relegate to history that unhappy period when anti-Japanese sentiment reared its ugly head in South Korea and Japan continually expressed its exasperation with the South Koreans. Needless to say, the Japanese people should not forget the history and lessons connected with Japan's colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. In regard to the comfort women issue, South Korea has worked out its own relief measures without seeking compensation from Japan. Separately from these measures, it is now urgent for the Japanese Government to take actions to show its sincerity in tackling the issue. President Kim's current visit marked the first step toward establishing a mature bilateral relationship. Now that it has gotten on the future-oriented track, efforts should be made to keep it on track. On the basis of present and future interests, good relations between Japan and the ROK are essential in regard to the international situation. The two countries have many interconnecting roles to play to ensure stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world. North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program is a case in point in the immediate vicinity. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Kim agreed to support the international community's resolute actions to settle the issue while opening the door to dialogue with North Korea. They also agreed to further strengthen tripartite cooperation between Japan, South Korea, and the United States, while confirming the importance of China's role and seeking its cooperation. The two leaders sent a signal to North Korea that they would seek a solution through dialogue by urging the North to accept the full inspection of its nuclear facilities and to promote a dialogue between the two Koreas. But depending on the North's response, they said they would endorse sanctions to be approved by the UN Security Council. Because the issue poses a serious security problem for Japan and the ROK, this message is natural and reasonable. The UN Security Council has decided to take graduated actions in setting this issue. The Japanese coalition government--the Social Democratic Party of Japan in particular--should make efforts to tackle this issue with cohesion. Reportedly, Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Kim discussed all possible scenarios and agreed on how they would react. However, it is necessary that the defense ministers of the two countries get together to have a thorough discussion on how to deal with the issue. As President Kim told a news conference, it is apparent that China is opposed to North Korea's nuclear weapons development program. And, China will probably do its best to persuade the DPRK not to go nuclear because China might find itself in a difficult position when sanctions are discussed by the UN Security Council. China certainly understands the significance of President Kim's visit to Beijing in the footsteps of Prime Minister Hosokawa. We agree with President Kim when he said that isolating North Korea is not the intention of the international community and that neither are sanctions. The international community just wants North Korea to behave as a responsible member. We must now keep a sharp eye on the DPRK.
