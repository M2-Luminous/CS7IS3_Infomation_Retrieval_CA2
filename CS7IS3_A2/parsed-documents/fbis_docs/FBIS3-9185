FBIS3-9185 "dreeu055_d_94008" FBIS-EEU-94-055 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Mar 1994 SLOVAKIA NBS Provides Data on Meciar Government's Debt AU2103195094 Bratislava SME in Slovak 18 Mar 94 p 3 AU2103195094 Bratislava SME Language: Slovak Article Type:BFN [Report by "is": "According to Slovak National Bank Data, Meciar Government's Debt Amounts to 60 Billion"] [Text] Bratislava--The foreign currency reserves of the Slovak National Bank [NBS], excluding gold reserves, represented about $415 million as of 31 December 1993, $405 million as of 9 March 1994, and $439 million as of 14 March 1994. Slovakia's total foreign currency reserves (NBS reserves plus foreign exchange assets of commercial banks) reached $1.853 billion by 9 March. "Both NBS reserves and total foreign currency reserves can be considered stable, and, therefore, I see no reason to correct the targets of the monetary program for 1994," NBS Governor Vladimir Masar said within the framework of a meeting of the NBS Banking Council. The external indebtedness of the government sector increased from $1.6 billion on 31 March 1993 to $1.9 billion by 31 December 1993. The overall external indebtedness of the Slovak Republic, including the debts of banks and the entrepreneurial sphere, increased from $2.35 billion on 31 March 1993 to $3.169 billion by 31 December 1993. "The NBS has met all of its commitments," Vladimir Masar added. The servicing of the Slovak Republic's debt, including commitments toward the Czech Republic, represents $346 million this year, of which $229 million is principal and $117 million interest. Asked by SME about the situation of the current account of Slovakia's balance of payments (account of the trade balance plus account of services), NBS Vice Governor Marian Jusko said that the NBS does not avail itself of complete data yet. "The likely result is indicated by Slovak Statistical Office data about the results of our balance of trade in 1993, which ended with a deficit of 26.7 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]," he noted. The balance on the clearing account between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic reached 114 million European Currency Units [ECU's] in the Czech Republic's favor by 15 March, which falls 16 million ECU short of the set marginal credit. Hence, there is no imminent danger of payment in freely convertible currency for reason of exceeding the marginal credit. The state budget deficit reached Sk5.4 billion by 14 March 1994, and, according to the NBS governor, it "evolved within planned limits." Last year's state budget deficit amounted to Sk21.5 billion. When we include payments to the Czech Republic for exceeding the marginal credit on the clearing account, however, the deficit amounted to as much as Sk29 billion. The NBS covered the deficit, which, according to Vladimir Masar, increased drastically toward the end of the year, by means of a direct credit, which led to an inordinate growth of money supply and to the threat of inflation growth. Since 1 January, the state budget deficit has figured in the "state debt" item, and parliament will decide on how it will be covered. The former government's debt came close to Sk60 billion, also as a result of the inclusion of the state budget deficit for last year. [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 18 March on page 21 carries an 800-word interview with Julius Toth, outgoing minister of finance, by Igor Zvach. The place and date of the interview, in which Toth assesses his 21 months in office, are not given. Asked about the development of the state budget this year, Toth says: "The latest data suggests that meeting the targets of this year's budget is realistic. In March a year ago, the deficit stood at Sk11 billion; this year it will not exceed Sk3.5 billion. At the same time, we must remember that we have already paid Sk3.5 billion to the Czech Republic for exceeding the marginal credit [on the clearing account] and that we have released more than Sk1.1 billion for the National Insurance Company. The development since January therefore justifies my optimistic assertion that, given a very rational management of resources, it may even be possible to use a certain portion of the projected Sk14 billion deficit not for patching up holes but for development programs. And, inasmuch as the economy has already become stabilized, in my opinion, the budget management could end with much better results than in 1993."]
