Some residential quarters in the capital, Aden, were subjected to strikes this evening by surface-to-surface missiles. Shrapnel from these missiles, which were intercepted by our air defenses, fell on some residential quarters and hit innocent citizens. Today, in another arena, crushing battles took place between our forces and hostile forces on all fronts. Our forces managed to halt the advance of the enemy forces, after inflicting heavy human and material losses on them, which we shall report on in subsequent communiques. Our forces, led by the fighters of the liberation war, continue to cleanse villages and towns of the filth of the forces of the al-Ahmar gang which tried to spread corruption in those areas, looting the citizens and violating their honor. The Armed Forces, supported by the masses of the people, are resisting -- with rare courage and legendary bravery -- the barbarous and brutal forces, for the 45th consecutive day. They have unlimited confidence that the ruling military regime in Sanaa will take its last breath in the next few hours, and will have to drink from the cup of defeat and disgrace. God is great, God is great, victory is near.
