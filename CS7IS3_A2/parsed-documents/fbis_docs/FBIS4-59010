FBIS4-59010 "drnes090_l_94004" FBIS-NES-94-090 Daily Report 7 May 1994 ISRAEL Rothschild on Difficulties of Self-Rule Rothschild on Difficulties of Self-Rule TA0705105494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0800 GMT 7 May 94 TA0705105494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Major General Dani Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the territories, believes the power struggle between the local leaders in the territories and the PLO-Tunis leadership will continue. In his opinion, the PLO will find operating the self-rule difficult unless it assigns the local leaders a greater role. The local leaders, he says, will continue supporting the peace process in any event and will not join the anti-'Arafat organizations. Speaking to our correspondent, Gen. Rothschild said the Palestinians began by demanding that Israel leave them to manage their affairs on their own, but they soon realized that the task was very complex. The true test of the agreement's implementation, in the coordinator's opinion, will be the extent of the population's satisfaction and the rate of improvement in every sphere of life. Unless such improvement is attained, the strength of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the other opposition forces will rise. As for the next phase of the Cairo agreements, Gen. Rothschild does not anticipate easy negotiations on the early Palestinian empowerment in the rest of Judaea and Samaria. The matter is complicated, because we will be discussing joint Israeli-Palestinian bodies, he said.
