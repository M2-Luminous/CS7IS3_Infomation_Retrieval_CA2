The Norwegians have now agreed with the EU on the main outlines of an agricultural settlement. Norway accepts the EU's farming prices from the first day of its membership. The agricultural producers, however, regard the settlement achieved as a total defeat for Norwegian farming, reports Ulla-Maria Johansen from Oslo: [Johansen] Finland's negotiation settlement, in particular, has speeded up Norway's membership talks, and yesterday the government backed down from its decision to postpone the talks until next Tuesday. As a result of the talks which resumed last night, Norway and the EU reached agreement on the main lines of an agricultural settlement. However, the agreement has not yet been formally approved and details have not been made public. According to statements by Agriculture Minister Gunhild Oyangen, Norway has, however, accepted EU prices from the first day of membership, the compensation to be paid to Norwegian agricultural producers as well as the subsidy to be paid to the food industry. In addition to the regions north of 62 degrees latitude, the negotiations have achieved that frontier areas, which have the same production conditions as the north, are to be included in northern farming and EU subsidies. The Norwegian parties have refrained from commenting on information which has leaked about the agricultural talks as long as formal approval by the two sides for the negotiation result is still lacking. The farmers' central organization has, however, already branded the agreement as total defeat and the small farmers' central organization has described as it worse than expected. The `No to the EU' movement, for its part, demands a nine-month period for an EU debate before a referendum, and according to the latest opinion poll, before the talks on the agreement start, 28 percent of Norwegians are in favor of EU membership, while 42 percent are against it. The fishing negotiations also resumed in Brussels last night and, according to Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen, the two sides have come closer to each other on the issue of EU marketing freedom for Norwegian fish and fish products. There has been no progress in other issues. The fishing negotiations will continue today and one of the most problematic issues will be Norway's demand to keep the fish resources north of 62 degrees latitude within national control. Norway does not want to give the EU the right to decide on the fishing quota for Arctic cod in the northern waters together with Russia. This is Ulla-Maria Johansen in Oslo.
