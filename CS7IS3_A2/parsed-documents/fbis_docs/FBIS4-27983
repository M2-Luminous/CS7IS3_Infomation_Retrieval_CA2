Japanese officials said the two days of talks focused on the thorny issue of "objective criteria," the very roadblock that scuttled the "framework" negotiations in February. Japan and the U.S. agreed last week to resume the trade talks and expert-level government officials from the two countries have been meeting over the past week, both in Tokyo and Washington, to take stock. While officials declined to comment on the substance of their discussions, there were indications that the two sides still had trouble working out a mutually acceptable formula to quantify market access to Japan. One difference that has surfaced since the two countries decided Monday last week to resume the framework talks concerns the number of auto dealerships handling foreign cars. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has cited the number of foreign car dealers in Japan as a kind of "objective criteria" to determine whether Japanese consumers have equitable access to foreign cars. "For us, that amounts to a numerical target, something we agreed that should have no place in the framework," a Japanese official said. Japanese officials emphasized, however, that the negotiators involved in the two days of auto trade talks in Washington were not charged to make "political decisions." That would be left to another round of meetings that has been tentatively scheduled next week in Tokyo between Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, and Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, the two principals in charge of the "framework" negotiations for the automotive trade sector. Apart from auto trade, other industry sectors covered in this week's talks were the insurance industry and Japanese Government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment.
