As for the 514 industrial products, tariff on about 70 items can be reduced under the relevant provisions of the Customs Import Regulations. Commenting on the (?light) products on which tariff reductions have been agreed upon, Director Huang Yen-chao of the Industrial Bureau said the bureau is mapping out plans to decide on the items to be levied with reduced tariffs. According to the explanation given by Industrial Bureau officials to the U.S. side at the trade talks, preparations can be completed within about two months. Hence, based on this estimation, Taipei is expected to officially announce in March temporary tariff cuts on industrial products, which Washington has demanded. Moreover, Director Huang disclosed that the delegation from Taipei already clearly explained the difficulty of temporary tariff cuts on 185 farm products, and that import duties on 70 of the 514 industrial products can possibly be reduced under the relevant provisions of the customs law. However, he said, the reduction rates have not been decided yet. Sources from the Executive Yuan's Agriculture Committee disclosed that the U.S. response was not very favorable. The delegation from Taipei proposed a remedial plan and pledged to revise the administrative and legislative procedures for the customs tax regulations to reduce customs tax for import items whose tariff cannot be cut by half under the provisions of Article 47 of the Customs Law. However, legislation for such revision can be completed only after October of this year at the earliest. As for whether or not Washington is willing to accept the remedial plan, Director Huang Yen-chao did not further elaborate.
