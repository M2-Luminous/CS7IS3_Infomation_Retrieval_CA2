Kalashnikov-designed assault rifles have a worldwide reputation. Much less has been written about our portable antitank grenade launchers. Meanwhile they are worthy of respect and the highest assessment in their class of weapons. The RPG-7 is in the inventory of 40 countries' armies and is being manufactured in some of them. The RPG-7's design concept was developed at the end of the 1950's. An active-reactive ballistic design for an antitank weapon (Chief Designer V.K. Firulin) was used in this grenade launcher for the first time. In other words, the grenade "gathers momentum" using two engines -- launch and sustainer -- which provides a significant advantage in firing range. The RPG-7 with this projectile (PG-7V) was accepted into the inventory in 1961. This design was utilized more than a decade later in foreign grenade launchers (Sweden, Germany). The PG-7V basic projectile reliably penetrated the armor of the main battle tanks of the 1960's. The employment of the RPG-7 in a combat situation, specifically in the Middle East, convinced us of that. The PG-7VM and PG-7VS projectiles, which provided a greater armor penetrating capability with a smaller caliber, were accepted into the inventory at a later date. However, the age-old battle of projectile and armor seriously intensified with the appearance of layered composite armor that was developed in England. They used it in the armor protection of the Challenger (Great Britain), M1 Abrams (United States), and Leopard-2 (Germany) tanks. It is much more difficult for armor-piercing and shaped-charge projectiles to penetrate this type of armor. The development of the PG-7VL projectile, with a powerful warhead that guarantees an armor penetrating capability of up to 600 mm, for the RPG-7 was our designers' response. This was achieved by increasing the caliber of the grenade, the weight of the explosive and improvement of the shaped charge [kumulyativnyy uzel]. Indeed, in the process the firing range was reduced. The appearance of dynamic protection (reactive armor) further intensified the problem of maintaining the RPG-7's effectiveness (as, by the way, of all other grenade launchers and also ATGM's [antitank guided missiles]. Reactive armor is comparatively small units that are attached to the main armor of the tank or armored infantry vehicle. Elements consisting of two plates that are separated by a layer of explosives are located in a unit. When a grenade hits, the element's explosives detonate, the strike wave and the stream of fragments disperse the shaped jet and its energy is significantly lost for penetrating the portions of the plates. Increasing the grenade's power does not provide increased effectiveness in this case. And yet a solution to this problem has also been found. The PG-7VR projectile with a tandem warhead -- with two shaped charges located one behind the other-- was developed for the RPG-7 under the direction of Chief Designer I.Ye. Rogozin ("Bazalt" State Scientific Production Enterprise). They operate in succession. The first destroys the dynamic protection and the second penetrates the main armor. In this manner, our portable grenade launcher was the first in the class of grenade launcher weapons to provide the capability to combat tanks equipped with dynamic protection elements. An RPG-7 with a PG-7VR tandem projectile penetrated an armor plate equipped with dynamic protection -- a model of the latest tank armor -- at the arms exhibition in Abu-Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) in the spring of 1993. This caused a sensation. Just like this projectile penetrating through a half-meter thick steel-reinforced concrete cube. We can say that the domestically-produced RPG-7 portable antitank grenade launcher that was developed several decades ago is experiencing a second birth.
