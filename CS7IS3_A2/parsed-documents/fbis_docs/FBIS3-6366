The trade and industry minister gave the assurance after noting that the underlying inflation rate was around 2.5 percent and assuming a full 3 percent additional rate due to the GST. "And since we have a lot of offsets, it is likely to be below 5.5 percent," he added. Offsets to cushion the impact of the GST include rebates on service and conservancy charges and tax cuts. Mr. Yeo made this assessment in reply to MPs who expressed worry last week that GST-induced inflation could lead to a price spiral. Some had predicted inflation of 6 percent, while others feared it would hit 9 percent, more than thrice last year's 2.4 percent. Yesterday, the minister assured the House repeatedly that the new tax, to be launched next month, will not lead to high inflation. He cited a 1986 International Monetary Fund study of 35 countries which introduced GST and found that 29 only had a one-off rise in inflation. The rate went back to normal subsequently. For many, the increase was also lower than the tax rate. Addressing calls to combat profiteering, he revealed that the reactivated Committee on Profiteering and Inflation had met major retailers to gauge how they would respond to the GST. Many said they would absorb the tax for most of their lower-priced items and pledged not to raise prices by more than 3 percent for higher-priced goods. On the possibility of people taking advantage of the GST to jack up prices, he said the keen competition in Singapore's very open economy with no supply shortages left little scope for this. But, he added it was also difficult to determine what constituted profiteering. Price differences occurred all the time at different places. As long as people were willing to pay, who could say shops were profiteering, he asked. It could only exist if consumers had no choice. Noting that the government was nevertheless mindful of the public's concern, he cited several other measures, including the Department of Statistics' regular survey of hawker prices. Its finding so far: Only 4 percent have raised prices. "So this concern about runaway prices, therefore, has no basis at all," he said. The department, he added, will assist the Consumers' Association of Singapore [Case] by helping it to publish a list of the best and worst deals for consumers. The latter will be a blacklist, similar to the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board's blacklist of shops for tourists, he said, adding that Case should be bold in protecting the consumer. He also said that those who ganged up to form a monopoly would face the consequences of the Price Control Act. Under the act, the government can set maximum prices for goods which it thinks suppliers are profiteering from. Mr. Yeo's final message: The comprehensive measures could only work if consumers exercised their rights. "We have to teach the retailers that greed does not pay, and the consumer is in the best position to do that." Parliament passed the Trade and Industry Ministry's budget and began scrutiny of the Ministry of Information and the Arts. Debate continues today.
