Kolesov] [Text] Today the United States is completing work on creating the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) for surface ships. Its variant--the ACDS Block 1, being developed by a scientific research subdivision of the surveillance and command and control center in San Diego, California--underwent testbed trials in early 1992 at a special coastal combat information center using an extensive simulator of reflecting targets to check the capabilities and reliability of the system. In order to conduct sea trials of the ACDS, Block 1 is to be installed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70). The new ACDS has three loops, each of which embodies the principle of similar source integration (SSI): Sonar environment [SE] SSI; radar environment [RE] SSI; and electronic environment [EE] SSI. Like previous systems, the ACDS Block 1 is intended primarily for air defense; however, it possesses a significantly increased range of operation, a higher degree of automation, and higher level of target tracking. The system provides for the capability of changing and correcting software both in the process of sea trials and during future operation in the fleet. Although the ACDS was developed for aircraft carriers, it also can be installed aboard amphibious warfare ships and cruisers. The EE SSI loop is the main element of the entire system of electronic support of battle groups. Thanks to it, electronic intelligence [ELINT] sets and electronic environment channels of electronic warfare [EW] systems will be able to operate together, which will make it possible to create a single picture of the tactical situation for the battle group commanders. And although the EE SSI loop was combined for the first time with other loops in the new ACDS, in the future it is planned to include it in all combat direction systems in the fleet. This loop will accomplish exchange over digital communications channels with information sources, triangulation, and tracking of radiating electronic systems and their platforms on a real-time basis; compare the results with returns from the radar and IFF system; classify the radiating targets; eliminate information that does not match; and display the tactical situation on displays of the battle group units. This will make electronic detection a completely automated process, changing the very view of building a picture of the electronic environment. The EE SSI loop is designed to automatically connect the bearing line to the radiating electronic system and the parametric outputs of information sources. The latter may be ELINT sets and electronic environment channels of EW systems, such as the WLR-1H, SLQ-32 and SLQ-17 (installed on aircraft carriers), SLQ-32 and WLQ-16 (on cruisers, destroyers, and frigates), ALQ-142 (on SH-60B Seahawk helicopters), ALR-66 (on P-3C Orion aircraft), ALR-76 and ULQ-20 (on S-3B and ES-3A Viking carrier-based aircraft), and ALR-73 (on E-2C Hawkeye carrier-based airborne early warning [AEW] aircraft). The S-3B and P-3C aircraft can exchange information with surface ships both directly and via E-2C AEW aircraft, but the SH-60 helicopters and ES-3A aircraft can do so only with their own ship platform. Surface ships also receive information from ELINT satellites and enter it into the system. The EE SSI is designed to use the Link-16 jamming-resistant, high-capacity, digital communications line, which is part of the JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System) system. Link-16 provides information to a special subnet for exchange of commands and reports on the electronic environment. Tactical units of a battle group and its supporting aircraft tied into this system can receive a picture of the overall situation generated by the EE SSI loop of the flag ship and supplement it with their own data, regardless of whether or not their loop has wide capabilities. Using the new target data processing equipment, the control station officer will be able to provide a single electronic image to all Link-16 subscribers. The same processes occur on the Link-16 digital communications line as on the Link-11, but with greater accuracy and intensity. In order to increase the efficiency of the EE SSI loop, in 1989 NATO experts approved changes in the standard messages of the EE subnet of the Link-16 line. The loop operates in the following manner. With receipt of the sum total of bearing lines from the information sources and also data on frequency, pulse spacing, and pulse scanning period in the system, they are first compared to one another and then with radar returns. This process is automated and controlled using a computer. When the next report from an information source comes into the system, it determines if a corresponding report is in the system. If there is, the computer identifies the bearing lines and marks the radiating electronic system at their intersection, which is then compared to the radar return. If there is no corresponding report in the system, the loop compares the bearing line to the radiating source with the radar return, simultaneously continuing select a pair. These processes proceed continuously, so a return from a radiating target can be formed, for example, from a single bearing line taken at a great distance into a moving areas of probable target locations (ellipse). It can then supplemented by a second and third bearing line taken from the same or a different source, compared with the newly appeared radar return, and return to the starting position of the bearing line, when the supporting forces have lost electronic contact (their tracking is done according to radar data), or continue to exist in the system, even if there is no radar contact. Under certain conditions, for example, if the enemy is not using restrictions in the operation of electronic systems, the EE SSI loop can display the tactical situation without turning on the radar. It must be re-emphasized that the EE SSI loop accomplishes the comparison of bearing lines based on measured parameters and not on the results of classification of radiation sources, which may be presented later. In other words, two intersecting bearing lines having the same frequency, pulse spacing, and scanning period will be connected automatically by the loop regardless of whether or not the appropriate classification data are in the computer memory. The design of the question contains a postulate that a false association is worse than missing an association. If the pair does not coincide accurately enough according to the measured parameters, an association will not occur and the bearing lines will not be connected. The decisions by the computer, just like those by a person, may be incorrect; therefore, the loop's software provides for the capability of operator intervention in the into the computer operations to change manually the target classification and identification results. Each mark of a radiating electronic system, based on one or several bearing lines, is processed by a Kalman filter, which with the passage of time "clears up" the assumed position of the radiating source. Measurement of the bearings does not have to be simultaneous in order to receive a good result. Subscribers may transmit data about the electronic environment quickly or slowly, depending on the situation, without special coordination of their actions. The operator recording the mark of the radiating target on the display can see how the size of the areas of possible target location will decrease as additional bearings are received from the information sources, and the heading and speed of the radiating source gradually stabilizes, nearing the actual value. Despite the fact that the Kalman filter works more effectively with a large number of incoming reports, the target movement elements can be analyzed when just one subscriber reports on the radiating target. The EE SSI loop plays the primary role in the process of classifying ungrouped radiating targets in the ACDS Block 1. The parametric data of each return of a radiating electronic system are compared with the parameters in the computer memory, as a result of which a listing of possible radiation sources is produced. It is very rare that just one source is given, since the ranges of the parameters of the various electronic systems overlap considerably. For each class of radiation sources there exists a set of probable platforms on which it can be installed. If several radiating electronic systems are detected at one point in space, the potential adversary is located at the spot of intersection of the lists of probable platforms of each of them. Data on target speed and altitude from the RE SSI loop are also used to reduce the list of possible platforms. The computer calculates the likelihood of the existence of each class of targets. The ACDS Block 1 and its EE SSI operate in close interconnection with other systems. The sets of data from information sources, according to which they make the decisions, and the decisions themselves circulate over the JTIDS communications system with other ships. The easy-to-understand picture of the overall environment generated by the ACDS of the flag ship is transmitted to each ship without the aid of the costly installation of the ACDS. In addition to the problem of creating a combined picture of the overall environment for ships of the battle group, the following problem causes difficulty for American experts: How to avoid unnecessary duplication of primary information being received by tactical units where the situation analysis is done, which may arise due to the great spatial multichanneling in the digital communications line. This is particularly important when analyzing the electronic environment where the time sequence of data being received plays an determining role. American experts see the solution to the problem in changing the standard messages being transmitted over the Link-16 channels, which was discussed above, and also in ensuring a single target numbering system both for tactical units of the group and for supporting forces. When an operation on one of the ships of the group intervenes in the operations of the computer and does the association manually, the same thing automatically takes place on the other ships, too. Such a decision is due to the fact that each ship has tracking data which is not entered into its circuit, but is integrated into its local picture. The information received from its own sources is more complete and has a higher confidence level than that transmitted from distant sources. American experts believe that it is impossible to ensure a completely identical picture of the tactical situation on each ship of the group, but it is realistic to receive a combined picture. To do this, it is necessary to distribute the duties beforehand among those involved in the search. One reports only radio frequencies, another the pulse spacing, and still another the scanning period. Manual and automated information sources operate together in order to produce an artificial uniform product for relay to other subscribers. Manual sensors are used to divide up the parameters to be transmitted, and automated sensors are used to divide up the search sectors. One merit of the EE SSI loop is the fact that any variants of distributing duties is suitable for it. As is noted in the Western press, detection of battle groups using electronic assets today is considerably more effective than using radar assets. In particular, it notes the disproportion of efforts expended by servicing personnel on analyzing the electronic environment and the results obtained. Even on the newest ships of the fleet, displaying the electronic environment is a process that requires intensive manual labor and constant attention of the operator. Combat direction system operators must carefully compare the bearing lines by time and identify them with radar returns, and the signals often disappear before this work is finished. American experts believe that taking two bearings from different units with a rigid base (now totally at the initiative of the personnel), is a waste of time. It is impossible to accomplish such actions without coordinating over radiotelephone communications. In addition, operators know that only important information is worth the considerable efforts, and if a mistake is made in target classification, such a report will evoke obvious displeasure among the rest of those involved in analyzing the situation. Therefore, today personnel rarely use Link-11 for transmitting data on the electronic environment. Operators aboard Orion, Hawkeye, and Viking aircraft supporting a battle group also rarely report these data for the same reasons, although they have ELINT sets with good capabilities aboard the aircraft. An exception to this is the SH-60B Seahawk LAMPS-3 helicopter, which uses the ALQ-142 ELINT set to generate a continuous flow of bearings for detection of radiating sources. They are shown on displays of the ship platform, where the bearings are intersected with bearings of the onboard SLQ-32. American experts believe that such a fully automated exchange between the two units should be accomplished at the battle group level using the EE SSI loop. The exchange of data on the electronic environment must be done at a pace that makes it possible to assess the dynamics of target movement. This work cannot be done manually, especially in conditions of sailing in coastal areas and in areas of heavy navigation, when dozens of air and surface targets are in the battle group's surveillance zone. Development of the principle of integrating similar sources makes one look in a new way at certain concepts in electronic warfare. The word "return," which had only a simple radar meaning, is presented in the ACDS Block 1 actually as a "multi-return." It consists of connected intermediate returns of short- and long-range radars, identification systems, the EE loop, and sonar returns. Operators must clearly imagine the structure of this process, otherwise an incorrect identification will be difficult to recognize and correct. If people and systems such as the ACDS never made mistakes in combining, comparing, and classifying targets, the operator would not have to imagine all the particular features of the process of target processing by the EE loop. However, mistakes are inevitable and, in the opinion of American experts, servicing personnel must have the opportunity to correct them until the data corresponds to reality. Automation of the process of collecting and processing data on the electronic environment will enable operators to analyze the values which they observe. Tactical units will be able to report intercepted bearings for the EE SSI loop, enable other to make decisions on their comparison, or do this themselves. It is necessary to observe just one technical condition: To exchange data over the Link-16 line. It is believed that electronic surveillance and tracking must become as fully automated and integrated a process (within the battle group) as radar surveillance is today.
