Answering today a question of KCNA on the present situation surrounding the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, the spokesman said there is no change in our stand of resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue. He noted that if the United States really want to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should no longer seek to isolate and stifle the DPRK with a double-dealing tactics as now but clearly indicate its correct stand toward the talks first of all. Recalling that on January 31 we published a statement clarifying our principled stand toward the great difficulties laid in the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula by the unjustifiable act of the United States, he said: The United States openly defended the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which was demanding that we accept an unjust inspection tantamount to a comprehensive inspection, contrary to the points of agreement between the the DPRK and the U.S. and U.S. political figures went off into an undisguised war hysterics against us. All this was clear manifestation of the policy of stifling the DPRK. When the United States and the IAEA secretariat were resorting to base intrigues to stifle our Republic, openly reversing the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement like this, we could no longer pin hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and, accordingly, made a resolute decision to walk our own way, not bound to any promise. This decision of ours was immediately conveyed to the U.S. side through a relevant channel. In this regard the U.S. side made clear that the inspection by the IAEA should be one purely for the continuity of safeguards and officially notified our side that there was no change in its stand to continue DPRK-U.S. talks and it was willing to discuss the nuclear issue and the improvement of the relations between the DPRK and the U.S. as a whole at the third round of talks. Synchronizing with this, the secretariat of the IAEA suggested that it would seek an inspection only for the continuity of safeguards, renouncing its absurd former claim for a comprehensive inspection. It is a fortunate thing, if the United States and the secretariat of the IAEA mean what they say. However, the clamor for pressure on the DPRK continuously raised by the U.S. hardline conservatives makes us deeply doubt whether this stand of the United States is true, or not. The U.S. Senate reportedly passed a "resolution on sanctions" against the DPRK some time ago and then the U.S. ambassador in the United Nations called a consultative meeting of the permanent members of the UN Security Council and discussed the feasibility of the "sanctions". The United States and the South Korean authorities are even showing an undisguised movement to stage the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. It obviously contradicts the stand for continued talks for the United States to resort to such row of pressure before the end of the negotiations for defining the scope of inspection for the continuity of safeguards between the DPRK and the IAEA Secretariat. If the United States thinks it can get something by frightening us with strength, regarding pressure as an almighty solution, it is a mistake. The heavier the pressure on us, the firmer our determination. We will watch the future action of the United States with concern.
