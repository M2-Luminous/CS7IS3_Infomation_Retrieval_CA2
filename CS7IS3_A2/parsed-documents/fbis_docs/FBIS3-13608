Musa added that a just peace should involve Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and the recognition of the Palestinians' right to self-determination. Speaking at a seminar on the "Future of Peace in the Middle East," which was held at Cairo University tonight, Musa said that the Middle East does not live in isolation from fast-breaking developments that have altered the postwar world. A new world order is coming into being, although its features may remain unclear because it is still in a transitional stage. Egyptian diplomacy takes note of these developments, Musa said. He added that those who remain isolated will fall behind. The foreign minister mentioned that following the Cold War, regional conflicts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America found their way to the negotiating table. It was natural that the Palestinian issue would move toward a solution with the new changes in today's world. Musa declared that Egypt does not impose its views on the Palestinians or any other Arab party, but simply offers assistance when requested to do so and when it deems that its assistance is needed. The foreign minister reiterated Egypt's position on Jerusalem; namely, that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab territories. Egypt, he said, rejects all Israeli measures that were implemented with a view to Judaizing Jerusalem or declaring it Israel's eternal capital. Musa responded to a recent statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton that Washington sees Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The foreign minister described this statement as political and tactical [siyasi wa taktiki]. If this statement signals a new U.S. policy toward Jerusalem, Musa said, then Egypt completely differs with Washington about this policy. The foreign minister pointed out that the U.S. Embassy in Israel is still in Tel Aviv. Minister Musa said that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September 1993, stipulates that the issue of Jerusalem is a topic open to negotiations. Jerusalem is an open issue and Israel's measures there are invalid and illegitimate, Musa declared. The foreign minister voiced dismay over the UN Security Council's delay in denouncing the massacre at al-Ibrahimi Mosque. Describing the position of the UN Security Council as most regrettable, Musa said that a resolution passed more than two weeks after the massacre does not have the same force and effect of one issued immediately. The role of the Security Council is getting shakier by the day. The Security Council is losing its effect on and importance for world public opinion and is beginning to fall into the trap of double standards, a matter which will lead to the erosion of UN credibility, Musa stated. Minister Musa denounced the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories as being invalid and illegitimate. The Egyptian position following the massacre was not only one of condemnation but also of calling for measures to guarantee the safety of the Palestinians living in the occupied territories. Security is a two-way street and the Israelis should have no monopoly on it, Musa stated. The foreign minister said that Egypt is calling for the removal of some settlements, the disarmament of settlers, and the outlawing of Israeli terrorist organizations. He pointed out that Israel already outlawed two of these organizations: Kahkh and Kahana Hay. Minister Musa said that such demands will be presented at the negotiating table once the peace talks are resumed. This underlines the need to resume these talks, he stated. Musa said that there are only two methods to restore one's rights: either war or negotiations. Shouting and calling for the discontinuation of negotiations do not produce results, he remarked. Concerning the Middle East market, Musa said that this is an idea that has only been expressed, not yet implemented. There should be no fear of Israel because it is not a major country [laysat dawla kubra] in the region, he said. The foreign minister said that, regardless of what we may feel about it, economic cooperation in the Middle East will be a normal matter once a just peace has been achieved. Musa said that Egypt will definitely not provide Israel with water from the Nile. Egypt will not sign the treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons unless Israel signs it, he added.
