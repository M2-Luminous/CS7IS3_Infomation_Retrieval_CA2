The prime minister of the Republic of Bulgaria declared once again that the government has invested and continues to invest much effort in maintaining a parliamentary majority that will support the cabinet, without any change to its formula of a cabinet of experts entrusted with addressing the most important national tasks: combating inflation, fighting crime, settling the foreign debt, and other priority tasks. However, with great regret, Prime Minister Berov noted that changes have evidently occurred in the positions held by the parliamentary groups, which until now have supported the cabinet. The prime minister intends to attempt once again to achieve a unification of the parliamentary groups that are now in opposition to one another, so as to conclude the most important tasks on which work has begun, which any Bulgarian Government is bound to complete without fail. If the prime minister fails to achieve this before 25 May, he will consider that his mission of preserving political equilibrium in the country has been exhausted. He is firmly convinced that unless this is achieved, Bulgaria is on the road to early parliamentary elections.
