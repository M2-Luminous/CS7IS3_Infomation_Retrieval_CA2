"There were those," Shahnon wrote, "who criticised the play for being a one-man show -- meaning that the drama was acted by only one person -- even though there were many other parts." Using direct and sometimes coarse language, the story ends with the demise of "Piem" at the hands of the other actors, who finally realise that they, rather than "Piem," have the most important role in the drama. It isn't hard to detect the object of Shahnon's parody; Malaysia's premier, Datuk Sri Mahathir Mohamad, is popularly known as "PM," short for prime minister. But for Mahathir, the story could not have been published at a more sensitive time. In February, Abdul Ahmad, the editor of DEWAN SASTERA magazine which carried the story, was moved to another position at Mahathir's request. The story has raised eyebrows in political circles because Mahathir's style of leadership is increasingly being compared to that of his new deputy, Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, at times less than favourably. After four months in the job, Anwar's energetic style and high profile have generated another focus of attention on a political stage long-dominated by Mahathir, and some observers wonder how much longer the 47-year-old former student activist will be content as Mahathir's understudy. The conventional view has it that Anwar is Mahathir's creation and chosen heir. "Make no mistake, Mahathir wants Anwar to succeed him. That's why he is giving him everything," said a former newspaper editor who is close to the prime minister. But Mahathir has also hinted that he is in no hurry to step down. For many Malaysians there is a contradiction between Anwar's position as heir apparent and Mahathir's stated intention of retaining the premiership for an unspecified period, particularly in a political culture which stresses total loyalty to strong leadership. Some are convinced that Anwar's conspicuous visibility and contrasting approach on some issues foreshadows a power struggle. "It's not part of our culture... Anwar should know his place and be patient," commented local writer Karim Raslan. Anwar has certainly not steered away from the limelight since his promotion last December. In January and February, he made a series of visits to Brunei, Indonesia and Singapore that diplomats described as conspicuously successful. After the Jakarta visit, Indonesian diplomats detected an improvement in bilateral ties. A senior Singaporean official said that since Anwar's visit to the island republic, "I have received requests for Anwar to speak in Singapore almost every day." At home, Anwar managed a campaign to bring down the opposition state government in Sabah. A cabinet source told the REVIEW that Mahathir hadn't expected the ruling National Front coalition to win more than 13 seats in February's state election; Anwar brought home 23 seats, just two short of a majority. A job well done; perhaps too well done. "Mahathir doesn't appear to be in the centre of things, it's all Anwar," commented Rustam Sani of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies. Mahathir denies any backstage bickering. "I don't think there are any problems. The problems are imagined by other people, it is wishful thinking on the part of those who want to see problems," he told journalists in the first week of April. Such denials are not likely to dampen speculation of a brewing rift. Mahathir also claimed he was on the best of terms with his former Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Musa Hitam before quarrelling with him in the mid-1980s. Musa assumed a high political profile and was popular on the ground. The sense of power and popularity, he once admitted in an interview, went to his head. Anwar has often said he won't make the same mistake. But the danger signals are there. As well as maintaining a high profile, Anwar is also seen by some analysts as putting a small but perceptible distance between himself and Mahathir on certain policy issues. Mahathir's refusal to attend the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) caucus last November signalled his unhappiness with moves towards formalising Apec as an institution. Yet in March, Anwar seemed to send a different signal by attending a meeting of Apec finance ministers in Hawaii where he was one of two Asian representatives to hold a bilateral meeting with United States Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. "Anwar could not have gone without the prime minister's blessing," suggests Datuk Abdullah Ahmad, a former minister, adding that "maybe he gave it reluctantly." Those who know Anwar say he is less inclined to quarrel with the West that Mahathir, preferring a softer approach. Western governments have not been slow to exploit this characteristic. While Mahathir was lambasting the West at the United Nations General Assembly last year, Anwar was given red-carpet treatment in Washington by congressmen and administration officials. In a more glaring departure from the shadow of his political master, Anwar was quick to distance himself from an official ban on the award-winning U.S. film Schindler's List. The film, which portrays the suffering of Jews during World War II, was initially banned by the National Censor Board, which answers to Mahathir as home minister. But Anwar unequivocally supported lifting the ban, which he later announced after a cabinet decision taken in Mahathir's absence at the end of March. No one considers that Anwar acted without referring to Mahathir, who initially leaned towards supporting the ban. But--despite the fact that subsequent demands by censors that scenes of sex and violence be cut mean the film will not be screened in Malaysia--observers said the effect of Anwar's decision to lift the initial ban was to send conflicting signals on a matter of policy. Anwar supporters attest to a difference of approach between the two leaders, but they insist it is part of a constructive partnership. According to Khalid Jaffar, Anwar's press secretary: "They do differ, but they also confer a lot. At least Anwar does not disagree with Mahathir behind his back." But while Mahathir himself may not be uncomfortable with Anwar's assertive style, the rest of the political hierarchy is unused to dealing with a plurality of opinion at the top. "They don't like disagreement, it's unsettling and bad for business," suggested one political analyst. But what if the source of friction does not stem from the top? Some observers consider that the large body of supporters Anwar attracted in the run-up to his election as deputy president of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (Umno) last year--a run initially opposed by Mahathir--is putting pressure on him to speed up the succession process. They are seen as eager to hasten the day Anwar takes over so that they can accelerate their own political careers. They favour holding the next general election sooner rather than later, expecting the new cabinet to reflect Anwar's strength in Umno. Some of Anwar's aides also blame the business community for fuelling rumours of a split. They blame this on the intense competition for contracts stemming from the prospective privatisation of government holdings. "Some businessmen who were accustomed to favours before Anwar became finance minister are deliberately spreading rumours that he has fallen out with Mahathir," said an Anwar aide. Those who feel left out of Anwar's circle may regard their interests best served by encouraging Mahathir to feel upstaged by his deputy, but they could be mistaken to assume that Anwar can be swept aside the same way Musa was. Anwar's support in Umno is strong, having won over most of the party hierarchy in his bid for the deputy presidency of Umno. For Mahathir this means that Anwar could mount a challenge to his Umno presidency at the next party elections scheduled for 1996. For some observers, the balance of power is beginning to look precarious even within Umno. Every influential politician has his followers, but some observers regard the attention Anwar has attracted as symptomatic of changes in Umno. Factionalism is not new to the party, argues political analyst Abdul Razak Baginda, but the shift towards more corporate involvement in the party has raised the stakes. "That's not part of our tradition," he says, "and the competition is more intense."
