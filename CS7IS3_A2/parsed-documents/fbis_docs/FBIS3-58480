He admitted that he once raised the possibility of his own retirement, and that that was a mistake which subsequently fueled the internal crisis in the party. Felipe Gonzalez also stated that at the next PSOE congress, if he has the confidence of the delegates and it depends on him, Alfonso Guerra will figure in the new party leadership. In a conversation with journalists, Gonzalez admitted that the precongress debate in the PSOE has become heated, and that he is trying to stay neutral in the process of selecting delegates. He described as liars those who could have said he is opposed to Guerra's presence in the new leadership that will emerge from the congress, and emphasized his belief that Alfonso Guerra can remain a perfect PSOE deputy secretary general. [passage omitted] On a possible coalition government following the Socialist congress, Gonzalez said there is cooperation with CiU [Convergence and Union], which makes it possible to govern and to adopt measures as important as the labor reform. He repeated his offer of a coalition government, and said he is open to dialogue if CiU were to accept the offer. He admitted, however, that communication with the Basque Nationalist Party would be much more difficult now, although he declined to give an explanation of what he believes to be the cause of the Basque Nationalists' change of attitude. Gonzalez did rule out a grand coalition government with the People's Party, because he believes the conditions for it do not exist. Nor did he show himself in favor of holding an early election, although the latest opinion polls to be published show an increase for the People's Party. He recalled that something similar occurred last May, but the PSOE then won the election. With respect to the People's Party, Gonzalez admitted meeting recently with Jose Maria Aznar to discuss the situation in Banesto [company in financial crisis] and the NATO summit. He expressed his desire to continue to hold these personal contacts, although he admitted there have only been two in the course of the parliamentary term. Gonzalez also denied that he lives shut up in Moncloa Palace and has no contact with people, although he acknowledged that he could be giving the false impression of living isolated from the country's real problems. [passage omitted] The prime minister also criticized the attitude of the trade unions to calling a general strike for 27 January. In the opinion of Felipe Gonzalez, this is a totally inopportune act of irresponsibility, since it will not help to create jobs or to boost investors' confidence, and he repeated that it is bad for the already difficult economic situation suffered by Spain. The Spanish head of government also showed moderate optimism about an early emergence from the crisis, in view of the improvement in the latest economic indicators. However, he forecast a slow recovery which would have no immediate impact on job creation. [passage omitted]
