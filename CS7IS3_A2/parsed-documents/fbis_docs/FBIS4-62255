What we do need is to form the Republican Guard of Crimea only from the peninsula's citizens. I am convinced that the deputies will support me in this." In Mykhaylo Kukushkin's words, military ships should only be able to sail into the ports of Crimea on coordination with the Crimean president. Some data suggests that a draft document on setting up the Republican Guard of Crimea has already been prepared and will in the very near future be submitted for consideration by the Crimean parliamentarians.
