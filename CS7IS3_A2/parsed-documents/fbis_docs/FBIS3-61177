An extensive report was delivered by Defense Minister Pavel Creanga. In his opinion, the chief merit of the concept devised in the fall of last year is that it systematized all measures for the accelerated creation of the armed forces. This document deals only with military matters proper. The remaining factors--preparation of the economy, creation of state reserves, strengthening of morale--will be the subject of other prescriptive enactments. Pavel Creanga believes that practice, operational-technical measures, and the experience of work among the troops confirm the topicality of the concept. The minister criticized the proposals which Nicolae Petrica, former chief of the main staff of the armed forces of the republic, sent to President Mircea Snegur. Why? Petrica believes that a decisive role under today's conditions should be assigned not so much the regular forces as large-scale trained reserves (140,000), that is, a kind of "working army." It was proposed to this end that the republic leadership create under the auspices of the Ministry of Defense a network of centers for the military training of the youth. And that the permanent staff of the armed forces consist of 6,500 men. The defense minister explains why this is unacceptable: A threat to the republic's military security may be seen not in acts of aggression and wars of the nuclear powers and military blocs but in possible local conflicts, in which the Republic of Moldova would be forced to defend its independence and territorial integrity. Whence the conclusion that the armed forces should be such as to be able to quickly localize the center of tension, ensure defense of the borders, and cut short possible provocations and encroachments on independence. Consequently, the minister concludes, the troops should be professional and ready to fight, and the manning level of the reserve should not perform the predominant role. Setting forth the concept of army organizational development, the defense minister highlighted the main tasks of the regular troops: to efficiently and rapidly confront any possible threat without additional mobilization measures. If necessary, to be capable of additional manning to the level of wartime; to ensure a high level of the training of the command and control bodies and the personnel; and also of a militarily trained reserve capable of performing operational assignments. The Ministry of Defense is oriented toward the European average ratio of the strength of the personnel and the population--0.6-0.8 percent (0.23 percent with us). The concept defines the main function of the armed forces as performance of the assignments of deterrence against military provocations and aggression. The draft concept, the speaker observed, should be modified in connection with the creation of the Civil Defense and Emergencies Department. Defense Minister Pavel Creanga termed "absurd and harmful" General N. Petrica's proposals concerning the incorporation in Ministry of Defense formations of the carabinieri forces, whose assignments are totally different. Legislation prohibits the enlistment of carabinieri forces for assignments that are not within their province. Pavel Creanga believes to be completely wrong Nicolae Petrica's opinion concerning alternative service because it has not been justified "from either the economic or moral viewpoints." The Ministry of Defense has devised proposals for the government which will help avoid wrongdoing in questions of the organization and performance of alternative service. The concept embodies a new principle altogether. The numerical composition of the army and its structure cannot be constant from year to year, they must correspond to the military-political conditions in the region. Specialists have calculated that the optimum strength of the regular army is 10,000. Judging by the report, the intentions of the leadership of the Ministry of Defense are serious. But the practical implementation of the plans is being impeded by the absence of a proper legislative base. Let us hope that the new parliament will settle the arrears of its predecessor.
