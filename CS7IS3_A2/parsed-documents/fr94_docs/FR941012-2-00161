FR941012-2-00161 FR941012-2-00108 (d) The international competitive position and export potential of United States products and services. The Executive Order permits the Trade Representative to include, if appropriate, ``a description of the foreign country practices that may in the future warrant identification as priority foreign country practices.'' The Trade Representative may also include ``a statement about other foreign country practices that were not identified because they are already being addressed by provisions of United States trade law, existing bilateral trade agreements, or in trade negotiations with other countries and progress is being made toward their elimination.'' The Global Context Changes in the world economy, reinforced by the end of the Cold War, have opened up new opportunities in the global marketplace. The United States is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. We are unsurpassed in innovation and flexibility. Gains in productivity have fueled our competitiveness. Our higher education is unsurpassed. Our workers are the most skilled and productive in the world. This new world is extremely competitive. In order to remain successful, we must pursue a strategy consisting of two interrelated parts: trade policies that will open markets around the world; and domestic policies that will help American companies and workers to remain the most productive in the world. This two-part strategy reflects the Administration's fundamental goal of higher living standards for all Americans. The single most important component of our trade strategy is the successful implementation of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Uruguay Round agreements amount to a global tax cut of some $744 billion. They will stimulate the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and, when fully implemented, add an estimated $100&hyph;200 billion to the U.S. GDP annually. The Uruguay Round agreements contain improvements in market access worldwide for goods and services, improved rules for trade, a new agreement protecting intellectual property worldwide, and dramatically improved procedures to enforce our rights. The improvements in dispute settlement under the new World Trade Organization (WTO) can provide real assurance to our exports that our gains at the bargaining table will be translated into real market opportunities, and that any impairment of our rights to market access will have an expeditious remedy. But these benefits, scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 1995, will materialize only if Congress has adopted legislation approving and implementing the Uruguay Round agreements. For this reason, the Administration urges expeditious approval of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which the President submitted to Congress on September 27. Enforcement The Administration remains committed to vigorous enforcement of our rights under trade agreements_both our rights at present, and the expanded rights we will have when the Uruguay Round results enter into effect. Section 301 will remain an essential element of our strategy in enforcing our rights in the new WTO system. Under WTO dispute settlement procedures, we will be authorized to retaliate against the trade of any government found to be violating our rights, if that government does not either eliminate the violation or provide compensation acceptable to us. Such realization would be carried out under the authority of section 301 as a matter of U.S. trade law. Section 301 will also remain an important tool in addressing unfair practices not covered under the Uruguay Round agreements. And it will be available to us when we encounter trade-restricting practices by either non-members of the WTO or governments to which we do not apply the Uruguay Round agreements.
