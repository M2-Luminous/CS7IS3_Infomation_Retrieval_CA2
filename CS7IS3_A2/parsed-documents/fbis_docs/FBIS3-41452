Vladislav Kotlov, a senior official at the Atomic Energy Ministry's press service, told Interfax that the statement of Adamovich, who said on Thursday that about a ton of plutonium was buried in a lake in Tomsk Region about 20 years ago, was absurd because a ton of that material costs billions of dollars. Besides, Kotlov said, the Siberian Chemical Plant, situated in Tomsk Region, had been burying all its radioactive waste underground, though in an area with subsoil waters. This was confirmed by the Atomic Energy Ministry's press service, which said the buried waste had a total radioactivity of one billion curies. Kotlov said laws were due to come out shortly banning the burial of radioactive waste underground in areas with subsoil waters. ``There are no guarantees that there will be no earthquakes in areas where burial sites are located, which may lead to the spread of radioactive substances,'' he said. There are also underground burial sites near Krasnoyarsk (Siberia) and Dimitrovgrad (Ulyanovsk Region), Kotlov said. Sources in the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Gosatomnadzor (the State Nuclear Inspectorate) and the Tomsk Regional Environmental Committee told Interfax those bodies had no data to confirm the information of Adamovich, who said he had documents to prove his statement.
