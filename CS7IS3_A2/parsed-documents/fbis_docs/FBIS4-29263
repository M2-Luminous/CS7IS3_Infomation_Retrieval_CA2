Chin Kwang-ho, born to an ethnic Korean family repatriated to the North from Japan, was working as a driver at a supply base in a North Korean military academy when he defected in early February, according to the NSP. Grievances over the severe discrimination against Koreans repatriated to the North from Japan drove Chin to flee, the agency said. The South Korean Government decided to accept him from a humanitarian point of view. Chin has a mother and an elder sister still living in North Korea, the NSP said.
