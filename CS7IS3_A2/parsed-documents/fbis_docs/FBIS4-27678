A Korean fisheries administration official said on Friday the decision was made at a Korea-New Zealand fishery meeting held in Wellington on May 30-31. New Zealand agreed at the meeting to reflect lowered fishery fees for South Korean fishing boats operating in the New Zealand waters in the New Zealand fishery law now being revised. The oceanic country also promised to cooperate positively in the effort of Korea to join the southern tuna protection convention and thereby obtain a tuna fishing quota. Moreover, the two countries agreed to step up their cooperation through various international working-level fishery conferences, the official said. The Wellington meeting was attended by a seven-member Korean delegation headed by Pak Ki-chol, a fishery promotion official of the fisheries administration.
