The Republic of China [ROC] and the United States should be able to hold bilateral talks on our entry into the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade [GATT] by the end of this month. Both Chiang Ping-kun and Hsu Ke-sheng, vice minister of Economic Affairs, said that they would inform the United States of our tariff reduction plan as soon as possible. The Board of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs will fax this plan to the Economic Division of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs today, to inform the United States of our tariff reduction plan and ask it to hold bilateral talks on our country's accession to GATT at the end of this month. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative will send officials to Taiwan at the end of this month to hold talks on protecting intellectual property rights and rhinoceros horns. Therefore, it is possible for the ROC and United States to hold bilateral talks in Taipei on the ROC's accession to the GATT at the end of this month.
