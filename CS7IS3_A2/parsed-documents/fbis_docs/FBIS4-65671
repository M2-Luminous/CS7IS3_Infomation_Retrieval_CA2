Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) confirmed this during the debate on European policies at the Federal Assembly. Among other things, he cited "modernization to ensure the transition to the age of information" to create future jobs as one of the major tasks. Moreover, the prosperity gap vis-a-vis Central and East Europe must be removed, and the eastern neighboring countries must be moved closer to the western stability zone and to the EU in the long run. As the state located at the center of Europe, Germany feels particularly great responsibility. Kinkel also stressed that practical progress must be achieved soon concerning police cooperation and a common asylum and immigration policy. The reason for the debate of the Federal Assembly was the upcoming German EU presidency. Representatives of the laender unanimously called for more democracy and closeness to the citizens in the European Union. Saarland Minister-President Oskar Lafontaine (Social Democratic Party of Germany) stated that the course for the reform of the EU, scheduled for 1996, must be set during the German presidency in the second half of 1994. Europe must not become a super state. Saxony Minister-President Biedenkopf (Christian Democratic Union) demanded that clear information should soon be provided as to how the Central and East European states are to be incorporated in the EU. Biedenkopf confirmed the call for more rights for the European Parliament.
