That after having completed initial investigations and judicial proceedings, it is evident that certain residents of San Cristobal Verapaz acted criminally and very seriously injured U.S. citizen (June Diane Weinstock), who was in that region as a tourist. They also seriously injured the judge, officials, administrative justice of the peace personnel, and members of the national media, the Red Cross, the Firefighters Corps, and public force personnel stationed in that region. In addition, judicial files were damaged. This has undoubtedly undermined the interests and human rights of hundreds of people who have been or are being prosecuted in that jurisdiction. 2. The Guatemalan Government, based on the spontaneous testimony of countless residents of that place, recognizes the innocence and honorability of the U.S. citizen, who was brutally attacked, and assumes responsiblity for the medical attention that her situation may require. The same treatment will be granted to fellow citizens whose condition warrants it. The government vigorously condemns this violent act. 3. The action of these groups is reflected in the dissemination of unfounded rumors and appearance of graffiti [legendas] in the country's towns and highways that link innocent U.S. citizens to the stealing of and trafficking in minors. The apparent goal of this is to create an atmosphere of insecurity and instability in the country. 4. This provocation seeks to jeopardize Guatemala's relations with friendly nations. 5. The government appeals to the public, urging people not to be deceived by the propagation of groundless rumors and the manipulation of inexact and biased information aimed at creating an atmosphere of social unrest. It states that it will not tolerate individual or group actions perpetrated with the intention of taking the law into their own hands. It pledges to strictly enforce existing laws against those who commit these crimes.
