The real economic scale of the "great China sphere," encompassing Hong Kong and Taiwan, will probably exceed that of Japan and even the United States in the 21st century. Economically depressed advanced countries are queuing up to converge on China with its huge potential market of 1.2 billion persons. Japanese enterprises might miss the opportunity for growth if they are late in starting. China is swaying the world. Restraining Measures Ineffective--Even Universities Enter Joint Ventures To prevent economic overheating, the Chinese Government set forth in May 1993 a policy to not only control establishment of development zones in regions but to strictly examine the soundness of project plans and fund procurement of development zones below the county level and, in some cases, to abolish them. However, it appears that local entities are ignoring the government policy. Presently, Songjiang County, adjoining Shanghai, is becoming the focal point of foreign capital attracted to China. Land prices (usage rights) in Shanghai City have risen considerably, but are still cheap. Moreover, the expressway linking Shanghai and Hangzhou City, which is under construction by the nation, will pass through this county. Tahui "xiang" (equivalent to a town), located about 10 km west of the center with the county offices, is a typical farming village with vast paddy fields seen in the outskirts of Shanghai. At present, this town is trying desperately to sell its development zone. The area of the development zone is 2,700 mu (1 mu is 666 square meters), or approximately 15 percent of the town's agricultural land. A 20-meter road was built in the middle of the paddy fields and land on both sides is being sold. "Local Countermeasures to Central Government Policies"--Expediency Measures Increase as Restraints Are Tightened The population of this town is 17,000. Since it is close to Shanghai, there are many branch factories of state-owned enterprises and 63 of them are in this town. It is a "semi-agricultural, semi-manufacturing" town with factories now contributing more than 50 percent of the town's total output of 400 million yuan (approximately 7.4 billion yen). To further increase cash revenue, the buildup of the development zone is being promoted. As its name implies, this town has old pagodas built during the Tang dynasty and a Taiwanese enterprise is now engaged in a development project with total investment of 40 million yuan (approximately 740 million yen) to build a comprehensive resort area with golf courses and hotels. Chen Jinrong, secretary of the CPC Tahui Town Committee, says, "Even if the present development zone is completely sold out, there are other sites we can offer. We would greatly welcome the entry of Japanese enterprises." Xinping Town, located about an hour's ride west of Tahui, has converted 10,000 mu of agricultural land into a development zone and started a full-scale program to attract foreign capital. With a population of 33,000 persons and an area of 45,000 mu, this town is the largest in Songjiang County but relatively few factories have entered because of difficult accessibility. Even today, it takes over two hours from Shanghai but, as early as next spring, the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway might open and an interchange will be built nearby, so, using the claim, "only 35 minutes to Shanghai" (Wang Yougen, town mayor), as the selling point, efforts to attract foreign capital were started in earnest. The mayor says, "If the contract is concluded this year, we will sell you 1 square meter for $30.00." Of course, Songjiang County, which administers these towns, is operating its own development zone. In July 1992, agricultural land was converted and an "Eastern Economic Development Zone" was newly established. The size is 30,000 mu, equivalent to about 30 percent of the county area, and 160 million yuan (approximately 2.9 billion yen) were spent on infrastructure buildup, including roads, electricity, water supply, etc. So far, the entry of 40 companies from 11 countries is certain. Among them are eight Japanese companies, including Yakult and Toyo Denso Co. (Minato-ku, Tokyo), an automobile parts manufacturer affiliated with Honda Motor Co. Wang Min, deputy director of CPC Songjiang County Propaganda Department, nonchalantly makes a comment that would surprise Pudong officials: "If you are planning to enter national-level development zones, such as Shanghai's Pudong area, you have to go to Beijing to obtain permits each time and the procedure is cumbersome. You can enter easily here and the prices are less than half of other places. We are very anxious for Japanese enterprises to come." Actually, land prices (50-year usage rights) are $40-$50 per square meter, including infrastructure expenses, so the level is less than half of that in Shanghai's Pudong area or Shenzhen City. Taking the case of Songjiang County alone, most of the county's 19 towns and villages have established development zones and are competing for foreign capital. Furthermore, the inducement methods might be called versatile. Recently, an increasing number of Japanese firms have been contemplating entries into local development zones, seeking low-priced lands, but the Chinese business methods are complicating their decisions. A certain town is encouraging investments through a type of expediency measure, i.e., "to make it a joint venture in form only; in reality, independent financing (full capital subscription) is acceptable." As compared with independent financing, a joint venture has many advantages, such as lenient export requirements, payment of subscription in installments, etc. On the other hand, through independent financing, foreign capital enterprises can freely conduct business operations as they wish. In other words, the towns are encouraging the clever method of having the towns formally register the incoming foreign capital as a joint venture and do all the required paperwork until the factory opens, but, in reality, permit free operation through independent financing. Also, leaders of other towns say, "There is government guidance, but we can make arrangements for prices and methods of establishing companies without regard to it." If factories are built, cash revenue can be readily earned as compared with farming, which is burdened with extremely low purchase prices for crops. Once the benefits of factory management are enjoyed, it becomes difficult to backtrack. As revealed in the statement, "there are local countermeasures against central government policies," local actions are difficult to restrain. As control measures become tighter, expedient methods, which have a stronger element of "human politics" than legal rule, become more active. This technique is very difficult for Japanese firms to understand. Onoda Cement Co. established the Dalian Huaneng-Onoda Cement Co., Ltd., in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, as a joint venture with a local enterprise. Dalian Onoda started full-scale production of cement in July 1992, but the company has been concerned recently about pressure being applied to maintain product prices at a certain level though there is no such legal provision. Production capacity of the company's plant is China's largest at 1.37 million tons per year. Investments totaling 26 billion yen are among the largest of Japanese firms. At present, approximately 60 percent of the output is exported to the United States. The export ratio set when the contract was drawn was 70 percent but, because "demand for high-quality cement became urgent with the construction boom in China and domestic shipments were increased sharply" (So Kojima, general manger), the level below the quota is being permitted. That is not a problem, but Dalian Onoda's headache is the administrative guidance for minimum export prices from Dalian City. There are other state-operated cement manufacturers in Dalian City. If Onoda exports too cheaply, the sales of state enterprises might decline, so the minimum price instruction was issued that "shipments below this price are not permitted." For the present, sales are somehow being made, but competitive power will be lost eventually if prices remain high. There is also fear that the minimum price might be raised in the future. There is no legal basis, but if not obeyed, export permits will be suspended, so the company must comply. Increase in materiel costs, without consultation, is another source of concern. There was an occasion when the fees for electricity provided by the city were raised sharply by over 20 percent, without advance notice, and calculation of manufacturing costs was thrown off badly. There was an upsetting experience, too, when the water supply was cut off abruptly. "Inability To Estimate" Plant Construction Costs--Japaneses-Style Feasibility Studies Are Useless Also, even with plant constructions, there were problems that could not be imagined in Japan. Construction costs could not be estimated accurately and were inflated substantially. In China, there are no business practices like the full turnkey contract, whereby a plant is constructed at a set cost and turned over to the owner. For this reason, construction had to be started without detailed plans. Through discussions with individual state and private sector officials, after construction was started, construction costs finally become known. In Onoda's case, investments exceeded the budgeted amount by over 20 percent. Honda Motor Co., too, was troubled by the "inability to estimate." In July 1993, as a joint venture with the state-owned munitions manufacturer, China Jialing Industrial Co., Ltd., Honda established the Jialing-Honda Motor Co., a two-wheeled vehicle manufacturing firm, in Chongqing City, Sichuan Province. In Chongqing Economic and Technological Development Zone, located in Nanping on the south bank of the Yangzi River, construction began this June on a plant with production capacity of 300,000 vehicles a year. The first problem that arose was the financing of the costs to prepare the site. There were a hill, 10 meters high, and four lakes at the site. According to the land-use contract, preparatory costs were to be borne by the city's development zone, but costs doubled because work did not proceed smoothly and the development zone ran out of money. Since there was no way out, Jialing-Honda had to cover the deficiency. Even with the electric supply contract with the power generation bureau, the contracted rate had been 460 yuan per kilovolt-ampere (kv-amp) but the rate actually jumped to 760 yuan. In the case of Jialing-Honda, usage is to 10,000 kv-amp so the increase meant an additional charge of approximately 55 million yen. Yuji Yamahata, director and manufacturing division chief, says resignedly: "It seems the rate was raised because they had to install a new large-capacity transformer. We are building the plant with the spirit of cooperation to build the infrastructure of the development zone." Marubeni Corp.'s Beijing branch is worried about the unexpected jump in rental rates of foreigner-use apartments which are occupied by its resident employees. Rates increased by about 35 percent over last year to $35-40 per square meter a month. Since an apartment is about 100 square meters because of larger floor space for foreigners, the monthly rent is approximately $4,000. Converted to Japanese yen, that exceeds 400,000 yen. Until early 1992, there was a renter's market for foreigner-use apartments and rents were declining. Subsequently, however, as the number of resident employees increased with the steady advance of foreign capital, demand exceeded supply and rates began to rise. When unforeseen events occur, the Japanese-style feasibility study (FS/corporate research) is not useful. Akira Sera, senior director of Nisshin Oil Mills, which started to operate a joint-venture oil plant in September 1990 in Dalian, states that "a thorough FS was conducted over five years but it was not very useful." During the FS stage, edible oil was rationed and supply continued to be limited in China but, after the plant started to operate, large quantities of imports from other countries, including the United States, began to flow in with liberalization of sales, and selling prices fell. Moreover, raw material prices soared because of inflation and profits could not be earned for a while. Situations might also arise where counterparts, which cannot be imagined in Japan, become candidates in a joint venture. Located along the middle reaches of the Yangzi River is the city of Wuhan of Hubei Province. Japanese firms investing in the joint Japan-China software development company, Wuhan Anluo Computer Systems, Ltd., which has its main offices in this city, are software development subsidiaries, Yaskawa Information Systems (Kita-Kyushu City) and Y.E. Data, of Yaskawa Electric Manufacturing Co. The Chinese subscriber is Wuhan Dongluo New Technology Research Institute but it is the Wuhan University which is providing the capital in full. It is under the direct jurisdiction of the State Education Commission of the State Council and an important university in which only the top performers in entrance exams can enter. It is inconceivable for a national university in Japan to establish enterprises but it is a government policy in China. Various departments in Wuhan University have started businesses and at present, the number has reached over 20 companies. Of them, five are joint ventures with foreign firms. Zhang Yumin, general manager of Wuhan Anluo, also serves as an assistant professor in Wuhan University's computer science program (equivalent to a department). It would the same as if, in Japan, an assistant professor of a famous national university, supposedly far removed from businesses, were to take on the dual role of running a foreign capital-affiliated enterprise. Business profits are used to supplement shortages of academic departments and are also distributed among professors. At the most, there is nearly a threefold differfential in pay among departments. The biggest earner is the university's economic institute. Trainees are accepted from state and city governments as well as stock brockerages and insurance companies and lectures are given on market economy. In other words, a "Chinese-style business school" is being operated. In addition to running the joint venture, the computer science department, too, is teaching computer technologies to approximately 100 trainees from outside the school. The professors' salaries rank fifth among the university's 33 departments. The method of raising capital is also unique. Of the capital subscription of $100,000, Wuhan University invested $45,000. For this investment, funds were allocated to build a departmental research institute. Shi Quangchao, assistant general manager and Wuhan University lecturer, explains the reason for the budget transfer as follows: "The technological level can be elevated faster by receiving the newest technology from foreign companies in a joint venture than by building a research institute and exchanging technologies with foreign universities. Moreover, profits can be expected." In Chinese corporations which are growing rapidly, there are many customs and systems that are beyond the comprehension and commonsense of Japanese corporations. Business operations are carried out without strict adherence to laws and regulations and in such cases, personal contacts play an important part. These Chinese business practices appear to present big risks to Japanese companies. If one has to say, "we cannot know the costs until we try," he probably cannot even bring the subject up at a board meeting in Japan. Inadequate Land-Air Routes and Communications Facilities--Infrastructure Problem Poses an Obstacle The infrastructure problem is another big risk concern of Japanese corporations. Yukio Seki, chief researcher and head of Asia Research Office, Economic Research Division, Nomura Research Institute, points out: "Production in mining and manufacturing industries is increasing at a double-digit annual rate but the railroad transportation capacity is growing at only about 3 percent. At this rate, economic growth will be constrained." The fact is that "railway freight transport in 1992 was able to meet only about 60 percent of demand" (Tadao Nishi, head of Research and Publications Division, Association for the Promotion of International Trade, Japan). When employees of Yamaha Motor Co.'s joint company in Chongqing leave by plane on domestic business trips, they depart without setting an anticipated return date. Fumiaki Kamiya, administrative department chief of the joint company, states matter-of-factly: "Passenger aircraft are always filled and only tickets for outgoing trips can be obtained in Chongqing. Employees must remain at their destinations until they can make reservations for the return trips, so I send them out thinking they should return in 10 days." Road conditions are not good, either. The main highways leading out from big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, are heavily congested all the time. Trucks and busses fill the roads and there is constant honking of horns. It seems as though there are no traffic regulations. There is a steady stream of cars rushing by at high speeds. Pedestrians and bicyles weave through them. In fact, when a trip was made to a plant in the suburbs about 30 km from Chongqing, an allowance of two to three hours had to be made one way. En route, a truck that had broken down was abandoned in the middle of the road. There was an occasion when we were stalled for nearly two hours in a traffic jam. Car performances are still unpredictable and vehicles that overheat or that do not restart worsen the congestion. For a simple business transaction in the suburbs, one or two days are wasted in getting around. Communications facilities are poor, too. Even in big cities, during the company's business hours, telephone calls jam the few circuits and long-distance calls are difficult to make. Construction of relay facilities is moving slowly and portable telephones are often not serviceable. In Wuhan, power outages occur almost daily in the summer when air conditioners are turned on all at once during the day and in the evenings when meal preparations begin. NEC Corp.'s joint company, Wuhan-NEC Optical Communications Co., Ltd. (Wuhan City), will prepare for outages by installing its own generator in the optical communications equipment plant being built with a March 1994 completion target date. Deficiencies are also noticeable in the legal system. Kenji Hattori, chief of Information and Research Section, Japan-China Association on Economy and Trade, states: "There are criminal laws and criminal litigation laws but there are no systematic codes of civil and commerlcial laws which serve as the legal basis for corporate activities. The legal system is a big problem, too." The Japan-China Investment Promotion Agency, which has expertise in handling problems related to investments in China, recommends that time be spent on negotiations before concluding contracts, draw up detailed contract agreements and do not carry over matters to post-contract negotiations. After contracts are concluded, it is also necessary to check whether all of the contractual items are being carried out faithfully. Only Risks Stand Out, But There Is No Other Growth Market Like China Masanada Hirano, assistant secretariat chief of the above agency, advises that: "To conduct business smoothly in China, it is important to wine and dine persons in key positions. Japanese companies should understand this and should not be stingy with social expenses." In China, where prices are cheap as compared with Japan, the social expenses of a certain Japanese general manager soared to 3 million yen in one year. However, if attention is paid only to risks, another aspect of China will be overlooked. Izumi Hara, chief of the Project Development Section, China Committee, Industrial Bank of Japan, makes this statement: "The aim of the recent economic tightening is to stop inflationary practices such as land speculation. In essence, the entire economy will not be stalled because of this move. There is no other developing country with as abundant manpower as China and also, there is no other economy with so much waste. If the manpower is used and waste is eliminated, there is limitless room for growth." The economic environment differs greatly from the time of the Tiananmen incident in 1989. Consumer goods are plentiful and there is no panic-buying of goods as happened then, while the harvest last year was rich enough to record record crop production. The move to restrain overheating, led by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, Deng Xiaoping's protege, is achieving results: "Before August, one-third of the loans by financial institutions to companies had been recovered" (a senior official of the State Council). At the least, money is no longer available for speculative real estate investments. It is true that there is great risk in the Chinese market. Political aberrations occur constantly. There is the observation that "China is like the battleship Yamato. Unlike maneuverable Japan, China is not easily stirred into action but, once it begins to move, it is difficult to stop, so extreme measures must be taken" (Ryoichi Kawai, chairman of Komatsu, Ltd.). However, for Japanese companies troubled with recession, entry into China, a huge market nearby, has become an important operational issue. Nevertheless, as compared with European and U.S. firms, the hesitancy of Japanese companies is noticeable.
