This Is Only the Beginning...."] [Text] In a democratic system you get surprises. One such surprise was the appearance of the State Duma's decision about the amnesty. Stories as to how this came about have been weighed up but it is impossible to weigh up everything, especially as this did lie in the power of those participating in the analysis. This is how the president's representative in the Federal Assembly A.M. Yakovlev evasively explained the release of the October mutiny's instigators and the pardoning of the members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in accordance with the State Duma amnesty. He, together with his colleagues from the Russian Federation president's entourage Yu. Baturin and G. Satarov, held a briefing 28 February at the Kremlin, which was almost entirely devoted to an analysis of the situation which has developed over the State Duma's decree on the amnesty. A.M. Yakovlev drew journalists' attention to the legislation's flaws which, according to him, were the reason for the presidential team's insufficiently clear and coordinated actions in response to the State Duma's decree on the amnesty. Apart from this, information was received claiming that work was in progress in the State Duma's apparatus with a view to amending the decree's text, and this factor was not taken into consideration. Moreover, a letter from General Prosecutor A. Kazannik was sent to the State Duma. It contained six basic points which essentially were aimed at removing the bias of the decree on the amnesty. Here, G. Satarov expressed himself more categorically: According to him it is actually the inconsistency in the stance of the Prosecutor's Office which has been a key element in this whole story. The general prosecutor sends a letter to the State Duma saying that its decree on the amnesty violates Russian legislation, and then, with unprecedented speed for this department, adopts a decision about releasing this group of well-known people from custody. G. Satarov was asked a question about the accuracy of reports that M. Gorbachev entertains the possibility that the document was submitted for President B. Yeltsin's preliminary approval. G. Satarov replied: "This issue could not have been submitted for the president's approval, which I. Rybkin confirmed in conversation with me 26 February." Nevertheless, the briefing's participants assured us that they had expected such a turn of events, though they did not produce any arguments backing up what they said. According to Satarov, the president has planned corresponding actions concerning the defense of human rights which will be announced in the near future. The journalists regarded the report that Federal Counterintelligence Service Director N. Golushko had been dismissed from his post (the president signed the relevant edict 28 February) as a sensation.
