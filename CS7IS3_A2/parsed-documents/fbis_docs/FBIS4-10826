Today, we are having celebrations in "Mariana Grajales" Revolutionary Plaza, in front of the monument to this mother of the fatherland -- this exemplary woman who wrote a unique epic for her people with her life and the lives of her children, whom she fed with the milk of heroism. What better place is there than this one, where Mariana calls on us to kneel and swear to defend the freedom of the fatherland or to die for it, and where she orders us to stand up and march to Camp Mambi, like she did with all her children, even the youngest one? And what better territory is there than this one, the heroic east, birthplace of our revolutions, Guantanamo Province, where there is no beach, path, valley, or mountain that does not deserve glorious mention in our country's history? For the glorious deeds of the Mambises people in last century's three wars against the colonial yoke. For the most tenacious and successful struggle by peasants for their land, the 18 possessions of the crown [el realengo 18]. For the solid support that it gave our guerrilla column to found and extend the 2d "Frank Pais" Eastern Front, giving us its best sons, sending us ammunition and all sorts of supplies, surrounding us for nine months with their uncompromising support until the 1 January triumph. For its contribution to the victory at the Bay of Pigs. Perhaps not enough has been divulged about the fact that the mercenaries sent to land on the coast of Baracoa were to open a front to divert us from the main thrust of the attack, but they did not dare step on Guantanamo soil, where a decided and alert people in arms were waiting to annihilate them. Faithful to their tradition of rising to the occasion in the face of danger and adversity, the people of Guantanamo, under government and party leadership headed by Comrade Juan Carlos Robinson, faced with courage, energy, and efficiency the devastating effects of the November floods. With the solidarity of the whole country and with state support they made their repairs in silence. Here, nature's catastrophe has served as an encouragement to work, and it has not been used as an excuse to not fulfill production plans or defense tasks. We are also gathered to promote to higher ranks 33 militiamen and reservists deployed in this province, who symbolize the 33 years that separate us from the heroic Bay of Pigs and represent all of those throughout the country who today receive this well-deserved encouragement. We are also gathered to hand over a replica of Maximo Gomez's glorious machete -- as in previous years -- to a group of writers, journalists, artists, and cultural institutions on behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in recognition of their outstanding contribution to strengthening the country's combat capabilities and our people's patriotic and internationalist awareness. It is of great satisfaction to decorate, in keeping with the Council of State decree, the heroic fighters and civilian workers of the border brigade, who in keeping with their duty, have many times risked their lives or have been mutilated in the minefields that surround the territory illegally occupied by the United States. To those who have fallen while fulfilling this risky mission, to First Lieutenant Arturo Ruiz Martinez, and to soldiers Raul Milanes Labrada, Roberto Navarro Hernandez, and Wilbert Vazquez Gamboa, I posthumously confer today the "Antonio Maceo" order. They have offered up their budding lives, these brave youths, worthy followers of soldiers Ramon Lopez Pena and Luis Ramirez Lopez, who in past decades lost their lives because of treacherous bullets fired from the other side of the fence. The sacrifice of those who have been wounded or mutilated forever, the hard test of thousands of fighters and officers, who throughout the 30 years since the border unit was created have repeatedly guarded the fatherland, risking dangers and suffering the tensions of the border along the front -- all of this is part of the high price we are forced to pay because of the existence of this foreign military base on a part of our soil. We have said and reiterated, from the very triumph of the revolution, that this base was imposed on the Cuban people by force, and we demand that it be dismantled and returned to Cuba. Its presence, in disregard of our people's manifest rights and their legitimate government, violates all norms of international law. It is a brutal act of arrogance by the empire. Today this base, which is obsolete from a military viewpoint, constitutes an unnecessary expense that must be borne by the U.S. taxpayer. To reduce its uncontrollable military budget, the United States has dismantled dozens of military installations in the United States and abroad. Nevertheless, it maintains this one as a source of constant provocation and humiliation against Cuba. We will never renounce our sovereign right to this part of our island -- this part of our national territory. We reiterate today what we expressed nearly a year ago in this same plaza: There is not one day in which we are not reminded that we have a dagger stuck in our country's side, just a few kilometers south of where we are now standing. We have never stopped believing that some day we may be able to remove this dagger in a peaceful and civilized manner in accordance with the principles of international law. As everyone knows, our state's social system, as well as our military doctrine, dictates that we shall never become an aggressor that fires the first shot. Everything we do to strengthen our defense is precisely aimed at making any aggression against our country a costly enterprise. Our defensive efforts constitute a deterrent that will make any war prohibitively costly and unwinnable and, at the same time, guarantee our people's peaceful and creative endeavors. As long as we fail to achieve this legitimate and unyielding aspiration of recovering the territory now occupied by this base, our position is to avert incidents along the demarcation line between this area and the rest of the island. As we stated several weeks ago, during the past year a climate of tranquillity has prevailed on both sides of the fence, and we are inclined to keep doing all that is necessary to maintain this atmosphere. This is why we have taken and will continue to take all necessary measures to prevent any foolish attempts by those who want to leave the country by way of this route. To try to cross through those densely mined fields on both sides of the fence, attempting to evade our checkpoints and patrols, is madness and, at the same time, an act of provocation against our country's security. Two armies are deployed face to face on either side of the fence. Given the United State's permanent hostility toward our country and its illegal occupation of this part of Cuba, these two armies are not exactly friendly armies.
