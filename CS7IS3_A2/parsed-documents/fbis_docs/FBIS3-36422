In his interview with SELSKAYA ZHIZN he refuted allegations that the joining of the rouble zone by Belarus is undermining its sovereignty, or that this decision means a kind of charity on the part of Russia. "In this case those European politicians who are working for the introduction of a common instrument of payment for europe are bad patriots either," Kebich stressed. In his opinion, the root cause of Gaydar's resignation is much deeper than the problem of signing an agreement on the unification of monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. "In general terms, it could be described as the difference in views between the prime minister and the deputy prime minister over the way the reform should be developed," he said. The rouble zone will not mean a political and economic alliance, it will be nothing but a common financial and monetary system. According to Kebich, "in conditions of a common monetary system, Belarus will have a chance to follow its own path. The same is true of Russia. We have complete understanding on that matter with Russian leaders."
