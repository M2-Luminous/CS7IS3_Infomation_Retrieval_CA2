FR941212-1-00062 FR941212-1-00016 In addition to geographic separation, the pygmy-owl's eastern and western populations occupy different habitats. Although some broad similarities in habitat physiognomy are apparent (e.g., dense woodlands and thickets), floristically these eastern and western habitats are very dissimilar. The desertscrub and thornscrub associations in Arizona and western Mexico are unlikely any habitats occupied by the pygmy-owl in eastern Mexico and southern Texas. Also, the oak association habitat occupied on coastal plains in southern Texas is unlike any habitat available in the western portion of the pygmy-owl's range. However, the Tamaulipan thornscrub habitat of the east and the riverbottom mesquite-cottonwood bosque habitat once found in Arizona are more similar in physiognomy and to a slight degree in floristic makeup. The potential for genetic distinctness further supports identifying eastern and western pygmy-owl populations. The fact that the pygmy-owl is nonmigratory throughout its range suggests that genetic mixing across wide areas may be infrequent. Considerable variation in plumage between regional populations has been noted, including specific distinctions between Arizona and Texas pygmy-owls (van Rossem 1937, Burton 1973, Tyler and Phillips 1978, Johnsgard 1988). The above information indicates that eastern and western populations of the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl are distinct, based on geographic isolation, potential morphological and genetic distinctness, and distribution and status of habitat. These eastern and western populations of the pygmy-owl may be considered separately for listing under the Act, as ``*␣*␣* any subspecies *␣*␣* and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate which interbreeds when mature'' [Section 3(16)]. Further, the status of the species in Mexico is currently unclear (see discussion under ``Factor A'', below). The above criteria lead the Service to consider four separate populations of G. b. cactorum for listing purposes: western U.S. (Arizona), eastern U.S. (Texas), western Mexico, and eastern Mexico. Because the levels of threat, habitats occupied, quality of information, and overall status differ among these four populations, the Service herein proposes separate actions for various population segments. The Service included the pygmy-owl on its Animal Notice of Review as a category 2 candidate species throughout its range on January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554). After soliciting and reviewing additional information, the Service elevated G. b. cactorum to category 1 candidate status throughout its range on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). A category 1 species is one for which the Service has on file substantial information to support listing, but a proposal to list has not been issued because it is precluded at present by other listing activity. Based on an extensive review of information on the species, it is now appropriate to list the U.S. populations, while continuing to review the species in Mexico to determine whether Mexican populations should be proposed for listing. Recent information from Mexico indicates that the species may be more abundant, at least in the southern portion of its range, than originally thought. On May 26, 1992, a coalition of conservation organizations (Galvin et al. 1992) petitioned the Service, requesting listing of the pygmy-owl as an endangered species under the Act. The petitioners also requested designation of critical habitat. In accordance with Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, on March 9, 1993, the Service published a finding that the petition presented substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that listing may be warranted, and commenced a status review on the pygmy-owl (58 FR 13045). In conducting its status review, the Service solicited additional comments and biological data on the status of the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl, through mailings, a notice in the Federal Register (58 FR 13045), and other means. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to reach a final decision on any petition accepted for review within 12 months of its receipt (16 U.S.C. §1531 et seq. ). That decision, to be published in the Federal Register , must be one of the following findings: (1) The petitioned action is not warranted; (2) the petitioned action is warranted (a proposed regulation is published); or (3) the petitioned action is warranted, but the immediate proposal is precluded by listing actions of higher priority. This proposal constitutes a 1-year finding with respect to the petition that listing as endangered is warranted for the Arizona population, listing as threatened is warranted for the Texas population, and listing is not now warranted for the two populations in Mexico. Since designating the pygmy-owl as a category 1 species, in the course of its continuing status review, the Service has acquired significant new information on the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl. This finding is based on various documents, including published and unpublished studies, agency documents, and field survey records. All documents on which this finding is based are on file in the Fish and Wildlife Service Ecological Service State Office in Phoenix, Arizona.
