In that way Italian Popular Party Secretary [PPI] Mino Martinazzoli replied to questions about how he viewed the outcome of the upcoming elections. "I feel irritated because attempts are being made to convince the Italians that there are only two competitors. However, the discussions going on within both alignments exactly serve to outline the reasons of our existence. The Italians are not as careless as one thinks, and they are not stupid either." The PPI secretary also talked about the document signed by the centrist leaders protesting against the treatment that TV programs have reserved for their position: "I signed it with unruffled indignation. If they showed the Italians what is happening behind the doors, they would understand the deception that ongoing. If someone put stockings in front of a TV camera as a filter, it means that he is ready for a performance, and not for a dialogue with the people."
