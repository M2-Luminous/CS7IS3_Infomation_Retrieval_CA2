FBIS4-34844 "drlat122_m_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-122 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Brazil Common Mercosur Tariff for Informatics Suggested Common Mercosur Tariff for Informatics Suggested PY2306143894 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1852 GMT 22 Jun 94 PY2306143894 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Brasilia, 22 Jun (EFE) -- The Brazilian Government has proposed to the four member countries of the Common Market of the South, Mercosur, -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- a common external tariff below 20 percent for informatics and telecommunications products as of 2001. Brazilian Ambassador Jose Arturo De Medeiros on 22 June told EFE that Brazil, which wants to protect its informatics industry, is willing to reduce its import tariffs, which currently are at 35 percent, to below 20 percent by 2001. De Medeiros, a professional diplomat, is a member of the Brazilian delegation negotiating with the other Mercosur member countries on the common external tariffs Mercosur will impose on imports as of 1 January 1995, when Mercosur becomes a free trade zone. The technical negotiations over a common external tariff, which should be ready by 15 July when the presidents of the Mercosur member countries meet in Buenos Aires, have agreed on almost 85 percent of products. The negotiations have, nonetheless, been paralyzed over vital subjects like petrochemical and especially informatics and telecommunications products. With the new proposal presented 17 June during a technical meeting in Buenos Aires, Brazil expects the negotiations to make considerable progress and finish in three weeks. According to the Brazilian proposal that apparently was viewed with interest by the other member countries' representatives, Brazil will reduce its import tariffs on informatics and telecommunications equipment until reaching a rate below 20 percent in 2001, which is the maximum allowed by Mercosur. According to the same proposal, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- which import informatics and telecommunications equipment with minimum import tariffs (Argentina imports these products with a zero tariff) -- will increase their tariffs until meeting the same level of Brazilian tariffs in 2001. The Brazilian proposal, if accepted by its partners, will allow the negotiations over the common external tariff to conclude on time, but making an exception for capital, informatics, and telecommunications products. Free trade and a common external tariff for 90 percent of products will be established among the four member countries as of 1995 and until 2001, the year when the exceptions will end and the common external tariff will be the same for all products for the four member countries. Brazilian insistence on protecting its informatics industry had forced the Mercosur negotiators to declare that the tariffs among the four member countries would be the same only by 2006 and that it would be very difficult to reach an agreement in the informatics and telecommunications field. According to the newspaper GAZETA MERCANTIL, the new Brazilian proposal was possible thanks to a concession granted by the national industry after a government request. Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay must give an answer to the Brazilian proposal next week when the technical negotiators meet in Montevideo.
