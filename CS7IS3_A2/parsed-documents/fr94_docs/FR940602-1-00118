FR940602-1-00118 FR940602-1-00014 (D) A schedule of required activities prior to permit issuance, including when the permitting authority is expecting to give its approval of the plan, and the time periods during which the trial burn would be conducted. (4) When a trial burn plan is approved, the Director will specify a time period prior to permit issuance during which the trial burn must be conducted. (5) The applicant shall perform a trial burn in accordance with the approved trial burn plan, and must make the required determinations, submissions, and certifications in accordance with §§270.62(b)(6) through (b)(9) for incinerators, or §§270.66(d)(3) through (d)(5), and 270.66(f) for boilers and industrial furnaces. Trial burn results must be submitted prior to issuance of a draft permit. (6) Upon completion of the trial burn, combustion units must comply with the performance standards of §264.343 of this chapter (for incinerators), or §§266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter (for BIFs), along with all other applicable interim status standards. Compliance shall be demonstrated and determined based on the results of the trial burn, as follows. The owner or operator may only operate the combustion unit under conditions that passed and were demonstrated to meet the performance standards, and only if the successful trial burn data is sufficient to set all applicable operating conditions during the post-trial burn period. If any results of a trial burn for a combustion unit show non-compliance with any set of performance standards, the owner or operator must immediately cease operating under the condition(s) that resulted in non-compliance, and notify the Director. In order to continue operating when results of the trial burn show non-compliance with any performance standards under any set of conditions, the owner or operator must submit to the Director, with the trial burn results, a description of the conditions under which it is operating, and a preliminary explanation of how the conditions were determined to be sufficient to ensure that the unit functions within the performance standards. After reviewing the trial burn data and the preliminary demonstration submitted by the owner or operator, the Director may further restrict operating conditions as necessary to assure that the unit is operated within the performance standards. (7) If the trial burn results indicate that any performance standards in §264.343 of this chapter for incinerators, or §§266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter for boilers and industrial furnaces, have not been met, the facility may submit a request to conduct an additional trial burn. (i) The request to conduct an additional trial burn must include: (A) An explanation of the reasons for the previous trial burn failure; and (B) A revised trial burn plan submitted under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section which contains substantive changes to address the reasons for the previous trial burn failure. (ii) The revised trial burn plan must be approved by the Director according to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. The Director may approve the request to conduct an additional trial burn only if the requirements of this section have been satisfactorily met. (iii) The Director must send a notice to all persons on the facility mailing list as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1)(ix) and to the appropriate units of State and local government as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1)(x) announcing that the Director has reviewed the draft revised trial burn plan and has tentatively decided to approve it. (iv) This notice must be given within a reasonable time period, and in accordance with §270.74(c)(3)(A) through (D). (8) If the trial burn results indicate that compliance with the performance standards in §264.343 of this chapter for incinerators, or §§266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter for boilers and industrial furnaces, was not achieved, and thus, operating conditions cannot be developed under §264.345 of this chapter for incinerators, or §266.103 of this chapter for boilers and industrial furnaces, the Director may, pursuant to the procedures in Part 124 of this chapter, deny the permit application for the combustion unit.
