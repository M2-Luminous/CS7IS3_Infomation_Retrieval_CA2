The reason is that during the post-war period a lot of time has been spent on setting up law enforcement bodies and strengthening them with professionals, time which has been used by criminal elements. By the end of 1993, a RIA correspondent was told by Konstantin Adleber, chief of staff of the Abkhazian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Headquarters, that the number of particularly serious crimes has been considerably reduced. Those who violate the curfew are now subjected to a fine of 5,000 rubles or detained for 3-15 hours. No military servicemen or other persons carrying weapons are allowed on the streets. The sale of spirits has been banned.
