Fortunately, the local governments rapidly put the grain in stock on the markets, and quickly brought the grain prices under control, and the wave of panic purchases did not spread any further. However, this aroused people's serious attention to the price tendency this year. This year is of crucial importance for the in-depth development of economic structural reform in the mainland, so it is called a "reform year." Taxation, banking, company, investment, foreign exchange, price, housing, and wage reform measures will put into practice. Reform will advance more deeply, more broadly, more intensively and with greater difficulty than in previous years. The unstable factors that existed latently over a long time may become more intense. Therefore, the authorities will strive to keep prices stable and bring inflation under strict control. This will be a major guarantee for reform's success. In fact, the panic grain purchasing appearing late last year was an event beyond the expectation of the authorities. Last year, grain production decreased in Hebei because of the serious drought, and also decreased by nearly 10 percent in Guangdong because the construction of factories and the development of real estate projects used too much farmland. However, grain production in the whole country still increased by over 10 billion kilograms, and there should be no shortage in the markets. According to analysts, the substantial grain price increases and the panic grain purchases in Beijing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and other cities late last year were mainly caused by some psychological factors: First, as the central authorities decided to increase grain prices in 1994, peasants were not willing to sell the grain on hand. Second, the local authorities did not take effective measures for regulating and controlling the supply of grain after grain transactions became free. Third, the masses misunderstood the reform measures put into practice in 1993, especially the reform of the taxation system, and thought that the new taxation system would certainly bring about price increases. So they rushed to buy grain, cooking oil, and other foodstuffs in order to preserve the value of their income. Although the recent grain price hike was mainly caused by psychological and speculative factors, the phenomenon also reflected people's fear of price hikes and inflation, and indicated that society's ability to endure inflation might have been overestimated. Now, the common people have become more sensitive to and more fearful of inflation. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider and decide the timing of adopting the new reform measures and to pay close attention to price tendencies. Otherwise, when the major reform measures are put into practice this year, they may bring some shocks to society and became a factor leading to economic and social instability. In fact, the retail prices in the mainland increased by 13 percent last year, and the costs of living in 35 large and medium- sized cities increased by 20 percent. The rate of inflation has caused a considerable pressure on the livelihood of salary earners. According to the decision of the central authorities, in 1994 the national economy will maintain "sustained, rapid, and healthy" [chi xu kuai su jian kang 6688 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development, and GNP will grow by about 9 percent over 1993. Although this growth rate will be somewhat lower than the 1993 figure of 13 percent, it is expected that economic growth, as well as the size of investment, in the first few months of this year will remain at a high level, and it will be hard to effect the so-called economic "soft landing." In addition, as tariff rates for imported goods will be lowered, more high-priced imported goods will pour into China; the potential credit demand will increase after the exchange rate of renminbi was unified; and the prices of some energy and farm products will be further increased. All this may lead to a sharp increase in the inflation rate. This shows that the task of macro-control that the central government is facing this year will still be rather arduous. If the intensity of economic regulation and control is appropriate and effective in restraining the rise of the general price level, then there will be no major market fluctuations. On the contrary, however, if prices increase too rapidly, it will be hard to prevent a high inflation situation, and a vicious cycle may also come into being. Reportedly to prevent too serious an unfavorable impact on the market and on the people's daily lives, the central authorities have decided to strive to keep this year's price increase index at a level below 10 percent and to adopt such measures as increasing wages and allowances and increasing peasants' income in order to offset this year's grain and other price increases to guarantee that the people will enjoy solid benefits in the course of reform. Not long ago, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji stressed that stabilizing grain prices and restraining inflation will be the key to the smooth advances of reform in 1994. This showed that the Chinese top leaders were soberly aware of the importance of keeping the balance between reform and stability.
