Our correspondent reports sensational, as he put it, details of today's sitting. [Correspondent Aleksandr Ukhov] The lawyers of defendants [Anatoliy] Lukyanov and [Vasiliy] Starodubtsev proposed that criminal proceedings against their clients be dropped in connection with the fact that Lukyanov and Starodubtsev had been elected to Russia's highest legislative body. At the request of defendant Lukyanov, lawyer Padva read out a letter from Boris Yeltsin which the Russian president had sent Lukyanov on 30 December. The letter said, inter alia: [Padva reading letter] I congratulate you on the holiday (and wish) that we establish fruitful and constructive joint work sharing responsibility for the future of Russia and its citizens. I am asking you to submit your proposals regarding forms of interaction between parliamentarians and the president and mechanisms for resolving possible contradictions between us. [passage omitted]
