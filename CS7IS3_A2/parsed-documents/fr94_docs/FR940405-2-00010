FR940405-2-00010 FR940405-2-00007 Cold-Rolled Stainless Steel Sheet From Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Final results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On November 7, 1991, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on cold-rolled stainless steel sheet from the Federal Republic of Germany (56 FR 56976). We have conducted this antidumping duty administrative review pursuant to a remand order from the U.S. Court of International Trade in Krupp Stahl, A.G., et al. v. United States (Slip Op. 91&hyph;31, April 19, 1991). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of subject merchandise, Krupp Stahl, A.G., and the period December 17, 1982 through June 23, 1983. Based on our analysis of the comments received, we have not changed the preliminary results. The final margin is listed below in the section ``Final Results of Review.'' EFFECTIVE DATE: April 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jackie Johnson or Wendy Frankel, Office of Agreements Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;3793 or &hyph;0367. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 7, 1991, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (56 FR 56976) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain cold-rolled stainless steel sheet from Germany (48 FR 28680, June 23, 1983). In the notice of preliminary results of review, we noted that Krupp Stahl, A.G. (Krupp), failed to respond to our questionnaire issued in July 1991. On September 12, 1991, Krupp advised us that in 1989 it had destroyed the records for the December 1982&hyph;June 1983 review period, because German law does not require that business records be retained beyond a minimum period of time. In addition, we noted that after searching our files we were only able to locate the public version of the narrative portion of Krupp's responses to the Department's original and supplemental questionnaires issued in 1983 and 1984. Because that information was insufficient for purposes of conducting an administrative review and because Krupp did not respond to our questionnaire because it had destroyed all supporting documentation, we used the best information available (BIA) for the preliminary results of review.
