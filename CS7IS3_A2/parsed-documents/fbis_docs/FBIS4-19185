He denies that his organization is involved in any way, either directly or indirectly, with the secret terrorist network attributed to the FIS, which was recently broken up in Lille. Moussa Kraouche had been called in for questioning and detained during the round-up of Islamists last November. The police maintained that, in his home, they had found documents originating, in particular, from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). However, as a result of the dubious origin of one of these documents, it was impossible to establish any links between the FAF and the GIA . [Rioufol] Do you know the two suspected FIS sympathizers who were arrested in Lille? [Kraouche] No. However, it is too early to say whether or not they are members of the FIS. I cannot help noticing that, depending on what suits the media, either all Algerians belong to the FIS or the FIS is portrayed as a minority group. There is no evidence to support the allegation that these two persons are even FIS sympathizers. If ever that proved to be the case, then they would have to answer to the legal authorities for their acts. [Rioufol] The FIS is accused of running secret terrorist networks in France. [Kraouche] I officially refute such a claim, which was merely made to frighten public opinion! We condemn any illegal action undertaken on French soil or elsewhere. The line followed by the Algerian Fraternity in France is one that is governed by legality. [Rioufol] That may be, but the Algerian Fraternity in France has very close links with the FIS. [Kraouche] Admittedly, we do sympathize with the aims of the FIS, which is an organization that is not officially recognized in France. [Rioufol] But the FIS has been directly implicated in terrorist attacks committed in Algeria. [Kraouche] You cannot describe them as terrorist actions! Terrorism merely exists when perpetrated against a legitimate state. In Algeria, it is popular resistance which is mounting against an illegitimate, illegal military dictatorship. No terrorist actions are being committed in Algeria. [Rioufol] How can you say that? Only recently, two young girls were killed because they were not wearing the Muslim veil. [Kraouche] Two veiled young girls were also killed. In any event, these acts have nothing to do with the Islamists. People are not killed for not wearing a veil. Furthermore, the Koran preaches: "No religious constraint." We are against the murder of innocent people or foreigners in Algeria. Not everything can be blamed on the FIS! It is provocation! [Rioufol] Are you trying to tell us that these acts are provocations perpetrated by the present government? [Kraouche] Most certainly! The military security forces play a very important role there. They have released 10,000 prisoners convicted under common law so that they can incarcerate Islamists. The people they released are individuals who are prepared to commit criminal acts. The violence in Algeria is not the work of Islamists, but of the junta and those who support it, like Said Sadi. That is a very serious matter. [Rioufol] Do you support what is currently happening in Algeria? [Kraouche] Not everything, no. I support the legal struggle by the Algerian people to regain their dignity and victory, which was snatched away from them during the last general election. [Rioufol] Do you have links with the Armed Islamic Group? [Kraouche] We have no links with the GIA, nor with any other armed group. In France we are a legal association with the specific mission to inform people about what is going on. Our objective is to disclose the repression under which the Algerian people is suffering. [Rioufol] If the FIS comes to power in Algeria, do you think there is reason to fear a clash within the Muslim community living in France? [Kraouche] The Muslim community in France wants a rapid solution that would stop the bloodshed. If the FIS were to come to power tomorrow, then we can assure you that everything will proceed peacefully. There is no cause for concern. It is the differences existing within Algerian society that lend it its richness. [Rioufol] Soothing words, but at the moment a very large number of Algerian intellectuals are leaving their homeland where they are being physically threatened. [Kraouche] It is not soothing. In Algeria the military junta has constantly repressed the people.
