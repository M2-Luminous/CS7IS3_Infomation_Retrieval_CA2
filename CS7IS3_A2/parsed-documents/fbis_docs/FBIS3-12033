The naval base in Guantanamo illegally occupied by Washington, located in the eastern part of the island, is not the only source of aggression. The Cuban Parliament's International Relations Department has issued a report on the extent of U.S. military strength maintained near the island of Cuba. The document, publicized by PRENSA LATINA, notes that Cuba endures a partial military blockade and that the decision to restore the U.S. Homestead Air Force Base in Florida is an important part of this. In addition to this installation, which has been refurbished after being razed by a hurricane, there is an increased presence of airplanes and growing air and naval activities in Key West, only 180 km from Cuba. On the pretext of closely following the crisis in Haiti, the Pentagon deployed approximately 60 warships near Cuba's eastern tip. During the first two months of 1993 [year as heard] there has been increased military surveillance of the island. The U.S. military deployment near Cuba has been going on since the triumph of the Revolution. But it is strange that it has continued in spite of the events that climaxed in the collapse of the Soviet Union. The allegation that Cuba represented a threat because Moscow has become as anachronistic as the economic blockade, which Washington also maintains in spite of much criticism from both within and outside the United States. Well-known analysts have recommended an easing of the military pressure on Cuba. One of these is (Donald Shultz), a national security policy scholar who lectures at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army's War College. Last year, an inter-American magazine that researches global affairs published an article in which (Shultz) recommends that the White House distance itself from extremist elements of the Cuban immigrant community and promote measures, even military measures, that display trust. (Shultz') advice has gone unheeded, at least as far as the Pentagon is concerned. The same is true of the economic blockade, which has been sustained and toughened, in spite of growing criticism. No wonder a Cuban parliamentary commission recently declared that the way to resolve differences with the United States is to create external conditions conducive to the freehanded realization of the Cubans' social model.
