A number of senators and deputies officially announced, on 9 May through Senator Bernard Sansaricq, that a new president of Haiti will be sworn in, in Haiti, within the next few hours: Judge Emile Jonassaint, the current president of the Court of Cassation. According to the announcement made by Sen. Sansaricq in the presence of a group of parliamentarians, Jonassaint will be sworn in on 11 May. Here is a report by Edner Jean on 9 May, the day that was to mark the conclusion of the National Assembly, [pauses] the conclusion, in national assembly, of the current parliamentary session. In the last analysis, the National Assembly was unable to convene. [Begin recording] [Jean] [passage omitted] For his part, the president of the Chamber of Deputies said it is not up to him to rule in favor of one or the other of the two Senate Offices, adding immediately thereafter that his office is willing to work with whichever Senate Office can gather 14 senators. At that time, Sen. Sansaricq had still been unable to find a 14th member, something that was virtually impossible to do. Exchanges between senators and deputies became very heated. At 1830, Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde held a meeting behind closed doors, but the socialists stuck firmly to their position and finally left the room. Sen. Sansaricq's reaction came almost immediately: At 1900, he was back at the Senate, this time accompanied by about 15 deputies, all members of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, and he solemnly announced that Judge Emile Jonassaint will be sworn in as the new president of the Republic on 11 May. [Sansaricq] I have already spoken to President Emile Jonassaint. The president has completely agreed to be sworn in at noon on 11 May, here, before the Senate of the Republic. [applause] I also want to announce that the Haitian Army is going to snap its fingers at the [word indistinct] of the Senate of the Republic. [applause] [passage omitted] [Jean] [passage omitted] There was a surprise. Attracted, perhaps, by the atmosphere of this crowd -- to repeat the words of Senator Dupiton -- Monde joined the historic meeting. He went to the rostrum and took a stand in favor of the meeting and the measures being taken. He added, however, that a clear distinction should be made between the Monde who is president of the Chamber of Deputies and the Monde who is a deputy. Monde was warmly applauded by his peers. At 2000, there was a power outage and this group of senators and deputies went home, singing the national anthem. This is Edner Jean for Radio Metropole. [end recording]
