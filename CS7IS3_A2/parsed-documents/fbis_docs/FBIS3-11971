The election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general took place after reports that there was friction between the countries that supported the candidacy of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus and those who supported the South American president. "Although Nicaragua maintained its support for the Costa Rican foreign minister, Gaviria's election will not alter relations," said a spokesman for the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry. North and South American countries supported the candidacy of the Colombian president, while Niehaus had the support of Central America and the Caribbean countries. According to the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gaviria "is a very skillful and capable person because of his position." Gaviria will be leaving his post on 7 August when he turns it over to the president elected on 29 May in Colombia. Today, the Nicaraguan press, on its front pages, emphasized the election of Gaviria as well as the frustration of Niehaus, who harshly criticized the United States for exerting pressure on countries that had committed their votes. Analysts had forecast that the battle over the secretary generalship of the hemispheric organization was a battle between the "large and small countries" of the Americas, and that no representative of Central America had ever occupied the post of OAS secretary general.
