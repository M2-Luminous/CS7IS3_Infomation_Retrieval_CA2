FR940204-0-00032 FR940204-0-00017 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [OH48&hyph;1&hyph;6051; FRL&hyph;4816&hyph;1] Approval of Maintenance Plan and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; OH AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: USEPA is approving a redesignation request and maintenance plan for Cuyahoga County, Ohio as a revision to Ohio's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide. The revision is based on a request from the State of Ohio to redesignate this area, and approve its maintenance plan, and on the supporting data the State submitted. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient data are available to warrant such change. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rulemaking becomes effective on March 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: William Jones, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;6058. Copies of the redesignation request, public comments on the proposed rule, and other materials relating to this rulemaking are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone William Jones at (312) 886&hyph;6058, before visiting the Region 5 Office.) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604. A copy of this redesignation is available for inspection: Jerry Kurtzweg (ANR&hyph;443), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Jones at (312) 886&hyph;6058. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 107(d) of the pre-amended Clean Air Act (CAA), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) promulgated the carbon monoxide (CO) attainment status for each area of every State. For Ohio, Cuyahoga County was designated as a nonattainment area for CO, see 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978), and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Pursuant to section 107(d)(1)(C) of the CAA, Cuyahoga County retained its designation of nonattainment for CO by operation of law, see 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). At the same time the area was classified as a moderate CO nonattainment area based on a design value of 10.1 parts per million. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency requested that Cuyahoga County be redesignated to attainment in a letter dated October 16, 1992, and received by USEPA on October 21, 1992. On July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37453) USEPA proposed to approve Ohio's requested redesignation. The CO nonattainment area at issue consists of Cuyahoga County. The State of Ohio has met all of the CAA requirements for redesignation pursuant to section 107(d)(3)(E). The State provided monitoring, modeling and emissions data to support its redesignation request. The 1992 CO attainment emissions inventory totals in tons per day are 98.55, 81.25, and 67.17, respectively, for the point, area, and mobile sources. The State relied on the existence of an approved Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program as part of its maintenance demonstration. The State of Ohio also provided the following schedule for implementing the contingency plan and committed to retain the existing monitoring network for carbon monoxide in the Cleveland area. The last column in the schedule is the amount of time that a specific activity must start ahead of the oxygenated fuels program start date for scheduling purposes. The completion time is the amount of time required to finish a specific activity in the table.
