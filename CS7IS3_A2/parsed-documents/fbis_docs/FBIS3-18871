The chancellor's participation in the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings, together with Francois Mitterrand, Bill Clinton, and the Queen of England, would have been the pinnacle of his career as a statesman and, moreover, would have been of considerable help in a decisive electoral year. We remember the emotion of 22 September 1984 when the French president and the German chancellor paid their respects hand-in-hand before the Verdun war memorial. This symbolic gesture was a prelude to the strengthening of Franco-German cooperation and a boost for European unity that culminated in the Maastricht Treaty. Ten years later, in a world turned upside down, a unified and sovereign Germany was shocked to find itself excluded from the ceremonies of 6 June and has voiced its displeasure, if we are to believe the daily newspaper FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, by asking its diplomats to withdraw from any ceremony related with the event. The affair is obviously a delicate one. What is being celebrated on Omaha Beach is the fraternity of the allied armies which managed, at an immense cost in human lives, to begin to win back the land held by the Nazis. It is not, as was the case at Verdun, a shared homage to the war dead. Neither is this celebration a private affair between the French and the Germans. It is not certain whether the British would have appreciated seeing yesterday's enemy treated on the same level as the allies. Therein lies the whole ambiguity of the celebration of the battles -- it is unlikely that next year Francois Mitterrand and the Queen of England will celebrate the 180th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. If we had wanted to stress the reconciliation of yesterday's enemies, the Normandy ceremonies ought to have been a purely military affair, a reunion of comrades in arms who had lived through a terrible event together. The capitulation of Nazi Germany and the great political show of remembrance should have been left to the following year. Perhaps there has been an error of "mistaken scenario" for which the French president should take the blame. The task of the French leadership would perhaps have been made easier if, on several occasions, Chancellor Kohl had given less cause for criticism: From the visit of Ronald Reagan to the Bitburg cemetery in 1985 to last year's inauguration in Berlin of a plaque dedicated to the memory of "all the victims" of World War II, he has showed that he sometimes confuses -- for reasons of domestic politics -- reconciliation and the assigning of responsibility.
