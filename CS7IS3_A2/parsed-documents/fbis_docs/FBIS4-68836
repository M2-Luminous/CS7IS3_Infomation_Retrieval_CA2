He insistently recommended that the publishers accept for production Shulgin's work "Why Do We Not Like Them?" THEY are the Jews. WE are Russians with a capital "R," who recognize our national affiliation as a most valuable Christmas present of fate. Thus dear Boris Sergeyevich and the Russkaya Kniga Publishers (against their wishes to some extent) are intending to present reading Russia with the advocacy work of a most dazzling national Black Hundred figure, who contrived in postrevolution exile to admire Stalin for his imperial labors, return to the Union, serve the obligatory 10-year stretch, and remain true to his love and his hatred. It should be mentioned immediately that Boris Mironov was for the past two years (until his appointment) director of Russkaya Kniga and that he continues to exert a particular influence on the business prospects and future of this establishment. Nonetheless, not one regular employee of the publishing house agreed to edit this urgent work and append his name to the publication particulars. Some suggested that the following be set up on the title page: "Publication recommended by the Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press." A statement of fact--the chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press is, in fact, involved in the publication of literature sowing national discord--is inevitable. And he is doing this, what is more, while remaining beyond the reach of incensed cosmopolitans since there is not a single written document recording his direct participation in the publication of the said work. There is only the verbal evidence of people dependent on him. And, as indirect proof, the trifling matter of Shulgin's piece of research, so important for the fate of Russia, having arrived at the printer's (Book Factory No. 1, city of Elektrostal) in circumvention of the usual publishing cycle. The client, as we were informed in the production department of the book factory, is Russkaya Kniga. Boris Sergeyevich Mironov is undoubtedly a politician of the new wave. He pronounces the word "Russian" emotionally and, judging by his numerous radio and television appearances, is thinking seriously about how to reconstitute Great Russia. He is a particular traditionalist, if account is taken of the exclusive Russian tradition of official functionaries of the highest rank reckoning their appointment as nothing other than an inscribed pass into high politics. Simultaneously considering it possible for himself to adhere to exclusively personal and intimate political views. The opinion, which is approved throughout the world, that a public servant should be a proponent of the official ideology is considered an anachronism fit for satisfied European countries. In the mercantile language of the payroll, pay is computed for Boris Sergeyevich Mironov in order that a state which customarily calls itself democratic ensure "freedom of speech and the independence of the press...," but Boris Sergeyevich, appearing on television, has the following interesting words to say: "Such concepts as democratic principles, democratic canons--they are incomprehensible to me. I believe that they are once again trinkets and toys which are being used unscrupulously today in democratic and other political games. I believe that we should be guided not by some democratic reaction; we should be guided by common sense aimed at just one thing--the same thing for which I like Stolypin. Aimed at a strengthening of the state, a strengthening of Russia. And Russia can be strengthened only via the authorities. Strong authorities mean a strong state." Russia, as we all know, can be strengthened in various ways--the choice of pit-prop facilities is broad enough. But if account is taken of the passion of the chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press for strong authoritarian power, the press will soon be having to be guided by his common sense. In this case, we are simply compelled to analyze the personal attributes and level of practical potential of the committee chairman. So, then, Mr. Mironov negotiated the illustrious path from trainee at KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA to correspondent of PRAVDA. He has preserved his commitment to his paper--he named it as being among the papers constituting the "national information field which we are accustomed to calling central...." It is to these papers--PRAVDA, TRUD, and so forth--"whose name has become a symbol of Russia"---that Boris Sergeyevich intends giving budget monies first and foremost. He was, as we have already mentioned, director of the Russkaya Kniga Publishers (the former SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA Publishers). In 1993 he published the novel "The Madman," as the principal practical hero of which he portrayed one Mikhail Nikiforovich Poltoraivanov, the correspondent of a central newspaper. Boris Sergeyevich scrupulously delineated his practical hero in rich, lively, and evocative manner. With vivid touches and Tolstoyan periods. He did not employ camouflage inasmuch as the recognizability of the prototype was obligatory. It is rumored that Poltoranin was made fun of somewhat after the novel's appearance. Of Boris Sergeyevich, no. Because if a person does such a thing, he has, consequently, good reason to. Boris Sergeyevich had the novel published in the friendly Respublika Publishing House. It is not that important, of course, that the composition was supervised in the P.F. Anokhin Petrozavodsk Printer's by an employee of the Russkaya Kniga Publishers, that the publication particulars contain the name of no editor at all, that the technical editor was an employee of Russkaya Kniga also, and that the novel was printed from slides at Book Factory No. 1 in the city of Elektrostal. In which the product of Russkaya Kniga is usually printed, but by no means that of the Respublika Publishers, which has its own Krasnyy Proletariy Printer's. It is an absolutely trifling matter that the paper also was allocated from Russkaya Kniga stocks. We do not doubt, of course, that everything was paid for punctually and that an agreement with Respublika was signed and drawn up properly. It is foolish and trivial even to demand that a book by the director of a publishing house travel the customary route of a manuscript submitted for publication and that someone there decide whether it has a right to be published or not. Following this skewed logic, it could be demanded that vendors of the meat department stand in line for meat. The next step in the career of Boris Sergeyevich is the office of chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press, which was formed on the hallowed ground of the Ministry of Press and Information and the sporadically rebellious Federal Information Center. B. Mironov set forth his exclusively professional (and in no way political) principles at a news conference in Moscow, which caused quite a sensation. Boris Sergeyevich gave the appearance there of being an energetic and fair individual, but, unfortunately, contradicted himself somewhat: "I do not get into political banalities," Mr. Mironov said, "and this is our purpose, we pursue a sectoral policy, purely professional...." That is, Boris Sergeyevich announced that the committee would be objective, like the Moon, which simultaneously illuminates the road and the victim and the robber. But he observed immediately here that he would with pleasure impose moral censorship, and to the question as to whether "...the Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press intends monitoring observance of publications' political trustworthiness and subsequently dictating what should be written and how," he announced that "...of course, we will recommend, heeding our recommendations--that is your business...." We would recall that Boris Sergeyevich's first recommendation--to OBSHCHAYA GAZETA--took the form of an official caution, not heeding which was quite difficult. Would have been, had it not been for the verdict of the Appellate Court for Information Litigation, which sets aside the caution. But the biggest discrepancies occurred not at the level of the word but of the level of the view. Of Boris Sergeyevich's view of life. Boris Sergeyevich spoke at length, for example, about Alla Yaroshinskaya, calling her for some reason or other an ordinary Zhitomir journalist (in our age of democracy, evidently, ordinary Zhitomir journalists can win an alternative Nobel Prize and become a member of the Presidential Council), and juggled, to put it mildly, facts connected with the "Atomic Encyclopedia" which she is publishing--initially in a public interview, then at the news conference. But this is not the point. Mironov's conflict with Yaroshinskaya and its clear political underpinnings (Boris Sergeyevich is afraid of competition since there is in the Office of the President a plan for the creation of an official structure for assistance to the press, which was to have been headed by Aleksandr Yakovlev and Alla Yaroshinskaya) were illustrated in detail by IZVESTIYA of 31 March 1994. Exposing Yaroshinskaya as a publisher and accusing her of theft, Mr. Mironov observed that he himself had attended the school of director of a publishing house and had been accustomed in this field to earn everything down to the last kopek independently. The trouble is that this is not entirely the case. The Russkaya Kniga Publishers, which Mironov left, not only has not prospered since his directorship but finds itself, according to the workers of the publishing house, in an extremely difficult financial situation. Each employee of the publishing house has been issued a list of books whose print run has not in practice sold out--so that the employees might take part in the distribution as best they can. The list contains approximately 30 titles, and, according to employees of the publishing house, this is 60 percent of the entire print product on which Russkaya Kniga has been working these past two years. The books are filling up warehouse premises, and the publishing house, lest it pay money for storage, has been forced to undertake acts of charity and to give them out free of charge. Since it was made clearly understood to us that the decision on the publication of this book or the other would always be made by Mr. Mironov himself, it is, naturally, he who bears the responsibility for all these problems of the structure he has left. In addition, during Boris Sergeyevich's directorship there were several further odd episodes at the publishing house permitting doubts as to Mironov's theory concerning honestly earned kopeks. The business of the calendar published by Russkaya Kniga for a large Siberian plant acquired a certain notoriety even in publishing circles. The large industrial enterprise, which has trade relations with foreign partners, decided to conclude with the publishing house a contract for the publication of the "Old Russian Book Miniature" in order that 3,000 copies of the calendar might be published bearing the plant's proprietary symbols. During the negotiations, which took place in March of last year, Mr. Mironov informed his clients that the publishing house was in a difficult material situation. In this connection the plant undertook to pay for the entire print run of 20,000 copies. And not simply to pay, what is more, but to prepay. The calendars (so that they could be sold) were to have been delivered to the enterprise absolutely no later than August. But on Mr. Mironov's initiative the documents did not specify a precise deadline. "We are civilized people," Mironov said, "you will get the calender, I will not say on time, but sooner...." "Mironov was full of enthusiasm," plant representative Yelena D. told us. "We were shown a calculation with regard to all the types of taxation--the production cost of each calendar amounted to R800. The contract was signed in April--No. 20 of 12 April 1993. Some 16 million were paid into the publishers' account within a week, and--total silence ensued...." Subsequently the situation unfolded in most villainous fashion. The calendar was not ready either in July or in August or in September. To all questions there was just one answer--it is being printed. Then... it dries up. At the start of October the representative of the plant was issued 15 copies of the calendar and told that, considering the inflationary processes, the prime cost of a copy would be R3,600. And this meant that the plant could expect merely its own 3,000 calendars with the symbols, while the rest would remain at the publisher's. "I then demanded a new calculation," Yelena D. told us, "I wanted to know where this increase in the price had come from. It was brought me--for `our' 3,000 copies. It said that the paper had been purchased in mid-April--why, then, was it so expensive? The chief accountant was summoned. She said: No, this is the wrong paper, it is not intended for this calendar. The appropriate people were hastily assembled, and I was given another set of figures--based on a cost of one copy of R2,700. "To make a long story short, I realized that we had simply been cheated. At that time, in the month of April, Mr. Mironov probably needed money. He had, evidently, wasted it on something or other. In actual fact, the plant lost this money. We were unable to sell the part of the print run that came to us, arriving too late. I was told in the publishing house's accounts department: `You cannot imagine even how you were cheated....'" It may be observed that the Siberian plant business was an isolated instance. But the paper knows of several other episodes of the less than ethical attitude of Mr. Mironov toward his authors and clients and his financial records. Describing them would take too long, showing the records is difficult. But are there witnesses? In two years Russkaya Kniga has had three chief accountants and as many commercial directors. Not one, according to people in the know, surrendered his files on leaving. And each of them will remember Mr. Mironov's methods of conducting business for a long time, if not forever. We were told in the publishing house: "We still freeze with fear merely at the mention of his name...." The appointment of PRAVDA man Mironov to the position of chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press has been seen by many journalists as evidence of an obvious cooling on the part of the official authorities toward the news media. But, we are convinced, a less atypical person than Boris Sergeyevich Mironov also could have coped with the organization of the dubious game going by the name of "straighten out the journalist." It is obvious, for that matter, that the appointment of Mr. Mironov is the result of the materialization of quite narrow group interests. Boris Sergeyevich is in his position very convenient for a whole number of quite influential politicians. He will never, for example, fall out with the Committee for Information and Communications of the State Duma. And he will hardly abolish the at least 15 small state-owned (?) enterprises established on the basis of practically all the economic subdivisions of the Ministry of Press and Information and the Federal Information Center, whose successor the committee is (the newspaper has a list of all these small state-owned enterprises). It is perfectly obvious that fighting the very institution of group (large or small, it is immaterial) political intrigue in our society is just as useless as trying to influence the weather by means of a collective campaign. Nonetheless, many of us formerly paid quite dearly for our democratic toys and trinkets for us now to be parting with them overnight. We realize, for that matter, that we have taken up too much paper and too much of the reader's time with individual traits and singularities of the new custodian of the press. The problem is not, of course, the character of Mr. Mironov--he does not, ultimately, eat children. The problem is that politicians of his ilk are again needed and are once again being brought into power. Meanwhile, time is passing. Journalists, like the peasants and miners, are sitting and waiting for government subsidies. The distribution of subsidies is the first and most telling manifestation of power. Today power is being manifested by the chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press. We will see who gets the money.
