"Bulgaria's prestige in Europe and the world will depend on its performance as chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Ministers," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said upon his departure for Strasbourg. Addressing the session of the Committee of Ministers, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov outlined the main points in the work of the committee during Bulgaria's chairmanship. "During the past few years the Council of Europe has proved capable of meeting the challenges of the new developments on the continent. Our present time, however, is so dynamic that we are already facing new realities, requiring our organization to adapt itself to them and develop still further its ability to react rapidly and adequately," Mr. Daskalov said. "The future profile of our organization depends on the successful and balanced solution of the problem of the enlargement of the Council of Europe (...) which should continue without lowering the standards for membership," Mr. Daskalov said in his address. "Political dialogue should be deepened and intensified. Not only in view of enlarging the organization, but also of stabilizing its achievements and of further reinforcing and adapting the Council of Europe's actions, including in certain fields evaded by now. This is the only possible way to enhance the democratic changes in our societies and to harmonize our efforts in European unification. In this respect we consider the increase of the role played by the Committee of Ministers as the central policy-forming and decision- making body of the organization to be of crucial importance. "The complexity of the new tasks to be solved and problems to be overcome demands an ever increasing consolidation and intensification of the coordination between the Council of Europe and other European institutions involved in the construction of a democratic security system in Europe. In particular we consider it important to strengthen the co-operation with the European Union. Relations with the CSCE should also be further stimulated," Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said. Mr. Daskalov pointed out in his speech that as chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe Bulgaria would make every possible effort to contribute to the common future of the European Continent and do its best to implement the decisions of the Vienna summit. Addressing Secretary General Catherine Lalumiere, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov said: "We appreciate the brilliant way in which you have conducted the organization during the past five challenging years of its history -- years which changed its face and its future. We have witnessed your personal efforts and involvement in these changes, your devotion to the principles and ideals of the Council of Europe and of united Europe as a whole. I personally would like to assure you that in the heart of my country your name will be associated with Bulgaria's accession to the Council of Europe." [passage omitted]
