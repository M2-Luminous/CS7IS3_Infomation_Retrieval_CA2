They reported to the prime minister on the talks. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the two, the prime minister's political adviser Jacques Neriya, and Colonel 'Amos Gil'ad, Mr. Rabin's deputy military secretary, left for Cairo this morning after consultations with the prime minister. They were instructed to find out 'Arafat's real stand on the possible resumption of the talks between Israel and the PLO. The PLO's ambassador in Cairo said an Israeli envoy would arrive in Tunis within two days to hand 'Arafat Israel's response to the organization's demands on the security of the Palestinians in the territories. He said the PLO would decide whether to renew the peace talks based on Israel's answers. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 7 March reports that "Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation, told the PLO in Tunis that the Neriya-'Arafat meeting was positive, and that Neriya took notes, which he will deliver to Prime Minister Rabin this evening. Speaking to our correspondent, Sha'th said that it is still too early to speak of a summit meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin, but stressed that the contacts are positive, and that it is possible that developments will take place in several days, if Israel accepts the requests raised in Neriya's meeting with 'Arafat."]
