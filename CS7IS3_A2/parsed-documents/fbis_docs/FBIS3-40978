It is also inexpedient to set up such production processes. This conclusion was reached by the bureau of the Commission for Issues of Nuclear Policy under the president of Ukraine, which examined this issue at a meeting chaired by Academician Viktor Baryahtar [name as received] of Ukraine's Academy of Sciences. In the opinion of the meeting's participants Ukraine does not have any possibility for extracting highly-enriched uranium and processing it and this is why they support the decision to transfer nuclear warheads to Russia in return for fuel for nuclear power stations. According to experts' calculations, the construction of new production processes for reprocessing highly-enriched uranium from nuclear warheads will not strategically solve the problem because there is not enough of it. Moreover, in general these production processes are ecologically dangerous. The commission's bureau has resolved to support the activity of the president in up drawing appropriate agreements with Russia and the United States that would suit the national interests of the state. [signed] The press service of the president and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.
