FR940630-0-00111 FR940630-0-00036 Youthbuild programs. See the definition of ``HUD Youthbuild programs'' in this section. ยง135.7 Delegation of authority. Except as may be otherwise provided in this part, the functions and responsibilities of the Secretary under section 3, and described in this part, are delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The Assistant Secretary is further authorized to redelegate functions and responsibilities to other employees of HUD; provided however, that the authority to issue rules and regulations under this part, which authority is delegated to the Assistant Secretary, may not be redelegated by the Assistant Secretary. ยง135.9 Requirements applicable to HUD NOFAs for section 3 covered programs. (a) Certification of compliance with part 135. All notices of funding availability (NOFAs) issued by HUD that announce the availability of funding covered by section 3 shall include a provision in the NOFA that notifies applicants that section 3 and the regulations in part 135 are applicable to funding awards made under the NOFA. Additionally the NOFA shall require as an application submission requirement (which may be specified in the NOFA or application kit) a certification by the applicant that the applicant will comply with the regulations in part 135. (For PHAs, this requirement will be met where a PHA Resolution in Support of the Application is submitted.) With respect to application evaluation, HUD will accept an applicant's certification unless there is evidence substantially challenging the certification. (b) Statement of purpose in NOFAs. (1) For competitively awarded assistance in which the grants are for activities administered by an HA, and those activities are anticipated to generate significant training, employment or contracting opportunities, the NOFA must include a statement that one of the purposes of the assistance is to give to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, job training, employment, contracting and other economic opportunities to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns. (2) For competitively awarded assistance involving housing rehabilitation, construction or other public construction, where the amount awarded to the applicant may exceed $200,000, the NOFA must include a statement that one of the purposes of the assistance is to give, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, job training, employment, contracting and other economic opportunities to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns. (c) Section 3 as NOFA evaluation criteria. Where not otherwise precluded by statute, in the evaluation of applications for the award of assistance, consideration shall be given to the extent to which an applicant has demonstrated that it will train and employ section 3 residents and contract with section 3 business concerns for economic opportunities generated in connection with the assisted project or activity. The evaluation criteria to be utilized, and the rating points to be assigned, will be specified in the NOFA. ยง135.11 Other laws governing training, employment, and contracting. Other laws and requirements that are applicable or may be applicable to the economic opportunities generated from the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance include, but are not necessarily limited to those listed in this section. (a) Procurement standards for States and local governments (24 CFR 85.36) _(1) General. Nothing in this part 135 prescribes specific methods of procurement. However, neither section 3 nor the requirements of this part 135 supersede the general requirement of 24 CFR 85.36(c) that all procurement transactions be conducted in a competitive manner. Consistent with 24 CFR 85.36(c)(2), section 3 is a Federal statute that expressly encourages, to the maximum extent feasible, a geographic preference in the evaluation of bids or proposals. (2) Flexible Subsidy Program. Multifamily project mortgagors in the Flexible Subsidy Program are not required to utilize the methods of procurement in 24 CFR 85.36(d), and are not permitted to utilize methods of procurement that would result in their award of a contract to a business concern that submits a bid higher than the lowest responsive bid. A multifamily project mortgagor, however, must ensure that, to the greatest extent feasible, the procurement practices it selects provide preference to section 3 business concerns. (b) Procurement standards for other recipients (OMB Circular No. A&hyph;110). Nothing in this part prescribes specific methods of procurement for grants and other agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations. Consistent with the requirements set forth in OMB Circular No. A&hyph;110, section 3 is a Federal statute that expressly encourages a geographic preference in the evaluation of bids or proposals. (c) Federal labor standards provisions. Certain construction contracts are subject to compliance with the requirement to pay prevailing wages determined under Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a_276a&hyph;7) and implementing U.S. Department of Labor regulations in 29 CFR part 5. Additionally, certain HUD-assisted rehabilitation and maintenance activities on public and Indian housing developments are subject to compliance with the requirement to pay prevailing wage rates, as determined or adopted by HUD, to laborers and mechanics employed in this work. Apprentices and trainees may be utilized on this work only to the extent permitted under either Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR part 5 or for work subject to HUD-determined prevailing wage rates, HUD policies and guidelines. These requirements include adherence to the wage rates and ratios of apprentices or trainees to journeymen set out in ``approved apprenticeship and training programs,'' as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
