Under the guise of "conflict resolution" which has become one of the new buzzwords of the Clinton administration's largely amateurish effort to stay "engaged" in America's self-prescribed "manifest destiny" to lead the post Cold War world, U.S. policy in the region is becoming less and less apologetic about an activist role in the arena. The Clinton administration's "creative diplomacy" in South Asia which seems to have no pretensions to any other interest except to strap the region into some kind of nuclear non-proliferation regime translates into sustained pressure on India and Pakistan to "come to the table." This can only result in a substantial erosion of sovereignty in decision-making for both countries. The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel's questioning of Kashmir's status as an integral part of India might not really be the key indicator of the discernible tilt in policy against India, given that all Washington's pronouncements have had the in-built premise that Kashmir is disputed territory. That the U.S. regards part or all of Kashmir as disputed is not so much a point of issue, given the undeniable historical reality that Kashmir's status was the subject of U.N. resolutions, but what is of concern is the marked hardening of the U.S. attitude towards India's position in the dispute, including a hint of an intervention in the problem that will not be in India's interest. There are three new elements that stand out in Ms. Raphel's presentation that are the critical indicators of the tilt against India. The first is an unsubstantiated assertion that Pakistan's support in fuelling the militancy in the Valley is not as much as it used to be. Not only would this formulation give greater credibility to the claim that the stir in the Valley is wholly spontaneous and indigenous, but it would reinforce the attempts from across the border to keep the militancy "spontaneous." The second disturbing element is that in a shift from the stand of the Bush administration the Clinton administration now appears to be questioning the efficacy of the Shimla Agreement. Until now, the American emphasis on Shimla had implied an acceptance of India's argument that Kashmir was an issue to be resolved bilaterally. Another indication of the U.S. interest in internationalising Kashmir is the suggestion that America will sound out Russia on a joint initiative for conflict resolution in South Asia. The Narasimha Rao administration appears to have been taken by surprise by the unfriendly tenor of these remarks, especially because it has in recent months tried to respond to American and international pressure by setting up a human rights commission and also indicating a willingness to talk to Pakistan on Kashmir. But what the Government has not perhaps taken into account is that precisely because it took these steps only under pressure and is perceived to be amenable to this sort of pressure, does Washington find it tactically rewarding to turn up the heat. As we had said earlier in these columns, India's position on Kashmir is becoming increasingly vulnerable because of the continuing inability to initiate a political process in the State, the sharpening perception of the Indian State as an alien oppressor, reinforced by the image of the Army laying siege to the religious symbols of the Kashmiri people. But most troubling is New Delhi's reluctance to accept the reality that the only way to take Kashmir off the world's radar screen is to engage Islamabad in a mutual confidence building exercise so that an insecure regime in Pakistan does not feel compelled to invite external mediators in, at the cost of the region's sovereignty.
