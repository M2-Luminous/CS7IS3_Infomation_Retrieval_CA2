A government official said on Monday that the system would be an effective means of preventing disputes stemming from the two sides' different setups. The system would also help minimize South Korean investment risks in North Korea as there are currently no bilateral investment guarantees. If the two sides reached agreement, the form of trade and investment contracts would be formalized at a private level subject to approval by government authorities. "We have conceived of the idea in the belief that chances are slim for the conclusion of a governmental South-North investment guarantee agreement in the foreseeable future," the official said. The South is now working on a draft and when significant progress is seen in the nuclear issue, it will raise the issue with the North, the official said. Japan and China introduced a standard contract system prior to normalizing diplomatic relations.
