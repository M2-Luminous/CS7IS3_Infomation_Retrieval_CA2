Ma Liumin, 25, and Zhu Min, 22, were arrested when about a dozen uniformed and plainclothes police descended on an informal art show organized by the two at their home in the city's eastern Chaoyang district just as it wound up Sunday afternoon, witnesses said. Police Tuesday again raided the artists' home, where a number of painters live, and took away paintings and materials, the friends said. Police refused to comment, although Monday they confirmed the raid, but gave no details. "Ma was nude during the gathering but his show was purely artistic and had no political message," one of the artist's friends said.
