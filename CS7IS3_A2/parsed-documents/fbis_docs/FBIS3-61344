Khazan: "The Kuchma-Hrynyov Alliance--Biggest Surprise of the Season"] [Text] The super-bloc of this election campaign, the union of ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and ex-Deputy Speaker Volodymyr Hrynyov, was met with a certain degree of bewilderment by the broad segment of quasi-political masses. But despite being entirely unexpected, it was still immediately perceived as being fairly strong and flexible. The impression remains, however, that this compromise union is deficient, due to the fact that ex-Deputy Prime Minister Volodymyr Lanovyy is not a participant. Prior to this time, Lanovyy's views on methodology for the conduct of market transformations coincided with those of Volodymyr Hrynyov. Which cannot be said about Leonid Kuchma. Nor has this strange factor gone unnoticed by observers and delegates to the III Congress of New Ukraine, from which all three individuals have sprung. But Leonid Kuchma did not spend a long time in New Ukraine, soon making his career as the head of government. While Volodymyr Lanovyy left New Ukraine over disagreement with the tactics of the antimarket--in Lanovyy's view--policy of Kuchma following the II Congress. The New Ukraine leader, Volodymyr Hrynyov, has evidently embarked upon a path seeking unifying factors with Leonid Kuchma, not disjunctive ones. V. Hrynyov's attempt once again to draw V. Lanovyy into the ranks of New Ukraine at the III Congress 18 November were not crowned with success. In his presentation to the congress, Lanovyy expressed a sharply negative assessment of the Kuchma-Hrynyov alliance. Perhaps not the least important--although not the most important either--role in the difficult relationship between Lanovyy and Kuchma was played by the ugly situation that came about in January of this year, when the Center for Market Reforms, headed by Lanovyy, presented to Prime Minister Kuchma--still new in office at that time, a program of market transformations. But Kuchma, enamored with the idea of "management of the state sector," failed to attribute to the program the significance it deserved. His apparatus (V. Pynzenyk's name was also mentioned here) used scissors and glue to fashion a motley collection of fragments of diverse--at times mutually exclusive--economic programs, including the program of the Center for Market Reforms, into which titanic labor had been expended, according to Lanovyy. In the final analysis, the eclectic nature of the policy of the Kuchma Cabinet (along with pressure from the president's clan) led to his resignation. Not joining the alliance, Volodymyr Lanovyy is establishing the Union of Private Property Owners and Entrepreneurs, whose congress will convene 24-25 December. So what is this union of Kuchma and Hrynyov based on? It is most likely based on a certain convergence of positions, for which Kuchma had to make at least a small shift to the right, and Hrynyov--to the left, which fixes the position of the alliance on the left flank, but not far from center. From all appearances, the prediction of farsighted politicians and political experts, including the well-known V. Malinkovich, on prospects for a left-centrist bloc is coming to fruition. We know that political groups of appropriate orientation formed prior to this time are beginning to gravitate towards it. The election results will show whether or not it was worth the trouble.
