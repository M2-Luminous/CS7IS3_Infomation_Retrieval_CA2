Cadres from propaganda and foreign affairs offices at and above the county and department level and cadres from other departments at and above the prefectural level attended the report meeting. The meeting was presided over by (Du Tai), executive deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee. (Qu Jia), head of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Government, who personally attended the 50th meeting of the World Human Rights Committee, made a report to participants at the meeting on the situation of the international struggle for human rights. (Qu Jia) said: The Chinese delegation once again smashed the scheme by the Western hostile forces and a small number of separatists at the international meeting to split China. Facts have once again proved that the force of righteousness will eventually defeat those ulterior motives. At the 50th meeting of the World Human Rights Committee, (Qu Jia) used his personal experience as a person of the Tibetan nationality to refute unbridled rumors and intentional slanders against the human rights situation in China's Tibetan region by a small number of people. (Qu Jia) said: Some representatives of nongovernment organizations used rumors, which they themselves admitted to be unproven hearsay, to fabricate and distort the human rights situation in this autonomous region. They also cited documents of the so-called Tibetan government in exile. Therefore, people can easily see that their real intention was not their concern for human rights but rather their activities to split China by using the human rights issue. What is the human rights situation in Tibet? Only the people in Tibet are highly qualified to make statements on this issue. People all know that Tibet is an inalienable part of China. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, especially since the democratic reform in 1959, the human rights situation for the broad masses of people in Tibet has undergone a fundamental change. Great improvements have been made in economic and social development. The people's living conditions have been significantly improved. The customs and habits of people of Tibetan nationality have been respected, and the policy of freedom of religion has been fully implemented. Various policies carried out in Tibet by the central government, especially a series of special policies especially formulated for Tibet in the last 10-odd years, have been greatly supported by the broad masses of people of Tibetan nationality. They have deeply realized that the past several decades have been the best period concerning the human rights situation in Tibet. The situation in Tibet can be seen by the people. If people take a just stand, they can certainly see the overall and genuine situation. At the 50th meeting of the World Human Rights Committee, (Qu Jia) pointed out that in 1993, in addition to the touring of Tibet by some 30,000 foreigners and people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, 344 people from 24 countries came to visit and inspect the situation in Tibet, including leading members of governments, parliaments, and political parties, as well as reporters and officials of foreign embassies and consulates in China. They have visited cities, villages, factories, schools, hospitals, and temples in Tibet and have held extensive contacts with people of various circles. After personally seeing the situation in Tibet, they generally recognized development and progress in Tibet. Even some people who had a considerable prejudice against the situation in Tibet cannot but say that only hearing a one-sided view on Tibet is not justifiable. In presenting an introduction to the 50th meeting of the World Human Rights Committee on China's nationalities policy, (Qu Jia) emphatically pointed out that the Chinese Government always adheres to the policy of equality for all nationalities because this is a fundamental principle stipulated by the Chinese Constitution. In China, people of all nationalities, regardless of their total population, the extent of their social and economic development, and differences in customs, religious beliefs, and languages, all are equal in terms of their status and all enjoy equal rights and benefits. The Chinese Government has always made efforts to strengthen the unity and harmony of people of various nationalities in the country. In formulating political, economic, and social development policies, the Chinese Governments has paid special attention to protecting the rights of minority people. In handling nationality affairs work, the government will extensively solicit opinions of various related nationalities and do things through full consultation. Meanwhile, through enacting laws and adopting concrete measures, the government has guaranteed that people of various minority nationalities can take part in the administration of state and local affairs in various fields. To help people of minority nationalities develop economic, cultural, and other social undertakings and to catch up with more developed regions as quickly as possible, the Chinese Government has always attached great importance to providing necessary assistance to minority peoples in terms of money, supplies, and manpower. In formulating plans for the development of the national economy, the Chinese Government has always adopted a policy of giving preferential treatment to the regions in which minority peoples reside. Meanwhile, the state has required and encouraged developed areas to help regions in which minority peoples reside, it has advocated mutual assistance between regions, and it has implemented the system of the regional autonomy of minority nationalities. The system of regional autonomy is an important political system stipulated by the Chinese Constitution to protect the rights and interests of people of minority nationalities. In areas in which people of minority nationalities reside, the state established autonomous organs to enable minority people to exercise their rights to administer the internal and local affairs of their own nationality. According to related stipulations of the Chinese Constitution and the Law of the People's Republic of China on National Regional Autonomy, the autonomous organs of various autonomous areas are state organs of local political power. In addition to the functions and power of other state organs of various provinces and municipalities, those organs also have autonomous power related to the political, economic, cultural, education, and other fields. The implementation of this system has protected various democratic rights of minority people and has promoted development in various fields in regions in which people of minority nationalities reside. China is a country with a legal system. Through the legislation of related laws, China has affirmed and protected the rights of minority people, guaranteed the equal position of various nationalities, and adjusted relations among various nationalities. At present, China has enacted laws to protect people of minority nationalities. These include nationwide laws such as the Constitution and the Law of the People's Republic of China on National Regional Autonomy, and local laws and regulations on self-autonomy formulated by various nationality autonomous areas. The contents of those laws and regulations cover minority people's political, economic, cultural, and educational fields, as well as their languages and religious beliefs. It can be said that China has in the main formed a legal system to protect various rights and interests of people of minority nationalities. Facts speak louder than words. The practices over more than four decades have proved that China's policy for nationality affairs has achieved success. The international community will not be deceived by the lies spread by a small number of people in the world. Our government has always stressed and made great efforts to promote the human rights of all Chinese people, including the people of Tibetan nationality. The efforts and achievements cannot be denied by some lies by those people. The report made by (Qu Jia) won warm applause from the participants. At the report meeting, (Du Tai), executive deputy director of the propaganda department of the regional party committee, emphatically pointed out: Although we have repeatedly foiled the scheme of splitting the motherland by international hostile forces and a small number of separatists at home and abroad, we must not slacken our vigilance. We must strengthen our belief in our cause and fully understand the protracted and complicated nature of the struggle against separatism. We must not to the slightest degree slacken in our efforts.
