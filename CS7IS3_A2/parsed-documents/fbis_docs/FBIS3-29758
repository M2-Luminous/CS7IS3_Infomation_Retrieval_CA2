Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other Cabinet members vowed to move forward with the policy. But the prime minister said only major arms deals, not small ones, should be subject to the barter trade policy. He said other government agencies, not only the military, would also be required to consider the possibility of barter trade negotiations. Wichit, a non-MP and non-partisan member of the Chuan Cabinet, claimed that "politics" was behind the show of dissatisfaction by the generals over the trade policy. But the defence minister would not elaborate. "I don't want to talk about it," Wichit said when asked what he thought had prompted the top brass to come out to attack the government over the policy. "Even a neutral guy like me has taken so much blame over this. This has been politicized. I am working for the people's interest and the policy is a good one which will benefit the country's economy." On Monday, Army Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit strongly criticized the Defence Ministry for having allegedly failed to coordinate government and military discussions about the counter trade policy. "All the problems and confusion should be referred to the permanent secretary for defence or the defence minister," Wimon said. "I want to know how they interpret the government's policy and whether they can explain it." Last week, following a meeting of the Defence Council, a policy-making body of military agencies, several top brass came out to attack the policy as "impractical". They said the policy would severely affect the armed forces plan to modernize their weapons and delay arms purchases. The country's interest would eventually be affected if the prices went up after the delay, they said. They said no arms dealers would be interested in bartering their weapons for Thai commodities. But government leaders said the generals misunderstood the policy. The government wanted only that the armed forces keep the Commerce Ministry informed about their planned arms purchases. The ministry and other agencies concerned could then try to negotiate with the governments of the arms dealers to buy Thai agricultural products in return. Wichit said the policy should not be called "barter trade" as it would bring about confusion. "The Nov 2 Cabinet resolution is clear-cut," Wichit said. "They just want the armed forces to help government agencies concerned to negotiate with the arms-selling countries to buy our agriculture products." Wimon and several generals have complained that their main duty was to defend the country, not to conduct trade negotiations. But Wichit said yesterday it should pose no problem for the armed forces to help other government agencies concerned in the negotiations. "I've told the Cabinet that the Defence Ministry is not good at trade negotiation. But I am also obliged to respond to the need of other ministries concerned. We can help the ministries carry out the negotiations in the first place because the armed forces could tell the arms suppliers that their country should buy some Thai products too," Wichit said He said he had explained the government's policy to chiefs of staff of all the armed forces, and there should be no problem or misunderstanding. He said military attaches to Thai embassies in foreign countries could also help in the counter trade negotiations. Wimon had complained on Monday that all army purchase plans had "bounced back". Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa quoted Wichit as telling the Cabinet that he wanted all arms purchases to be carried out in line with the food-for-arms policy. But Chuan told reporters yesterday the government wanted only major arms purchases to be carried out in line with the counter trade policy. "If they want to buy only 100 to 200 rounds of cannon ammunition, they don't have to negotiate for the counter trade," Chuan said. "The defence minister has offered to consider by himself which deals should be conducted under the counter trade policy. So, the final decision on which deals should be subject to the counter trade policy will depend on the minister. But if a deal is only Bt1 or 2 million worth, no negations are needed." Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday that the Air Force plan to purchase G-222 transport planes from Alenia, an Italian firm, had to be further delayed. He said the Thai government had to wait until Italy has a new government before sending representatives to negotiate with the country to buy Thai agriculture products in return for the plane purchase. "The negotiation may take place next month or in April," Suphachai said. "The Air Force will not be affected because we will at least be able to buy the planes on the same quotation." The deputy prime minister said the government only wanted to help farmers with its barter trade policy.
