P. Borovaya, director, Biota Scientific-Production Association] [Text] An interfarm biological laboratory was organized in 1990 in Leningradskiy Rayon, Krasnodar Kray at the Leningradskoye APO [Agricultural Production Association?]. Besides producing biological agents, its has been ordered to reveal the most dangerous pests and diseases of agricultural crops, to draw maps of their occurrence at farms, and to develop the methods of effective use of different microbiological preparations and monitoring the quality of biological agents delivered to the rayon's farms. The Northern Caucasian Scientific Research Institute of Phytopathology provided technical and methodological assistance to the laboratory in all of these years. In the stage of initial development, our main goal was to establish a collective of like-minded individuals capable of organizing production of biological agents in the shortest time possible, and to unite farm agronomists around the idea of ecologically compatible plant protection. We believe we were able to solve this problem successfully. The biolaboratory, which has become part of the Biota Scientific-Production Association, currently employs 12 persons, including Doctor of Biological Sciences T. S. Ivanova (a nematologist), Candidate of Biological Sciences A. P. Luda (a microbiologist), five highly qualified specialists with a higher biological and agricultural education, and four laboratory technicians. The laboratory has equipment making it possible to produce microbiological preparations such as rizoplan, bitoksibatsillin, lepidotsid, baktofit, preparation-2 and trichodermin, and preparations based on predatory nematodes. The first lots of bacterial and fungal preparations were produced in May 1991 according to procedures introduced at the SK NIIF [not further identified]. In addition the laboratory's associates underwent apprenticeship at the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Applied Microbiology (Obolensk), where they mastered the methods of producing and using several microbiological preparations. A highly active strain of Trichoderma was revealed independently. It is now being used in greenhouses of Leningradskiy Rayon to control root rot. The laboratory is also developing preparative forms of biological resources based on entomopathogenic nematodes that are highly effective (70-95 percent) against wireworms and potato moths. A total of 7,200 liters of biological preparations were produced in 9 months of 1992. During the time that the scientific and practical directions of the laboratory's work were forming and it was financed out of the budget of the Leningradskoye APO, its activity moved along quite briskly. But the situation changed after transition to full cost accounting. Difficulties typical of not just our enterprise alone came into being. An acute need arose for increasing production volume and fitting out the laboratory with highly productive equipment (primarily fermenters of different capacities), for erecting a separate production building, a boiler plant and so on, and for solving a number of public health problems. All of this requires considerable resources! Realizing the concept of low-volume microbiological production will doubtlessly require investors. The problems of supplying laboratories with strains of industrial microorganisms satisfying all of the requirements of modern production, and of organizing advanced training courses for laboratory associates, have not been solved. There is a problem in keeping personnel employed year-round. Everyone is busy in spring and summer, but in fall and winter the few greenhouse complexes are unable to keep our work profitable. We are looking for things for the people to do--perhaps producing yeast for food industry, feed additives, silage leaven for animal husbandry, and biologically produced humus. We would be interested in knowing how other collectives are solving these problems. COPYRIGHT: "``Kolos'', ``Zashchita Rasteniy'', 1993
