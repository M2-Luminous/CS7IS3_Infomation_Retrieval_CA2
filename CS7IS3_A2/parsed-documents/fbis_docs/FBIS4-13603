In a statement to the weekly AL-MUSAWWAR to be published on Friday [22 April], Rabin said President Mubarak helped greatly to continue the process and remove the obstacles in its way. On the negotiations with Syria, the Israeli prime minister said he does not believe peace with Syria can be achieved without secret meetings. He pointed out that Israel held talks with the PLO in Oslo for six months and that that helped to achieve the Declaration of Principles. He added: Our government was the first in Israel to accept Resolution 242 as a basis for peace with Syria, entailing withdrawal on the Golan [min fawq al-julan]. But Rabin added that the geographic scale of the withdrawal cannot be specified before Israel knows exactly what the Syrians mean by full peace. Asked about the failure to implement the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the reason for the postponement, Rabin said: We have not postponed negotiations. We are ready to continue the talks indefinitely to reach an agreement that would achieve the goals of the transitional stage, overcome opposition by particular forces on both sides, achieve security for the Israelis, and grant the Palestinian council the authority to administer the Palestinian people's affairs. Asked about ways to solve the problem of settlements, Rabin said that the agreement is very clear: It provides that all the settlements will stay where they are during the transitional stage. The PLO signed this agreement and we will discuss the settlements issue when we negotiate over the final solution. Asked about negotiations with Jordan and Lebanon, Rabin said: We believed that we were close to an agreement with Jordan but, regrettably, our efforts did not succeed. We have virtually no territorial problems with Jordan. He stressed that Israel has no territorial problems with Lebanon but there is a security problem because the Lebanese Government cannot muster sovereignty over all its territory. We do not covet one inch of Lebanese territory and all that we hope is that the Lebanese Government can disengage the private military organizations. On the possibility of holding a meeting between him and Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, Rabin said: We must prepare for such a meeting because if we meet and fail to sign an agreement, our failure would cause disappointment and frustration and defeat our purpose of reaching an agreement that can be implemented.
