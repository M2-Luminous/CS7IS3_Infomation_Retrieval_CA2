He Suggested to Deputies... Five Ways of Finding the Trillions"] [Text] Unfortunately the grotesque word "nonpayments" has now become firmly established in the vocabulary not just of economic managers but of Joe Public too and has afflicted all spheres of the economy like a cancerous growth. In his speech to the Federation Council session, Viktor Chernomyrdin cited the following figures: As of 1 March, the debt owed to enterprises was 25 trillion rubles [R] whereas the debt owed by them was R32 trillion. This means that there are R7 trillion missing from the equation: Even with mutual offsetting of debts throughout all production chains and all types of economic ties, there would still be a colossal amount owed -- many consumers will not have the actual resources with which to settle their debts. I think that, in these extremely difficult conditions, Viktor Chernomyrdin has offered some quite effective methods of overcoming the crisis. Method one. Clear the budget debt to enterprises (R4.6 trillion). The method: direct payments, the issue of promissory notes (over R1 trillion), and the reduction of taxes on enterprises equivalent to the amount owed. Method two. The granting of centralized credits to end consumers to facilitate targeted payment for supplies along the entire production chain. Method three. The introduction into circulation of commercial promissory notes, which would signify a property liability for financial commitments assumed. Method four. A rigorous procedure for bankrupting enterprises which are not viable, are merely a drain on financial resources, and do not yield a return. Method five. Rigid taxation discipline, which ensures that the revenue sections of the budget are properly topped up. So, it seems, the premier's team has finally rolled up its sleeves. There is just one question here: Why has it taken so long? Let us recall that back on 23 February our newspaper published an extract from a memorandum of the Russian Federation President's Analytical Center dedicated to the problem of nonpayments. The center's recommendations are very close to the premier's proposals. Furthermore, in our view they include a number of additional measures not yet taken into account which would make it possible in principle to prevent similar crises in the future. Once again there is cause to blame the extremely complex social and political situation in the country, which is diverting the government from the solution of the most urgent problems.
