Such authority would forbid congressional amendments when considering agreement ratification. The White House was given this authority during the global trade talks which concluded last month. Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, hinted today that the administration would seek the same authority when, for example, considering an expansion of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). "It is critical for negotiators for the U.S. to have fast track authority if we're going to reach the kind of agreements that congress has to ratify," Kantor said. Some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Chile and Argentina, are making efforts to join NAFTA, now the world's largest free trade zone in terms of territory, comprising the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Speaking at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kantor said the administration might also seek such authority when negotiating bilateral investment and intellectual property rights treaties.
