In January 1994 Defense Minister Pavel Grachev asked Boris Yeltsin to allocate 28 billion rubles to ensure the minimum improvement in the provision of housing for high-ranking Moscow officers and generals. Yeltsin instructed Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin to allocate the required amount. Chernomyrdin redirected the document to the Finance Ministry, which told the military 20 April 1994 that there is no money for housing. Under the Soviet authorities high-ranking servicemen waited for housing in the capital for two years at most. Now there are 102 generals and admirals alone in Moscow without housing. Russia-wide there are 169,700 officers without apartments.
