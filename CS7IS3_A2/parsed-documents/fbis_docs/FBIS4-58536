Though the strength of the prime minister in the government has increased, his position as party leader is gradually weakening. Recently, the prime minister himself violated his earlier pledge regarding maintaining a democratic structure in the party by dismissing the state committees of the party in 10 states with the stroke of a pen and installing selected people who are obedient to him in those states. Personal interests rather than political consideration always played a greater role both in making and in violating pledges. The main allegation against the Nehru-Gandhi family was that they did not care to abide by democratic norms while running the affairs of the party. They were competent in administering the party on an ad hoc basis. There has been no organizational elections of the party for at least 20 years. After Rao was nominated party leader and prime minister, he announced that if the party adopts the path of democratization through the holding of organizational elections then it would become difficult for the followers of Sonia [wife of late Rajiv Gandhi] to get the leadership of the party. With the passage of time, Rao has himself surrendered to the ruling family. It is significant to note that Rao held about an hour long face-to-face talks with Sonia before appointing the ad hoc committees of the Congress-I in 10 states. Party men have noticed that Sonia is gradually getting rid of her lack of interest in politics which she earlier displayed. The recent visit of Sonia to Andhra Pradesh, which is the constituency of Rao, her acceptance of an invitation extended by the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, to visit the state, and her later rejection of an invitation -- are all are quite significant. Under Rao, elections to the working committee of the Congress-I and also the organizations of the party throughout the country were held. Earlier the members of the working committee were nominated. Taking advantage of the elections, the groups opposed to Rao became active and became desperate to seize the control of the organization. After the election of the working committee, Rao identified the persons who posed a challenge to his authority. He then made influential leaders like Arjun Singh [Human Resources Development Minister] and Sharad Pawar [Maharashtra Chief Minister] resign from the working committee and inducted people nominated by him in their places. Apart from these minor strategies, Rao allowed the party to move in its own way. Then he became active to consolidate the seat of the prime minister by keeping his authority on his party firm. He also succeeded in establishing an absolute majority of his party in the Lok Sabha by creating divisions in different parties and winning them over to his party despite the existence of the Antidefection Law. After consolidating the seat of the prime minister and making it free from danger, Rao has now turned his attention toward the party organizations. He wants to make these organizations such that they will only carry out his orders. Rao is sparing no opportunity to embarrass and harass Arjun Singh and Sharad Pawar. This has been proved by the incidents that took place at a function held to pay homage to martyrs of the Jalianwalabag massacre [this massacre took place during the British rule]. At this function, the human resources development minister, Arjun Singh, was harassed, and Sharad Pawar was embarrassed over the issue of the illegal wealth of Dawood Ibrahim [underworld figure]. It appears from the last meeting of the working committee that the authority of Rao has been reestablished. The State Congress committees of Goa and Gujarat have entrusted Rao with the responsibility of nominating their leaders. This confidence in and allegiance to Rao may lead to autocracy. The failure of Rao to nominate the chief minister of Gujarat even in two months has created doubts whether he deserves the confidence that has been placed in him. In the last working committee meeting, at least five pro-democracy leaders viz. Arjun Singh, Balram Jakhar [agriculture minister], A.K. Anthony [civil supplies minister], Rajesh Pilot [state minister for home], and R.K. Dhawan raised objections to giving supreme power to Rao for reconstituting the working committee and the All India Congress Committee. At the end a compromise was reached that allowed Rao to reconstitute the party committees in the states and the organizations at the lower level. By exercising this power, Rao can keep the provincial leaders within his grip. The organizational success of Rao will depend on his efforts to suppress the powerful groups within the party. Apart from this, he needs to win over the people by his own charisma and also have a dependable group of followers. Until now Rao has failed to achieve any of these two objectives. This state of affairs has created a favorable situation for his sycophants like Pranab Mukherjee [commerce minister], Sidhartha Shankar Ray [Indian ambassador to U.S.] and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. Pranab Mukherjee is now showing as if the West Bengal State Congress Committee is within his pocket. At the same time he is studying the prospects of the reentry of Sidhartha Shankar Ray in the politics of the state. He is also keeping a watch whether Priyo Ranjan Das Munshi makes any sabotage. Priyo Ranjan is keen to get either the position of Soumen Mitra [leader of the West Bengal State Congress] or a post in the union cabinet. He is not willing to delay this special day celebration. Due to the pace at which Rao is proceeding, the confused and divided opposition cannot rule out the possibility of sudden elections in at least 10 states if not of the Lok Sabha. These states include Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Goa, Manipur, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Orissa, and Arunachal Pradesh. Rao has not taken up any political program or announced any slogan as a preparatory measure for the holding of elections in these states. The scope of preelection slogan talk has reduced in view of the current economic and political scenario at the national and international level. The days of cheap slogans and announcement of schemes are over. For these reasons, Rao has become more interested to use party organizations as a tool to win elections. With this end in view the process has started to nominate the right candidate, remove the dissidents, and to convert the party into a professional bureaucratic organization. Rajiv Gandhi also adopted the same techniques in the year 1989. Will Rao ultimately be able to control the impact of the GATT? Rao is now trying to run the party in the style set up by Indira and Rajiv. Until now he has failed to attain the command displayed by Indira or Rajiv. He has postponed for an indefinite period the organizational elections that were scheduled for this year. This time all appointments against party positions will be given on an ad hoc basis. Rao will perform this task with the assistance of different committees or observer groups. He will brief these committees or observers about the people liked and disliked by him. In the past this strategy or method failed to mobilize the internal strength of the Congress. Will it be different in the case of Rao? Or will he gradually hand over over his authority to No.10 Janapath [residence of Sonia Gandhi]? Rao has achieved some election successes in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. In these two states, Digvijay Singh and Vir Bhadra Singh have become chief ministers by defeating the leaders who had the blessings of Rao. In these two states the party organization has been resusticated to the grass-roots level. Party elections in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan has been set aside. In these areas, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, perhaps, Rao wants to nip in the bud the prospects of the growth of powerful leadership. The reverses suffered by his party in the elections held in these states has been seen by all. Here lies the danger of running the party on an ad hoc basis. The claims he can make regarding the successes of the government will perhaps not play a significant role in the contest during the elections. In that case his dream to lead the party during the next Lok Sabha elections may be shattered whether the elections is held on schedule in 1996 or earlier.
