He said in an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine that it was necessary to consider some provisions of the trilateral statement in the parliament. In his words, it was hard to understand "why primarily the SS-24 missiles controlled by us must be withdrawn from Ukrainian territory and not the obsolete SS-19 which we do not control and cannot launch." In his opinion, "it was necessary to demand the states-parties to the Helsinki, Paris, Vienna and Lisbon agreements and the UN member-states to participate in the agreement of the three presidents. It is necessary that not only Ukraine give up its missiles but that the other parties also reduce their numbers," Kotsuba pointed out.
