He made bellicose and absurd remarks at the meeting under the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue that strong steps should be taken to resolve the nuclear issue through UN sanctions, and that there is no other alternative but sanctions to resolve the issue. This shows that the South Korean puppets are pursuing what is called multinational sanctions against us with the backing of outside forces. Therefore, their acts are antinational criminal acts that can never be forgiven. Furthermore, the puppet clique is crying about the inevitability of sanctions against the same fellow countrymen at a time when the UN Security Council has recently issued an extravagant presidential statement against us and the United States and its followers have openly plotted to impose sanctions on us, thus making an issue of our Republic's peaceful use of nuclear energy. We cannot repress our rising indignation regarding this. As has already been reported, the U.S. warmongers have recently run amok with a commotion of military pressure against us, while openly babbling, under the pretext of our nuclear issue, that a preemptive strike [sonje konggyok] against North Korea remains an option. The U.S. imperialists have put their troops occupying South Korea on a 24-hour alert against us and, at the same time, have deployed the large aircraft carrier Independence to waters where it can participate within a few days in a operation of a northward invasion. Also, they have continued their warmanics by saying that they will change the location of the Rimpac war exercise to the waters off the East Sea of Korea. Several days ago, the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces occupying South Korea even conducted a so-called noncombatant evacuation operation in Pusan, which entails preparing select U.S. soldiers and their dependents for a quick departure from South Korea if an emergency situation occurs on the Korean peninsula. Such an act by the U.S. imperialists shows that they, by setting a northward invasion war as their goal, are more viciously sticking to commotions to crush [apsal] us. At this juncture, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is loudly babbling about so-called sanctions, playing into the hands of the U.S. imperialists, their masters. This clearly shows that the South Korean puppets -- who are thoroughly colonial servants -- as well as the antinational groups -- who are madly playing for the sake of the interests of outside forces -- are not considering the destiny of the nation. Actually, the South Korean puppets are running amok with war preparations to provoke a northward invasion war as demanded by their masters, the U.S. imperialists. Also, they are madly carrying out their fascist-oriented suppression -- which is their usual way [sangnye] to provoke the northward invasion war -- upon the reunification and democratic forces. They have inspired a war atmosphere by placing the puppet army on around-the-clock alert posture and, also, have attempted to suppress and exterminate the South Korean people's spirit for the anti-U.S., antigovernment, and antipuppet struggle, thus placing the police throughout South Korea under emergency duty orders and kicking up a commotion of check and search. The events now taking place in South Korea can only be seen as the eve of a war. These also vividly prove the South Korean puppets' attempt to push, without fail, our nation into the disaster of a nuclear war. The Kim Yong-sam groups, who commit criminal acts against the nation, should be sternly punished by the nation. We have urged the Kim Yong-sam group to immediately stop committing the criminal act of making the land of our fatherland become the place of outside forces' nuclear war, thus warning it as much as it can accept [padadulrilmankum kyonggo hamyoso] that the so-called sanctions, which the imperialists plan to impose under the pretext of the suspicion of our nonexistent nuclear development, mean a war, and that there is no charity [chabi] in war. The Kim Yong-sam group, however, held the National Security Council meeting by ignoring our warning and have brought about the black cloud of nuclear war, thus more loudly babbling about the sanctions. The Kim Yong-sam ring, treacherous group, who regards the interests of outside forces as more important than a warning from the same fellow countrymen, can never be safe. If the Kim Yong-sam ring wants to achieve their dirty political goal by carrying out sanctions in collusion with outside forces against the fellow countrymen, thus not considering the interests of the nation, it will be a big miscalculation. The Kim Yong-sam ring should be clearly aware that if they embark upon the road of adventure, their civil government will come to an end.
