The economics ministers of the CEFTA countries, Bela Kadar of Hungary, Leslaw Podkanski of Poland, Jan Ducky of Slovakia and the Czech Republic's Vladimir Dlouhy told journalists they attached great significance to the agreement. They stressed especially the fact that the changeover to liberalising Central European trade was occurring at a time when important trade agreements worldwide were being concluded, examples including the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Liberalisation will not apply to certain problem groups, particularly agriculture, they said. It will also proceed more slowly with a number of "sensitive goods," such as automobiles, textile and metals.
