However, downtown Mafikeng looked more like a business area than it has done since Wednesday with people, taxis and cars thronging in the streets. Station Street, the scene of most of the clashes between security forces and rioting civilians, resembled more than ever a country town on market day with the taxi rank full and people shopping. Most of the stores were open, including those cleaned out by looters, as mopping up operations after four days of violence seemed to have ended. The road between Mafikeng and the capital Mmabatho had heavy traffic flow in both directions and parking lots outside government and parastatal buildings in mmabatho were filled with cars. Most operations seemed to be returning to normal after the civil service strike. Full-scale cleaning up operations started in earnest at the extensively looted Mega City shopping complex adjacent to the government buildings, although none of the businesses there had any stock to count or sell. Flash point of the wave of unrest that rocked the fragmented homeland, the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation, also reopened on Monday. Corporation staff were back at work, clearing up broken glass and garbage spilt during a police routing of employees who occupied the building and effectively shut down the radio and television service for more than a week. Broadcasts will resume operations only on Tuesday. In spite of no broadcasts, the radio news room was a hive of activity.
