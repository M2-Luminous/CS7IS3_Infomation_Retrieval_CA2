According to the PLO, this diplomatic initiative cannot but concern negotiations taking place on the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Giuseppe De Carli reports: [De Carli] The PLO is asking the Vatican to set up a permanent bilateral commission to define relations between the Holy See and the Palestinian people, between the Catholic and Islamic communities in the Holy Land. The PLO delegation, led by Muhammad Zuhdi [Muhammad Zuhayr al-Nashashibi], Yasir 'Arafat's diplomatic adviser, was received this morning by Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the Holy See's foreign minister, and Claudio Maria Celli, his deputy. The Palestinians are also asking for an agreement similar to the 30 December 1993 agreement that ratified the formalization of relations between the Holy See and Israel and their mutual diplomatic recognition. There has still been no official PLO reaction to this agreement, but it has been judged premature and inopportune by some Palestinians in the occupied territories. However, it is noted that the Palestinian delegation has not come to Rome to protest, but to build a fuller relationship with the Vatican. At the center of the talks are ways to apply the agreement on Gaza and Jericho and, above all, the matter of the holy city of Jerusalem. The PLO delegation welcomed the request the pope made, during his address to the diplomatic corps, for a special statute for Jerusalem, a spiritual reference point for the believers of the three great monotheistic religions. A communique from the Vatican press office, released just a few minutes ago, said the meeting heralds the beginning of a more official dialogue between the Holy See and Palestinian representatives. Further, the PLO expressed its appreciation of the work carried out by the Catholic Church for peace and collaboration between all peoples in the region.
