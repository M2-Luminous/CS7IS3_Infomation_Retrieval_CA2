The arms industry in the European Union [EU] is to be linked more closely; armament efforts are to be harmonized. The ministry hopes to save money through joint procurement. A working paper of the ministry states that such an EU armament agency would make sense only if past and present national jurisdictions were relinquished. In the words of a spokesman, the paper reflects "initial thoughts" for negotiations in the "Western European Armament Group" of the Western European Union [WEU]. An EU armament agency with corresponding jurisdiction could possibly circumvent the restrictive German export regulations. However, on Tuesday [24 May] the Defense Ministry emphatically pointed out that the aim of the consultations is "not a loosening of arms export regulations." It is still completely open how a joint EU arms export policy is to be shaped. Negotiations in the WEU are to be concluded by fall. Since the Maastricht Treaty, the WEU is an "integral component of development in the EU" for defense policy questions. This subject is reserved for direct cooperation of the EU governments. In the view of the German Defense Ministry, the future EU armament agency is to be based on "close defense policy cooperation with France." This is to provide "the European armament integration process with the necessary dynamism." The paper states that EU members, which are seen to be hesitant on this issue, initially should not be integrated, since a minimal solution without relinquishment of national jurisdictions would promise little success. Evidently the Federal Defense Ministry assumes that Great Britain, with whom many cooperation agreements exist, is not willing to give up the ultimate national decision on questions of exports. The position paper, worked out in the Defense Ministry, proposes to amend Article 223 of the EC Treaty--which had not been changed by the Maastricht Treaty--during the revision of the Maastricht Treaty planned for 1996. With regard to present rules on competition, the article states that "each member state can take those measures which in its opinion are necessary to preserve its essential security interests, as regards the production of weapons, munitions, war materiel, or trade therewith...." The Defense Ministry now proposes that the armament agency advance the bundling of arms activities "through a mutual waiver by countries willing to integrate to cite Article 223 of the EC Treaty." The Defense Ministry paper also states that, by establishing a joint armament agency, jobs would have to be sacrificed. But the productive German arms industry "overall will emerge as a net gainer" from unimpeded competition.
