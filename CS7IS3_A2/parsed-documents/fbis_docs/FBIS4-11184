In London, Mauricio Toussaint Ribot, director of SEMIP hydrocarbon policies, said Mexico's production of liquid hydrocarbons, which was 3.131 million barrels a day in 1993, surpassed the all-time high reached in 1982 for the third consecutive year. A SEMIP communique stated that the Mexican official explained in London, before international experts, that of that amount, 1.794 million was for domestic consumption and 1.337 million for export. Toussaint Ribot said the increase in hydrocarbon reserves over the past three years allowed the country to replenish three quarters of its production, thus reversing a trend of several years. In the meeting where experts present their countries' hydrocarbon policies, he said 38 oil fields have been discovered in the past three years -- the same number discovered throughout the preceding six years. For this reason, he gave assurances that Mexican Petroleum [Pemex] will invest over $20 billion until the year 2000 to recover the cash flow that had diminished in the 1980's. Pemex currently invests $3 billion a year. He added that Mexico's policy allows it to become integrated into markets worldwide with its competitive oil industry, which can face the uncertainties of international markets and remain a dynamic factor in the national economy.
