BOFT officials attributed the surging deficit to the lessened competitiveness of made-in-Taiwan products on the European market. During the January-May period, Taiwan's exports to Europe totaled US$5.335 billion, a decline of 5.6 percent from the first five months of 1993. Imports totaled US$6.294 billion, an increase of 10.7 percent, the officials said. Among the European countries, Germany remained Taiwan's leading trade partner, accounting for 27.5 percent of Taiwan's total bilateral trade with Europe. Despite the gradually recovering economy in Europe, Taiwan's capital-intensive industries have had trouble penetrating the European market, an indication that industrial upgrading here has not yet helped the competitiveness of Taiwan products overseas. Taiwan's exports to Europe are mainly information products, electronic machinery components, bicycles, plastic products, and sports equipment.
