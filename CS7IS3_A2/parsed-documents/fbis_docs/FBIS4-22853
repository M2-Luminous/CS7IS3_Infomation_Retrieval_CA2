Yu. Katayev, A. A. Mitsel; UDC 517.518.8] [Abstract] Differentiation of an empirical function specified on a grid a=x[.sub]1[/]<x[.sub]2[/]<...<x[.sub]n[/]=b is incorrectly stated by its measured values f(x[.sub]i[/]), i=1,...,n. The incorrectness of the differentiation problem is related to violation of the third correctness condition according to Adamar - the stability condition. Several methods are used for the solution of this problem, including the Tikhonov method where the differentiation problem is reduced to the solution of the Fredholm equation of the first kind. With these methods a stable solution is numerically determined from the system of linear algebraic equations. An analytical solution of smoothing out and differentiation of empirical data is obtained in this paper and the results of numerical experiments are provided. References 10: 9 Russian. 1 Western.
