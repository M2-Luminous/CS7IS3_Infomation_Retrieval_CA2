Why Then Are We Striving, as Usual, to Let the West Take Them Over?''] [Text] There's talk going around about the slimming down of the Russian gold reserve. Be that as it may, it can be rather rapidly supplemented if the government would finally show some interest in the fate of our country's competitive technologies for the production of gold from its raw materials. Otherwise the know-how and inventions associated with them may become the booty of the nouveau riche and without hindrance will turn up abroad. The time has come to acknowledge that these technologies also constitute a ``gold reserve'' of Russia, strengthening its national economic security. It cannot be allowed that they share the fate of the nonferrous and rare metals which have floated abroad together with dollar earnings already exceeding 20 billion rubles. An obvious paradox of our time: the results of the scientific and technical activity of our country's scientists are being introduced in many regions of the world, but in Russia itself they either remain unused or are not used at the proper level. A fashionable variant of solution of economic, technical or other problems is becoming the turning sometimes not to the best, but only to foreign experience. The country may be seized by a sort of foreign far-sightedness in which we remain oblivious to our own scientific ``gold placers.'' In a letter to the editor from Valeriy Golovin, entitled ``Gold in Waste Heaps,'' published in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on 9 December 1993, he reported that the Mnogovershinnnyy Mineral Enrichment Combine in the Amur region when extracting gold and silver from ore on a regular basis dispatches to waste heaps up to 15% of the gold and up to 78% of the silver. As it was asserted in the publication, the lack of Russian technologies does not make possible the undertaking of any intensive exploitation of the Khakandzhin gold and silver deposit. The administration of Khabarovsk Kray links gold production plans for the immediate future only to reliance on the experience of foreign specialists. Thus, a formula for success in the economic rebirth of different regions in Russia, seemingly attainable only by the use of foreign technologies, is being defined. But, truly, such a point of view can scarcely be elevated to the rank of a state policy. However, only those who are wearing the blinds of pro-Western far-sightedness fail to note that foreign companies usually offer for sale technologies which, to put it mildly, are of no economic value for their own countries. However, the enormous interest which some foreign companies, unlike national producers, are manifesting in our competitive technologies, which in most cases until recently were kept completely secret, is logical. These technologies, understandably, can and must be an object of national pride, a truly golden Russian asset, the basis for the restoration of the national economy and civilized economic and scientific-technical cooperation with foreign countries. One such technology was developed under the direction of Academician Boris Laskorin. This is a sorption leaching technology for extracting gold and silver from ores, the so-called ``resin in pulp'' method. Due to its universality and high efficiency it became the basis for developing technological schemes for the reworking of raw material containing gold from different deposits in the former USSR. Here the experience of production workers and the knowledge of the inventors of the technology were brought together. Nowhere in the world is there raw material containing gold which is identical in its composition. And for this reason alone, even knowing the method itself, its optimum application is virtually impossible without the scientific-technical oversight of its inventors, a statement which can be made, however, relative to the use of any high technology. As is confirmed precisely by the situation prevailing at the Mnogovershinnyy Mineral Enrichment Combine, where the production workers through their own efforts probably could not accumulate that experience and knowledge which would be adequate for the optimum exploitation of the technology, which also evidently served as a reason for seeking assistance from abroad. The many years of experience in using this technology confirms its high productive indices. For example, at the Muruntau gold production enterprise in the Kyzylkum alone, where the base technology with the participation of the inventors of the method was introduced as early as 1968, up to 94% of the gold is being extracted, and this in a deposit with an extremely low gold content. For richer ores the percentage of gold extraction is usually still higher. In addition, a quarter century after its development the base technology is constantly being improved and has been perfected both in the laboratory and under commercial conditions at seven gold-producing enterprises in the former Soviet Union. The accumulated experience is unique and the new technological solutions are still protected as inventions. Precisely Russian gold technology has opened the way to the production of gold from deposits regarded as poor, unsuited for commercial exploitation. After reexamining the conditions of gold and silver minerals, with allowance for use of the Boris Laskorin technology, the confirmed geological reserves of ore in gold-bearing deposits for their input into the economic cycle of the country increase in many cases by a factor of 10-12. Such deposits can be exploited at once, leaving for future generations the richer strategic geological gold and silver reserves. Confirmation of the high competitiveness of our country's gold technology by foreign specialists became possible only after the stamp of secrecy was removed. The first publications on Russian technology for the complex reworking of gold-bearing raw material created broad interest throughout the world. When mineral exploiters became familiar with our method representatives of the leading companies of the gold-producing countries, that is, Great Britain, South Africa, United States, France and Brazil, as reported by Boris Laskorin, all gave the highest marks to the ``resin in pulp'' technology. To be sure, however, our know-how remained for them a commercial secret. In turn, as long as this Russian method remained a secret foreign specialists used a different technology -- the so-called ``charcoal in pulp'' method. A technical-economic comparison shows that the advantages of the ``resin in pulp'' method are indisputable in all respects: gold extraction is increased by 5-12%, the expenditure of costly reagents, the time required for processing the raw material, amount of engineering equipment and consumption of electric power are all reduced. The capital expenditures on the construction of a plant also are considerably lower. The leading gold producing companies in the world, being guided by the obvious economic advantages from use of the competitive Russian technology, are intelligently acquiring it, even giving up their own ambitions. Our technology, for example, already is being exploited by the British Lonro company in Zimbabwe; the national JCI company in South Africa also is close to this, in a contract with which the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation there is a provision for commercialization of the rights of the inventors of this technology as being intellectual property (know-how and inventions). A number of key gold producing companies of other foreign countries also are interested in economic cooperation and in these countries through the Soyuzpatent Patent Attorneys Association juridical protection of this technology is being ensured and the patent office in South Africa has issued a patent for it: a document giving exclusive rights to Russia in the territory of South Africa. It is possible, to be sure, not to analyze and not to take note of this problem, but simply put in the hands of the market economy, which sooner or later will put everything in its place. But, possibly it is necessary that the interested federal control agencies in the Russian Federation pay heed to the prevailing situation with the use of high competitive technologies both in Russia and in the CIS countries and attempt to organize such a state scientific-technical, economic (investment, tax) and juridical strategy for a breakthrough, the fundamental thesis of which should be the fact that the gold reserve of the country and competitive gold extraction technologies constitute an important factor in the economic rebirth of Russia and the preservation of its national economic security. A radical solution of this problem will serve as a basis for an attentive comparative analysis of that which is of value both in our country and abroad. It also probably can assist in extinguishing the Russian debt to foreign countries, which according to recent data exceeded the 60-billion dollar mark, not to mention the difficulties associated with debts within the country. But since debts must be paid off even today, a solution also must be found at once.
