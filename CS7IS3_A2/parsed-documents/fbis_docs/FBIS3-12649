[Ghawshah] Thank you. [Al-Jundi] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was not the first to be perpetrated against the Palestinians living under occupation. Following this massacre, numerous question marks hang over the peace process. What is the PLO's assessment of the peace operation after this incident? [Ghawshah] The crime against our kin in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was doubtless a turning point for the Palestinian people's progress and profoundly affected the peace process, especially as this bloody assault was not the first of its kind by extremist organizations and settlers. Our people have already been subjected to many similar assaults. Armed settlers have attacked our people, stormed houses, assaulted vehicles, and blocked roads while Israeli army and security personnel stood by and watched. Despite denunciations and petitions and discussions about settler issues, Rabin's government continued its policy of allowing settlers to walk around fully armed and attack Palestinians. Basically, we view this as a major incident affecting the peace operation and halting the talks. [Al-Jundi] Do you think this massacre will halt the peace process or only postpone it indefinitely? [Ghawshah] This depends on the conduct of Prime Minister Rabin and his government and the measures that will be adopted following the massacre. They must make a decision disarming all settlers. The Israeli Government has only decided to disarm some settlers. What also happened is that the Palestinians were prevented from laying their martyrs to rest. At the same time, the settlers continued to walk around fully armed, something that was relayed by television screens worldwide. We say: In light of the Rabin government's decisions and judging by how seriously it handles this issue and the peace process, we might decide to suspend the negotiations instead of halting them altogether. We have offered a lot to keep the peace process going. We are still saying that if earnest and effective decisions are made, primarily providing international protection for our people against assault, we might regard what is happening as a suspension of the talks, not an end to the peace process. [Al-Jundi] Following the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the international condemnation of it, observers have spoken about the peace process and the basis for negotiations. Regarding the Israeli settlements inside the Palestinian self-rule area, is there a specific strategy that the Palestinian side will follow in the coming phase? [Ghawshah] Since the Madrid conference, the PLO and its negotiating delegations have been reiterating that the settlements and the settlers constitute an obstacle to peace. In all the rounds of talks, the Palestinian delegations have been calling for the withdrawal of the settlers and the dismantling of the settlements. They have been calling for ending this phenomenon, which is considered to be a continuation of Israeli aggression and occupation. But because of particular factors and circumstances, the discussion of the final status of the settlements has been postponed. Now, after the massacre and after the world has realized that the main issue is not Israel's security, but the Palestinian people's security, it has become clear that these settlements are a threat and a powder keg. We stress the need to start a serious discussion of the status of these settlements. This is particularly so because Rabin has stressed that there are security settlements and political settlements. We believe some settlements can be dismantled while others can be put together pending their dismantling. This constitutes a guarantee for peace. But if Rabin and his government still insist on their stance, it means they are putting out obstacles. Thus, the peace process will remain threatened by this powder keg represented by the presence of the settlements and armed settlers.
