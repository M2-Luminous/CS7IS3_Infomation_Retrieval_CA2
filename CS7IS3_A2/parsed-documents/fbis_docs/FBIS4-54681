Journalist Marek Meissner writes that Polish Government officials privately complain that Poland is being singled out because it is more susceptible to U.S. pressure than other arms-exporting countries and that a cutoff of Polish military exports to Burma would only benefit the Polish defense industry's foreign competitors. Meissner notes that German, Portuguese, Korean, Chinese, and Indonesian companies are currently exporting military hardware to Burma. He alleges that even U.S. firms have sold "obsolescent" equipment to Burma. Meissner compares the current situation to an incident in 1991, when, as a result of U.S. pressure, Poland withdrew from negotiations with Burma for a contract to supply several dozen armed Mi-2 helicopters. The order subsequently went to China. Meissner adds that, since then, U.S.-made Bell Model 212 helicopters have been sold to Burma. Meissner also notes that the Polish Defense Ministry denies that any large-scale transfer of weapons to Burma is taking place. He quotes ministry spokesman Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki as saying that "none of the large companies such as Cenzin [a state-owned arms-trading company] deliver materiel to Burma." According to Rozbicki, what is at issue is "merely a small amount of military equipment sold by a small firm."
