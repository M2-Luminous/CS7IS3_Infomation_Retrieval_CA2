Sweden has troops there as part of a Nordic battalion, as well as observers. Speaking to the youth movement of his own Conservative Party, Bjorck said no nation would dream of sending 70,000 troops into the field without a modern, efficient command structure. He specifically called for a local commander able to make decisions in Bosnia under a mandate from the UN secretary general. The Swedish defense minister said the lack of a UN force in and around the safe haven of Gorazde is the reason for the catastrophe there. His words were echoed by Sweden's Armed Forces Commander in Chief Bengt Gustafsson.
