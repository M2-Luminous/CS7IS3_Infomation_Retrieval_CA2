Last Monday afternoon [21 March], in Turin, the League's leader was bombarded with telephone calls from Berlusconi, who was trying to soften his positions, but Bossi steered full steam ahead. Yesterday, in Novara, he said: "We have nothing in common with Berlusconi." In his TV appeal to voters, which had just been recorded, he made no concessions. His ideas are clear-cut: "There are those who do not want to change anything, namely the Left; those who want to change something, namely Forza Italia; and those who want to carry out a revolution, namely the League." In short, nothing has changed between the two halfhearted allies. To complicate matters even more, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] has been courting the bandwagon's [League nickname] colonels -- first and foremost Roberto Maroni [League lower house floor leader]. Maroni, have you received any offers from Forza Italia to change sides? "No explicit offers," Maroni replied. Bossi's "adopted son" (the nickname was coined by Bossi himself), who is also the League's number two, did not pull back, did not hide behind words or deny the allegations. No explicit advances were made, but advances were made at any rate. Maroni explained: "Suggestions were made. However, it was not Berlusconi who made them, but other people." And what did you reply? The League's "Doctor Subtle," who is notoriously a staunch Milan soccer team supporter, answered in jest: "Tell the Knight that, given that I am supporter of the Devil [Milan soccer team nickname], I will join him only if he obtains for me the number 10 jersey in the Milan team, the one worn by Savicevic. I would be happy to play at San Siro [stadium] just for 10 minutes." Maroni laughed and, in response to a journalist who cast doubts on the truthfulness of this reply to Berlusconi's overtures, he said: "This is exactly what I said. Why, do you find it unbelievable?" In short, feelers and offers have been put forward, and these were addressed not only to Maroni and [League's Milan Mayor] Formentini, but to many others too. Maroni then went on to repeat the recent jibe about Berlusconi's candidacy for the premiership: "If he fails to get elected in Rome, standing against such a nonentity as [Budget Minister] Spaventa, he will have to give up becoming prime minister." For weeks, League outgoing deputies and high-ranking officials have been bombarded with phone calls and even faxes inviting them to leave the Bandwagon and rally to Berlusconi's tricolor symbol. This has been a large-scale recruiting campaign, aimed at weakening the League and transforming it into a submissive spare tire of Berlusconi's project. This explains Bossi's campaign against Berlusconi, including the circulars, signed by the Bandwagon's leader, against conducting a common electoral campaign with Forza Italia. Maroni calmly explained: "A recruiting campaign? Of course. An avalanche of faxes. But those who received them, or who were made an offer, immediately reported them to us. This is how the League's supporters are -- in politics they follow their hearts, they are not interested in personal profit." Maroni was not unduly upset, he almost took for granted that the League's ally would wage this kind of offensive. "It is only natural. Berlusconi regards the League as one of his businesses, one among many. However, the League is a political movement which was built by its activists with their blood and tears. Within a company, officials can be turncoats, they can be bought, it is enough to offer them more, and they can also be fired on the spot. However, the League is not a company. We are not managers, we are political leaders who believe in federalism. Berlusconi's men are exclusively rational, calculating. We are emotive, personally committed. They believe the League's supporters can easily be won over by making rational offers, but we are not at all like this." What about those who have already changed sides, those who have joined National Alliance [AN]? Maroni gave a prompt reply: "Any party can be infiltrated by agents, but, you see, as far as they are concerned, no recruiting campaign was necessary. They were all ready to leave anyway." Senate floor leader Enrico Speroni, speaking from Rome, made the same point, though his tone was somewhat different: "Opportunists and venomous snakes are well advised to leave," he said, commenting on the departure of a number of former deputies, town councilors, and party officials, who followed Fini's [secretary of the Italian Social Movement, MSI] call. Speroni also had some cutting remarks in store for Senator Gianfranco Miglio, the independent League supporter and theoretician of a bandwagon moving steadily toward secession. In fact, in a recent interview Miglio was self-critical: "The alliance with Berlusconi was a mistake. I was in favor of it, but today I must recognize that it would have been better to go into the elections on our own." However, arguing against professor Miglio, who believes that many former League supporters will vote tomorrow for National Alliance, Speroni said: "Those who chose the League did so because they believe in federalism. Therefore they can join anybody they like, but certainly not the statist and centralist MSI. These guys really understand nothing at all." For his part Maroni, addressing AN, made a mock overture: "If Fini accepts federalism, then we can talk, but in order to do so he will have to disown 40 years of his past, and all the days spent on his electoral campaign, his speeches, and his statements."
