[Al-Tibi] We are here in Vienna, both Israelis and Palestinians, at the invitation of the Bruno-Kreisky-Forum to negotiate the touchy issue of the final status, which means the issues of Jerusalem, the settlements, refugees, the right to return, borders, etc. These are the most difficult issues. I can tell you that the first day has already brought very productive and constructive discussions, particularly on the issues of refugees and the return of refugees. [Hochner] Mr. Katz, Jerusalem has always been an integral part of Israel, the capital of Israel for the Israeli Government. [Katz] I hope that Jerusalem remains united and under Israeli sovereignty. Yet, this is one of the controversial, sensitive issues. Of course, we are discussing this issue, too, as well as other issues that create difficulties for the Palestinians. This is in the very nature of mutual talks. We must also discuss controversial issues, because otherwise, we will not reach an agreement. [Hochner] One of the controversial issues is the settlements on the West Bank. Can you see Israel one day giving up these settlements to exchange peace for land here, too? [Katz] I believe we can convince the settlers that it is worthwhile to leave this area and move behind the green line in order to create a good atmosphere. I think we can convince them by starting a new Zionist movement. I think we can convince them to leave those areas. I hope we will achieve this by convincing them and not by forcing them. I am sure we can overcome this problem. I do not think the settlements will remain where they are now, at least not all of them. Maybe there are some strategic points, such as the Jordan Valley, where the settlers can remain and should remain. Yet, settlers who live near Arab municipalities with Palestinian inhabitants should leave these areas and move behind the green line. I hope they will move to Galilee and the Negev, thus strengthening the State of Israel. [Hochner] Mr. al-Tibi, a lot will depend on whether the PLO manages to get the security situation on the Gaza Strip and in Jericho under control. What danger do you see, or how much rivalry from fundamentalist Hamas? [Al-Tibi] You know, it is legitimate to have opposition, democratic opposition. There are Palestinians who do not support this agreement, although the great majority of Palestinian people support the peaceful settlements and the Gaza-Jericho agreement. However, the Palestinian people also want to see tangible achievements. The most important factors for the success of this agreement are the development of the infrastructure, the creation of new jobs to eliminate high unemployment on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, and the financial support by the World Bank, the European Union, and the Arab world. I hope that part of the Islamic movement will participate in the government in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. They can even participate in the elections scheduled for next year. [Hochner] Mr. Katz, the objective of the Palestinians is clear: a state of their own. Is that conceivable for Israel, and, as with the question of Jerusalem, when do you think that Israel will feel safe enough to grant the Palestinians this state next to Israel? [Katz] I belong to a minority in my party. I believe that an independent Palestinian state would be something useful for Israel, for Israel's security. I think it is up to the Palestinians to take a decision on a safe future. I think that if we offer them the opportunity to create an independent Palestinian state, it will increase their sense of responsibility for what is going on there. [Hochner] Mr. al-Tibi, the Palestinians have political expectations as well as political ones; certainly expectations for an independent state and not just the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. When do you think the PLO will get this independent state, by what time does it want to have it? [Al-Tibi] Under the agreement, the final solution regarding the status should be discussed at the beginning of the third year at the latest. However, we hope that official talks on the final status will begin as soon as possible. I think that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will naturally lead to an independent Palestinian state according to the developments in the area. First, because the Palestinians are seeking self-determination and an independent state. Second, I think that even in the Israeli cabinet, a majority of ministers supports the idea of an independent Palestinian state. I think that the whole thing might take place before the conclusion of the fifth year of the interim stage. [Hochner] Thank you very much, Mr. Katz and Mr. al-Tibi.
