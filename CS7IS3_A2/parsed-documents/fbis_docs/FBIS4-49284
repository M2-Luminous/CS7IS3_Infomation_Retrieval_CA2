Twenty-five discipline inspection commission members attended the meeting. Attending as observers were persons in charge of the discipline inspection organs of various localities, cities, counties (districts), units directly under the province, universities, and large-sized enterprises and institutions. The plenary session, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, revolved around the party's tasks of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability; conveyed the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection; reviewed and summed up anticorruption fight across Anhui since 1993, especially the second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection; exchanged the experience in anticorruption fight; and made arrangements for anticorruption tasks in 1994. The plenary session deliberated and approved a report "Launching the Deep-Going Anticorruption Fight So As To Serve Anhui's Reform, Development, and Stability" by Chen Guanglin, secretary of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission, on behalf of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission Standing Committee. Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC Commission, delivered an important speech at the meeting. The session held that comrade Lu Rongjing's speech and Comrade Chen Guanglin's report earnestly implemented the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection; analyzed Anhui's anticorruption fight in a seeking-truth-from-facts manner; summed up the experience of anticorruption fight in 1993; and clearly defined the tasks of the anticorruption fight in 1994. The session called on party organizations at all levels across Anhui to earnestly organize the broad ranks of party members and cadres to study the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ninth Plenary Session of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission; to further reach a unity of thinking and understanding; to meet the demands of the central authorities and the provincial party committee; to strengthen flesh-and-blood ties with the masses of the people; to adopt effective measures; and continue to carry out the deep-going anticorruption fight. Last year was a year witnessing rapid progress in reform, opening up, and economic development in Anhui, as well as major breakthroughs in the anticorruption fight. Party organizations, governments, and discipline inspection organs at all levels across Anhui firmly carried out the party's basic line; and, based on the arrangements of the central authorities and the Anhui provincial party committee, closely revolved around the pivotal task of economic development, led the broad ranks of party members, cadres, and the people to launch a broad and deep-going anticorruption fight, and accomplished many tasks. Generally speaking, the anticorruption fight across Anhui was good and its development was healthy. To a varying extent, we scored some results in carrying out the three tasks put forward by the central authorities and basically met the demands of the central authorities and the Anhui provincial party committee. Remarkable results were scored in areas and departments where good work was done. All of these made positive contributions to maintaining political stability, promoting reform, opening up, and economic development in Anhui, as well as ensuring the implementation of the macroeconomic regulation and control in Anhui. The session held that we should fully affirm the progress and results achieved in the anticorruption fight at an earlier stage; however, we must address the issue of the unbalanced progress of Anhui's anticorruption fight. Some results are not solid, and some deep-rooted problems have yet to be resolved. We still face a grim situation in the anticorruption fight. This is a very formidable task that needs persistent arduous efforts and allows no laxity. In last year's anticorruption fight, various localities and departments thoroughly implemented the central authorities' arrangements, policies, and principles regarding the launching of the anticorruption fight and accumulated a great deal of experience. These experiences are mainly as follows: 1) to accord with the tasks of the central authorities and the Anhui provincial party committee, closely integrate reform, opening up, and economic development with the anticorruption fight, and ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the Anhui economy; 2) to adhere to the principle of "firmly grasping two links at the same time" and truly take the responsibility of leading the anticorruption fight; 3) to fully mobilize the masses and rely on them to fight corruption; 4) to attach importance to doing a good job at every stage and concentrate efforts on management over special projects; 5) to strengthen leadership over investigation and handling of cases and make efforts toward solving major cases; and 6) to give full play to responsible institutions' functions and form joint forces to fight corruption. These experiences should be applied to guide the future anticorruption fight and improved in practice. The session pointed out: In accordance with the arrangements of the central authorities and the Anhui provincial party committee, the general requirement of this year's anticorruption fight is to adhere to taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance; to thoroughly implement guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, and the 10th Plenary Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial CPC Committee in an all-round manner; to grasp the party's tasks; to closely revolve around the pivotal task of economic development; to adhere to the three anticorruption tasks; and, on the basis of consolidating achieved results, to continue to carry out effectively the deep-going and protracted anticorruption fight; and to serve Anhui's reform, development, and stability. First, we should continue to exercise strict supervision over leading cadres' honesty and discipline. Leading cadres of party and government organs at and above the county (section) level should strictly implement various regulations of the central authorities and the State Council regarding the strengthening of the construction of party work style and a clean government. We should continue to thoroughly implement the five-article regulations on honesty and discipline put forward by the central authorities last year. On this basis, we should firmly implement the five-article regulations put forward and reiterated by the central authorities this year: (1) It is not allowed to violate regulations to purchase and replace imported luxury cars; it is not allowed to abuse one's authority to change or borrow cars and extort funds for car buying from enterprises and subordinate units; it is not allowed to use loans, pooled funds, and funds for special projects to purchase cars for leading cadres. County (city) party and government organs and units that have not paid back workers' wages are not allowed to purchase cars. (2) It is not allowed to violate the State Council's regulations on the reform of the housing system to purchase homes at lower prices; it is not allowed to abuse one's authority to offer preferential conditions when purchasing homes for oneself, one's children, and relatives; it is not allowed to spend public funds on refurbishing individual's homes. (3) On their domestic official business trips, leading cadres should travel with light luggage and few attendants and should not go beyond the local standards for room and board. It is not allowed to host special dance parties for leading cadres. (4) It is not allowed to turn events into big extravaganzas, in the name of weddings, funerals, post transfers, birthdays, or house-warming. It is, especially, not allowed to spend public funds and property on hosting such events and to take the opportunity to accumulate wealth. (5) It is not allowed to abuse one's authority to delay paying back public funds; it is not allowed to borrow public funds for purchasing homes for oneself and one's relatives and friends, to build private houses, and engage in profit-earning activities. In accordance with the guidelines of the central authorities' regulations, we should, in the light of Anhui's reality, include the correcting of party and government organs that violate regulations to spend public funds on installing telephones in their homes into the contents on cadres' honesty and discipline; and implement this together with the central authorities' five-article regulations. Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions and those of party and government organs at and above county (section) level also should implement the regulations on honesty and discipline; oppose such corrupt phenomena as abusing power for personal gain, embezzlement, taking bribes, and extravagance. Second, we should continue to do a good job in investigating and handling major cases. We should focus on the investigation and handling of law- and discipline-violating cases of leading party and government organs and cadres, judicial departments, administrative law-enforcement departments, economic administrative departments, and their staff members; and concentrate our efforts on the investigation and handling of major cases. We should emphasize the investigation and handling of cases that involve leading cadres embezzling funds, taking bribes, and abusing power for personal gain; cases that involve law- and discipline-enforcement personnel practicing favoritism and engaging in malpractice, perverting justice for bribes, violating the law when enforcing laws, and violating discipline when enforcing discipline; and cases that involve legal bodies violating the law and discipline. We should select typical cases to make public to the masses and improve the social effects of the handling of cases. Third, we must continue to stop unhealthy tendencies. (1) We must continue to firmly stop unwarranted levies, and place emphasis on intensifying supervision and inspection, making sure that rules are strictly followed. Efforts must be made to deal with noncompensatory use of enterprises' vehicles, computers, and telecommunications equipment by party and government organs, or their personnel, through abusing their authority; as well as the problem involving the use of various names to appropriate enterprises' funds for creating "small coffers" for organs, or using appropriated funds for projects benefiting staff workers. The unhealthy tendency of soliciting financial support from enterprises under all sorts of excuses must stop. Efforts to alleviate peasants' burdens must continue. The central government's regulations on separating the collection and use of administrative levies and fines must be firmly followed, and specific measures must be drawn up for implementing these regulations. (2) The "small coffers" of party and government organs, administrative organs, and institutions must be screened. (3) Continual efforts must be made to stop the unhealthy trend of using public funds for travelling abroad or in other parts of the country. To safeguard the solemnity of political discipline and ensure the implementation of government orders, discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all levels must, while carrying out these three anticorruption projects, intensify their supervision over law enforcement and the implementation of democratic centralism, focusing attention on the implementation of all major decisions and measures of the party Central Committee, the State Council, the provincial party committee, and the provincial government on deepening reforms, developing the economy, and maintaining stability. This year is an important year for implementing the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the 10th Plenary Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial Party Committee; an important year for Anhui to achieve a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; and an important year for restructuring the economic system. While reform, development, and stability are arduous tasks, so is the anticorruption struggle. The plenary session urges all party committees and governments to properly handle the relations between reform, development, stability, and the anticorruption struggle; firmly uphold the policy of promoting material civilization and socialist ethics at the same time; and regard the anticorruption struggle as part of the scheme of overall importance. We must mobilize all party members to wage the fight, party organs and government departments must join forces, and each and every organ and department has to responsibilities to fulfill. The fight against corruption must be closely coordinated with efforts to improve party conduct and work ethics, party members and cadres must be regularly educated to be mindful of their conduct and work ethics, rules and regulations governing party conduct should be drawn up, and the work ethics-related legislation must be expedited, so that the root causes and the symptoms can be dealt with at the same time. Party and government leaders at all levels must set examples with their personal deeds. They must take the lead in implementing the Central Committee's regulations and requirements for fighting corruption and promoting work ethics, earnestly intensify supervision over the anticorruption struggle, and render assistance in doing away with interference and in dealing with thorny problems. Anticorruption propaganda must be further intensified and a good environment for the media to join in the fight against corruption should be created. To keep pace with the anticorruption drive, discipline inspection and supervisory organs must be even stronger. As advisors and important assistants to party committees and governments in improving party conduct and work ethics, discipline inspection and supervisory organs play the role of organizing, coordinating, and guiding the struggle. Cadres, especially leading cadres, of all discipline inspection and supervisory organs must earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study the unabridged version in the light of the actual state of affairs, and use the guidelines to guide their work. Leading bodies of all discipline inspection commissions must abide by the party principle for democratic centralism, exercise collective leadership and share responsibilities, work with greater unity and coordination, and do their jobs with concerted efforts. We must sum up experiences of improving efficiency by merging offices, and continue to streamline our organization, organs, operations, and operating procedures so that each organ will have two different functions. All organs must intensify their ideological and operational construction. They must educate their cadres to uphold the concept of taking overall interests into account and guide their cadres to study the market economy so that they can do their jobs more efficiently. Organs must also intensify investigation and study and do their jobs creatively. The plenary session believes that, as long as party committees and governments at all levels firmly implement the decisions of the Central Committee and the provincial party committee on fighting corruption, have a consensus of view, earnestly strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the masses to follow through with the project, this year's anticorruption drive certainly will achieve new success.
