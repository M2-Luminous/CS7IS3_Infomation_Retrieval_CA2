This is where the similarity ends. Today who in our country, destroyed as it has been by "perestroykas" and tormented by "reform," can guarantee that a political diet will create the climate of unity which, in the opinion of the people who have drawn up the "treaty," is all that the country lacks to complete "reforms"? The word "overcome" predominates in the terminology used by the "great Yeltsin." Semantics reflects his approach: Now that everything has been overcome in the country and a total -- economic, ideological, and political -- deadlock has been reached, the team of "reformers" are asking for a respite. It is hard to destroy things even in such a huge country as ours. Moreover, once again they are doing things their way, twisting the arm of everyone in succession -- political leaders, deputies, trade unions, and the hungry, embittered people. The concept of a "treaty" requires the interests of all sides to be taken into consideration, while what B.N.'s team is proposing is called capitulation. They are once again trying to upset everything, once again speculating on the "people's needs." But the people need the team of "reformers" to stop mocking the country, it is they who have to surrender. That is what they are doing, but at our expense. Why should we voluntarily deprive ourselves of political activity for a whole two years when we already lack premises, vehicles, communications, and access to television and radio? Despoiled and without rights we are being deprived of the last, virtually imaginary chance of defending our voters' rights. Why should Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov lose prestige? Do they want the false mass media which no one in the country has trusted for a long time now? Should the wave of anger that is threatening to sweep everything aside really be stopped? Even without the "treaty" one of them will occupy the president's post. Might the "treaty" allow the development of the shattered military-industrial complex, stop the slump, improve the economy, and revive the agricultural sector? No. This marks a breathing space before the country is decisively finished off, an attempt to avoid the storm that will sweep aside the regime. They are unable to introduce a state of emergency regime in proper form, it is therefore being introduced under a different banner, in essence. That is the tactic of fighting on two fronts -- fighting the growing political opposition bloc on the one hand and the spontaneous protest of the masses on the other. The protest must be deprived of a leader and personalities and rendered chaotic. It must be discredited by being criminalized in the eyes of society. That is why the Duma has been harassed for four months: It had to be rendered compliant and tractable. It is meanwhile being said that horse trading is inappropriate and that what is at issue is national calm. It is not only appropriate and essential, since we are not just talking about the people's calm, but ours as well, Ladies and Gentlemen, and the people are already fed up with the graveyard calm. Nor will a change of leaders stop this: Deprived of one set of leaders they will soon find others who are more decisive and more radical. In fact the "treaty" boils down to exacerbating the situation, to an attempt to transfer the country's political life to a criminal development scenario since a person can affect the situation in society either politically or criminally and, robbed of political levers, resorts to illegal ones. We think that the quest for social peace is extremely necessary but that Yeltsin's team should conduct that quest in a real rather than an imaginary political area, honestly, without guile and without shirking. And, who can say, without their leader perhaps. Especially since many people have already realized this and drawn the right conclusions. We think that fulfillment of the following terms constitutes the social base of a political partnership for signing this "treaty": 1. The return to the State Duma of all the former Supreme Soviet property and all its rights for deputies' full four-year term. The creation of conditions for deputies to take a real part in public life. 2. An end to mass media persecution of all opposition leaders and equal access to radio and television. The opening of banned patriotic press publications. 3. The replacement of the people's most hated ministers with the political leaders of parliamentary factions and the creation of a coalition government of people's confidence. 4. Early presidential elections. On those terms alone can society arrive at civil peace. Those conditions alone can guarantee calm for the team that has crippled the country. It has no choice: All other options will inevitably bring about civil war and the total annihilation of antipeople forces. Political struggle is a normal civilized form of struggle, so better that than the chaos of all-out, ungovernable fratricide that this "treaty" will inevitably bring about. The situation in the country can only be changed once there has been a change of "reform" course and in the attitude toward political opponents. There is no other way. After reading out his statement from the rostrum, Deputy Ivanov said indignantly that when it was being xeroxed certain "voluntary censors" had noticeably cut it.
