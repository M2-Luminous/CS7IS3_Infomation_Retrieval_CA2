Pakistan's nuclear program has been suspended since July 1990; however, as to the question of it being rolled back, Pakistan will not do so unilaterally. We have told our American friends not to punish us under the Pressler Amendment, because this will not help limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This issue cannot be resolved when India learns that only Pakistan will be punished, and that it will not. The United States should understand that the present attitude toward Pakistan is extreme in nature, that it must be changed, and that it is not meeting its goal of stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons this way. Our differences with the United States over Pakistan's nuclear program are very old. During Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's time, the United States had opposed when Pakistan had signed an agreement with France to purchase a nuclear reprocessing plant. Then U. S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger threatened Pakistan that if it did not abandon its nuclear program, "it would be punished in such a way that it would be a lesson to all other countries." Mr. Bhutto's supporters say that he took a great risk and continued the program, and that he was dismissed and later hanged as punishment. General Ziaul Haq continued this program; however, because of the Afghanistan situation, the United States did not object. When the Afghanistan war was over, the United States intensified its objections again, and, finally, in October 1990 it stopped all military and economic aid to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment. At present, Pakistan is trying to explain to the United States of America that the unilateral implementation of the Pressler Amendment is not helping it achieve its goal of stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Asia, and that it should review this legislation again. Many informed American experts have also admitted that the Pressler Amendment has not helped in the attainment of the goals it was supposed to reach, and that there is no use in retaining it. However, the U. S. government has not agreed to review this legislation. Since the establishment of Benazir Bhutto's government, she has tried to convince the United States that its policy on nuclear weapons in South Asia is incorrect. Ms. Robin Raphael, assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, has also been informed of Pakistan's position on it. Madam Bhutto has explained Pakistan's stand again. As the prime minister has said, Pakistan has proposed different strategies to limit the spread of nuclear weapons in South Asia. Because of a lack of cooperation from India, however, none of these could be implemented. If the United States really wants to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Asia, then, instead of putting pressure on Pakistan only, it should pressure both countries equally. Its present policy is resulting in an increased nuclear race in this region. It should realize the importance of Pakistan's positive and proper stand, and should be willing to review its decision to stop aid to Pakistan. Mian Nawaz Sharif, leader of the opposition, has said that Madam Bhutto froze the nuclear program in July 1990, and has admitted that it was frozen during her administration. Thus, she had proven herself to be an enemy of her own country. The inference that Mr. Sharif has made from Madam Bhutto's statement is a very strong and unreasonable one. However, Madam Bhutto should also clarify her statement; if the program was frozen in July 1990, then who ordered it? Was this decision made with her knowledge, while she was the prime minister? Similarly, Mr. Sharif should also make it clear why, during his 30-month prime ministership, he did not try to correct this decision, and why he did not reactivate that program. It is said that, during Mr. Sharif's rule, the Senate chairman, during his trip to the United States of America, assured the American authorities that Pakistan's nuclear program was frozen and had been stopped where it was. If this information is correct, then it should also be explained. We request that both leaders, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and opposition leader Mr. Sharif, to stop issuing statements about Pakistan's nuclear program just to hurt each other's position. It would be wise not to make this issue a political football. This program is related to our national defense, and political motives should not be given priority over our national interests.
