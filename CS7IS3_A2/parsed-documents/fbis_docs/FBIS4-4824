In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which is based on collectivism all the members of society devote their all for the country and people, the society and collective in a large harmonious family. Some time ago, Yim Kwang-chol, a soldier of the Korean People's Army, covered a handgrenade with his body on the point of its explosion, saving several dozen comrades at the cost of his youthful life. A coal miner Kim Kwang-ho threw himself under a coal car rolling down at breakneck speed to save more than sixty fellow workers and a schoolmistress Hwang Kil-yon died after saving children from drowning. They were honest persons of the times who dedicated their lives to the society, collective and comrades. It is not uncommon that men and women become parents of orphans and sons and daughters of old folks with no one to support them and looked after them like Yu Chong-sil living in Haeju and Choe Hye- yong living in Pyongyang. Countless are stories about beautiful deeds of working people. To cite a few examples, Kim Yong-hui, a nurse at the Kim Man-yu Hospital, donated her cornea to a blind man to give him sight, and many medical workers donated their blood, flesh and bones without hesitation to save critical cases, and train conductresses Kwon Chong-hui and Pak Sun-yo found a brief-case containing more than 200,000 U.S. dollars and bank notes and returned it to its owner, Hatsushi Akirashi, sales director of the Nippon Union Air Service Company, Ltd. But in South Korea, egoistic mode of life is prevalent in the society where the people think of only money, owing to the infiltration of the American way of life and the anti- popular policy pursued by the authorities. A girl O Chong-hwa in Chinju, South Kyongsang Province, stabbed her mother to death for money and valuables, a young man in Iri, North Cholla Province, knocked down his father before rushing to a bank and Ho Nam-kil murdered his son with a dagger in Puchon, Kyonggi Province. Such crimes are reported every day. Yi Chong-in in Yongdungpo-tong, Seoul, strangled his old parents, saying they were burdensome, profiteers of the Kuro Hospital attached to the Korea University threw away a moribund patient on to the street when he, without a guardian, could not pay the doctor's fee and young men and women killed their girlfriends or boyfriends for a few dollars. The South Korean ruling quarters, far from protecting the orphans, sell them off to other countries to gain foreign currency. The exported children average four thousand annually. To the astonishment of the people, wives of the privileged quarters form "gambling gangs playing for heavy stakes running into hundreds of millions of won," and unhesitatingly commit crimes, travelling everywhere. If such vices are to be cleared away, the working people must become the master of the country.
