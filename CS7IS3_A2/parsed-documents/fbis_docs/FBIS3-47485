The vote in the committee was 12 for and 12 against, and the motion was carried with Akira Omori, the committee chairman, exercising his casting vote. The public hearing, to be held in Tokyo, is a prerequisite to putting the bills to a vote in an upper house plenary session. The bills are aimed at revamping the electoral system for the House of Representatives and tightening political fund-raising controls. The upper house's Special Committee on Political Reform voted Monday to set the date for the public hearing for January 17. The reform bills cleared the more powerful lower house on November 18 but have become bogged down in the upper house in the face of stiff opposition from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to pass the package during the current Diet session, which expires January 29. Several upper house members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], one of the ruling coalition parties, have expressed opposition to the bills and could vote against them or abstain. In the upper house, the ruling coalition has 131 seats, the LDP 99, the JCP 11, the Niin Club five, and independents five. At a session of the special committee Thursday, the JCP submitted a motion demanding the coalition let Hosokawa's former political funds manager Masatoshi Miyama testify before the Diet as a sworn witness. The JCP wants Miyama to testify about 100 million yen Hosokawa said he received as a loan from the scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin trucking group and later paid back.
