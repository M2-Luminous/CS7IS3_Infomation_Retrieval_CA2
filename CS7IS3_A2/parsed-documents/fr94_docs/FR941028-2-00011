Evaluation of Applicant Institution's Commitment to Program Goals (35%): Includes, but is not limited to, evaluation of the following: Institution's focus on AMO physics; overlap between research interests of the institution and NIST; emphasis on undergraduate hands-on research; undergraduate participation in research conferences/programs; on-campus research facilities; involvement in systemic reform at the undergraduate level; past participation by students/institution in such programs; and commitment to educate women/minorities, and persons with disabilities. Evaluation of Applicant Institution's Cost Sharing (30%): In the spirit of a true partnership, successful applicants will be encouraged to contribute matching funds. A suggested level of participation would be to directly cover student travel (one round trip by common carrier) and housing costs (approximately $1200); a higher level of participation, such as partial payment of the student's stipend, stated intent to support the participating students at a research conference, and/or awarding of academic credit, will be given extra merit in the evaluation process. Award decisions shall be based upon total evaluation score. Award Period The 1995 Physics Laboratory SURFing Partnership is anticipated to run between May 29 through August 18, 1995; adjustments may be made to accommodate specific academic schedules (e.g., running from May 15 through August 4, of awarding a limited number of 10-week cooperative agreements).
