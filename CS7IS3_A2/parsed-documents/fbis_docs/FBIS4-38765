In his address to the Ukrainian parliament on the situation in the Crimea on Wednesday, Kravchuk said that "we must not demand that Russia immediately withdraw its ships from Sevastopol. This would be wrong from the strategic point of view in the first place." Ukraine cannot ban Russia from keeping a navy force in the Black Sea. History has bound Russia and Ukraine to live in peace and friendship and be equal partners, Kravchuk said. He added that the question of the fleet is the "question of Ukraine and Russia." He stressed that it must be solved gradually, without causing the situation to worsen. He agreed that the fleet should be divided and based in different places, but stressed the need to determine the status of the Russian part of the fleet which will be located in Ukraine. Ukraine is seeking to find such a solution which would "meet the national interests and take into account Russia's security needs in the south," Kravchuk said. He noted that in the future Russia will have to set up a navy base on its own territory. The Ukrainian leader emphasised that after the recent talks in Moscow between the Russian and Ukrainian official delegations "some details of the agreements on the fleet are beginning to take shape." He said that the talks will resume in the near future. Kravchuk stressed that the Crimean issue is vital not only for Ukraine and the Crimea, but also "all European states and the world community."
