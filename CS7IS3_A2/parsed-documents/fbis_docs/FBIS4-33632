Ortega PA0906045094 Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 7 Jun 94 p 4 PA0906045094 Managua BARRICADA Spanish BFN [Letter of congratulations from Cuban President Fidel Castro to Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the Nicaraguan Sandinist National Liberation Front, FSLN, dated 24 May] [Text] Havana, 24 May 1994, 36th year of the revolution. Comrade Daniel Ortega Saavedra Secretary General Sandinist National Liberation Front Dear Daniel: Allow me to express my most fraternal congratulations for your recent election as FSLN secretary general. The special congress that recently ended was, undoubtedly, an expression of maturity, particularly of the unity preserved by that political organization during the most difficult stages of struggle through which it has historically journeyed. That event blazes a path of hope for the organization in its continuous efforts to accomplish the objectives of genuine and full social justice, results to which it has committed decades of struggle, as well as the valuable blood of its martyrs. Under international circumstances as complex as the present, where a unipolar world under the hegemony of the United States has taken shape, the will, fortitude for struggle, and faith in the people's victory is tested. I would like to convey my congratulations to all the comrade delegates to the congress, the Sandinist Assembly, and the elected National Directorate. An embrace, [Signed] Fidel Castro Ruz.
