The survey was organized by the Chinese geological and mineral departments, which have since 1987 organized a series of explorations in the region, the overseas edition of PEOPLE'S DAILY said yesterday. Four exploratory missions conducted in the area by the surveying ships Haiyang-4 and Fengdou-4 have collected sea depth, gravity, and magnetic data in the Zengmu and Wanan basins of the Nansha Islands. In addition, the Nanhai Sea Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences also conducted geophysical explorations in the region. Last year, the Chinese scientists evaluated the six tectonic oil-bearing structures in the Wanan Basin, providing valuable data for further exploration of oil and gas resources in the area.
