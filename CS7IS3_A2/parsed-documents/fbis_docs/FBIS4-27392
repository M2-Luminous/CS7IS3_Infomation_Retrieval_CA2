In the beginning of this year, the government met with the chairmen of people's committees and people's councils to discuss the execution of these tasks. In providing guidance for the implementation of the National Assembly resolution, a working regulation for better coordination between the prime minister, National Assembly chairman, the chief justice of the Supreme People's Court, and chief of the Supreme People's Organ of Control was established by the National Assembly Standing Committee. Therefore, the investigation and dealing with all cases of violation and offenders have been proceeding at a faster pace. In 13 major legal cases in 1993 handled directly by the central organs, 12 cases have been tried. The government has also accelerated the changing and supplement of its regulations and policies, especially in dealing with construction investment, the establishing of state budget targets, and market management. Regarding anti-corruption work, the number of corruption cases discovered in the first four months of this year is less than that of the same period last year. However, corruption is still serious, and occurs mainly in the transferring and selling of houses and land, the spending and collection of state budget, the handling of money of state enterprises, the management of foreign aid, in the demand for bribes in the administration, in commodity control, and traffic control. The number of smuggling cases discovered and dealt with in the first four months of this year is three percent more than the same period last year with the value of confiscated goods at 25 percent more than that of last year. Cross border and airline smuggling cases have decreased but smuggling by the sea route has been increasing and is becoming more serious and complex. Noteworthy is the recent legalization and registration of illegally imported cars and motorcycles by some provinces after the collection of a small amount of tax. The government is investigating people's committees and related organs in these provinces. In the coming period, it is necessary to closely coordinate the execution of the National Assembly resolution with on-going programs for economic and administrative reform to cope with emerging phenomena and gradually solve fundamental issues relating to regulations and mechanism. The result of our efforts depends firstly on the responsibility and conscientiousness of heads of government organs from the central to grassroots levels and the role of all mass organizations in each locality. What is abnormal is that most of the corruption and smuggling cases have not been discovered by organs and units where the offenders used to work. Therefore, it is necessary to heighten the responsibility of party organs, government, and mass organizations in all sectors and echelons, beginning with the education and control of party members and cadres to uncover and deal with all cases of violation. The government also suggests that National Assembly deputies and National Assembly constituent groups strengthen their supervisory role in this task, especially in their working place and their constituents. The government welcomes the positive contribution of all mass media agencies in this fight. It is hoped that newspapers and radios will carry out more satisfactority their roles as defined by the Press Law. It is also hoped that they will also strive to overcome the shortcomings in their reporting, and thus contribute to further accelerating the movement to combine the voice of the press, public opinion, and the responsibility of state organs to increase the strength and efficiency of this struggle. Fifth, we must broaden and heighten the result of our scientific, educational, cultural, and social activities. In our striving to execute the 1994 program of actions for the successful implementation of the National Assembly resolution, all related sections must have better improvements, especially in the mountainous and isolated areas. For ethnic people, the economic issue is attached even more closely to the cultural and social aspects. The government funding for investment in mountainous and ethnic areas has clearly manifested that relationship. This funding must be used correctly and efficiently to create conditions that would allow the mountainous people to take advantage of their local situation to eliminate starvation, reduce poverty, gradually enrich themselves, improve their intelligence, and reduce disease and drug addiction. It is necessary to make preparations for the 1994-95 new school year while at the same time continuing to increase the number of students at all levels and create conditions for more children to attend school. Greater efforts are needed to improve the quality of education and training. Plans must be worked out to adjust the objectives of primary education and give general education school students more access to elective courses or subjects. Steps must be taken to renovate the contents of social science and humanities. Plans must be worked out to stabilize the organization and operations of the national university and the three newly established regional universities at an early date. Urgent measures are needed to prepare for the establishment of the Ho Chi Minh City National University. It is necessary to see to it that scientific and technological research contributes positively to the formulation of industrialization and modernization strategies and of sectorial or regional development projects, as well as to the assessment of the renovation process. It is important to see to it that scientific and technological research projects focus on targeted areas, be consistent with socioeconomic development projects, and yield practical results. It is necessary to uphold the sense of responsibility of state management agencies when it comes to technology imports assessment and inspection. It is important to implement the regulations on product quality, take measures against contraband, and enforce the law on environmental protection. Special efforts must be made to reduce pollution in the urban areas. Steps must be taken to improve the environment in the countryside. Regarding cultural and information services, the purposes of the three state-level programs are to renovate historical relics to prevent them from further deterioration, organize and promote cultural and information services at grassroots establishments and in the countryside, and consolidate and expand cinematography. It is necessary to link these three programs to diversified activities to mark major anniversaries, bearing in mind the need to make these activities attractive to broad sections of the population. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the overall quality of artistic programs and cultural products. Continued efforts are needed to gradually modernize radio and television networks and strengthen culture and art management through the law to ensure strict implementation of regulations and rules that are in effect. As far as public health care is concerned, efforts must be concentrated more on grassroots establishments. Measures must be taken to get rid of the situation in which medical care and treatment is nonexistent at certain villages. It is necessary to implement disease control and prevention programs satisfactorily, fight child malnutrition, and improve the quality of medical care and treatment. At the same time, it is necessary to adjust the system of hospital fees and medical insurance premiums, start the construction of two special medical centers in Hanoi Municipality and Ho Chi Minh City, formulate a national policy on medicine, perfect pharmaceutical development projects and medical equipment development projects, consolidate the management of state agencies over public healthcare provision, and enforce the regulations governing medical and pharmaceutical practices by the private sector. Prompt measures must be taken to expand the population activities and family planning network down to villages and wards and combine propaganda activities with efforts to broaden services, thus increasing the number of people who wish to adopt contraceptive methods to reduce the percentage of families with a third child. Regarding physical education and sports activities, it is necessary to pay due attention to the masses' movement, work out positive measures to build the contingent of athletes, and organize physical education and sports congresses at all levels in anticipation of the 1995 national physical education and sports congress. Vietnamese athletes must participate positively in international and regional contests and must improve their achievements, especially at the Asian Games scheduled for late 1994. It is necessary to enhance the results of social welfare programs, especially job development programs and hunger elimination and poverty reduction programs. Care must be given to children who have nobody to turn to in time of need. It is necessary to make preparations for the promulgation of the regulations on favors to be done to those who have rendered meritorious services. Adequate arrangements must be made to relocate the burial sites of fallen combatants. Plans must be worked out to maintain and expand the movement to show gratitude to those who have rendered meritorious services. Measures must be taken to implement programs to eliminate the evils of prostitution, drug addiction, and HIV infection, bearing in mind the need to guarantee close and uninterrupted direction of party committee echelons and administrative organs at all levels, especially at ward and village levels. It is necessary to secure routine and constant coordination among administrative organs, front organizations, and the mass media. It is necessary to attach due importance to educational activities and preventive measures in combination with necessary legal action.
