The oil field went into operation in 1960, and its output of crude oil has risen every year since. In 1976, annual crude oil output broke the 50-million-ton mark, and it has now been operating steadily for 18 years, having produced a cumulative total of over 1.22 billion tons of oil for China, setting a new world record of longevity for oil fields of its type throughout the world. Experts claim that Daqing is the world's largest terrigenous oil deposit, and has geological features very different from the world's major marine deposits which make it a difficult oil field to develop. Daqing oil field had, therefore, to make creative advancements in applying the water flood recovery method widely used around the world. Daqing employed a range of advanced technological measures to deal with its low-, medium-, and high-water stages and was able to effectively sustain a high and stable level of productivity. It is estimated that an annual crude output of 55 million tons can be maintained up to 1995, and a 50-million ton output level can be maintained until the year 2000.
