The details of withdrawal will be addressed in Washington next week, when the parties start discussing the fine print. [passage omitted] According to his meeting with al-Asad, President Clinton attributes much importance to holding the peace process in public -- because Israel's political structure is democratic. Clinton and the Americans believe it is important that the process is not held in back rooms, except of course for tactical issues and fine print matters. They want a public Syrian commitment to the peace process. They believe that yesterday, al-Asad made a giant step forward in this respect. Bilateral U.S.-Syrian issues were also broached by the two ministers yesterday. The most difficult of those issues is terror. President Clinton brought up the issue, and noted the fact that the rejectionist front organizations are located in Damascus. He heard al-Asad saying something like: What can I do about George Habash? I cannot dispel him. Israeli officials discerned a degree of urgency by the Syrian president, conveyed by the U.S. team. Al-Asad feels there is not much time and that peace should be completed before the end of 1994. These are the main points the Americans brought from the meeting President Clinton held with President al-Asad in Geneva.
