FR940706-0-00033 FR940706-0-00002 Requirements for parachute performance will ensure all of the following: (a) The parachute complies with the applicable section of TSO&hyph;C23c (SAE AS8015A) at the critical airplane weights. (b) The parachute deployment loads do not exceed the structural strength of the airplane. (c) The system will provide a ground impact that does not result in serious injury of the passengers. (d) The system will operate in adverse weather conditions. The requirements for the functions and operations of the parachute recovery system will ensure all of the following: (a) There is no fire hazard associated with the system. (b) The system has adequate reliability. (c) The sequence of arming and activating the system will prevent inadvertent deployment. (d) The system can be activated from either the pilot's or the copilot's position by various sized people. (e) The system will be labeled to show its identification function and operating limitations. (f) It must be shown that the occupants will be protected from serious injury after touchdown under various adverse weather conditions, including high winds. Requirements for protection of the parachute recovery system will ensure that the system is protected from deterioration due to weathering, corrosion, abrasion, and other causes; and that provisions are made to the parachute canister to provide adequate ventilation and drainage. Requirements for a system inspection provision will ensure that adequate means are available to permit examination of the parachute recovery system components and that instructions for continued airworthiness are provided. Requirements for operating limitations of the parachute recovery system will ensure that the system operating limitations are prescribed for inspection, repacking, and replacing the system's parachute deployment mechanism at approved intervals. Discussion of Comments Notice of Proposed Special Conditions, Docket No. 118CE, Notice No. 23&hyph;ACE&hyph;76 (59 FR 2786, January 19, 1994) proposed special conditions for small general aviation airplanes. The comment period for the notice closed March 21, 1994. Four comments were received from one commenter. All comments were concerning the flight portion of these special conditions. The commenter believes that the wording of the proposed special conditions indicates that flight test may be required for each make and model of aircraft for which the GARD system will be installed. The commenter does not believe this is necessary for airplanes with similar characteristics such as configuration, weight, and speed. To support this position, the commenter cites TSO&hyph;C23c for emergency personnel parachutes that are certified according to suspended weight and maximum allowable deployment speed. The commenter states that significant configuration changes would be low wing versus high wing or a change in the position of the parachute main attach point relative to the aircraft center of gravity. A significant change in airplane characteristics could be defined as any variation that could potentially cause the airplane to react to parachute deployment different from the original tests.
