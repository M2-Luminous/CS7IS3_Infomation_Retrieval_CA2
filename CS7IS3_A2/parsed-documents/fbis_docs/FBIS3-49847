In other words the DZVM, with its five deputies, will not enter a coalition with either the Socialist Party of Serbia or the opposition. To a suggestion that in this case neither side will have the necessary 126 votes in the republican parliament, Agaston said that "other solutions will have to be sought." The decision not to take part in the formation of a new republican government was adopted by the DZVM presidency last Saturday. [passage omitted]
