Before discussing the details of meetings Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias held at the U.S. State Department, I must say that the minister's scheduled meeting with Anthony Lake, the U.S. presidential adviser on national security issues, was canceled. The reason is that the U.S. National Security Council is conferring today after U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to escalate attacks against Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. So Lake probably had no time to meet Papoulias. The foreign minister went to the State Department at around 1030 to meet Warren Christopher, his counterpart; Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; and Matthew Nimetz, the U.S. presidential envoy to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM]. Answering a question before meeting Papoulias, Christopher said: The United States does not intend to ask Greece to lift the measures against Skopje unilaterally. At least this will not happen before international mediator Cyrus Vance and Nimetz conclude their mediation efforts. He added that Greece will decide whether to lift the measures. Christopher clarified that there is no disagreement on this issue between the State Department and the White House. There have been rumors that the State Department is pressing the White House to put pressure on Greece to lift the measures against Skopje. The U.S. secretary of state said that according to Nimetz's report, the differences between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [as heard] appear to be diminishing. Christopher said he hopes the parties can reach a preliminary agreement that will lead to lifting the embargo. This is important because essentially Christopher expressed the hope that the talks would proceed according to the procedure proposed by Greece. After meeting Christopher, Papoulias was asked about this issue. He expressed very reserved optimism, saying that no significant progress has been achieved. He explained to Christopher the Greek Government's positions on smoothing Athens-Skopje relations. The foreign minister said he did not ask the United States to postpone establishing diplomatic relations with Skopje, adding that the United States must intervene to break Skopje's intransigence. He stressed that the efforts continue. Papoulias will meet Vance in New York on Monday morning [25 April]. Papoulias and Christopher discussed the Bosnian crisis, the Cyprus issue, Greek-Turkish relations, and Greek-Albanian relations. Afterward, Papoulias met Nimetz and discussed Skopje. He also explained the Greek side's great concerns about incidents in Fanari. Papoulias left open the possibility of Greece taking additional measures against Albania, over and above the demarches that have already been made to Van der Stoel, the CSCE high commissioner on human rights, and the UN Security Council. On his way to the State Department, Papoulias said that we are not discussing the deportation of Albanians. In a statement he made yesterday, referring to the arrests of Greek minority members by the Albanian authorities, Papoulias expressed the Greek Government's rage and said that every step will be taken to defend the Greek minority's internationally respected human rights. Papoulias and Christopher discussed Greek-Albanian relations in the context of respect for the minority's human rights. Papoulias said later that he asked the United States to intervene so that human rights in Albania are respected.
