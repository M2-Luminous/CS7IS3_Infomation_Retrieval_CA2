More than A Billion Tonnes of Solid Waste Poisoning the Environment''] [Text] An inadvertent misprint once revealed surprisingly accurately the nub of the problem: The words ``ash waste'' [``zoloshlakovyye otkhody''] had been replaced by the words ``gold waste'' [``zolotoshlakovyye otkhody'']. Indeed, if the solid waste of thermal electric power stations is divided into its different elements and projected onto Mendeleyev's table they would cover it so comprehensively that some gold-bearing veins might seem a lot poorer. These waste products contain gold, silver, and such rare metals as germanium, vanadium, strontium, scandium, and lithium. Around 96 tonnes of gold alone could be extracted from the waste produced at our thermal electric power stations! Prior to 1989, when the problem of recycling ash waste was under the state's control, the curve showing the volume of recycling rose constantly, reaching a figure of 16.3 million tonnes for the USSR as a whole or 15 percent of annual production (the figure abroad is around 55 percent). This work was included in our national economic plan and centralized capital investments were allocated to the development of reprocessing capacities. In recent years, however, because of the lack of effective rules governing market mutual relations, the curve showing the recycling of ash waste in Russia has begun to steadily decline. Last year just 3.0 million tonnes or around 7 percent of annual output was reprocessed. In all there are more than 1 billion tonnes of solid waste accumulated in waste dumps at thermal electric power stations, which occupy over 20,000 hectares of land. When the discussion turns to state regulation, many people for some reason take this to mean a return to the old ways, to a rigid system of planning, to the budget financing of all and sundry, strict executive discipline, and so forth. State regulation as we understand it (for the transitional period) means movement toward full-fledged market relations in which the system of direct economic benefit works faultlessly. But for this system to begin operating the state and the local authorities must adopt the necessary legislative and legal acts. For example, the corresponding taxation must be used to practically close off access to natural resources if they can be replaced by ash waste without causing a deterioration in the technical characteristics of output. Preferential taxation and credit can be introduced for enterprises which reprocess those waste products. State regulation or, more accurately, state participation would also include an insignificant proportion of budget financing, which the state would use for scientific research and experimental design work of a problematic intersectoral character, and in the sphere of capital investment for the creation of pilot projects for the reprocessing of major quantities of these waste products measured in tonnes. Statistical accounting and the radiation safety of the use of ash waste must be kept under state patronage, as must other questions affecting society's interests. The conclusion is obvious: The problem must be resolved at federal level and the interests of the components of the Federation must be taken into account. The ``Ekoresurs'' Intersectoral Economic Association, founded at the end of 1990 by the USSR Energy Ministry, the Moscow City Soviet Executive Committee, and energy and science-and-production associations, produced a number of proposals which it put to the government in August 1992. They formed a basis for the study of the subprogram ``Reprocessing of thermal electric power station ash waste products'' within the federal targeted program ``Fuel and Energy.'' This is where regional and federal interests were brought together. If the regional measure envisages the construction of a reprocessing enterprise with a capacity of over 500,000 cubic meters of waste a year, it is the opinion of the authors of the subprogram that it has the right to expect the support of the federal authorities -- in the form of budget financing or preferential taxation. Only the urgent creation of multitonne reprocessing capacities can halt the catastrophic accumulation of waste products and reduce their negative impact on the natural environment. As for economic efficiency, in a cost-based economy where the cost price of materials was included in the volumes of work and affected the fulfillment of the set plan, trying to force the construction industry to use cheap ash waste materials instead of costly materials (sand, ballast, or gravel) was virtually impossible. It is only now, even with only local tax regulators, that it is possible to implement a policy for the extensive replacement of natural inert and bonding materials with ash waste products. In December 1993 the government approved the draft federal targeted program ``Fuel and Energy.'' The Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy was defined as the state client of the subprogram ``Processing of thermal electric power station ash waste products'' with the ``Ekoresurs'' Intersectoral Economic Association defined as the executor and at the same time its author. The subprogram does not envisage state dependence. No more than 15-20 percent of the total volume of expenditure should be borne by the federal authorities. All the rest is to come from non-budget funds, first and foremost ecological funds, from bank credits, and from enterprises' own resources. The final say in this matter should belong to the Federal Assembly, which is empowered not only to ratify the indicators in the subprogram but also to adopt the law ``On solid waste resulting from production and consumption,'' which Russia urgently needs.
