Commanded by a Brigadier, the party of 31 men and women will be drawn from all three services and their role will be to validate selection criteria and training standards, to monitor training across all four arms of the NDF (Army, Navy, Air Force and Medical Service) and to adjudicate in any cases where disagreements arise. Mr Rifkind said: "I believe that we have one of the best military forces in the world, and I am positive their experience, expertise and efficiency will be of enormous benefit in helping to build the new multi-ethnic armed forces in South Africa." It is expected that a core of nine members of the BMATT will remain in South Africa on two-year resident tours, while the remainder would go for shorter periods of about six months. The unit should be assembled in South Africa by mid-June.
