The Finnish President's First Official Visit to Moscow Ended Yesterday"] [Text] At a dinner in honor of the eminent Finnish guest, Russian President Boris Yeltsin noted that the present leaders of Russia and Finland not only value the positive undertakings of their predecessors but also "intend to build on them." It was thus stressed that Russo-Finnish relations are a "significant factor for stability in northern Europe and the Baltic region," and consequently it is necessary to "constantly coordinate positions." As ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has learned, no joint documents were signed on the basis of the results of the talks. But the fact that President Ahtisaari was accompanied on his trip by a large group of Finnish entrepreneurs is indicative. The two countries' businessmen did not waste time on protocol matters but sought to use the top-level talks to consolidate their economic positions in Russia. Especially since both President Yeltsin and President Ahtisaari regarded with approval the development of direct contacts not only between state enterprises but also at the level of private firms. The figures are as follows: In 1993 Russo-Finnish trade turnover was more than 40 percent up on the previous year and totaled almost $2.5 billion. Furthermore, cooperation is developing not only at state level but also between firms and individual enterprises. Finnish companies are showing greatest activeness in Russia's border regions -- St. Petersburg, Karelia, and Leningrad and Murmansk oblasts. Special energy-saving and rational forestry use programs have been prepared for those regions. Projects for the development of mobile radio telephone systems, the modernization of highways and railroads, ports, and border transport crossings are being developed. A program of cooperation in the assimilation of oil and gas deposits in the northern regions of Russia is justn one of those being prepared. It is to be presumed that President Ahtisaari's visit to Moscow and his talks with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin will give fresh impetus to mutually beneficial cooperation.
