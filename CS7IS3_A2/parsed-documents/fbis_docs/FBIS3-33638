PLO official Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh told our correspondent in Davos, Gid'on Kouts, that the representatives of both parties in the formulations committee had accepted the compromise after making difficult concessions. According to the Palestinian sources, the formulated proposals were sent to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin who will decide whether or not to accept them. Our correspondent notes that Foreign Minister Peres telephoned Mr. Rabin several times today from Switzerland. Apparently, an agreement has been reached on the issue of the border crossings and on the size of the Jericho area; however, the parties still disagree over the matter of the security zones and roads in the Gaza Strip. Israeli sources confirmed that significant progress had indeed been made in the talks. The sources nevertheless stressed that there had already been instances in the past when everything fell apart at the last moment. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, who is mediating between the Palestinians and the Israelis, expressed great optimism. Minister Musa met with Yasir 'Arafat several times over the past 24 hours. Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat will meet later today at a luncheon on behalf of the international economic forum meeting at Davos.
