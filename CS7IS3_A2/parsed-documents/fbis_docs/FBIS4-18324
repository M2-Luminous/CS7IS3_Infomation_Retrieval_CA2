In eastern Germany, growth has intensified; the upswing is no longer solely supported by transfers, but increasingly by independent driving forces. For the first time since the upheaval, investment dynamism in the new laender is having an effect on the labor market: The decline in employment and the increase in unemployment have meanwhile stopped. Next year, there will be more employed and fewer unemployed for the first time again. In the old laender, one of the longest and most profound recessions of the postwar period has been overcome. After demand and production had followed a downward trend for the past two to three years, in the course of last year the economy got out of its slump thanks to comprehensive rationalization measures, cost reductions, and first stimuli of demand, in particular from the foreign markets. The traffic light of the economic development is meanwhile yellow all over the economy. It is, above all, export that has the best prospects. These prospects have improved not only the expectations by companies, but also the inclination toward investments. In contrast, private consumption will probably remain "waiting" for the time being: The decline in purchasing power because of continuing tax increases is too big. Since further burdens -- such as the nursing care insurance -- can be predicted and the expectations for income are primarily oriented toward the still unfavorable labor market prospects, private consumption can be expected to provide stimuli probably only in the later course of the recovery of the economic development. For the development of industry, the FAZ [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG] economic indicator, which unites early indicators such as orders received, business climate, interest structure, foreign value of the German mark, share index, and offers of jobs, has been pointing upward for the past 10 months; most recently it has pointed upward quite intensively. The duration and scope of the upward movement now "clearly" indicate "a change," the assessment says. The upswing became "visible" first in the orders received from abroad, which have increased since the beginning of 1993. During the first quarter of 1993, orders from abroad were almost 9 percent higher in real terms than during the same period of the previous year. At the beginning of 1994, this development continued. As a result, export deliveries stabilized, following the preceding serious slump in the course of 1993, and slightly recovered during the second half of the year. Research institutes and the Council of Experts expect a clear real increase in exports this year. In contrast, the production branches that are primarily oriented toward domestic economy are mostly still in a period of consolidation. However, domestic orders in the processing industry have also pointed toward stabilization since the second half of 1993. In January, they were 1.5 percent higher in real terms than in December 1993. At the beginning of this year, output in the producing industry was higher than at the same time last year for the first time since spring 1992. Capacity utilization, which had declined since autumn 1990, slightly increased during the last quarter of 1993. The "clearest increase in utilization" was noted by the Munich Ifo Institute regarding preproducts, "an indicator of industrial development, which was reliable in the past." According to Ifo, the producers of preproducts look toward the further development of business "with increased confidence." In chemical industry orders received reportedly increased strongly in January, following a slight recovery during the fourth quarter of 1993. The latest official figures seem to confirm the observation of the institute: in January, orders received in the basic materials and producer goods industry increased above average compared with December. In the two-month comparison with last year (December/January), orders were 7 percent higher in real terms. Output in the basic material sector exceeded the corresponding level of the previous year by about 3 percent in real terms. According to the economic development test in January, in the investment goods sector, too, the positive expectations have increase, above all because of the stimuli from abroad. While, however, there was still "skepticism" in electrical engineering and among the producers of delivery vans and trucks, machine-building, which was particularly hard hit by the recession until the middle of last year, now reports a further increased number of orders received, precision mechanics/optics seems to experience a gradual recovery. In the automobile industry, following the slump last year, the production and export of industrial vehicles seem to have been higher again in January/February than during the same period the previous year. The production of passenger cars for the first time stabilized in February at a very low level. According to the association, domestic orders received have improved slightly; however, domestic demand for industrial vehicles remains low. Volkswagen has affirmed that it intends to make the planned investment of 5 billion marks [DM] in eastern Germany, even though a bit delayed. According to the "Ifo investors calculation for eastern Germany," the gross fixed investments of west German, east German, and foreign investors all over the economy will increase by another 15 percent in 1994. The (expected) amount of more than DM160 billion will then be almost twice as much as in 1991.
