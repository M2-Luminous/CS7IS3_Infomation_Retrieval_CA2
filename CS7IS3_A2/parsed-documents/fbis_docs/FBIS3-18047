Apart from North Rhine-Westphalia, the job action has focused on Brandenburg, where according to the Union of Public Services, Transportation, and Communications Workers (OeTV), some 11,000 employees are planning to down tools temporarily during the day. Delays for commuters were mainly noticed in North Rhine-Westphalia, where railroads and buses remained in their garages in numerous cities. In southwestern Germany quite a few people also arrived late at work because bus and train drivers temporarily suspended work. Public transportation was also affected in various parts of the Saarland. In Munich and Augsburg, the OeTV strike not only affected public transport but also the collection of garbage. The Trade Union of Postal Workers (DPG) also appealed to its members to stage token strikes. According to trade union sources, several hundred postal workers downed tools in 10 telecommunication offices, including those of Berlin and Hamburg. [passage omitted] With their token strikes, which are scheduled to continue on Tuesday, the trade unions want to protest against the "stubborn and antisocial position" of the employers in the public sector. While the OeTV has called for a 4-percent pay increase, the employers presented a "list of cuts." Among other things, extra benefits that have hitherto been granted as well as two free days are to be cut. The wage talks were suspended without any result last week and put off to 9 and 10 March.
