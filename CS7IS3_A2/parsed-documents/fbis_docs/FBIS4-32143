Along the same lines are accusations that the Yugoslav Army is massing its forces in the border area with the FYROM and that `the Serb army' has occupied the Straza observer post on Cupino Brdo," the statement issued by the ministry says. ``The Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs deems all the accusations unacceptable and unjustified, and rejects them entirely. ``The Yugoslav Army was deployed along the border as early as June 1992 and from then on it has been securing Yugoslav territory, along the border with the FYROM, up to the administrative borders of the municipalities belonging to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At that time and for a long period thereafter the FYROM had no objections to the situation on the ground. The Yugoslav Army units deployed along the border with the FYROM fully respect their code of service, performing their duties strictly in the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The FYROM's accusations of alleged border violations became frequent when foreign military observers arrived on the Macedonian side of the border. ``The Federal Foreign Ministry believes that the aim of the frequent accusations by the FYROM authorities is to substantiate the theory of the alleged `threat from the north' launched by certain non-Balkan and non-European players for their own interests. Such accusations should at the same time justify the involvement and strengthening of the deployment of foreign military factors on the territory of the FYROM, as part of the campaign of stepping up pressures on the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. ``The FRY's policy toward all neighbors, including the former Yugoslav republics, is well known, and the attempts to portray it in a false light, such as those from the FYROM, are contrary to the mutual interests for the development of good neighborly cooperation, peace, and stability in the Balkans. The FRY's policy is based on mutual respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty and, in relation to the FYROM, also on the interest in normalizing relations and reestablishing broken ties and cooperation. The FRY will fully adhere to the principles of the inviolability of territory and non- use of violence in solving open issues. ``Again describing the Macedonian accusations as illogical, unfounded, and unacceptable the Yugoslav side expects the FYROM Government to stop fabricating such accusations and, in the interest of peace, security, and good relations to put its actions in line with internationally recognized norms and documents,'' it is said at the end of the statement by the Federal Foreign Ministry.
