FR941028-0-00015 FR941028-0-00005 This is particularly so, since, at present, there is no practical difference in treatment between operating under the blanket marketer sales certificates and treatment as a non-regulated first seller. Therefore, the rulemaking has had no substantive impact on the rights of the parties. Moreover, the blanket certificate having been issued by rule, any change in that certificate would entail a new rulemaking proceeding in which parties would have a full opportunity for notice and comment. The cases relied on in the requests for rehearing do not compel a different determination in this case. In Mobil Oil Corp. v. DOE , 12 the Federal Energy Administration found that an emergency existed and the court found that the threat to the public would be sufficiently dire for good cause to be found to not provide notice and comment. But the APA does not require an emergency, and provides an exception where there is no substantive effect, as in National Helium, supra . In two of the cases, there was no question that notice was required. 13 The only issue was whether the notice and opportunity to comment that was provided was sufficient to give the public fair notice of the final form of the rule. Here, in the particular circumstances of this case, the rehearing requests have provided a sufficient opportunity. In Texaco Inc. v. FPC , 14 the Federal Power Commission (FPC) found that the effect of the rule was not minor, since the industry wide cost would be many millions of dollars. Again, there is no substantive effect to the elimination of ยง270.203(c). In Bushman v. Schweiker , 15 unlike this case, the agency never made a statement as to why notice was unnecessary. Therefore, this case can also be distinguished from the case before us. 12 728 F.2d 1477 (Emerg. Ct. App. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1255. 13 American Standards Inc. v. U.S., 602 F.2d 256 (Ct. Cl. 1979) and Consumer Energy Council v. FERC, 673 F.2d 425 (D.C. Cir. 1982), aff'd, 463 U.S. 1216 (1983). 14 412 F.2d 740 (3d Cir. 1969). 15 676 F.2d 352 (9th Cir. 1982). The Commission orders: The requests for rehearing are denied as discussed in the body of this order. By the Commission. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
