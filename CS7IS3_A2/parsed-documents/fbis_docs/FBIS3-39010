In the presence of leading strategists of the Western world in Munich, Rudolf Scharping stated that there are "no serious differences" in foreign policy between the SPD and the Kohl government. Is this a turning point? Scharping told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "It was no turning point. I only wanted to clarify what the resolutions of our party congresses really mean. On this basis, an SPD government would be fully capable of action in foreign policy. Its program covers everything the United Nations did in the past few years -- and what it will want and be able to do in the future." In other words, this means that the SPD would be able to support the peace missions in which the multination association in New York might ask the SPD to participate. This would not be more than "blue helmets plus" -- that is, "monitoring of peace," "blockades" like those in the Adriatic, "humanitarian missions" like the one in Bosnia and Somalia, and the military protection of such tasks. What will happen if the United Nations wants more? The candidate believes that the United Nations is no world government that can order the states to march. Every government must make its own decisions. Still, Erwin Horn, a longtime member of the Defense Committee and an SPD member, believes that Scharping adopted a "different and new tone" at the Munich conference. As the "classical party of internationalism," the SPD cannot "simply stand aside forever." Scharping has realized that. Horn added: "We must abandon the megalomania reminiscent of Emperor William, that we always want to be different from the others." Yet the "changes" hinted by the party chairman have certainly also been triggered by expected major decisions by the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, which have already cast their shadow at this point. Karsten Voigt, foreign policy spokesman of the Bundestag group, put it this way: "It is to be expected that Karlsruhe will declare the full spectrum of UN measures as legally possible. The Constitutional Court has signaled to all three parties that it will basically settle all pending issues in a positive way in the early summer: The purely humanitarian mission in Somalia, participation in the blockade in the Adriatic Sea (an operation initiated by the Western European Union), and the AWACS mission over Bosnia (NATO mission on behalf of the United Nations, that includes a combat operation)." Thus, an amendment to the constitution will not be required but only parliamentary approval with a simple majority. Scharping could live very well with such a ruling, and he could even go further than the party has allowed him so far. Both the blockade in the Adriatic Sea against the Serbs and the flights of the NATO fire control system (AWACS) are basically combat missions of which the leftists in the party do not approve. One of Scharping's foreign-policy aides stated: "If this is the way Karlsruhe will decide, resistance within the SPD will collapse. This is the return to a tradition that accords great significance to a clear orientation toward the West in its foreign policy," he added. What is even more, the party's doctrinarian wing would be silenced for the time being in the mammoth election year 1994, and the candidate could fully concentrate on his bid for power. In addition, no one in the West would have to be afraid of an election victory of the SPD for foreign policy reasons, as Horst Teltschik, Kohl's former security adviser, stated ironically at the security conference in Munich. A victory of the "Atlantic-minded" -- of those who both reject the special European relationship with France and unilateral measures vis-a-vis the East -- is emerging within the SPD. In fact, the new harmony between the SPD and the United States no longer requires special efforts. The United States no longer insists on a choice between nuclear rearmament and special detente vis-a-vis Moscow and East Berlin. The entire West is now united in the difficult balancing act to integrate and contain Russian power. Affection is easy to give if it does not require a price.
