The two agreed that Seoul and Buenos Aires exchange a memorandum of understanding on the matter and expand exchanges of law-enforcement officials to strengthen bilateral judicial cooperation. "Judicial cooperation is very much in need considering more than 35,000 Koreans are living in Argentina and bilateral exchanges are growing," Ho pointed out. On this understanding, the two countries decided to sign an extradition treaty as soon as possible after consultation with the Korean Justice Ministry, he said. On Saturday, Ho finishes his agenda in Argentina and leads the four-man National Assembly delegation to Chile, where he is scheduled to meet President-designate Eduardo Frei and discuss problems of mutual concern.
