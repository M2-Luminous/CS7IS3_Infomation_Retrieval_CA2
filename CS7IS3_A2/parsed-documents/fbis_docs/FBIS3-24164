"The rate of decline of agricultural production has decreased significantly. Compared with last year, gross agricultural production decreased only two percent, while field-crop output increased seven percent." This diagnosis was made by the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine in its report on the socioeconomic situation in Ukraine in 1993. We were pleased to learn of this, particularly because this was not our only contribution in the agricultural sector. For example, heeding our request, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food replaced the massive oak doors at its main entrance with light Duralumin ones. This reform was no small thing. As I opened these doors one day, I unexpectedly ran into Borys Yosypovych Kyrychenko, the head of the Main Administration for Foreign Economic Relations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. No sooner had I said hello than Borys Yosypovych invited me into his office for a cup of tea (if only everyone was this hospitable). As we drank our tea, I asked him an important question: what is happening in the agrosector as far as foreign investments are concerned? In light of the heightened interest in this issue among the general public, I offer the readers a synopsis of the answer that I received to this question from Borys Yosypovych Kyrychenko. 1. Our agrarian complex depends on the West for some two billion dollars in production resources. This money is spent to buy veterinary medicines, chemicalization means, spare parts, packaging materials, etc. In other words, it costs two billion dollars just to keep the agroindustrial complex [APK] functioning. To enable us to bring it closer to the level of the agrosectors in Western countries, we would need an additional four to five billion dollars. If we had this money, in three to four years we could increase the export potential of farm products to 10 billion dollars. The problem is that we cannot get this kind of start-up capital from anyone. They have no confidence in us. 2. It would be naive to count on receiving investments from Washington as we once received capital investments from Moscow. We need to take a more realistic view of things. We are currently in the midst of an economic war. While our ancestors began fighting by throwing rocks, then moved on to bows, and finally developed nuclear weapons, the weapon in the economic war is the dollar. The side with more dollars is always stronger. Economic wars may be less savage than military conflicts, but the results are the same -- the invasion of the other side's economy. That is why the stage in which our economy is today can be compared to 1941-43. Only we have not yet dug in on our own Volga, near our own Stalingrad. We still have no Marshall Zhukov who would know how to stop the retreat. We do not yet have our own Stalin's decree: "Not another step back." And we do not know what will happen to our own Stalingrad. 3. There is great interest in Ukraine in the world community. Not only because it has the most fertile black soil in Europe. For example, we sow almost as much corn as the whole of Western Europe. How much we reap is another matter. We underrate our agrarian potential, while Western businessmen know its value. Ukraine could build her whole economy on sugar, sunflowers, and wheat. If our work met the standards of Western countries, we could easily export close to 20 million metric tons of grain, approximately 5 million metric tons of sugar, and almost one million metric tons of sunflower oil. Moreover, at below world-level prices, because production costs in our country are significantly lower and our labor force is cheaper. This is humiliating, but in today's situation it also gives us an advantage. On the one hand, these factors attract those who want to make money in Ukraine, while, on the other hand, the competitiveness of our products in the world market scares Western businessmen. 4. The agrarian sector can assure the country the necessary supplies of oil products. But to do so, we need to set aside three million of our 43 million hectares of land and use the income from this area to purchase oil. We need to create special companies, which could be organized into consortiums that would produce farm goods, the proceeds from which would go to buy oil. We would thus not need to look for other financial resources to pay for fuel. We could also solve the problem of rural investments at the expense of our agrarian potential. But this, too, requires start-up capital. 5. In the past year, our agriculture with large private firms [as published] received 120-130 million dollars in short-term credits. As a rule, these loans are extended for sowing with the expectation that a profit will be made that the fall. Last year, as part of such joint ventures, we grew sugar beets, sunflowers, and corn on an area covering 300,000 hectares. There are close to 70 joint enterprises in Ukrainian agriculture, of which 22 are engaged in production, 36 in trade, and the remainder are at the stage of being established. Among the foreign companies that are in partnership with our structures in the agroindustrial complex, Polish, Czech, and Hungarian companies predominate numerically, while American, German, and Italian firms lead in terms of the amounts of capital invested. No one is asking who the winner will be [as published]. At this stage, the most active are the Americans, later, perhaps, the Germans may lead, although not every company represents national or state interests. Today, the interests of the transnational corporations dominate. For example, the Tetrapak company, which is manufacturing packaging for milk products in our country, is registered in Great Britain, but the company's president, Hans Rausing, is a Swede. Why in Great Britain? Because the tax rate is lower there. 6. Foreigners are being frightened away by our unstable laws. When they were first passed, they were exceptionally advantageous for foreign investors. Later some of these laws were fundamentally changed. Also the mechanism of settling accounts with foreign partners has not been thoroughly worked out, and double taxation makes the production of goods for export unprofitable. These are the reasons that our agrarian rating has fallen significantly in the world. 7. And lastly. Capital flows where there are profits to be made. It is not possible to hold it with political actions. If a businessman figures out that he can make money on Ukrainian sunflower oil, he will bring his investment to Ukraine. These are our trump cards. But one can lose even while holding a good hand of trumps. Everything depends on the skill with which the game is played. Incidentally, apropos trump cards. Just as this material was going into print, the State Program To Encourage Foreign Investment in Ukraine was published unexpectedly. Characteristically, the agroindustrial complex was included in the priority sphere for investment along with other sectors of the national economy. The program provides for the introduction of highly productive farm technologies, the refurbishment and modernization of food processing enterprises, the development of the agricultural machine-building industry, etc. In a word, exactly the things that we lack at present. Therefore, despite the pessimistic notes sounded by Borys Kyrychenko in his prognosis, there is room for optimism. We need only add that the Law "On the State Program To Encourage Foreign Investment in Ukraine" will come into force on 1 March 1994. Let us wait, shall we?
