This is what was done by some armies in the Gulf, including the Kuwaiti Army, following the end of the liberation war. They held land, naval, and air maneuvers with the Western alliance states--the United States, Britain, and France--as well as naval maneuvers with Russia, which is also among the advanced states militarily and is a signatory to the military cooperation agreement with Kuwait. There is no doubt that the aim of these maneuvers goes beyond training and military doctrines to political and economic interests. It is not wrong to embark on such cooperation, particularly when the parties involved recognize mutual interests based on equality and respect for national sovereignty. However, despite their importance, these maneuvers are not an alternative to the Arab defense order, of which the Gulf is an integral part, and will not prevent efforts to build a regional security order that is badly needed in the region. Otherwise, the maneuvers will become a shackle and a monopoly that will lead to subservience. Hence, the Islamic Republic of Iran's call several days ago for holding joint maneuvers with Gulf states is important and will reinforce military cooperation and deepen the sense of joint responsibility toward the region's security, on which the Gulf states' political literature always focuses and proposes as one of the Gulf desires and as a priority for the region's states to reinforce their defense structure. It is, however, noticed that this call has not been favorably received, even though it may provide an opportunity for us in Kuwait to introduce a new strategic dimension in the security cooperation and military coordination--a dimension that is justified in light of the unity of the security interests, the deep historical, and religious ties, and the economic and trade links in the past and at present. Iran's firm position on the Iraqi regime's invasion of the State of Kuwait, as well as the blood we shared in confronting that tyrannical regime, makes it necessary for us to establish all forms of cooperation and coordination between Kuwait and Iran in particular and between the Gulf states and Iran in general. This will breathe life into Gulf-Iranian relations and will remove some obstacles hampering strategic understanding to protect the Gulf from all dangers and ambitions and rise to the level of the big challenges threatening the Gulf region.
