France and China have resumed "relations of trust," Juppe told reporters. According to the joint communique, the Chinese side has reaffirmed its consistent principled position on the question of Taiwan, while the French side has confirmed that the French Government recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese territory. The communique says French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will pay an official visit to China in the near future. Juppe said the visit will take place "in a few weeks, perhaps in March," when the Daya Bay Nuclear Center in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, which was built with help from France, is inaugurated. Sources close to Balladur said that former French Minister Alain Peyrefitte will visit Beijing soon to attend ceremonies on January 27 for the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and China. The French prime minister has asked Peyrefitte to prepare "very attentively" for his China trip, the sources said.
