He stressed that a company like this would not be able to function without major capital investment from Russia. According to Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Russian Federation military space forces, Baykonur has received this year only about 2 billion rubles of the 6 billion rubles that Kazakhstan was to allocate to fund the cosmodrome. Russia has to pay more than 30 billion rubles to maintain Baykonur. According to available information, construction and maintenance building work is currently under way at the cosmodrome, but the staffing levels in the space units are running at only 53 percent.
