The SPS delegation also held talks with Yerasimos Arsenis, defense minister and member of PASOK's leadership, and leaders of other Greek parliamentary parties. [Jovicic] The speaker of the Greek Parliament, Apostolos Kaklamanis, who today held talks with Goran Percevic, vice president of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] and deputy in the Federal Assembly, has sent a message to the Serbian people to persevere in the struggle for the final realization of their just, legitimate aims. Kaklamanis stressed that the Serbian people should remain resolute in their just struggle, which is also the struggle for the independence and freedom of all Balkan states. The SPS delegation is visiting Athens at the invitation of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, PASOK. The delegation has attended the PASOK congress over the past few days. In a cordial meeting with the SPS delegation, the speaker of the Greek Parliament said that the Greek people understand and realize that a big conspiracy has been initiated against the Serbian people, and that the aim of this conspiracy was to break up the old Yugoslavia. Goran Percevic, vice president of the SPS, said that at these very difficult and crucial times for the Balkans, traditional, historical, and indissoluble friendship between the Greek and Serbian peoples has been confirmed once again. Apostolos Kaklamanis accepted the invitation to visit Yugoslavia, expressing the hope that this visit would take place very soon. The SPS delegation today also held talks with Yerasimos Arsenis, defense minister and member of the PASOK leadership. During the open discussions that lasted an hour, they discussed security in the Balkans and the situation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Minister Arsenis stressed that the denouement of the situation in the Balkans could move in two directions. One possibility is to give in to pressure and allow the creation of a large number of puppet states that would be in constant conflict with one another and would be bossed around by big powers. The other possibility is the strengthening of the Balkan states, so that they are capable of solving problems themselves. The international community should understand that the second option is in its own interests, Minister Arsenis stressed. During their talks, the SPS delegation, various PASOK officials, and leaders of other parties represented in the parliament, such as the Political Spring and the Communist Party of Greece, expressed strong support for the just struggle of the Serbian people and sharply condemned the sanctions of the international community on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
