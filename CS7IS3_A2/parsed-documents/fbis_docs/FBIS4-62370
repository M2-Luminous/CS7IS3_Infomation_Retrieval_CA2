In an interview with Interfax he said he was told that such a document exists. "I know nothing about the reasons for the decision, if it was made," Filatov said. According to his personal viewpoint, the prevailing tendency now is not to let deputy prime-ministers have ministerial portfolios. The sphere which Shakhray is in charge is an especially striking example of the usefulness of this tendency, Filatov said.
