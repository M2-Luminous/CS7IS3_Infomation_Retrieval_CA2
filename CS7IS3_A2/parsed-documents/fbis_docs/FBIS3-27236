The regulations permit every city in the province to recommend one local enterprise to the provincial government. Then the provincial commission on economic restructuring will organize lawyers and accountants to investigate the businesses. Their reports will be sent to the provincial securities regulatory commission. Then the provincial securities policy committee will select the companies by secret ballot. The provincial government said the chosen firms will be mainly in the energy, transport, and raw materials industries. They should be able to prove they have had a satisfactory business record for three consecutive years and have violated no laws in that period. Each firm's net assets should exceed 30 million yuan ($3.5 million). The foundation for a sound equity market in Sichuan was laid last year, and a securities network centred in the capital Chengdu and in Chongqing now includes more than 10 cities. By the end of last year, 50 Sichuan companies had issued shares publicly and 14 of them had been listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges. The province has setup five securities companies and many others based in Shanghai or Shenzhen have opened branches in Chengdu and Chongqing. Across the province, 407 outlets allow investors to trade shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. More than 100,000 people in Sichuan have traded in stocks with a transaction value of 20 billion yuan ($2.3 billion). The province has invested 2 million yuan ($230,000) to set up the Sichuan Securities Trading Centre, which has a 700-square-metre trading floor and more than 200 seats, in Chengdu. The centre lists 20 kinds of treasury and corporate bonds with a value of 700 million yuan ($80 million). A computer link-up with the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges is expected this year.
