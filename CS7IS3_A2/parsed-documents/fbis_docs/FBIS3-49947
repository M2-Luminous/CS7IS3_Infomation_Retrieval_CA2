He pointed at the importance of the normalization of Croatian-Yugoslav relations for stabilizing the situation in the Balkans. "The basic characteristic of the latest round of negotiations is the fact that it has shown who is really in favor of peace and who in favor of continuing the war", Milosevic stressed in a press statement in Geneva this evening. "Despite the media war against Serbia, which has been demonized and labeled an aggressor, it is completely clear now what has actually happened. A few weeks ago, in this building (Palais des Nations), we had serious and, in my mind, responsible talks with 12 ministers of the European Union. On that occasion they presented their proposal on what was to be done to achieve peace. They put forward very difficult conditions -- 33.3 percent (of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina) for the Muslim side, UN administration of Sarajevo, access to the river. This was, as you already know well, a complete set of conditions for peace. Sacrificing their own interests in the name of peace, the Serbs decided to fulfill them, they accepted them and came to Geneva to sign a peace agreement. What has happened? The Muslims have rejected it. Even after the cochairmen had given their additions to it, they rejected it. I am telling you that I know well why they have done so. The Muslims do not wish to stop their offensive in central Bosnia because they wish to overrun the Croats, raze Vitez, Busovaca, and Novi Travnik to the ground, conquer Mostar and force their way to the sea, through a completely Croat territory. I hope that this round will show what is really happening and will help to create a more balanced picture of the events in our country and in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. I believe that the conference will be resumed and I admit that I am an optimist. We will have peace despite those who are opposed to it, the Muslim leaders and those behind them who advise them wrongly," Serbian President Milosevic said. Asked if war would break out after the collapse of the negotiations, Milosevic said: "I do not think so. The Serbs are the stronger side and they do not want the war and the resumption of clashes. Asked if Croatia was in reality recognized within its present borders by the joint declaration, President Milosevic said: "Please understand that your question is linked to a problem existing between Krajina and Croatia. This problem can be solved only by negotiations between their legitimate representatives. As the Vance plan has been activated, it is clear that they should implement it mutually. I reiterate my personal standpoint on a very important issue we are discussing now. I must say that all responsible Serb and Croat politicians must work on normalizing Serb-Croat relations. We will do our best to help the normalization of relations in general and in detail because it is the main factor of stability in the Balkans. Those who want the stability of their states and the Balkans will seriously work on the normalization of relations between the Serbs and the Croats and in the entire region," President Milosevic said in Geneva.
