This is last night's figure. Another 89 were evacuated this morning, and a third convoy is on its way to the airport. [Boisbouvier] Are these expatriates of different nationalities? [Marlaud] They are of different nationalities. Of course, most of them are French nationals, but there are also Belgians, Canadians, nationals from Oman, Indians, nationals from Mauritius, several nationalities including, of course, nationals from almost all European Union countries such as Greeks and Germans, a wide- ranging number of nationalities. [Boisbouvier] What about the numerous Belgians who are still here? [Marlaud] The Belgians have now arrived in Kigali. As far as we are concerned, we will continue to include Belgian nationals in our evacuation plan. There is a significant number of Belgian nationals in the convoy which is on its way to the airport. I believe that the Belgians who are arriving will gradually take care of their own nationals. [Boisbouvier] Will any French nationals be left in Rwanda after the evacuations? [Marlaud] There is a number of French nationals who, if need be, could decide to stay in Rwanda although the Foreign Ministry has strongly encouraged our nationals to leave this country, but we cannot compel those who do not want to leave to do so. [Boisbouvier] Have you got an example? [Marlaud] There are a number of priests and nuns who sometimes refuse to be evacuated despite our advice and despite the help we are ready to give them. Moreover, the embassy remains open for the time being. [Boisbouvier] Do you intend to evacuate all diplomatic staff at the end of the evacuation operation? [Marlaud] The embassy is open for the time being. As long as no other decision is made, it will remain open. [Boisbouvier] What is the mission of the French force in Kigali now? Is it only to carry out the evacuation, or is it also to maintain order at the airport and in other sensitive zones? [Marlaud] The mission of the French forces is to ensure the safety of French nationals and other nationals who wish to leave Rwanda. [Boisbouviere] Nothing else? [Marlaud] This is the mission that was given to them. I believe that this was said in Paris quite clearly. [Boisbouvier] Did many French nationals die? [Marlaud] Well, apart from the crew of the presidential plane, one death has been confirmed. [Boisbouvier] That of a white father in southern Rwanda? [Marlaud] Yes, but please allow me not to give too many details because I am always wary of the closest relatives hearing about it before they have been told directly. I would rather not elaborate. [Boisbouvier] There has been talk of a cease-fire in the country between the government and the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels, for 24 hours. What is the situation this Monday at noon? [Marlaud] There are still on-going talks between the government and the RPF. The UN Mission in Rwanda is acting as a go-between. No agreement on a cease-fire has been reached so far. [Boisbouvier] Do you think that it will be possible to reach an agreement over the next few hours, given the conditions demanded by the two sides? [Marlaud] The Rwandan government called for a cease-fire right away. So far, the RPF has rejected it. It remains to be seen whether the RPF will finally agree to this cease-fire throughout the country. [Boisbouvier] The Rwandan government, which was appointed a few days ago, has been denounced by some as a government with a hard line against the RPF. What do you think about that? [Marlaud] As far as the replacement of President Habyarimana is concerned, the new interim head of state is the former speaker of the National Assembly. This is in keeping with the provisions of the former Rwandan constitution and with the provisions of the Arusha agreement. The sharing out of ministries and ministerial posts between the political parties has remained the same as it was as far as the sharing out of power provided for by the Arusha agreements is concerned. As for the political balance of power within this government, everybody can judge it differently. [Boisbouvier] If there is a cease-fire tomorrow, do you think that a political agreement in the spirit of the Arusha agreements is still possible after all that has happened over the last few days? [Marlaud] What is certain is that there is no solution to Rwanda's problems if there is no reconciliation, if people are not able to work and live together. The Arusha agreements were an effort in that direction and it is the only way out of the Rwandan crisis.
