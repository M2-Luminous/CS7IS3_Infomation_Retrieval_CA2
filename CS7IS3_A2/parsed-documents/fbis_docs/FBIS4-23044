Polyurethane coatings obtained by hardening of industrial varnishes are readily contaminated with mold spores, especially in warm and moist air. Tributyl tin is an effective fungicide and tin-organic compounds are used as hardeners of polyurethane varnishes. Taking this into account, industrial grade varnish UR- 231 was modified with small quantities of tributyltin dichloromaleanate (DKhMO). This substance was synthesized by addition of tributyltin oxide to dichloromaleic acid. It has two biologically active groupings (the tributylstannyl group and a halogen at the double bond), each acting in a different fungicidal mechanism. This combination could intensify the activity of the compound through a synergistic effect. The LD[.sub]50[/] (acute oral toxicity for mice) is equal to 200 mg per kg of the pure substance. DMKhO, being a trialkyltin carboxylate, also acts as a hardener for polyurethane resins. On hardening, this fungicide also becomes part of the composition of a macromolecular coating and provides structural biocidal protection. Bench tests demonstrated that the compound has satisfactory adhesion and electrical insulating resistance (over 2 MOhms at 500 volts) which meets the standard. The test results also showed that varnish UR-231 modified with 0.1 percent DMKhMO has improved service properties for radio-electronic components and extends their use to tropical conditions.
