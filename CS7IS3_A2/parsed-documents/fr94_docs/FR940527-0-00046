FR940527-0-00046 FR940527-0-00017 After that April 1993 decision, the Board received numerous letters from individuals and organizations who objected to the elimination of subsistence uses of moose by rural residents living outside of the Wrangell community. The Board reconsidered this issue in an August 10, 1993 public meeting at which public testimony was taken and additional information on customary and traditional uses of moose in the Stikine River drainage was reviewed. This additional information included a transcript of a 1987 Alaska Board of Game hearing which established the original customary and traditional use determination. The Board also examined information contained in State of Alaska and U.S. Forest Service studies on subsistence use patterns in southeast Alaska. In consideration of presented evidence, the Board determined that the quantity and quality of the new information was substantially greater than was available when the original customary and traditional use determination was made. The Board found compelling evidence that residents of Petersburg and perhaps other southeast Alaska communities have a long-term pattern of use of, and strong economic and sociocultural dependence on, moose in the Stikine River drainage. Accordingly, the Board amended the 1990 customary and traditional finding to that of an ``interim no determination''. An ``interim no determination'' finding does not diminish Wrangell's customary and traditional use status but allows all qualified rural residents to take moose in the Stikine River drainage pending completion of an ongoing Board review of customary and traditional wildlife uses by southeastern Alaska communities. The Board finds these modifications to be exempt from Administrative Procedures Act (APA) requirements for public notice and public comments prior to publication. In this instance, the Board finds that such requirements are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest. The subpart C modifications contained herein accurately reflect actions taken by the Board under full public review processes. Public notice and public comment opportunities on these issues were afforded through newspaper notices, public meetings, and mailings. Further notice and public comment on these modifications would impede the regulatory process, would provide insignificant benefits in nature and impact, would unnecessarily restrict certain subsistence opportunities, and would generally fail to serve overall public interest. Therefore, the Board has not reapplied notice and public comment procedures prior to publication of these changes. The Board also finds good cause to implement this final rule on April 5, 1993 (for use of rainbow trout, Kuskokwim Area) and on August 10, 1993 (for use of moose in Unit 1(B)). These effective dates are consistent with former Board actions which were publicly deliberated and acted upon for this final rule modification. The Board therefore finds these modifications to be exempt from APA requirements for publication 30 days prior to the effective date.
