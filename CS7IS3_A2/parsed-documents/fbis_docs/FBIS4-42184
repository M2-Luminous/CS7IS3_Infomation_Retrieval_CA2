The indictment request filed today was the first formal move by magistrates toward putting Andreotti on trial since he was first placed under investigation more than one year ago. Andreotti, a Christian Democratic veteran and for decades one of the most powerful politicians in Italy, in March 1993 was first notified he was under investigation on suspicion of Mafia links. Magistrates at the time asked that Andreotti's parliamentary immunity from prosecution be lifted. The prosecution's case reportedly rests on testimony provided by six former Mafia members who decided to turn state's evidence, including Tommaso Buscetta, who 10 years ago first gave investigators a description of the workings of Cosa Nostra in Sicily but refused to talk about the links between politicians and organized crime. In more recent times other former Mafia bosses, specifically Gaspare Mutolo, Antonino Marchese, Leonardo Messina and Baldassare Di Maggio reportedly gave a clearer picture of these links. Andreotti's defense counsel, Odoardo Ascari, in a statement today said that, one year after the first suspicions were voiced, no one has yet stepped forward to confirm the alleged "contributions" Andreotti gave to the Mafia by using his political connections to rig trials against organized crime bosses in Sicily. According to judiciary sources, magistrates have been investigating possible connections between Andreotti and the Mafia slaying of Salvo Lima, Sicily's most powerful Christian Democrat, on March 12, 1992. Lima, a member of the European Parliament at the time, led Andreotti's supporters on the island. Some former bosses have claimed that Cosa Nostra was able to rig trials by turning to Lima, and that Andreotti himself met some top organized crime chiefs in private. Andreotti has repeatedly claimed he has never met Mafia bosses and could not do so even if he wished to because he is always under heavy police escort. But Palermo assistant public prosecutors Guido Lo Forte and Roberto Scarpinato today said investigations have shown that Andreotti "sometimes eluded his bodyguards." The fact that the prosecution has requested Andreotti's indictment indicates it believes sufficient evidence exists for a possible conviction. [passage omitted] Later today, it was learned here that three additional mafiosi who have become "pentiti," penitents or state's witnesses, have furthered the case against the life senator. The three were identified as Gioacchino La Barbera, Santo Di Matteo and Salvatore Cancemi. Barbera was said to have reported to investigators a conversation between Mafia dons Nino Gioe and Leoluca Bagarella on the feasibility of murdering Andreotti or one of his sons because of the powerful political figure's betrayal of Cosa Nostra. Barbera was quoted as saying, "They complained about the conduct of Lima and Ignazio Salvo and put up the explanation that these two could do nothing because Andreotti had, by now, changed policy in a direction less favorable for Cosa Nostra."
