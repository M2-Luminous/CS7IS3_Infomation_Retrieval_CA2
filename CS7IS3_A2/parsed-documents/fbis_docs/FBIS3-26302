On February 2, the Government of Burkina Faso, in disregard of the long-standing friendly relations and cooperation between China and Burkina Faso, announced the so-called "restoration" of "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan, the spokesman said, adding that the Chinese Government has lodged a strong protest with the Government of Burkina Faso and announced the suspension of diplomatic relations with Burkina Faso and cessation of implementation of all agreements between the two governments. In recent years, the spokesman pointed out, the Taiwan authorities, taking advantage of the temporary economic difficulties of some countries, have gone out of their way to pursue "money diplomacy" in an attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". This indecent trick, he noted, goes entirely against the fundamental interest of the Chinese nation and is bound to meet the opposition of the people on both sides of the Taiwan straits. "The scheme of the Taiwan authorities is doomed to failure," he said.
