"It's simply amazing how tenaciously vital such expectations are," Bogdankevich declared, and then he uttered the sentence quoted in the headline above. Bogdankevich based his pessimism, first and foremost, on the circumstance that it is specifically the devaluation of the national currency which is helping to keep exporters afloat. "But instead of seeing these problems, society is maintaining and even encouraging certain illusions," he emphasized. In speaking about the Russian-Belarusian talks, Bogdankevich said that the Russian side was constantly departing from positions which had been worked out quite some time ago. In contrast to previously signed agreements, Russia now considers it necessary to retain clearing operations. At the present time, moreover, the Russian experts (and these include deputy ministers and even ministers) are already proposing to eliminate the National Bank of Belarus and to open a branch of the Central Bank of Russia in Minsk. The Russians have also begun to renounce unified prices on energy resources (Prime Minister Kebich has steadfastly emphasized that this is the most important thing in the process of monetary unification); and they are proposing to introduce agreed-to or contract prices. To a question from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA as to whether it would be possible--at least theoretically--for Belarus to agree to such conditions Bogdankevich replied: "No! We in Belarus are not suicidal. Neither Kebich nor Bogdankevich will ever sign such documents. At the same time, however, the National Bank chairman did reaffirm that he supported the signing of an agreement based on previously stipulated conditions. "We were prepared to sign it even yesterday," Bogdankevich declared. Bogdankevich commented quite sharply on the frequent trips taken by Prime Minister Kebich to visit his colleague Chernomyrdin and their private-type, one-on-one meetings. "I don't understand these meetings, nor do I see their results," he said. Furthermore, the chairman harshly criticized Belarus's domestic economic policy, particularly the issuance of more than one and a half trillion to the agrarian sector. This money was distributed among the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in proportion to their amounts of arable lands, regardless of profitability and productivity. "This is not only not the path to a market-type economy. Such things were not done even under socialism," Bogdankevich declared indignantly. He reported that just during the first two months of this year the money supply in this republic doubled. In Bogdankevich's opinion, the inflation rate in March will exceed 50 percent; he also predicted a sharp rise in the rate of exchange for the dollar. The National Bank chairman reaffirmed his adherence to market-type relations, but he stated the following with regard to development in Belarus: "We are not at the beginning of the path, but rather at the beginning of its beginning." In point of fact, as of right now, there is not a single state economic entity which has declared bankruptcy, whereas at certain enterprises turning out products "for the warehouse" the employees are earning from 500,000 to 600,000 (as compared to the average wage of 200,000 in Belarus). Bogdankevich termed the situation in the matter of accounting "communism." It is a situation whereby as much as you like can be taken and used without any intention at all of paying it back. Bogdankevich's words demonstrate once again that nowadays within the Belarusian leadership he has remained, in fact, the only firm advocate of market-type relations and independence for this republic. Therefore, regardless of Bogdankevich's statements to the effect that he does not take a confrontational stance in relation to the government, many observers and journalists have a feeling of concern for his further career.
