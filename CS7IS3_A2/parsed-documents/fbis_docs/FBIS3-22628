This commercial agreement will be used to pay part of the Cuban debt with Brazil, which totals $48 million. This was reported by Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage D'Avila, who is visiting Brazil to negotiate investment strategies in the country. Lage met yesterday with President Itamar Franco and with Health Minister Henrique Santillo. Lage stated that Cuba is able to supply several medicines to Brazil at good prices. He said Cuba can sell Brazil generic medicines, like antibiotics and anesthetics. Carlos Lage explained that the Cuban Government is "patiently" awaiting the Brazilian discussion over the effectiveness of the anti-meningitis meningococcic B-type vaccine produced in Cuba. "We are aware this issue is being thoroughly discussed in Brazil but I would like to remind everyone that we are the scientific proof of the vaccine's effectiveness."
