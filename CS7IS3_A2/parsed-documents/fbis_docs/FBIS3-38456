FBIS3-38456 "drweu023_e_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Report on News Conference by Sinn Fein Leader Adams LD0202223294 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 2052 GMT 2 Feb 94 LD0202223294 London PRESS ASSOCIATION Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] [Sinn Fein President] Mr Adams's visit continued to grab the headlines in New York today. His speech to the National Committee on American Foreign Policy's Northern Ireland conference was widely reported in the city's morning newspapers and on coast-to-coast television channels. The tabloid NEW YORK POST devoted a full page to Mr Adams and his movements and the more sedate NEW YORK TIMES also had detailed and extensive coverage. Mr Adams was expected to maintain the publicity momentum through further TV interviews before leaving for Dublin from New York's Kennedy Airport tonight. He was also having further talks today with Irish-American politicians and trade union leaders sympathetic to the Irish republican cause. Clearly cheered by the warmth of his welcome, Mr Adams was planning to deliver a "farewell message" to the American people. Meanwhile, U.S. political commentators highlighted the possible harm done to Anglo-American relations by President Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa. It was thought, however, that the President might have compensated for any damage done to the "special relationship" by swiftly making clear last night that there would be no U.S. intervention on Northern Ireland. [passage omitted] Mr Adams ended his visit by claiming the publicity which surrounded it was generated by the British Government. "Had they never objected in the first place to me coming to the U.S. and never tried to interfere with the affairs of the U.S., then no one would have noticed when I got here," he told a news conference. "They created the issue and brought it on themselves by putting pressure on the American authorites." Criticism levelled at him by [British Prime Minister] Mr Major and [Foreign Secretary] Mr Hurd was contrived, he said. "They are trying to ensure that when another visa application is made it will cause more controversy. I think people here will resist them. This is just the hysteria of the British House of Commons." [passage omitted] Mr Adams said Mr Clinton's decision to allow him a visa was "the right thing to do, and a very sound gesture that makes the right signals and creates the right climate." Asked whether the cause of peace had been advanced by his visit, he declared: "It is very, very hard to make peace. It requires two sides to make up just as it requires two sides to make war." He insisted that he wanted an end to violence in Northern Ireland. The beginning of the news conference was marked by an outburst of applause from a number of republican supporters in the room with journalists. Mr Adams flies back to Ireland later tonight. During his final hours in New York he met trade union leaders and politicians with an Irish interest.
