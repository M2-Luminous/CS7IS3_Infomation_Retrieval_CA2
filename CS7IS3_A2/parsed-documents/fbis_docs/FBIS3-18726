The final report to the Bundestag, which is already available to ZDF, confirms that suspected Red Army Faction terrorist Wolfgang Grahms committed suicide. However, it is noted that the authorities involved made considerable mistakes during the arrest operation. As one of the consequences, the GSG-9 antiterrorism unit is to cooperate more frequently with the laender's special task forces in the future.
