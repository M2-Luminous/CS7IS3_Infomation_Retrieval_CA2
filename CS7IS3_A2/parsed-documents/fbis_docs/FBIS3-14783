On 27 February 1994, the first multiparty elections were organized, free elections whose final results will undoubtedly exert a tremendous influence on the future of the Republic of Moldova. Since last night at 2000 [1800 GMT], when the polling stations closed, the Central Electoral Commission has constantly been receiving information from the 1,966 electoral commissions set up throughout the country. A total of 1,751,278 voters participated in the current elections, representing 73.29 percent of the total electorate. In the east rayons, of the 400,000 citizens entitled to vote, 6,829 citizens of both Dniester and Moldovan citizenship cast their vote. The Gagauz people participated massively in the elections, so that in the south rayons, where most of them live, the participation rate was 74-98 percent. The lowest participation rate was recorded in the four electoral districts in Chisinau and the city of Balti -- somewhat higher than 50 percent. The latest data provided by the Central Electoral Commission reflect a partial situation based on information gathered up to 0400 [0200 GMT] from the city of Chisinau and the south of the Republic of Moldova. According to this information, the options expressed by vote stand as follows: For the Agrarian Democratic Party -- 49.65 percent; For the Bloc of the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity Movement -- 23 percent; For the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals 7 percent; and For the Christian Democratic Popular Front Alliance 7 percent. These partial results, as Chisinau radio commented, could be completed with a general assessment on the situation in the south rayons, where the majority of votes will go to the Bloc of the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity Movement. A summarized review at 0400 [0200 GMT) revealed that the electorate is oriented toward just four political formations, namely the Agrarian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity Movement, the Christian Democratic Popular Front Alliance, and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals. We have to specify that the figures presented here will undergo changes, which will be made known to you. And now my colleague will brief you on the final episode of the incident in Tiraspol yesterday. The Romanian citizen Ilie Vaduva is outside any danger. Last night he was escorted to Chisinau by two diplomats of the Romanian Embassy. Our country's ambassador, Mr. Marian Enache, told us that he had enjoyed the support of the authorities of the Republic of Moldova in solving this case, together with whom, he hopes, that he will be able to clarify the problem of the automobile of the Romanian Senate that was confiscated in Tiraspol. Ilie Vaduva expressed his gratitude to the Romanian Embassy in Chisinau, which, through the efforts it made, put an end to this unpleasant incident.
