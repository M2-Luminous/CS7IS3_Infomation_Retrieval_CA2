During his inspection tour, Song Ping stressed: We must regard agriculture as the foundation of the national economy. After we ensure grain and cotton acreages and increase their total output, we must adjust the agricultural production structure in rural areas and raise peasants' income level. From 8 to 24 March, accompanied by Zhang Boxing, secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial CPC Party Committee; Cheng Andong, member of the Shaanxi provincial committee standing committee and secretary of the Xian city party committee; and Li Huanzheng, member of the Shaanxi provincial committee standing committee and secretary of the provincial party committee's Commission for Discipline Inspection, Song Ping visited factories, rural areas, and schools, and called on workers, peasants, experts, professors, and veteran comrades to acquire a better understanding of industrial and agricultural production, and the development of cultural and educational undertakings. Wherever he went, he held talks with local cadres and people and encouraged them to make greater progress. Song Ping has worked in Shaanxi for 15 years. Song Ping said: Under the party's correct leadership, the provincial party committee and government have done a large amount of work. Shaanxi has developed rapidly and the major changes it has undergone are gratifying. Shaanxi has many strong points and should seize the opportunity to deepen reform and quicken development. During his talks with grass-roots cadres, Song Ping said: Cadres should concentrate their efforts on mobilizing peasants to improve their living standards, vigorously develop village and town enterprises, and develop industry to assist in agricultural development. Cadres should work diligently at their posts, be honest in performing their official duties, and serve the people wholeheartedly. They should go down to the grass-roots units and establish close contact with people in an effort to communicate with units of lower levels and to resolve the masses' problems. Weinan prefecture carries out a very good measure requiring leading cadres to report their major decisions to the masses for approval. In this way, cadres are under the supervision of the party and the masses. Weinan must continue this measure. It is very important for us to build good grass-roots party and political power organs and to play the exemplary role of a party member. Only when we build good grass-roots party and political power organs, can we carry out the party's decisions and policies. While we are paying attention to material civilization construction, we must make great efforts to promote spiritual civilization construction, collectivism, patriotism, and socialism. We should do a good job in family planning and in promoting the overall development of the rural economy. Song Ping hoped party committee and government cadres at all levels would work hand in hand and make concerted efforts to build a better Shaanxi.
