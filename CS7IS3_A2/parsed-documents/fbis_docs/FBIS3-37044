Commenting on the issue, Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov pointed out that democrats, after denying the party structure which had led to the arbitrary rule of the Soviet Communist Party, started to realize that a "strong, well-organized democratic party will guarantee development of democracy and continuation of the reforms in Russia." On possible interaction between this party and the Russian president, Kostikov emphasized that the president was a long-time democrat. "Boris Yeltsin has determined his place in the history of new Russia primarily as a democrat. That is why an ideological connection between the president and the democratically-oriented party to be established is quite natural. This stems from the president's whole policy," Kostikov remarked. Different political groups currently argue who will receive the "president's banner." According to Kostikov, this proves that society has realized what strong political potential the president has. Kostikov expressed his confidence that this potential was applied in favor of democracy and contributed to the development of reforms. However, Kostikov pointed out that "democrats should take a more active position towards the president, introducing themselves as an active political force, friendly to Boris Yeltsin and ready to support his policy." Also participating in the meeting were Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays; Sergey Kovalev, a well-known fighter for human rights; Yelena Bonner, widow of Academician Andrey Sakharov; writer and Federation Council deputy Yuriy Chernichenko; actors Zinoviy Gerdt, Mikhail Gluzskiy, and Mikhail Ulyanov; movie director Rolan Bykov; satiric poet Aleksandr Ivanov; writer Fazil Iskander; and others.
