FR940705-2-00103 FR940705-2-00073 [Docket No. 50&hyph;397] Washington Public Power Supply System; Notice of Partial Denial of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has denied a portion of a request by the Washington Public Power Supply System, (the licensee) for an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;21 issued to the licensee for operation of the Washington Nuclear Project No. 2, located in Benton County, Washington. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of this amendment was published in the Federal Register on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17609). The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to reflect management and organizational changes at the Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) for operation of the WNP&hyph;2 facility. The proposed changes would (1) modify the reporting responsibility of the quality assurance organization from the Managing Director to the Assistant Managing Director, Operations (AMDO), and (2) modify the appointment authority for the Corporate Nuclear Safety Review Board (CNSRB) from the Managing Director to the AMDO. These changes are proposed to reflect the current designation of the AMDO as the licensee's designated official with corporate responsibility for overall plant nuclear safety, and as the direct report for the CNSRB. In addition, the proposed change would (1) delete the specific requirement for health physics/chemistry program procedures, (2) modify the titles of two positions on the Plant Operations Committee (POC) to reflect revised organizational titles, (3) modify the CNSRB composition requirements from nine personnel to a minimum of nine personnel, and (4) delete the requirement that the CNSRB Executive Secretary be designated from the CNSRB membership. The NRC staff has concluded that part of the licensee's request cannot be granted. The staff denied the proposed change to modify the CNSRB composition requirements from nine personnel to a minimum of nine personnel, because the proposed change does not specify a maximum number of CNSRB members and is inconsistent with the existing TS provision that 5 persons shall constitute a quorum of the CNSRB. The licensee was notified of the Commission's partial denial of the proposed change by a letter dated June 28, 1994. By August 4, 1994, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to the denial described above. Any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene. A request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date. A copy of any petitions should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to M.H. Philips, Jr., Esq., Winston and Strawn, 1400 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;3502, attorney for the licensee. For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendment dated February 17, 1994, and (2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated June 28, 1994. These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Richland Public Library, 955 Northgate Street, Richland, Washington 99352.

Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 28th day of June 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Theodore R. Quay, Project Director, Project Directorate IV&hyph;2, Division of Reactor Projects_III/IV, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
