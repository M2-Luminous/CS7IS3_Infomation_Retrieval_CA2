It is expected that following New Zealand-grown apples, which had been banned for a long time, the government will also lift a ban on American apples. Although there is strong opposition by domestic apple growers, there will be no reason for the Japanese Government to reject foreign nations' requests to import when the quarantine problems are settled technically. Although Japan's apple market was liberalized in 1971, almost no foreign apples have been imported to Japan so far. In fact, import of foreign apples was prohibited by the Pest Control Law based on the International Pest Control Treaty. To clear the problem hampering export of its apples, the New Zealand Government has made great efforts to establish a pest-control system. After inspecting New Zealand apples, the Japanese Government judged that New Zealand-grown apples are safe to eat, thus lifting the ban last year on New Zealand-grown apples. This year, the first shipment of New Zealand apples arrived in Japan. At the same time, it has also become possible for Japanese apple growers to export their apples to New Zealand, and a small amount of apples was exported last autumn. The United States for its part, since 1986, has been calling on Japan to import American apples. In response, the Japanese has repeatedly rejected the U.S. demand on the grounds that quarantine requirements were not met. The United States then said that Japan is intentionally delaying its granting of quarantine approval to American apples, repeatedly saying that the apple trade has become a political problem as one of unfair trade areas. Every time the United States applies pressure on Japan, we have stressed that the quarantine issue should be settled technically and criticized the U.S. attitude. At the same time, we have called on the Japanese Government to take fair action. Last April, the Japanese inspection team made an on-site inspection of U.S. pest-control methods and systems. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] recently announced its decision to lift the ban as early as this autumn on imports of American apples, saying American apples now meet quarantine requirements. It is a matter of course for MAFF to decide on imports because the quarantine problems were solved. Imports of foreign apples give consumers a variety of options. However, we are concerned about how it will affect domestic apple growers. Since production costs for American apples, which are harvested during Japan's off-season, are lower than Japan's, domestic growers are concerned that imports of American apples will have a great impact on their jobs. Meanwhile, some say it is questionable whether American apples suit Japanese consumers' tastes because American apples are smaller than Japanese ones and most of them, in general, belong to the "delicious" type. Production of this type of apple has sharply decreased in Japan. Past liberalization of other fruit markets, such as grapefruit, cherries, and oranges, had less impact on domestic ones than expected. As for apples, there is no guarantee that domestic apples will not be affected by foreign apples. But domestic apples have the advantage of being produced to suit the Japanese people's tastes. In addition, they are fresher than foreign apples. Domestic apple growers should not become unnecessarily confused. We hope that they will make further efforts to cut production costs and improve the quality of their apples so that their competitive power will increase. Producing a higher grade of apple is one way to attract consumers. In addition, consumers will probably welcome cheaper and more uncontaminated apples even if they are not well-shaped or well-colored. Furthermore, we suggest the domestic apple growers, taking advantage of this opportunity, seriously consider exporting their apples. It is said that people in Taiwan and Hong Kong prefer Japanese apples as gifts. Although the United States also bans the import of Japanese apples for quarantine reasons, it is expected to allow Japanese apples to come into the U.S. market when the Japanese Government lifts the ban on American apples. We think that Japanese apples are favorably compared with those grown in other nations. We hope that the domestic growers will demonstrate the quality of their apples in the U.S. market.
