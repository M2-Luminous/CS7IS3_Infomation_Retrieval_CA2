This statement was made by Zhirinovskiy's lawyer, Sergey Belyak, in an interview with Interfax Wednesday. Gaydar's article "A Bet on Scoundrels" published by Izvestiya on May 17 served as the reason for the suit. Belyak referred to Gaydar's phrase from the article: "Zhirinovskiy is the most popular fascist leader in Russia" and descriptions like "fascist populist." On June 7, Zhirinovskiy signed a statement to withdraw his first suit against Gaydar made on December 7. According to Belyak, Zhirinovskiy made this step after the signing of the Social Accord Pact, wishing to show his readiness for compromises not only in words, but also in practice. At the same time, Gaydar's new insulting statements have forced Zhirinovskiy to file another suit against him, Belyak said. "I have deep doubts that Gaydar understands anything in the history of fascism and Zhirinovskiy's works if he has ever read them," Belyak said. He explained Gaydar's actions by "the desire of an unpopular politician to curse a popular leader." Zhirinovskiy evaluated the moral damage inflicted on him by Gaydar at 500,000 rubles.
