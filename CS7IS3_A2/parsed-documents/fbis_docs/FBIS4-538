FBIS4-538 "drafr071_a_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Fighting Between Army, RPF Continues in Kigali Fighting Between Army, RPF Continues in Kigali Army Claims Control of North, Northeast EA1204164594 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise in French 1000 GMT 12 Apr 94 EA1204164594 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise French BFN [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The north and northeast are under the total control of the Rwandan Armed Forces. The relevant services of Army headquarters say nothing significant is happening in the Gisenyi operational sector except cases of interethnic strife which were also reported in the region last week. In the Ruhengeri operational sector, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] tried to cross the neutral zone in the area of the Kinigi and Vumba communes, but the Rwandan Armed Forces easily repulsed the attack. The entire zone is now under the control of the Rwandan Armed Forces. In the Rulindo operational sector, the Rwandan Armed Forces are in control of the Tumba and Kabuye Heights near (Gakenke) in the Ruhengeri Prefecture. Thus, the Kigali-Ruhengeri route is entirely open and under control. In Byumba, RPF combatants tried to penetrate through the (Kisaro) and Rutare communes, but clashed with the Armed Forces in the process. The Rwandan Armed Forces are also fighting with RPF forward units in the Mukarange Commune in Mutara Region. In Kigali town, as I have said, everything is peaceful at this moment, but firing has been heard in the Gikondo sector below (Rebero). Now we can no longer hear anything. Military officials point out that the RPF is using guerrilla tactics by which it is sending small groups of armed men into a sector to divert and dislocate important units of the Rwandan Armed Forces, but all that is well known to the Rwandan Armed Forces. The people should not panic, but tell the security forces where the enemy is hiding. This happened in the Gikondo sector yesterday when the attention of a patrol of the national Gendarmerie was drawn to the presence of seven RPF combatants hiding in a house. [passage omitted]
