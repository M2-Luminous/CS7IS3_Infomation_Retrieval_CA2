The agency's notice also banned sales of "sets" of domestic rice and imported rice in separate bags. It noted the policy is to maintain fair supplies and to avoid any hoarding of domestic rice. If domestic rice only is preferred and purchased, it will be completely consumed before rice grown this year comes onto the markets, the notice said. Blended rice will likely be put on the market as early as next week despite much opposition from consumers and rice sellers. Consumers say they want to have freedom of choice and if domestic and imported rice have to be sold in a certain proportion, then they want to have the rice in separate bags, so they can cook it in different ways according to the rice type. Rice sellers say, reflecting such consumers' voices, that they want to sell separately. Some wholesalers said they also want to sell "sets" of foreign and domestic rice instead of blended rice. The agency plans to organize meetings for consumers and sellers in order to avoid further confusion, officials said.
