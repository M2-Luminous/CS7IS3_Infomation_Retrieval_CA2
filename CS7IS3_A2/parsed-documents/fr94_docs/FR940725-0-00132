FR940725-0-00132 FR940725-0-00019 Second, the shipyard industry has demonstrated the effectiveness of the current and proposed 29 CFR 1915, Subpart B requirements over the past 10 years. Third, requiring the 1910 general industry requirements for [land-side] activities instead of the current and proposed 1915 shipyard requirements complicates the training element, by necessitating dual procedures. The training for both sets of requirements will be incompatible, since the standards each take a different approach_1915 Subpart B utilizes a ``performance oriented'' approach, while 1910.146 relies on specifications to achieve its objectives. Ingalls Shipbuilding (Ex. 11&hyph;20) agreed, stating: The SESAC recommendation stresses preventions, training and self-rescue. This approach, which relies on testing before entry and use of engineering controls to eliminate the hazards is, in our opinion, much safer than the general industry standard which requires the use of attendants at each confined space to summon rescue personnel when an emergency occurs. (SESAC'S recommendations put the emphasis on prevention). In addition to being safer it is also more economical than the general industry standard. The industry has adopted a single approach to working in and around explosive and dangerous atmospheres throughout the shipyard for several reasons: (1) The number and type of atmospheric hazards associated with products contained in the spaces is unpredictable. Some vessel repairers encounter over 100 different chemical cargoes (Ex. 11&hyph;27); (2) The complexity of confined spaces is increased due to the extensive internal structures, adjacent spaces, pipelines, vent systems, heating coils, and the like (Ex. 11&hyph;7, 11&hyph;27); and (3) The cross-contamination of previous and successive products complicates the atmospheric evaluation process (Ex. 11&hyph;7). (4) The nature of the work associated with the confined space entry in shipyards tends to be more complex. This work frequently involves hot work which can greatly affect atmospheric conditions within the space (Ex. 11&hyph;7, 11&hyph;27). Based on the record, OSHA has made a determination that a single standard should be applied for entry into confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres throughout the shipyard industry, following the Subpart B approach. OSHA has arrived at this conclusion for two basic reasons: (1) A single procedure, applicable throughout the shipyard and addressing hazards related to confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres will best protect employees, and (2) That the provisions adopted in revised Subpart B will provide shipyard employees with a comprehensive set of protective safety measures. A single standard applying to all shipyard confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres will provide employees with one procedure for working in any shipyard location, whether on a vessel or on land. The commenters overwhelmingly agreed that this approach would best protect employees (Ex. 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;50). OSHA agrees with these commenters that two procedures for dealing with confined and enclosed space and dangerous atmosphere hazards would confuse employees who have to implement those procedures. The Agency is concerned that the confusion resulting from different standards for shipboard and land-side spaces would actually lead to accidents rather than prevent them. As in the past, the primary focus of Subpart B will continue to be atmospheric hazards. Non-atmospheric hazards such as those relating to slips, trips, or falls are covered by other provisions of the shipyard standards. A more specific detailed discussion of non-atmospheric hazards is contained in the following paragraph. OSHA believes that land-side confined spaces in shipyards pose hazards similar in nature to those found in vessels and vessel sections covered by revised Subpart B. The evidence in the record demonstrates that the atmospheric and non-atmospheric hazards in vessels and vessel sections are also present in land-side confined spaces (Ex. 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;27, 11&hyph;32, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;47). The Agency agrees with the vast majority of commenters who stated that the procedures used to protect workers from these hazards in vessels and vessel sections could readily be adopted for use in land-side confined space operations (Ex. 11&hyph;1, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;32, 11&hyph;33, 11&hyph;34, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;42, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;46, 11&hyph;47, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;51). A few commenters stated that vessels and vessel sections pose greater hazards (Ex. 11&hyph;7, 11&hyph;8, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;22, 11&hyph;27, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;46). They noted such differences as greater complexity with respect to the hazards involved in vessels and vessel sections, movement of the vessel (which causes movement of atmospheric hazards), the total number of spaces involved, the multitude of systems (for example, fuel, refrigeration, and compressed air) present on-board ships, and the interrelationships between adjacent vessel sections (that is, hazards in one section can affect procedures to be used in adjacent sections). Nonetheless, most of these commenters contended that the Subpart B requirements were still appropriate for land-side confined spaces (Ex. 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;46). They argued that the Subpart B provisions would afford employees with greater protection than would be provided by ยง1910.146, and that procedures necessary to comply with Subpart B were already in place in most shipyards. OSHA has concluded that it is appropriate to apply revised Subpart B to all phases of shipyard work. The Agency has determined, based on the record, that shipyard employers can readily adapt their ship-side procedures which already conform to these requirements, for use in land-side confined space entry, as well. OSHA has included the phrase ``regardless of geographic location'' in the scope only as a clarification since it has been the Agency's position that this section, and indeed the entire Part 1915, apply to inland shipyard employment.
