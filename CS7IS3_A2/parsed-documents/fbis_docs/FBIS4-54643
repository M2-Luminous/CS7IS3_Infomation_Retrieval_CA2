The radio said in a commentary that Bosnian Muslim President Alija Izetbegovic had sent two letters to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman urging him to salvage the Washington agreement. A letter of a similarly dramatic contents has been sent to Tudjman by Izetbegovic's adviser Slobodan Lang, who warned on returning to Sarajevo from Herzegovina that Muslim-Croat relations were near a breaking point and the Washington agreement would cave in unless something was done, according to Radio Free Europe. The Bosnian Croats and Muslims, who have been engaged in fierce mutual clashes since the beginning of the year, fighting for territories in Herzegovina and central Bosnia, have signed the agreement on a common federation under strong pressure from the United States. So far, none of the dates set in the Washington agreement have been met, according to the Radio Free Europe commentary, which specified that major disagreements existed over personnel issues, primarily the office of president. The Bosnian Croats request that the first president of the federation be a Croat, but are ready to accept as a compromise that the post go to Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Haris Siljadzic but under no condition to Izetbegovic, whose candidacy has already been put up by the Muslim side. The Radio Free Europe commentary said that Croatian media were again presenting the Bosnian Croat state Herzeg-Bosna as a legal political formation of the rank of a state. The commentary said a reflection of the volatile relations between the Croats and Muslims was the recent blowing up of a mosque in the centre of Livno. It quoted the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS as saying that the Muslims in Livno, a town in western Herzegovina, insist that they have been living far worse since the Washington agreement has been signed, that the Croat troops are forcing Muslims to perform various degrading jobs, and are stealing cattle, money and tractors in the nearby villages. The Muslims were also quoted as saying that they were subjected to greater harassment now and that they wanted an integral Bosnia. The Radio Free Europe commentary said that representatives of the local Croat authorities in Sarajevo, which are loyal to Izetbegovic, had visited a number of foreign embassies in Zagreb to warn that the Washington agreement was definitively being torpedoed. According to the commentary, the local Croatian authorities in Sarajevo have warned that attempts are being made at introducing an internal order different from that defined in the adopted constitution, that no steps are being taken whatsoever for the return of the displaced persons, and that war crimes are being denied or minimized.
