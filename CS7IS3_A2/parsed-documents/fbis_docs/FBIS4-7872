And Lilic could say that Yugoslavia needs a parliament that it will be proud of, if it goes down along with the dinar. The federal parliament--after it tried last week to extricate itself from four months of a blockade--became entangled even deeper in the quicksand of complete uncertainty. Just as the Council of Citizens ended its recess and began a session on 2 March, Radoman Bozovic declared another recess on the evening of the very next day. When Bozovic declares a recess, it has never turned out well, at least not so far. The experience of this chamber of parliament and its current membership confirms that any other miracles are possible after a recess. On the night of 31 May-1 June 1993, for instance, bloody demonstrations broke out in front of parliament. The fierce clash between police and demonstrators in front of the Federal Assembly was preceded by an incident in the Assembly building. Bozovic, as always when he is at a dead end or someone tells him "That is necessary," in one classic knockout arbitrated--with a recess. Even after the Assembly was disbanded on 20 October, when Slobodan Milosevic said that the people needed a parliament that it would be proud of, the session of the Council of Citizens ended again with a recess. Bozovic apparently has all the rights to that patent. The people's deputies have not yet come to ask whether he is doing it all himself or whether someone is helping him. It is said, admittedly, that his dossier, after the ministerial scandal, in which Bozovic played the role of the third man, is still on Slobodan Milosevic's desk. Allegedly, whenever the president of Serbia needs that role he reminds Bozovic that 700,000 German marks have not been found yet and that an investigation could begin. Milosevic, according to that scenario, puts pressure on Bozovic and the latter subsequently puts pressure on whomever he needs to. It seems that he does not even have to be particularly persuaded to do so. In contrast to a comic strip, the situation with continuations in the Federal Assembly is incomparably more complicated: They are always announced, but they are never seriously meant. After all, some special customs prevail in parliament, along the lines of "It may be, but it does not have to mean anything." Admittedly, Bozovic more or less promised a continuation "as soon as possible." It was clear that that promise was completely consistent with the promise by his Socialist colleague Milomir Minic, who tried to use the quarrel between the Serbian and Montenegrin Radicals to appeal to the people, who are viewing this performance comfortably and directly. "The people are good at taking the measure of political options which, according to our (the Socialists') understanding, are a transitory phenomenon on the Serbian political scene." The people are asking the Socialists "to be involved in the key issues," and those, according to Minic, are peace, economic renewal, the functioning of a law-governed state, and the unification of political forces in the country. Except for the "two eyes in the head"--the deputies of the Socialist Party of Serbia and the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, who are fraternally pressing each other in an apparently increasingly firmer embrace and more and more exaggeratedly offering proof of their mutual love--all the others in the federal parliament are deeply affected by quarrels and schisms. Kilibarda's four Populists, with all their labor, are still unsuccessfully trying to recall the interests of the people and the state. The "Socialist fortune hunters," as Seselj honored his former allies last Tuesday, and the Radical "street thugs and primitives," as they were already characterized on Wednesday by the Socialist Party of Serbia in an official statement for the public, have taken off the gloves and a fight with bare fists could even start now. The ring has been moved from the Serbian parliament, where it was in the fall, while the Radicals tried unsuccessfully to overthrow Sainovic's government, to the Federal Assembly. The conflict cannot be disguised any longer: the conflict is here. Like every bad alliance or bad marriage, the link between the Socialists and the Radicals apparently also has to collapse with curses, hatred, and a deafening uproar. Since such scenes imply an audience, both the Radicals and the Socialists think that it is good to have the performance take place in public: the people will be able to choose the better ones. It seems that SOMEONE has upset the born Montenegrin, of Serbian origin, and the warlord who is still proud of his confiscated title today, who were constantly caught until last summer in the act of illicit love. Nothing is left of their mutual respect. The final scene of the session that was interrupted last Wednesday (before Bozovic used a recess to prevent something more than a quarrel) shows that at the heart of the parliament there are two angry and merciless enemies, whose quarrels, or something worse than them, are yet to come. Almost driven mad by Seselj's insistence that he stay at the rostrum, Bozovic, perhaps with the intention of keeping the "people" from hearing everything that he would say, pressed the key to turn off the speaker, but poured into in his microphone a whole heap of accusations at his expense. "Your insults are over.... I hope that you are civilized enough for a deputy's seat.... You are uncivilized.... You have misused the podium enough. I will demand that they remove you...." Bozovic got angry, so that finally Seselj retorted with a single sentence, in a similar style, that there would never be an end to Bozovic's insolence. All of this, however, is only details, or at least the outward manifestation of the serious drama through which this parliamentary membership is passing. It is becoming more and more obvious that this Federal Assembly is not lucky with the people's deputies. Just when one thinks that finally it will start to do its job, to pass at least some of the laws which we cannot have done without for a long time now or to deprive the third Yugoslavia of the application of regulations that were in effect in its past, the deadlock appears inevitable. It is not possible to move out of the deadlock to which parliament is constantly returned by the quarrels and incidents. After the split between the Socialists and Radicals, it seemed that the opposition would take fate into its hands in parliament. With the collapse of that alliance, the ruling parties of Serbia and Montenegro lost a majority in the lower chamber. The illusion, however, was only a parliamentary episode, and the opposition deputies, for the most part, were not capable enough to take advantage of that split. In the meantime, while parliament's work was blocked, the "political police," publicly accused of causing conflict within the opposition parties, did not sit with their hands folded. Whether someone outside was undermining the political parties or whether they, like all other organisms, were "multiplying" from themselves, is less important than the already noted fact that divisions within them, usually, indicate new elections. In regard to what is happening in the Federal Assembly, perhaps one of those two historic sentences of Slobodan Milosevic is not unimportant (the first is the one from Kosovo, "No one should beat you"), uttered precisely in parliament, as a message to the Rakovica workers: "And now, everyone to his job." Any good reader of the message realized that the job applied considerably more broadly and deeply than the auditorium in which it was mentioned. Perhaps the "job" had to do with the battle for renewed prestige in parliament? Since the lost majority with which they were faced last October, the Serbian and Montegrin Socialists--as unsurpassable technicians of power--gained (it does not matter whether it was on their own or by assignment) the desired balance of power, in their favor, to such an extent that they virtually no longer needed the opposition. Of the 20 DEPOS (Democratic Movement of Serbia) deputies in the Council of Citizens, 11 (whom the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] were expelled from the party but who nevertheless succeeded in keeping their places on the benches) are "renegades," seven declared themselves to be SPO deputies, and Milorad Savicevic and Pavle Nikolic declared themselves to be "non-party figures." The leader of the SPO, who is demanding a separate deputies' office for his wing of the party, made his seat in the Council of Republics conditional upon a new discussion of depriving the 11 rebels of their seats. The attitude among the Democrats is even apparent in the Assembly restaurant. The new leader, Dr. Zoran Djindjic, represents that party in the Council of Republics, and the old one, Dr. Dragoljub Micunovic, is still considered the leader of the deputies' group in the Council of Citizens. Dr. Miroljub Labus and Miodrag Perisic sit at the table with Djindjic, and Dr. Ivan Vujacic and Desimir Tosic with Micunovic. Djordje Zecevic was also absent from this session, while Dr. Dragan Domazet also went abroad--i.e., the two wings of the Democrats. The Radicals, proud of their party discipline, although they expelled from their ranks three deputies from the Montenegrin SRS [Serbian Radical Party], did not succeed in having granted the desire to deprive them of their seats. Allowing the Montenegrin Radicals to complaint about Seselj, Bozovic, "in the name of defending the status of deputies, rules of procedure, and laws," "verified the will of the Council," and returned the previously denied seats to the Committee on Mandate-Immunity Issues for further consideration. Then the chairman of that committee, Radical Jovan Glamocanin, suddenly submitted his resignation, and the vice president of the Council of Citizens, Maja Gojkovic, saying that she had not agreed with Bozovic for a long time, also ostentatiously left the deputies' bench. The Federal Assembly has been faced with this practice for the first time: Deputies refuse to participate in committees and commissions, but remain in parliament. In the corridors of the Assembly, the question of who will be vicpresident of the Council of Citizens has been answered by the joke that it will be Radmilo Bogdanovic, who was re-elected vice president of the upper chamber that day. Recommended by the Socialists on both sides (the signatures of Radoje Kontic and Milos Radulovic are prominent among the Montenegrin signatures), Bogdanovic was only denied the votes of the Montenegrin Radicals and two Democratic Party deputies. The Council of Republics, on which representatives of the opposition counted so much, has been strengthened in a way that few people could have expected. In addition to Bogdanovic, it now also has two Zorans--Andjelkovic and Solokovic. With a rump composition (16 instead of 20), the Serbian Assembly was able to choose its fiercest fighters. No one paid attention to Novak Kilibarda's criticism that no chamber was constituted with a rump composition anywhere in the world, and that this one should not be constituted when it was reduced by 10 percent of the deputies. Thus, this Council, as in the past, can adopt whatever it cares to routinely and without debate: The majority is always powerful. After all, even before the blockade this chamber was able to choose federal judges, and Dragoslav Jovanovic as governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, or, as now, to adopt the federal budget and later, when it did not get through the other chamber, to get over it and go on. With that kind of Council of Republics and that kind of Council of Citizens, the federal parliament--if it is in the interest of the ruling parties and the current regime--can wait for the next regular elections without doing anything at all. Of course, if the leader of the Radicals does not intend to turn his clash with the federal prime minister about "secret dinners" and "kisses with Dafina" into a demand for the replacement of Kontic's cabinet. It is difficult to say whether Seselj would obtain support from the ranks of the fragile and internally undermined opposition, since only seven deputies raised their hands for his proposal for a vote on violation of the rules of procedure. What could the head of state do in that case? Could Zoran Lilic, on his own or "on assignment," one evening, in the leading news story on state television, be the first one to pound his fist on the table and then say that Yugoslavs needed a parliament that they could be proud of? He could--why not--if he used the contrived recovery of the dinar and the economy. If the new governor really holds out and does not allow printing money for the needs of the budget, and prohibits borrowing for the budget if there is not enough foreign exchange to cover it (and there is no coverage for March), and, all in all, succeeds in surviving until the middle of the year, when many people expect an end for him like Panic's and Cosic's, a celebration has to be arranged for the people. So far they have not had any better entertainment from replacements and elections.
