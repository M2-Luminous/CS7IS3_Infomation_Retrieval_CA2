We have many questions in the wake of Mr. Alexander Watson's visit. Certain political factions are very concerned over the way this gentleman has referred to the Nicaraguan situation. He said Nicaraguans must resolve their own problems. In an interview with us, Luis Sanchez Sancho [secretary general of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party] indicated that this gentleman apparently is obsessed with the Sandinists. This is very discomforting. How did your talks with Mr. Watson go? [Godoy] I would say our conversation was quite ordinary. Of course, it was characterized by the simultaneous discussion of a number of problems. Specifically, the assistant secretary of state talked about what he and his government deem to be a special or key concern -- namely, that Nicaragua is giving no sign of resolving its problems or starting to resolve them, and that there is no evidence of any progress. Nevertheless, Watson did not give an opinion as to the reasons behind this delay in finding solutions. We discussed various issues, many of which focused on economic matters, but finally, after a generally broad analysis, it was concluded by both Watson and those who accompanied him -- namely, Mr. Hamilton and Ambassador Maisto -- that political issues are at the heart of our crisis. This is because there is no other way to explain why Nicaragua has failed to show any growth, even though it has received more economic and financial aid than Panama and El Salvador combined within the same timeframe. Moreover, there are no signs of improvement on the horizon, because there is no evidence that this year will be any different from previous ones. The idea that Nicaraguans should resolve their problems by themselves was again stressed, because there is a clear downward trend in international financial aid, especially aid coming from North America. Therefore, if we fail to take advantage of the aid being offered now, it will be even more difficult to find solutions in the future. I told Mr. Watson that the U.S. decision of not meddling in Nicaragua's internal affairs was very appropriate. I hope, however, that this will prove to be true, because it is one thing to say the United States will not meddle, while it is doing just that in various forms. As I said, it is one thing to say: Solve your own problems, but what is advisable for you to do is such and such, while... [Reporter, interrupting] That is one way of intervening. [Godoy] What is their position then? This is their position on our efforts to resolve our own problems from a Nicaraguan vantage point, with Nicaraguan resources, and with Nicaraguan solutions. I think we had a very lively conversation. Every possible solution and the need to find solutions for the country were discussed. We cannot figure out where to start because all of the options or paths that have been explored have virtually failed, including the path of dialogue, which was frustrated by an executive branch decision. Moreover, the UNO [National Opposition Union] majority in the National Assembly was also broken by an executive branch decision. The executive branch is incompetent. It does not know how to, has not been able to, and has not wanted to efficiently manage those resources placed at its disposal. We are talking about several billions of dollars -- not about old cordobas [chancheros], but billions of dollars. The government even increased Nicaragua's debt. This government inherited a debt of about $12 billion, some $5 billion of which was forgiven, and yet we now owe about $13 billion. In other words, we will be heavily in debt by the time this government finishes its term, and, in turn, we will be less capable of correcting the situation. We discussed all of these issues with Mr. Watson. We spoke with absolutely frankness. I told him that it is not only important for the United States to refrain from intervening, but that it is also important that it not view things solely from a U.S. perspective, because, for example, he mentioned to me his extreme concern over U.S. property that has not yet been returned. I told him: You are right, but Nicaraguans are not interested in U.S. property; we are interested in the return of the property of many thousands of Nicaraguans. This is part of the strife were are experiencing. This is what is behind the lack of trust in the country. I noted that this has caused the government to loose credibility very dramatically. Finally, the most disturbing result from all of this is that the country has come under an enormous cloak of juridical uncertainty. Therefore, nobody wants, desires, or expects to invest here, because they think we do not have adequate conditions, considering that our government fails to deliver on its promises out of sympathy for or fear of the Sandinists, and I pointed this out to Mr. Watson. This is our reality. The country is adrift, and it cannot find a starting point for resolving its problems. [Reporter] Dr. Godoy, was it brought up to you... [pauses] Did you bring up the issue of human rights in this country -- the murder of more than 250 Nicaraguan Resistance members and crimes that have never been solved, such as those involving Bermudez and Jean Paul? In fact, a report issued by the U.S. State Department was based on human rights violations in this country. [Godoy] We did not touch on this directly, but it was indirectly discussed in the context of an exchange on the judicial branch's lack of credibility. In other words, our judicial system is not meeting the expectations of a true de jure state. In turn, this does not help people feel safe and secure. I said to him: If you asked your ambassador in Managua about the long lines of people at the consulate applying for visas to travel to the United States, you would certainly be told that people are again arriving there in the early hours of the morning and standing in long lines in an attempt to get a visa to go to the United States. Why is this? Because the country has failed to provide the conditions to keep people here. We quickly reviewed this situation because not much can be done in one hour, which is how long our meeting lasted, but we did discuss all discussable issues. We also talked about the problems the government has created for itself. I told him there are black holes in the government that nobody can explain; nobody knows what has happened. A case in point is Cornap [National Corporations of the Public Sector]. The government has spent three years privatizing it, but nobody knows what criteria was used, nobody knows the results of this privatization, and there is no reliable report; there is nothing. This is the only country that dishes out money in its privatization process. It is an extremely poor country, one of the poorest, and yet it dishes out millions of dollars to privatize. The buyer of a state-owned company or property not only gets the property for a song -- and, indeed, influence-peddlers are involved here -- but he also receives millions to start a new life. All of these things fail to help clarify the situation in any way. As I told Romerito [not further identified], on 15 March, I think, they are about to implement the social mobilization plan to fire 15,000 state employees, because the size of the state must be reduced. Nevertheless, it happens that some are being fired while others are being hired. This government started with 11 ministries, but now there are 14 of them. There has been a permanent string of lies. [passage omitted] [Reporter] What does Mr. Watson think about the Army? [Godoy] He indicated to me that President Chamorro promised that General Humberto Ortega will leave the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] this year. Is this enough? No, it is not. This is what we have been saying for some time. In a way, the Army has become its own state; it is not within the state, but above the state. Such a situation would not be favorable anywhere in the universe. There must be a review to ensure that -- if indeed this institution, which produces nothing more than expenses for the country, should continue to exist -- then it should be strictly subordinated to civilian power. It should be subordinated to civilian power, otherwise, the game will continue. We will pretend to be doing something that is not being done. This is a double standard that has created confusion in the country, which has taken away trust in it, and that has deprived the nation of juridical certainty. This has helped create the stagnation we have been facing for so many years. [passage omitted]
