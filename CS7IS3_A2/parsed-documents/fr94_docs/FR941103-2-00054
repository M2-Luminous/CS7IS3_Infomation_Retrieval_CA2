FR941103-2-00054 FR941103-2-00031 2. Several informal meetings were held between the publication of the July 1, 1993, FRN and the beginning of the public rate adjustment process. These meetings, involving personnel from Western, Reclamation, and represen- tatives from organizations of interested parties, produced many issue papers that identified and discussed the items which should be considered in a firm power rate adjustment. Agreement as to how to approach many of the issues was reached during this time, considerably reducing the number of unresolved issues and easing the later formal public process. 3. On December 27, 1993, letters were mailed from Western's Loveland, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City Area Offices to all Integrated Projects customers and other interested parties announcing an informal public meeting to be held on January 31, 1994. 4. At the informal meeting held on January 31, 1994, Western and Reclamation representatives explained the need for a rate increase and answered questions. 5. An FRN was published on April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19008), officially announc- ing the proposed firm-power rate adjustment, initiating the public consultation and comment period, announcing the public information and public comment forums, and presenting procedures for public participation. 6. On April 22, 1994, a rate announcement package was mailed from Western's Salt Lake City Area Office to all Integrated Projects customers and other interested parties announcing the publication of the FRN of April 21, 1994, and the beginning of the formal public process to adjust firm power rates. The package contained (1) a letter announcing the upcoming public information and comment forums, (2) a copy of the April 21 FRN, and (3) a copy of the April 1994 Integrated Projects Firm Power Rate Adjustment brochure. Rate announcement packages were mailed to customers served by Western's Loveland and Phoenix Area Offices on April 25, 1994. 7. At the public information forum held on May 24, 1994, Western and Reclamation representatives explained the need for the rate increase in greater detail and answered questions. 8. The comment forum was held on June 30, 1994, to give the public an opportunity to comment for the record. Four persons representing customers and customer groups made oral comments. 9. Nine comment letters were received during the 97-day consultation and comment period. The consultation and comment period was originally scheduled to end on July 20, 1994. A letter was sent to all interested parties from the SLCAO on July 19, 1994, stating that Western would continue to accept written comments through July 27, 1994. Letters were mailed from the Loveland and Phoenix Area Offices on July 20, 1994. All comments submitted by the end of the comment period have been considered in the preparation of this rate order. Project History The Integrated Projects consist of the CRSP and the Rio Grande and Collbran Projects. The projects were integrated for marketing and ratemaking purposes on October 1, 1987. The goals of integration were to increase marketable resources, simplify contract and rate development and project administration, assure repayment of Collbran and Rio Grande Projects' costs, and create a common rate. The projects maintain their individual identities for financial accounting and repayment purposes, but their revenue requirements are integrated into one PRS for ratemaking. Power Repayment Studies PRSs are prepared each FY to determine if power revenues will be sufficient to pay, within the prescribed time periods, all costs assigned to power. Repayment criteria are based on law, policies, authorizing legislation, and DOE Order RA 6120.2.
