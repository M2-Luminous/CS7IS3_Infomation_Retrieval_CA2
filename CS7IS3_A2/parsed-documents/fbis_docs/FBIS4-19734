We Will Get it"] [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Caprettini] Mr. Bossi, can you tell us what your expectations are in relation to the government which will soon be formed? [Bossi] Mind you, it will not be formed immediately. We must wait at least until 25 April before we can begin, right? [Caprettini] If you say so... But does the League have any suggestions to make to Berlusconi? [Bossi] We are saying that we cannot waste the electoral victory. The government will have to get busy to get the changes we have envisaged under way. Otherwise... [Caprettini] Does the change include the federalist prerequisite being fulfilled within a few months? [Bossi] Of course, the federalist prerequisite still stands. However, this must be implemented without frightening people. If people are scared, we will achieve the opposite of what we want. In any case, we will find the right solution within a reasonable timeframe. [Caprettini] Tell us, Mr. Bossi, what about the ministers? Have you already put forward your requests? What are your requests? [Bossi] We have not yet started discussing the government. We are dealing with other matters. As far as the composition of the ministries is concerned we have not made any requests. Everybody is keeping silent on the subject, perhaps because each party is preparing the cards that must be played at the right moment. [Caprettini] What about your cards, Mr. Bossi. Are they ready? [Bossi] Of course. [Caprettini] I am not asking you to show them now, but could you at least tell us what sort of game you will be playing? [Bossi] Well, clearly we cannot ask for all the ministries, but some are... so to speak... at the top of the list. [Caprettini] Let me phrase the question another way: Did Berlusconi accept your request concerning antitrust legislation? [Bossi] Of course he accepted it. Liberalism and federalism are the hubs of our involvement. If they are missing... The problem, at this stage, is that whoever supervises these two areas must be credible. He must be convinced of the need for action. Therefore... [Caprettini] In short, have you secured the post of deputy prime minister for Roberto Maroni [League lower house floor leader], or not? [Bossi] This matter is still uncertain. However, we will be putting forward specific requests. [Caprettini] It is rumored that these will concern, among other things, the Interior Ministry. [Bossi] Well, clearly the Interior Ministry cannot be taken over by someone from National Alliance, nor can it go to a former DC [Christian Democratic Party] member. That leaves us and Forza Italia. We will see... taking also into account the fact that the Interior Ministry includes the problem of local government (Bossi was referring to the ministry's central office controlling local government -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note). This is why we must first understand whether it will be possible to reform the ministry itself. [Caprettini] There is a lot of talk about purportedly external experts for important ministries -- the Interior Ministry, but also the Budget Ministry, for which Dini's name is being mentioned. [Bossi] Technicians? Nonsense! What we need is politicians. As far as the Budget Ministry is concerned, we have a name ready: Gianfranco Pagliarini. [Caprettini] What do you think of the possibility of entrusting some of the parliamentary committees, say the bicameral committees, to the opposition? [Bossi] I think that these committees must be entrusted to the party which is the best guarantor of democratic rules, namely the League. [Caprettini] Mr. Bossi, what are you requesting, in short, from Berlusconi in order to join the government? [Bossi] We can make many requests, but this is not the real issue. The question is not quantity, though in this respect we could also make ourselves heard, but rather the quality of our presence. We must not waste the electoral victory.
