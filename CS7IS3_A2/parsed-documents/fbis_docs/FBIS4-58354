This relationship, which began 35 years ago, has continued to acquire substance and solidity in the cauldron of the battles of struggle and reconstruction through all the trials until it has, today, become a rare fabric, which no enemy can penetrate or undermine. Needless to say, this special relationship has not come out of vacuum, nor has it been formed in one battle or occasion. It is also, certainly, not a lop-sided relationship such as some leaders and rulers have with their peoples, but is an intimate, solid, and strong human relationship based on the strong pillars of affection, confidence, respect and the truest meanings of affiliation and loyalty. The first time Iraqis heard the name Saddam Husayn was in 1959 when people spoke admirably and appreciatively of the great deed by the loyal and courageous Ba'thist youth who, along with fellow Ba'thists, liquidated the dictator 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim on al-Rashid Street. And, in 1964 Ba'thist strugglers began to understand and feel through practical experience that the leadership of their young comrade Saddam Husayn was of a historic, invasive, and daring type that played a basic role in rebuilding the party and unifying it on the organizational and intellectual levels, and that it was pursuing the party's national and pan-Arab struggle despite all the challenges and hardships placed in its way by the renegades. Following the glorious 17-30 July Revolution, Iraqis understood that leader President Saddam Husayn, who devoted his life to the service of the Iraqi people and the Arab nation and the achievement of the historical national and pan-Arab aims and ambitions, was in fact the engineer, planner, and brain behind all the great achievements and victories the revolution had achieved since 1968. It must be said here that the evil enemies have also realized at an early stage that one of the sources of Iraq's strength is this intimate relationship and rare unity between the people and their leader. So, it is natural for the evil forces to target the symbol and leader of Iraq and his intimate relationship with the people by trying hard to drive a wedge between them. At a time when the enemies are wagering and concentrating their efforts on penetrating and undermining this unique relationship, the glorious Iraqis, who are certain that Saddam Husayn is the guarantor of their continuous victories, the captain who will sail their ship to safety, and the leader of their march on the path of progress and advancement, got even more attached to his historic leadership, expressed their determination to adhere more and more to the symbol of their struggle and dignity, and affirmed their resolve to march forward under his flag; the flag of Allahu Akbar. It was also clear during the immortal Mother of Battles that the U.S.-NATO coalition was wagering on splitting this humane relationship between the people and their leader. The best proof of this wager is the U.S. Administration's insistence on continuing the unfair blockade on the Iraqi people without any legal or political justifications as indicated by the openly hostile U.S. acts and statements. But what has happened and is happening now clearly shows that the evil forces are discovering with time that their wager has failed miserably and that they have failed and will continue to fail to undermine this relationship which they have been targeting for four years to no avail. In fact, the evil forces are now certain that this relationship that they are trying to undermine is getting stronger and has become one impenetrable unit despite all their conspiratorial plans, political and economic pressure, and cheap propaganda campaigns. Indeed, this noble relationship has resisted all the mean imperialist-Zionist wagers and plans. The evil and aggressive forces are convinced that they cannot penetrate it and that what they have done and are doing to this end is of no avail and will absolutely not change the loyal Iraqi people's stand toward their historic leader and righteous son, Saddam Husayn. Therefore, the evil forces have no choice but to give up their mean endeavor and to seriously reconsider all their hostile policies toward steadfast Iraq, which is what they are doing now.
