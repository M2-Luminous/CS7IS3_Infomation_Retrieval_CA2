First Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chetha Thanajaro said representatives from both sides would first hold unofficial talks to accelerate the negotiation process, and that the meeting itself will discuss the agreed topics and details. He said bilateral problems abound since the two countries share an over 2,000-km-long border, but that previous meetings had gradually helped resolve several thorny issues. Many problems cannot be settled in one go, and both sides have to hold several more rounds of negotiations to finalize their agreement, he added. "For example, on the question of illegal (Burmese) immigrants, they (Burmese officials) have pledged to tighten up their control, and thus the number has dr@pped from over 300,000 to about 200,000," he said. Bangkok will be the venue of the first three-day meeting, while both sides will meet on the fourth in Pattaya. The Burmese team, headed by Southern Commander Maj Gen Khet Sein, will on Friday pay a visit to the petrochemical industries in Lam Chabang Eastern Seaboard.
