Upon completion of the above process, unallocated mandates shall be added to the number of mandates available from the national slate. 8.4. If a mandate is acquired pursuant to Paragraph 8.3., the difference between the number of votes required to acquire a mandate, and the number of votes actually cast for the candidate shall be deducted from the national aggregate number of fractional votes allocated to the party that nominated the candidate. 8.5.

Special elections shall be held if, due to the lack of party slates, no first or second rounds of election were held in a regional voting district. (Paragraph 46.) 9.1. Candidates fielded on the national slates shall receive their mandates in proportion to the national aggregate number of fractional votes, and in the order of the announcement of such fractional votes.

Votes cast in an invalid round of elections shall not be regarded as fractional votes and therefore shall be disregarded from the standpoint of mandates to be acquired from national slates. Similarly, the number of votes cast for a party's regional slate, whose national aggregate number of votes does not exceed four percent of the national aggregate number of votes cast for the regional slates of all parties, shall not be regarded as fractional votes. 9.3. Parties having filed notice no later than eight days prior to the elections of their intent to combine their national slates shall receive mandates in proportion to the combined total number of fractional votes allocated to their slates.

Method of calculation for tallying votesand for determining the outcome of elections I. Individual voting district 1. Valid and invalid round of election: (a) Valid first round of election A first round of election is valid if more than half the number of eligible voters cast votes (b) Invalid first round of election A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or fewer eligible voters cast votes. (c) Valid second round of election A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is valid if more than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. (d) Invalid second round of election A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is invalid if fewer than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. 2. Successful or unsuccessful round of election: (a) Successful first round of election A valid first round of election is successful (Point 1/a) if a candidate receives more than half the number of votes cast. (b) Unsuccessful first round of election A valid first round of election is unsuccessful (Point 1/a) if no candidate receives more than half the number of votes cast. (c) Successful second round of election A valid second round of election after a valid (Point 1/a) or invalid (Point 1/b) first round of election is successful if the votes cast for the various candidates differ. (d) Unsuccessful second round of election A valid second round of election (Point 1/c) is unsuccessful if the candidates received equal numbers of votes. In individual voting districts the candidate receiving in the valid round of election the number of votes specified in Points 2/a or 2/c shall become the National Assembly representative. II. Regional voting district 1. Valid and invalid round of election: (a) Valid first round of election A first round of election is valid if more than half the number of eligible voters cast votes. (b) Invalid first round of election A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or fewer eligible voters cast votes. (c) Valid second round of election A second round of election after an invalid first round of election (Point 1/b) is valid if more than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. (d) Invalid second round of election A second round of election after an invalid first round of election (Point 1/b) is invalid if one-fourth the number of eligible voters or fewer eligible voters cast votes. 2. Preconditions for calculating the outcome of regional slate election results: (a) national tally of votes cast for regional slates, separately per party; (b) identification of parties whose national vote total does not exceed the four percent margin established in Paragraph 8.5. of the Law. 3. Calculating results in a valid round of elections held in a regional voting district: (a) The number of votes cast for the various parties' electoral slates shall be added up (hereinafter: the total number of valid votes). (b) One additional mandate shall be added to the number of mandates that can be obtained in a voting district (hereinafter: divider). (c) The total number of valid votes shall be divided by the divider. The quotient thus derived represents the number of votes needed to acquire a mandate. (d) The number representing two-thirds of the number of votes needed to acquire a mandate shall be calculated (hereinafter: two-thirds limit). (e) The number of votes cast for a given party slate shall be divided by the number of votes required to acquire a mandate. The whole number derived as a result of the division equals the number of mandates acquired by the party, in due regard to the provisions of Paragraph 8.8. of the Law. The remainder after the division, as well as votes not resulting in mandates constitute fractional votes. (f) If, after the division pursuant to Point (e) there remains an unallocated mandate, parties receive mandates in the declining order of fractional votes cast for parties, up to the two-thirds limit. If all mandates are distributed in a given voting district, no additional mandates shall be distributed, irrespective of the two-thirds limit. Except for fractional votes defined in Paragraph 8.4. of the Law, fractional votes not resulting in mandates shall be added to the national slate. (g) After completing the calculation specified in Point (f), above, in a regional voting district, the still unallocated mandates shall be added to the national slate. III. Distribution of mandates that can be acquiredfrom national slates based on fractional votes 1. Fractional votes resulting in individual and regional voting districts (Paragraphs 9.1.a. and 9.1.b.) shall be added up on a nationwide basis separately for each party, in due regard to the provisions of Paragraph 8.4 of the Law (hereinafter: total number of fractional votes cast for a party). 2. The number of fractional votes cast for all the parties throughout the country shall be a added up (hereinafter: national fractional vote). 3. The number of mandates not allocated from regional slates (Point II/3/g) shall be added to the maximum number of mandates that can be acquired from the national slate (58). 4. The national aggregate number of fractional votes shall be divided by the number of unallocated mandates per Point 3 above. The resultant quotient shall represent the number of votes required to allocate a mandate. 5. The number of fractional votes cast for any given party shall be divided by the number of votes required for the allocation of a mandate. The whole number quotient derived as a result of the division shall represent the number of mandates to be allocated to any given party. Fractions and fractional votes not resulting in mandates shall be the repeat fractional votes (hereinafter: repeat fractional votes). 6. If after the division specified in Point 5 above there remains an unallocated mandate, the number of repeat fractional votes shall be divided by the number of unallocated mandates. This calculation produces the number of votes required for allocating one mandate. The allocation of mandates shall be continued based on the new quotient and on repeat fractional votes in a declining order, until the number of mandates shown in Point 3 above are allocated. 7. If, after completing the calculation pursuant to Point 6 above, there remain unallocated mandates, the calculation shall be repeated after deducting the already allocated mandates and the number of votes already taken into consideration. IV. Relationship between the 4-percent limitand the mandates that can be acquiredthrough regional slates 1. The number of votes cast for regional slates nationwide shall be added up separately for each party (hereinafter: number of slate votes cast for a party). 2. Slate votes cast for all parties shall be added up (hereinafter: number of slate votes cast). 3. Four percent of the number of slate votes cast shall be calculated. 4. Any party receiving more slate votes than the four percent margin, shall receive the mandates acquired in the regional voting district, as well as mandates from the national slate, based on fractional votes. 5. Any party receiving fewer slate votes than the four percent margin shall (a) lose the fractional votes acquired in the individual voting district, (b) not acquire mandates from the regional voting district, and shall (c) not acquire mandates from the national slate.

A computer program shall be established for processing the data, on the basis of which any correction or change entered in the course of totaling the votes can be verified and identified subsequently. 7. After the election, based on the personal identification numbers of voters having cast votes, the computerized service shall prepare a record of voters who cast votes in two or more precincts, and shall present such record to the administrative boards. This means that the computerized service shall verify whether persons voting in their temporary residences cast votes in two or more precincts. 8. After making public the preliminary national results of the elections, and before announcing final results, the votes shall be totalled once again based on minutes maintained in precincts. [Signed] Dr. Matyas Szuros, provisional president of the Republic;Dr. Istvan Fodor, acting president of the National Assembly LEGISLATIVE INTENT to the legislative proposal on theElection of National Assembly Representatives GENERAL INTENT Our history, and close to 1,000 years of statehood have taught us that the Hungarian people always had a sincere desire to enforce their right and to perform their responsibility to direct and shape their own fortunes. After aspiring for freedom and independence for centuries, at the end of the 20th Century we once again have an opportunity to establish a constitutional state consistent with European concepts of freedom--a century that put to test individuals as well as nations. The substance of suffrage and representation is the most sensitive issue from the standpoint of public law. Exercising the right to vote--a political right to which every citizen is entitled--is also the means for establishing a representative body. The provisions of an electoral law by which a representative body is created must not be based on arbitrary criteria. The standards contained in such law must be organically related to existing social conditions, and a true reflection of the relative strength of various political forces must be guaranteed. In addition to introducing the fundamental institutions of direct, democratic representation (popular referendums, popular initiatives, and so forth)--the subjects of unfair neglect in the past, to be used in a reasonable manner and with moderation under law in the future--secure foundations for governance will, undoubtedly, be established by the periodic renewal of representative bodies based on the people's will. This is a common characteristic of every modern, democratic, constitutional state. At the present stage of our social development we must establish a system of political representation in which the policy-formulating influence and strength of political parties increases, in addition to having reliable and credible people, fit to perform the tasks. The new electoral law is not simple, because it is adapted to the existing transitional and evolving social and political conditions. The Proposal provides for a mixed electoral system that aims for proportional representation, as a result of which 176 representatives will be elected from individual voting districts, and 152 representative mandates will be acquired by parties based on votes cast for regional (county) slates of candidates. An additional 58 candidates will be chosen from national slates of candidates to compensate for disproportions resulting from votes cast for candidates running in individual voting districts or fielded on regional slates. The proposed law represents a departure from the mechanisms and institutions for nominating candidates used so far. It eliminates previous restrictions and establishes new legal criteria for nominating candidates. Procedural rules guarantee the freedom and fairness of elections. From the standpoint of openness, the freedom to conduct election campaigns, and the availability of judicial recourse, the Proposal withstands any comparison. The Proposal guarantees rights to citizens, while it primarily prescribes duties for state agencies, organizations involved in the administration of the elections, and for the mass media: it assigns tasks to be performed by them to help citizens enforce their rights. SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS 1. The Proposal preserves the traditional and democratic basic principles of elections: Suffrage is general and equal, and secret ballots are cast directly for candidates. 2. The Proposal provides a narrower definition of disenfranchised persons than before. The fact that disenfranchisement can only occur pursuant to law, based on the judgment of a court serves as a guarantee. In a departure from legal provisions presently in force, the Proposal also provides a right to be elected: Any person with a permanent residence in Hungary and entitled to vote can also be elected. The fact that Hungarian citizens staying abroad on election day, or whose permanent or temporary residence is not in Hungary, are regarded as impeded from the standpoint of casting votes, is a new element in the Proposal. This new provision is based on the fact that the Proposal views suffrage as a basic political right to which every Hungarian citizen is entitled, and regards persons staying abroad for long or short periods of time as impeded only insofar as the exercise of that right is concerned. 3. The eligible voters' free choice between exercising or not exercising the right to vote, as provided for by the Proposal, is significant as a matter of principle. This provision establishes an absolute opportunity for the exercise of the right to vote, but not a legal obligation to vote. 4. An extremely large variety of electoral procedures are used by various countries having multi-party systems. One finds examples for systems based purely on voting for slates of candidates, and others based exclusively on systems of individual voting districts, and yet others, in which the two systems are combined. At present, the appropriate system to be adopted in Hungary is one that combines slate voting linked to the various parties, and voting for candidates running in individual voting districts--a system in which every vote counts. Consistent with the above, the Proposal provides for an electoral system that combines slate voting and voting for individual candidates, and different rules to be observed in electing representatives running or fielded in individual voting districts and in regional (county, Budapest) voting districts. About 60,000 residents elect a representative from each individual voting district. Voters may cast two votes, and receive two ballot forms to do so. One is used to cast a vote for a candidate running in the individual voting district, the other for casting a vote for one of the county (Budapest) slates of candidates fielded by the various parties. The winning candidate in an individual voting district receives a mandate. Votes cast in individual and regional voting districts nationwide, not materializing in individual or slate mandates, are added up, and 58 mandates are allocated to the national slates of parties in proportion to the aggregate number of "fractional votes" cast for each party. As a result of this combined electoral system, 176 representatives will be elected to serve in the National Assembly from individual voting districts, 152 representatives from regional voting districts, and 58 representatives from national slates of candidates. There will be a total of 386 National Assembly representatives. The legal status of each representative is equal; the way they acquire their mandates--from individual or regional voting districts, or from national slates--has no bearing on their status. 5. The method of nominating candidates for National Assembly representative varies according to the differences specified in Paragraph 4. Persons eligible to vote, and their social organizations qualifying under the law on the functioning and management of parties may, in their own right, nominate candidates to run in individual voting districts. Only persons eligible to vote may be nominated, and an additional condition requires that 750 nominating slips be collected from persons residing in the voting district and eligible to vote. Candidates nominated by eligible voters, or by social organizations which do not organize themselves as parties are called "independent candidates." Parties may field candidates in regional voting districts only if they also field candidates in at least one-fourth the number of voting districts within the regional voting district, but in no event fewer than two voting districts. The intent of this provision is to prevent weightless, ad hoc groupings without grass roots support to play a role in Budapest or county public life. Parties fielding at least seven regional slates may field candidates on national slates. The Proposal enables parties to nominate the same person as a candidate in an individual voting district and a regional voting district, and, in addition, to list that person's name on the party's national slate. This enables parties to provide a greater chance to persons they regard as particularly important from their own standpoints. 6. Consistent with the new order of nomination, the Proposal conditions candidacy by a statement to be issued by the candidate, in addition to requirements established earlier in the Proposal (signatures of support, and the established ratio of candidates fielded). Candidates must issue statements attesting to the fact that they are eligible voters and that they accept the nomination, and must also state that they hold no office inconsistent with the representative mandate, and that they would resign such office, if elected. The Constitution specifies these conflict of interest rules. Candidates conforming with these conditions are registered by election boards without further evaluation. The sole reason for which election boards can reject candidates is noncompliance with established legal criteria. 7.-9. Consistent with the logic applied to nominations, election results are also determined on the basis of different sets of rules. The fact that a certain proportion of eligible voters must cast votes for a representative to be elected is a common rule. In the first round of elections the criterion of validity is that more than half the number of eligible voters cast votes. Since greater public interest is attached to the allocation of a representative mandate than to holding a third or fourth round of elections, an auxiliary rule recognizes the votes of one-fourth the number of eligible voters as the validity criterion for a second round of elections. Two rounds of elections may be held in individual voting districts. A candidate running in an individual voting district acquires his mandate in the first round of elections, if he receives more than half the number of valid votes cast. The first round of elections is invalid if no candidate receives more than half the number of valid votes cast. Candidates receiving more than 15 percent of the valid votes cast in the first round of elections may run in the second round of elections. Unless at least three persons receive 15 percent of the valid votes cast, the three candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the first round of elections may run in the second round of elections. The mandate is awarded in the second round of elections to the candidate receiving the highest number of votes. Parties fielding regional slates of candidates receive mandates in proportion to the number of votes cast for their respective slates. Party candidates receive mandates in the sequence in which candidates have been announced by their respective parties, the exact number of such candidates depending on the proportion of votes cast for each party. The Appendix to this Law describes the exact method by which these proportions and the award of mandates are to be calculated; the method was specified in due regard to international experience and traditions followed in Hungary. In order to enforce the principle of majority rule, the Proposal establishes two barriers in the path of mandates to be acquired from slates. One is that mandates cannot be acquired with fewer votes than two-thirds the number of votes calculated and required for the acquisition of a mandate in any given regional voting district. [The other barrier:] Parties acquiring fewer than four percent of the votes cast for all the parties in a regional voting district cannot receive mandates either from their regional, or from their national slates of candidates. This solution ensures that National Assembly decisions are made solely by political forces that enjoy actual societal support. Voters do not cast votes for the national slates of candidates; instead, parties receive mandates after the national aggregate number of fractional votes is known, pursuant to the method of calculation specified in the Appendix to this law. 10. The proposal provides great latitude in the election campaign for both voters and parties. It only prohibits the solicitation of nominating slips in places where such activity is regarded as unacceptable annoyance (in the patient care sections of health care institutions, on mass transportation vehicles), and where the influencing of voters is not desirable due to relationships of dependence, and therefore must be prohibited by law (workplaces, armed forces). Signatures for nominating candidates must be provided on slips received by every registered voter, as part of a notice advising the voter that he is registered. If in doubt, the election board verifies the authenticity of signatures. Eligible voters are free to organize election rallies, and such rallies are open to the public. The organizer of a rally is responsible for maintaining order. 11.-12. To ensure equal chances for every party, the Proposal provides for the mass media (Hungarian Radio, Hungarian Press, Hungarian Telegraphic Office [MTI] to participate in the election campaign. To ensure an atmosphere in which the free expression of the voters' will is not influenced during the period immediately preceding election day, and on election day, the Proposal restricts the publication of public opinion poll results, and prohibits campaigning beginning at 0000 hours the day before the elections. 13. As part of the rules governing the election campaign, the Proposal provides for the preparation of wall posters, advertisements, signs and pamphlets. Such campaign material may be prepared without special permit. The Proposal restricts the placement and posting of posters only to protect public and private interests. These include: the placement of posters on building walls and fences only with the building owner's or manager's permission. Local councils may define by ordinance public buildings and parts of public areas where the placement of election advertisements and wall posters is prohibited in order to protect the appearance of a city, historical places, the environment, or interests related to foreign tourism. 14.-18. Detailed rules concerning the method of voting have not undergone fundamental changes, but are supplemented by stronger guarantees to ensure the fairness of elections. A new provision includes the requirement that polling places cannot be established in buildings exclusively used by one or another political party; that pens, rather than pencils be used to mark ballot forms; and that the first person casting a vote at a polling place must also check the ballot boxes. Consistent with rules now in force, the chairman of the returning board is responsible for maintaining order at the polling place and its vicinity, and the policeman on duty at the polling place may enter the polling place only with the permission of the chairman of the returning board. 19. Consistent with the electoral system characterized by two votes to be cast, separate ballot forms are provided for voting for individual district candidates, and for regional slates, respectively. 20. The method of voting differs from the practice followed thus far. The earlier negative voting (crossing out the name of a candidate not desired) is replaced by positive voting: A "+" mark must be placed in the box on the ballot form next to the candidate's and the party's name. Votes can only be cast for candidates and parties appearing on the ballot form, by designating the candidate and the party slate for whom the voter casts his vote. Parties establish fixed slates, i.e., voters can cast their votes only for the slate as a whole. Therefore, with respect to an otherwise valid vote (in which the official ballot form is used and it is clear for which party slate the vote is cast), changes made in the sequence of the candidates within a slate, deletions from, or additions to the slate must be disregarded. Such votes must be regarded as valid votes cast for a given party slate. 21.-25. The Proposal does not change the rules for, and the traditional order of the voting process, with which people are familiar. The proposal introduces only a few supplemental rules that strengthen the societal openness of the elections. These include a requirement that a copy of the minutes containing the election results be deposited to the archives in the area of jurisdiction, and that ballots cast be preserved until the final settlement of possible pending judicial proceedings challenging the election results. 26.-34. The establishment and composition of administrative boards involved in the elections are consistent with practices based on the principle of having [several] parties. Notably: every party that fields a candidate and the representative of every independent candidate is, by law, a member of the relevant administrative board. The chairmen and secretaries of administrative boards are impartial; neither of these officials can be members of a party fielding candidates, nor can they be representatives of an independent candidate. A fixed number of members in each administrative body is chosen either by the National Assembly, or by councils. Elective and delegated members of administrative bodies have equal rights and duties. 35. Working groups without any decision-making authority assist in the functioning of the administrative bodies. These groups perform administrative, technical, and organizing functions. Members of the working group take an oath to unconditionally uphold legality. 36.-39. The method of forming precincts remains unchanged as compared to rules presently in force. The State Census Bureau continues to prepare the register of voters. The manner in which the register is compiled, the display of the register for public inspection, and rules for legal recourse against the illegal exclusion or inclusion of a voter have not changed. 40. The proposal retains previous provisions permitting people to vote with certificates, but includes additional safeguards to prevent possible abuse of this opportunity. Certificates must be preserved as part of the election documents, so that in case of doubt--e.g. in court proceedings--the validity of votes cast based on certificates may be proven in a credible manner. 41. Openness plays a definitive role in ensuring the fairness of elections. Accordingly, provisions to the effect that actions and operations of administrative boards are matters of public record, and that data and facts available to administrative boards cannot be classified as secrets, reflect adherence to significant principles. The populace must be informed of every fact, deadline, or information related to the elections and of interest to the public. Members of the press need no separate permit to observe the workings of the administrative boards, and therefore the Proposal lifts constraints that existed earlier. Only one restriction exists, notably: on election day, in order to safeguard the fairness of the elections: partial election results must not be made public prior to 2000 hours, i.e., the final hour when polls close according to the law. The amount of funds available to candidates and to parties for the campaign, and the kinds of funds they use for various purposes is of public concern, and therefore is also part of openness. For this reason, these data must be publicized by the press. 42.-45. From the standpoint of ensuring the legality of elections and of protecting the exercise of fundamental political rights, provisions pertaining to judicial recourse, as contained in the Proposal, are of outstanding importance. The basic feature of the system of legal recourse is that the administrative boards provide first instance remedies to actions objected to. The aggrieved party may turn to the courts, if an administrative board rejects an objection. A one-step court proceeding not subject to appeal is provided for. 46. Special elections must be held in both individual and regional voting districts, if the second round of an election is also invalid because fewer than one-quarter the number of eligible voters participated, or because the election could not be held in lack of a candidate or a slate. Special elections must be held in individual voting districts only when the mandate of a representative expires. (Criteria for such expiration are detailed in the Constitution.) Mandates vacated by representatives elected from regional or national slates may be disposed of by the party that established the slate. The party that established the slate may designate any representative from the slate to fill the vacated mandate. The sole condition established in this regard is that the party select a person announced by the party to be included in the slate at the time of the general elections; the sequence of the candidates on the slate may be disregarded. Even though special elections could also produce fractional votes, special election results have no effect on mandates allocated from the national slate. 47. The temporary exemption from under regular or reserve military duty, and the free of charge access to public transportation enjoyed by candidates are intended to provide opportunities for the candidates' real participation in the election campaign. 48. Based on a new feature in the elections--the use of computer technology--which increases openness and permits faster communications to the public, the Proposal distinguishes between preliminary and final election results. Preliminary results are published in daily newspaper, while final results appear in MAGYAR KOZLONY. 49. Rules pertaining to the calling of elections are contained in the Constitution; the electoral law has to settle only the duration of the election proceedings. This remains unchanged: the duration is 90 days. 50.-51. The National Assembly appropriates funds to cover the cost of state functions related to the elections. Budgeted funds must be used to finance the expenditures of the state on the one hand, and the costs incurred by the various parties participating in the elections, on the other. The latter must be financed in order to ensure equal opportunity for all parties to win. The Proposal establishes standard amounts of support for the various parties: they receive state contributions in proportion to the candidates fielded. Independent candidates are entitled to the same amount of support as candidates nominated by parties. 53. Consistent with his changed role, the minister of the interior directs the state functions related to the preparation and implementation of elections. 54. The proposal continues to exempt proceedings related to the elections and to the entitlement to vote from under payment of official dues. 55. The Legislative Law requires that all laws be in mutual harmony from the standpoint of both content and form. It would be appropriate to place provisions of this law referring to election rallies under the authority of the Law on the Right to Assemble, and the text of the law must be changed accordingly. 56. The Proposal provides that the Law take effect on the day of its proclamation. Following the effective date, provisions of Law No. 3 of 1983 must still be applied insofar as the election of council members is concerned.
