For reasons just as good as this in 1939 we might have said that we would become more independent if we got to decide on these issues as a member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics," Keijo Korhonen, a rank-and-file member of the People's Independence Front of Finland, quipped. Korhonen was referring to a statement made by bank director Kalevi Sorsa at a Better Alternative -- a European Finland, Inc. news conference held last weekend. At that time Sorsa declared that he thought that the most telling argument of factions opposed to European Union [EU] membership was loss of independence. Sorsa said that, after considering many factors, he had come to the conclusion that Finland would become more independent as a member of the EU as compared with its present situation, in which Finland just goes along with decisions made elsewhere through the EEA [European Economic Area]. "As a member, we will participate in influencing decisions," said Sorsa, who viewed the EU's discussion of a prescribed minority these past few weeks as a good indication of with what indifference Community members regard outsiders. Now that the national referendum on European Union membership is approaching, supporters and opponents are quickly organizing themselves. This is how a number of organizations that have applied for funds intended for, among other things, providing information on integration describe the situation. Last year the government allocated a total of 2.7 million markkas of discretionary aid for information in two installments: Twenty-five organizations were included in the first and 26 in the second. Some 91 applicants, whose applications total 14 million, are eager to get their hands on some of this year's 2-million-markka appropriation. In addition, 10 million markkas have been set aside in a supplementary budget for providing information on alternatives in the referendum. The conditions for allocating these funds will not, however, become clear before the bill governing the referendum is made public. It does, however, seem to be quite clear that aspirants want to improve their chances of getting money for their own alternatives by setting up many organizations. Thus Mikko Vesa, who told us that he is also the chairman of the Young People's Europe Committee, which was formed a couple of weeks ago, answers the telephone at the office of No to the EU -- until now the VEY [expansion unknown] -- the oldest organization opposing membership, launched as early as 1991. According to Vesa, a new, nonorganization is needed because, from young people's viewpoint, "men of the past's" decision on independence is not of any importance. Vesa said that young people want to mark the no box with an X for relevant reasons. Papal Conspiracies? Three kinds of organizations and committees are distributing information on the EU and influencing citizens' opinions: supporters of membership, its opponents, and neutrals. The Foreign Ministry's Information on Europe office also sends out the word that it is pursuing a neutral policy. Its own material is objectively presented, well founded, and well composed. The ministry's Information on Europe also distributes material from citizens' organizations, but it does not procure it for their choices. Therefore, whether they supply their printed matter for distribution through Information on Europe depends on how active these organizations are. A spot check indicated that at least No to the EU has seen to the availability of its publication VAIHTOEHTO through this channel, as has the MTK [Agricultural Producers Association], among others -- both recipients of big government information subsidies. Since the publications were prominently in evidence, at least as far as this is concerned, Seppo Aaltonen of the Popular Front Against the EC's acrimony-tinged invitation to take a look at how opponents are being discriminated against did not produce the desired result. Closely associated with the Communist Workers Party, the movement represented by Aaltonen backed Pekka Tiainen in the presidential elections. The movement's principal argument is "loss of independence." The EU is a federation from which, in its opinion, one cannot secede. Its most important form of activity is the publication and distribution of a paper called EI EUROOPAN UNIONILLE -- KYLLA SUOMELLE [No to European Union -- Yes to Finland]. This activity is funded by "the horny hand of toil." Another group that has gotten by without public support is the Free Finland Civic Movement, which is collecting signatures for a petition to be submitted to the parliament and which claims that it has already amassed nearly 200,000 names. Membership in the EU may be supported or opposed for very many different reasons. There is even talk of the pope, who opposes the Community because he considers it to be Catholic! During the final vote, however, the reasons why will not be asked for. Therefore, both those who plan to vote yes and those who plan to vote no have been exploring the possibilities of common action. Largely personified in Hilkka Pietila in the press, No to the EU is cooperating with the Independence Society. Jan-Magnus Jansson, for example, is indeed active in both of them. He has also been in contact with the People's Independence Front of Finland, whose arguments focus primarily on security policy, as well as with the Social Democratic Independent Nation -- Cooperative World group. The last-mentioned opposes the EU chiefly for being a neoliberalist community on whose scale of goals employment, for example, does not occupy the position hoped for by these critical Social Democrats. Because of a shortage of funds, this group headed by Jorma Bergholm has up to now been evident primarily in letters-to-the-editor columns. To Cooperate or Not During Easter Week Better Alternative -- a European Finland, Inc., which has begun to create a national network of local organizations, also explored cooperation with other organizations that support EU membership. As a movement composed chiefly of young academicians, at least Yes to Europe, an independent civic organization that has developed an idea almost contrary to the original one, has responded negatively to Better Alternative -- a European Finland, Inc.'s wooing. Kristiina Hartikainen told us why: As a subsection, the youthful group, which has even produced its own lively publication, would certainly have been trampled underfoot. The movement led by her sees many reasons for joining the EU. She cited as one of the main reasons young people's opportunities to study at European universities. "What personally gives me food for thought the most is the future of agriculture," Kristiina Hartikainen said and told us that she had also through a farmer friend come to understand the farm sector's critical views on the matter. The Better Alternative -- a European Finland, Inc. citizens' delegation and the coalition government have also in excellent fashion described how EU membership is dividing the parties, on the one hand, and, on the other, is uniting people from groups with the most divergent backgrounds. For example, RKP [Swedish People's Party] MP Eeva Biaudet, Left League Governor Kalevi Kivisto, Finnish Center Party MP Olli Rehn, Greens MP Paavo Nikula, Conservative Party power figure Ilkka Suominen, who is soon to leave parliament, as well as bank director Kalevi Sorsa, an important and influential Social Democrat, are on the citizens' delegation committee. Each of them also has party comrades among the opponents of EU membership. The plethora of civic movements, of course, reflects citizens' interest in the issue and because of that division is not necessarily regarded as a bad thing in either camp. After all, aside from affording them the possibility of applying for money, it also provides more and more of those holding different opinions with a goal they can identify with and a channel for taking action. Europeans or Tenant Farmers? So far no action group has succeeded in assembling a large number of members. No to the EU is the biggest with about 4,000 members. Better Alternative -- a European Finland has just started to recruit members. There are from 300 to 400 members in the Yes to Europe group. The activities of all the organizations are at present being hampered by uncertainty as to when the promised referendum will be held. Once that is decided on, a lot of money will also be applied for -- how it will be divided up among supporters and opponents is uncertain at this point. Unanimity extends only to the yes-or-no level and in one sense the civic movements that have arisen now are disposable goods. If and when the Finns take their place in the EU, they will certainly soon be arguing just as cleverly as before. But not necessarily in the organs of the Community. We must believe that Finns in Brussels would above all be Finns. In Kalevi Sorsa's opinion, a certain reference group within which Finland would probably be operating is even now evident: The Nordic countries, Germany, and Austria are societies with which Finland can enter into geographical and business-based cooperation. Social thinking and equality are those areas in which Finland could serve as a leading or exemplary country in the EU. Finland would also be able to provide its experience as a builder of bridges between East and West. "At the same time our own security will be best served," Sorsa felt. In his opinion, staying out of the Union would mean identifying with a group in which Finland does not belong. "Unthinkable. I look on anyone who with open eyes advocates that Finland join the EU as a traitor," Keijo Korhonen of Kajaani lashed out. He can only explain supporters' behavior as the gullibility of primitive tenant farmer folk. "Sheep have to be treated like sheep: with an ax to the head." Korhonen condemned them and insinuated that he could certainly brush the EU-Finland dust off their birchbark shoes.
