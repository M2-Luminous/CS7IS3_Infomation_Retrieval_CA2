The small parties and the recently formed ones would be happy to get into Parliament. They are all aware that their self-confidence, and their assertion that a coalition capable of governing cannot be formed without them, can bring extra votes for them. Based on their surveys, the Gallup or the Szonda Ipsos [public opinion poll companies] would probably contest many forecasts. Although who knows.... Many things can change in four or five months in politics, the popularity of certain parties can either increase or decline. After Christmas and before New Year when, leaving the daily political struggle behind, the party leaders have more time to look into the future, this is how they see their and our chances. Laszlo Kover, parliamentary group leader of the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]: We Are Able To Defeat the Socialists "I would by no means like to express or predict the FIDESZ's chances in percentages. One reason is that I would not like to reduce our chances by talking about them, and the other is that Hungarian domestic political life seems to be very pliable just now. However, in my view, the contest will be between the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the FIDESZ. I hope that we will come out from this as winners. As far as I can see, at the moment, we are the only ones who will be able defeat the socialists. "It does not seem like a very daring prediction that none of the political factors on the three poles, namely the MSZP on one side, the three parties of the current government coalition on the other, and the "group" of the FIDESZ and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] on the third, will on its own be able to gain absolute majority. Therefore, two out of the three tendencies will -- at least partially -- work together to form a government majority. "It does not seem likely that the forces outside Parliament will gain much strength and that any of them will turn into a significant political factor as a result of some landslide-like change. However, in my view, the voting base of the coalition has not continued to decrease for a long time as shown by the results of public opinion polls." Imre Szekeres, deputy chairman and campaign chief of the MSZP: We Will Be a Significant Force in Political Life "I first of all want the country to get as far as the elections in order and without major problems. "It is a decisive factor that all political forces should show more self-moderation in the economy and in politics. Another one is that programs and people, rather than passions, should contend each other at the elections because otherwise we will not be able to do anything with each other or with any kind of election results. Third: I expect a government that will be able to keep this country running and can show some kind of results in the future. "I think that the MSZP will reach around 25 percent at the elections and will thus remain a significant force in Hungarian political life; we will be able to influence the country's life. "Looking at it from the end of 1993, it cannot yet be decided who the coalition partners might be. We can only answer this after the elections, and I am not saying this for tactical reasons. First of all, we have to know how much support the various parties have because in a parliamentary democracy, majority has to be shown. In Hungary, we cannot set up a government by coming together and distributing the ministerial and state secretarial positions and then wait and see what happens. "However, I can now say with whom I cannot foresee governing together: These are the current government parties. I am not saying this for ideological reasons: These parties have governed very unsuccessfully and the citizens will vote for us -- if they will -- to prevent this government from staying in office." Zoltan Kiraly, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP]: Getting Into Parliament Is a Realistic Goal for Us Many people think that, with this historic name, it was difficult for you not to get into Parliament three years ago. At that time, the MSZDP produced a fine example of a failed election campaign. In view of the past three years, how do you see your party's election chances, we asked Zoltan Kiraly. "The parliamentary parties have a large advantage over us. Except for the last few months, the MSZDP's past three and a half years have been characterized by internal troubles while our rivals left us far behind. While the other parties already have complete lists, we are working on the criteria for selecting candidates. However, the party's 103-year history is a big advantage. All in all, I think that getting into Parliament can be a realistic goal for our party. "Unfortunately, our party is in a very bad financial situation. Our sympathizers are helping us 'on credit.' We will pay if we get into Parliament. We actually inherited 10 million forints debt and the state support is very small, we cannot use much of it for the campaign. From the western parties, we can only expect moral and professional support in formulating our program and during the campaign. "According to the public opinion polls, the MSZP and the FIDESZ have a considerable chance to win the elections. However, we cannot yet know how the votes will reflect the fact that people are turning away from the FIDESZ. The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] will become stronger. The socialists, the FIDESZ, the KDNP, and the SZDSZ will play a determining role in the new Parliament. "At least eight parties will be present in Parliament. I can see a chance for the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], the smallholders, the Republic Party, and perhaps the Agrarian Federation to get seats. Naturally, I hope that the social democrats will also be there." Karoly Herenyi, spokesman for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]: No Government Can Be Formed Without the Forum in 1994, Either MAGYAR NEMZET interviewed Karoly Herenyi on the MDF's election chances in 1994. "The MDF will continue to play a determining role in Hungarian political life after the 1994 elections. It is impossible to form a government without the MDF. I believe that we will repeat our election results as a percentage proportion, at least as far as the position is concerned, we might not do this as regards the number of mandates. "We can talk about coalition issues after we know our election results. We can mainly work together with our natural allies, the KDNP and the smallholders party that will hopefully continue to pull itself together, and we hope that it will have much better results than in 1990. Under no circumstances will we enter into a coalition with the SZDSZ or the MSZP. We do not have any contacts with the MIEP and the events of the last weeks confirm that there is decreasing chance for any kind of cooperation with this party. I am thinking of their statements in the days of mourning, including the caption under the photo on the front page of the MAGYAR FORUM on 16 December. "In my view, the election results will not directly be influenced by the unfortunate death of the former prime minister Jozsef Antall because the MDF will continue his political line in the future, too." Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the KDNP: Our Candidates Are Examined The KDNP expects 15 to 25 percent of the votes at the 1994 elections. According to Laszlo Surjan, the KDNP will come up with a more impressive and younger list of candidates compared to 1990. All candidates have to go through a compulsory examination in the party and the list of candidates will only be made public after this. As regards the possible coalitions, Surjan is cautious because at least four parties have the chance to gain 15 to 20 percent of the votes and, in this case, in the interest of governability, compromises have to be made for which cooperation among the four forces might be necessary. It is only the MSZP that cannot be considered as an ally out of the parliamentary parties. Surjan cannot exclude the possibility but does not intend to take away votes from the MDF and he wants to remain especially correct with the MDF. The KDNP expects that, because of the SZDSZ's coming closer to the MSZP, a number of former SZDSZ sympathizers will join the KDNP's voting base. In 1990, the KDNP was unable to set up a list in five counties because of the lack of individual candidates, but it will have candidates in all voting districts in 1994. While its predecessor, Brankovics's Democratic People's Party, had its main stronghold in the Transdanubia, today the KDNP's biggest membership is in Nograd, Borsod, and Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg counties. The KDNP expects to increase the number of its mandates mainly from northern Hungary. In 1990, the KDNP was not a significant force in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county but, as a result of steady organizational work, this is now one of their strongest districts. Many of the individual candidates are leaders and activists of civic organizations, and many of them have experience in local affairs. Sandor Gergely, chairman of the National Federation of Savings Cooperatives; Laszlo Nogradi, leader of the Hungarian Entrepreneurs' Chamber; Istvan Mikola, chairman of the Hospital Federation; and Gabor Jobbagy, one of the leading figures of the Embryo Protection Movement, will run for the KDNP. Geza Gyimothy, general secretary of Jozsef Torgyan's Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]: We Feel We Are Strong Bearing in mind the slogan of "God, Homeland, and Family," the Independent Smallholders, Agricultural Workers, and Citizens Party with its 60,000 membership is the country's strongest party; therefore, it has a reason to be optimistic about the 1994 elections, Geza Gyimothy told MAGYAR NEMZET. He said that they would run a candidate in all 176 parliamentary electoral districts, and they would mainly like to gain the trust of their compatriots who have Christian and national sentiments. Before the first round, they will not enter into an election alliance with other parties, and they will conduct their election campaign in coordination with the some 20 organizations that are part of the Christian National Unity [Kereszteny Nemzeti Osszefogas]. "We feel that the MDF has lost the trust of the citizens but there is a strata with Christian national sentiments which, four years ago, gave 62 percent of the votes on the parliamentary coalition deputies. We are mainly expecting their votes," Gyimothy said. According to Gyimothy, they have a realistic chance to get 20 to 25 percent of the votes. The smallholders had 12 percent of the votes at the last elections. "As our party has become stronger by now, we have reason to hope that we will have better election results in 1994," Gyimothy thought. Ivan Peto, chairman of the SZDSZ: Even Fewer Mandates Might Be Enough for Victory "Compared to the 1990 elections, the only change that I expect is that fewer mandates might be enough for an election victory. It is our, just as every other party's, 'obligation' to trust that we, namely the SZDSZ, will come up as winners. I can see a good chance for this. "It is difficult to answer the question whether the representatives of the conservative, the socialist, or the liberal parties will be able to form a government on their own. However, I do not think it is likely that the liberal parties and their election allies will be able to gain a strong governmental majority." "As far as I can see, no breakthrough can be expected in the issue of which parties gain a seat in Parliament. As opposed to the smaller organizations, it is the current parliamentary parties that have a chance to get into Parliament again. However, the MSZP will probably have better results at the 1994 elections than it did in 1990." Janos Palotas, chairman of the Republic Party: We Do Not Ally Ourselves With Extremists Recently, the Republic Party has significantly decreased the gap between itself and the parliamentary parties. In some 100 of the 176 electoral districts, it would already now be able to have a candidate. They achieved all this in barely one year of organizational work. What does Janos Palotas predict about the results of the 1994 elections? "In recent times, a relatively stable political image has been formed of the six parliamentary parties. This can be changed by an exceptionally good performance, another 1 or 2 percent can be gained but much more difference cannot be expected. In my estimation, the MSZP will gain the largest proportion of votes, some 22 to 23 percent. The chances of the current government parties are much worse than this. "It is much harder to predict the chances of the Republic Party, it has many tasks whose good solution can significantly influence the election results. It is a big challenge for us whether we can run in all 176 voting districts. If we manage to achieve this then we can even approach the peaks, otherwise we will gain many fewer votes. Therefore, the election result of the Republic Party can be between 11 to 12 percent or 25 to 27 percent. Whichever becomes reality, we will have to see it as a success because we will be in Parliament. However, our final goal can only be for our party to be a leading force of the future government coalition. "If we win, the Agrarian Federation, the SZDSZ, FIDESZ, or the KDNP can be our coalition partners. We would not enter into an alliance with the MDF or any extremist political forces, namely the MIEP, the Market Party, or the Workers' Party. The FKGP cannot be taken into consideration because, in our view, politically they are not sufficiently serious. The MSZDP is struggling with similar problems at the moment but it has progressive signs. If we do not win the elections then the program of the leading party will decide whether we can work together with it." Zoltan Biro, co-chairman of the National Democratic Federation [NDSZ]: We Can Equal the Challenge The NDSZ would like to occupy the position of national center in the Hungarian political structure. What chances does the party have to achieve this? Zoltan Biro gives the answer. "As opposed to the parliamentary parties that are also well endowed with financial resources, the NDSZ starts from a disadvantageous position. In spite of this, our position is encouraging because it seems that we will be able to meet the challenge at the elections. I am certain that we will get into Parliament. I hope for a parliamentary position for the NDSZ from which it will indeed be able to have a say in forming Hungarian politics. "In my view, the unification of the social democrats will not significantly influence our chances. However, I believe that an honest social democratic party will become strong within 10 years in this country; it may become one of the important political forces, and might even be our ally in the future. However, at the moment, there is a big difference between our programs and political directions. The history of Hungary's social democratic parties -- including the events of the past years -- show that they cannot organize themselves on a national basis to the extent we consider necessary. "The KDNP and the MSZP will certainly gain strength but this will not be of decisive proportions. After the elections, I would like a coalition in which the center forces that are close to each other -- either to the right or to the left -- work together. In this coalition, the NDSZ will certainly be among the influential parties. With the Agrarian Federation, for example, we can only work together if the programs and political directions can be well coordinated, and this also applies to other parties. Before the elections, rather than among the parties, we are seeking allies among the civic organizations that have closer links with society."
