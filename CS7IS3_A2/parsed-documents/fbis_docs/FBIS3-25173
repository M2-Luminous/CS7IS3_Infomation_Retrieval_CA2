More than ever before, this expression goes with the sociopolitical situation prevailing in our country. After September 1960, after 26 March 1991, our country is today at the same decisive turning point of its history: How to safeguard a democracy that has so dearly been conquered. We should admit that for some time now we have been witnessing a kind of auction situation in which each of us is intent on asserting himself by opposing one another. There is no one better than the office of Radiodiffusion-Television du Mali at assessing the extreme tension that currently prevails in our country and the clouds that are obscuring our democracy. Several parties have noisily left the government. The majority ruling party says loudly and clearly that it will assume its responsibilities. Students and pupils are taking to the streets; the trade union federations are giving ultimatums; many of our colleagues of the private printed media seem to be more preoccupied by what they consider as the freedom of the press than the consequences of what they write when the country is in an explosive situation. Some radios are making calls for an insurrection. When one adds to all this the impact of the devaluation on the people, there is so much to be concerned about. We can but wonder how far the various sides will go--hopefully not to the point of destroying the family structure that is Mali. In the face of the accumulation of dangerous situations, of this auction, we should call for restraint, caution, and reserve. It should be said that when one sets fire to the common house, one runs the risk of being burnt along with everything that is dear to you. We do (?hope) that the numerous democrats that are living in Mali, regardless of their political parties, will get ahold of themselves before it is too late and place Mali before all selfish political motives. To be a democrat is not just a slogan, it is an attitude. The opportunity is offered today to all democrats to show who they are and, to do so, they must adopt a courageous attitude in the face of the dangers that are threatening us. They should, from now on, mold their attitude and make their statements in the sense of how to safeguard our Mali, how to ease the tension. The civil society--if it really exists--is being called upon to meet that challenge more than ever before. We are proud to say that Mali is a country of ancient civilization and rich culture. We have been able to face all kinds of adversities at all times. We have always been able to stand tall and dignified during the most difficult times. It is certainly not today that history will prove us wrong. Sundiata, Ba Bemba, Samory, Dan Monzon, (Firum), the March 1991 Martyrs, all those who made the glorious history of Mali, shall never forgive us. One thing is certain: A failure today will be the failure of the democrats, all the democrats.
