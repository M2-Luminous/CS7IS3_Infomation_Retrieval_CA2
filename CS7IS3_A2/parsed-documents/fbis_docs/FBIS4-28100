The money will be used to cover the WFP's shortage of funds to transport food to the southern region of Sudan, where some 2.2 million people are said to be confronted with imminent starvation, according to the ministry. The region's agricultural production has greatly deteriorated as a result of changeable weather, insects and the country's civil war which broke out in 1983. The main mode of transportation for food is by air because the region lacks law and order and has poor infrastructure such as roads. But a shortage of funds has forced the suspension of two of the three possible air routes. According to a survey conducted by the WFP, the death rate per day in southern Sudan stands at 11.2 people per 1,000, a "major catastrophe" by the standards of the World Health Organization (WHO), the ministry said. Japan suspended extending official development assistance to Sudan in October 1992 due to the African nation's violation of human rights.
