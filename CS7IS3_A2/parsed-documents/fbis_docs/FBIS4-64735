An authentic diplomatic battle is now being waged against the Spanish military in the zone, who are trying to mediate between Muslims and Croats so that the agreements can be implemented. The Muslim mayor of East Mostar, Smajo Klaric, has leveled harsh criticisms of the Spanish troops, accusing them of a lack of neutrality and, more seriously, of complicity in the sacking of the city's historic treasures. "I have no desire to respond to those accusations," says Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Castro, spokesman for the Spanish contingent in Medjugorje. "Our work in Mostar is our best response." Colonel Luis Carvajal, commander of the Spanish contingent, adds: "In the East, we have excellent relations with the population. This is not hard to verify. Suffice it to walk along the street to note how the people treat our soldiers. In the Western part, however, we have very good relations with the civil and military authorities." Threats This may be an indirect way of acknowledging what various neutral observers consider problems that the Blue Helmets are having with the Muslim authorities. Attesting to these problems, in March, two Spanish members of the humanitarian Doctors of the World organization were threatened with firearms in their office at the East Mostar hospital, which had been looted hours earlier. Accusing both doctors of espionage and of trying to render the Bosnian male infants impotent with their vaccination program, the hospital's director was trying to force them out. Incidents of this type, however, are customarily resolved quickly by the Spanish military over a glass of a local brandy known as loza. "The real problem," says Col. Carvajal, "is those persons who, with the war, have succeeded in gaining a certain level of power and well being that they risk losing with peace. They, in addition to the Serbs, who in one way or another must be brought into this process, are the real obstacle to the Washington peace agreements." In the eyes of those interested in maintaining the present situation -- and they are present on both sides, although in greater number among the Croats -- the Spanish Blue Helmets, as guarantors of the peace process, represent a real "threat." This "threat" translates into the need for Col. Luis Carvajal and his assistants to carry out a diplomatic task in Medjugorje that is key to the pacification. Their performance is being attested to by the constant coming and going of delegations to and from the city. Groups of Croats from West Mostar meet every day with Muslims from East Mostar to discuss how to restore electric power or clear a mined terrain. "Getting daily life back to normal," says Col. Carvajal, "is of the utmost importance in trying to guarantee the future of the peace talks. If we can manage to get water running from the faucets and electric bulbs lighting up again, the people will then pressure the authorities to not back away from the process." East Mostar has been without water, electricity, and gas for the past 10 months. And in that time, 37,000 Muslim refugees, victims of the ethnic cleansing being waged by the Croats on the other shore of the Neretva River, have arrived on this side. Some 57,000 persons now live in Mostar who are totally dependent on the humanitarian aid arriving in the city owing to the mediation efforts of the Spanish Blue Helmets in recent months. To deal with the new situation created by the signing of the peace agreements between Croats and Bosnians, the Blue Helmets have had to reorganize. Mostar, Bosnia's second-largest city, is situated in this region and has been entrusted to the Spanish Blue Helmets. Around mid-March, an Antimortar Radar Unit arrived in the city and installed itself in the Muslim-inhabited eastern zone. Until then, it had been impossible to determine the origin of the mortars that from time to time were being launched against the Muslim zone, in violation of the peace agreements. Aid In cooperation with the Slovak battalion, the Spanish Blue Helmets have also succeeded in reopening road M-17, which connects Mostar with Sarajevo. By this route, which had been closed for two years after Serb artillery destroyed the bridges, it is now easier to get humanitarian aid to Sarajevo and other cities in central Bosnia. The change in the situation has noticeably improved the morale of the Spanish soldiers. "At last," says one of them, "we feel that we are being useful to these people." The Spanish command did their utmost to bring about an exchange of the first group of war prisoners between Croats and Muslims, to take place on the very day following the signing of the Washington agreements. As the Spanish wheeled armored vehicle leading the convoy of International Red Cross trucks carrying the first 200 Muslim prisoners entered the city, it was met by a vast crowd of people who, after having awaited that moment for eight hours, broke out into feverish applause. "That was an unforgettable moment," says a corporal, native of Madrid, holding back his tears. Agustin, a Blue Helmet member of the Madrid Unit, which has been patrolling East Mostar for the past three months, asserts: "I have never before seen so many people on the streets of Mostar. Something is changing and I am glad for these people. After so much suffering, they deserve a little hope." Hope is the watchword of the Spanish contingent in Bosnia. "The cease-fire," Col. Carvajal asserts with satisfaction, "is being complied with in excess of our expectations, and the situation must be made the most of to avoid a regression. We are doing our utmost to encourage forward steps, because that is the only way to avoid a return to the previous situation."
