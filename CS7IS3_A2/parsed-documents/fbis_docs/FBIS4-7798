The meeting was the first opportunity to put into effect the agreements signed during the minister's U.S. trip. A joint defense affairs commission will be set up in May. It will tackle, among other things, the restructuring of the Polish arms industry. [Correspondent] The representatives of both states talked about the possibilities of making practical use of the Partnership for Peace in military cooperation betwen both states, and the issue of security in our part of the world. [Begin recording] [Rey in English fading into Polish translation] We have specifically discussed the possibility of joint maneuvers. Such an undertaking requires a detailed plan. We will be working on it. [Kolodziejczyk] We are presenting the whole range of training undertakings we will implement this year, which are being implemented by the Polish Army, and the U.S. side will indicate which undertakings it wishes to take part in. All this will require the appropriate preparation, also on the staff side, so that there will be no disharmony. This means harmonizing the communications networks, the command systems, on some sort of chosen scale, and this will be the first very important step, very important experience for our Polish Army.
