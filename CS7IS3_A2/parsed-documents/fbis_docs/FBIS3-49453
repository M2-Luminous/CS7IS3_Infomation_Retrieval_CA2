Good morning to you. [Geremek] Good morning. [Woyciechowski] Why does NATO not want us? [Geremek] First of all, we would have to ask why we want to be in NATO. [Woyciechowski] So why do we want to be in NATO? [Geremek] I think the answer is not very obvious at all. In essence, NATO is currently experiencing a crisis -- it is a creature of the Cold War and it was supposed to be a countermeasure against the Soviet Union's imperialism, it was supposed to be Europe's and the West's defense. Now the Soviet Union is no longer here and the Cold War is over, and what will happen to NATO now? Well, it is simply the only European security organization which functions in practice and which has means at its disposal which enable it to respond to any kind of danger in Europe. I think NATO is currently going through a transformation. NATO must stop being a defensive, military-political organization and it must become an organization serving European stability; it is not yet ready to perform that role. After all, NATO is not prepared to try to overcome ethnic and border conflicts which are everyday occurrences in Europe currently. So it follows that NATO will transform itself. Poland needs to join a security organization so as to have a feeling of peace, and not because there should be a vacuum or because we should be orphans of the Warsaw Pact. I think Polish society has had historical experiences and historical perspective, and it remembers how alone Poland used to be. But society also has a feeling of a lack of social and economic security, at least in this one area -- in the area of politics, society would like to have a feeling of peace and some minimum guarantees. That is precisely what NATO membership would mean to Poland. [Woyciechowski] Was NATO not established to send their troops, tanks and aircraft in case -- knock on wood that it never happens -- somebody attacks Poland? Is that not what NATO is for? [Geremek] There are two articles in the treaty -- I mean the Washington Treaty which established NATO -- there is Article 5 which is the one we are after. It provides that in the advent one of the member states is attacked, all the other members make a decision -- rather automatically -- to defend the member which was attacked. There is also Article 4 which speaks about the NATO Council holding a meeting in specific cases to decide whether or not to intervene for the defense of a country which does not necessarily have to be a member. [Woyciechowski] So NATO can intervene in such cases, but it does not have to? [Geremek] Exactly. It has to under Article 5 though. [Woyciechowski] But it can intervene also in cases of nonmembers being attacked? [Geremek] Yes. The whole argument now is indeed about Article 5, since such a provision gives the citizens of a country a sense of security and at the same time it is a deterrent factor. But if one considers what the current political situation is about, I think the issue of our membership in NATO -- I am expressing my personal view here, but in my opinion I have reasons to think that -- is not so dramatically important at all. That is because it is inconceivable to imagine Poland being attacked by a country.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what about Yugoslavia? Could Croats or Bosnians have pictured somebody attacking them? [Geremek, hesitating] I think what you are saying represents the type of thinking used by Americans, but it is false. Poland is in the center of Europe and Europe's fate is inextricably linked with Poland's fate. If an aggression occurred against Poland -- who could make such an aggression? Let us say it is one of the neighbors.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Such an aggression would come either from the left or the right. [Geremek] Historically speaking, they used to come from the left or the right -- that is the way it happened to us throughout history. So in case an aggression like this occurs, all of Europe would immediately be involved. The French did not want to die for Gdansk in 1939 and then they died for their own cities -- they lost the war. The necessary political imagination, so to speak, should make us realize that Poland is not in the Balkans and that one cannot make Poland marginal. There cannot be a situation where if there is a conflict occurring right here in Europe's center, NATO would regard it as a marginal conflict because NATO's border is on the Oder and Neisse rivers. That would be impossible. Moreover, if one were to assume that there could be politicians who would think that, then they would be acting to their own detriment. And it is not just a theoretical supposition that such politicians could exist -- they do in fact exist. I have read an interview with a politician from the Western European Union who replied to precisely this kind of question by saying: Well, we will not intervene, but there is no such danger to begin with. Now.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, to recap all this -- in your view, NATO's fear of accepting Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is more linked to the destabilization in the Balkans, to those little, local wars, and to the fact that looking from Washington, one confuses Poland with Yugoslavia -- and it is less linked to Poland's internal situation and also to the Zhirinovskiy factor? [Geremek] The first part is precisely that -- namely that one looks through the perspective of a completely separate conflict and thinks that one can make the issue marginal. A second part that you mentioned is the issue of the priority occupied by Russian issues. The West has very often in the past been bewitched by Russia and it gave Russia absolute priority. By the way, it is my view that we, Poles, should keep in mind that Russia continues to be a huge country and a superpower. It is afflicted with a disease but the disease is only temporary. But the thing is that American politics are now being guided by people who observe the Russian situation, and for whom the most important thing is to have some kind of agreement with the disordered East Europe. I think that even being familiar with the political geography of this part of Europe requires a certain effort, and it is a very easy thing to say to oneself: Here is a partner and now the thing is that the partner should -- as the Clinton administration has the habit of saying now -- be a partner in cooperation. I would say in that regard we can find traces of an old slogan which said that there must be order, and that the world will be peaceful if there is order in Warsaw. Well, that type of thinking is false and one will have to pay a price for that in the future precisely because Russia's main problem right now is the emergence of Zhirinovskiy. It is not a personnel problem or one associated with the person, but the problem is that imperial policy in which there are territorial claims and a desire to destabilize Europe and the world -- the problem is that this kind of policy gained the support of one quarter of this huge country's electorate. [Woyciechowski] Who is Zhirinovskiy? How should he be described? Is he a fascist? Is it fascism or is it something else? [Geremek] It is dangerous. It is a danger and really -- the plague, cholera, or typhoid fever seem minor by comparison, since it is a deadly [word indistinct]. [Woyciechowski] And how did it come about in Russia? How does someone like Zhirinovskiy emerge there? [Geremek] I think that one should consider two phenomena here: The first one is that transformations and leaving communism behind are painful processes -- and we know something about that, too -- so there is impatience in society, frustration, and unhappiness with the reforms. There is also another factor -- that is something which concerns the Russians' national pride. Russian dignity has been trampled on during these years, and that happened not only because their leaders banged their shoes against the seats at the United Nations -- Russians were ashamed of that. But what is worse is that all of a sudden Russia has no influence over anything, it is regarded as an object with which anybody is free to play. The world's fate is not dependent on Russia even by a bit, but there is still an army there, there is a political class, and there is also a kind of popular feeling: We used to be a great country, and now what? Now, Zhirinovskiy was capable of telling everybody what they wanted to hear: He told laborers that they will earn more and that the workplaces will not be closed, he told peasants that some way or another will be found -- either food production will be subsidized, or assistance will be given, if not to kolkhozs, then to private farms, and that his men know how to handle all this. And he told all Russians, including the military, KGB members, and everybody else, that Russia must be great, that it has a right to greatness, that it can have an imperial policy since it is in fact an empire and has such traditions dating back to before Stalin and the communist revolution. Now, he had the ability to use these sentiments for his own goals. One can say, if that is the case, to understand that the phenomenon means to immediately diminish its significance, as it were. I am very strongly opposed to many observers of the Russian scene -- including some of my friends -- who in my view tend to minimize the problem of Zhirinovskiy and they are very unwise in doing that. It is the problem of the future of democracy in Russia. If Russia is supposed to be a partner -- which it can be -- in world politics and as a democratic country, and one whose economy is improving -- the phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy has a fundamental significance for both these issues. [Woyciechowski] What is the difference between Zhirinovskiy and [Party X leader and former presidential candidate Stanyslaw] Tyminski? Why is the first one dangerous but the other one not? [Geremek] Zhirinovskiy scored a success whereas Mr. Tyminski did not. I think an important difference is that Zhirinovskiy has within his clientele not only the capital of social frustrations but also huge structures. There is the problem of the Army. Others say there is also the problem of the KGB. But even if you consider the problem of the Army alone -- I think it has between 2 and 2.5 million people, or more than that, in recent years all of a sudden it became a political factor and the Army is full of bitterness: A soldier who is told to storm the parliament building -- no matter what cause he is supposed to be advancing -- still has a lot of unanswered questions and besides, the soldier is being involved in politics. Well, now a type of politician has emerged whom soldiers and generals can trust, and they invest some of their hopes in him, so to speak, in the sense of saying to themselves that it is worthwhile to serve the country, make some changes and.... [pauses] Zhirinovskiy can say -- and the demographics of his electorate is proof of that -- that he gained the support of the Army. That is extremely important and that is the reason -- among others -- for which we cannot diminish Zhirinovskiy and his measures. [Woyciechowski] Let us go back for a moment to the beginning of our conversation and the issue of NATO. Now, several minutes into the conversation, I will try to recap what I understood you to say: Joining NATO is not the most important thing for Poland since NATO is no longer what it used to be. It is NATO that must change, and then the time will come to deliberate what position Poland should take in this new European security system. Did I understand you correctly? [Geremek] Well, I have been trying to go against the wind.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, is it very important or not very important, I mean this [words indistinct]. Is it really the most important thing? [Geremek] It is really important but not the most important thing. I am going against the wind of the situation which was recently created among the public. I think it is a shame that it happened that the issue of joining NATO was used in political campaigns -- it should not have been. It is a classic issue which diplomacy should have prepared and, once the possibility of joining NATO came up, then it could have become political fact. There are no possibilities right now of immediately joining NATO. If we were to join NATO right now, the state budget would not be able to carry the burden which modernizing the Army requires, as well as adaptation to NATO's standards. But there is a dangerous thing -- and I openly admit that it bothers me not only as a politician but also as a citizen -- that there could occur a refusal on NATO's part to allow Poland, the Czech or Slovak Republics, or Hungary to become NATO members. [Woyciechowski] That simply affirms the fact that the iron curtain -- even though in a symbolic way it no longer exists -- remains at the Oder and Neisse, whereas we would like it to stand at least at the Bug river. [Geremek] I do not even think that there is a postulate made on our part to move the iron curtain to the Bug river. What we want is for the curtain to disappear altogether. Right now.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But in actual terms, the border is really Europe's border? [Geremek] Yes, but it should be an open border. I think -- and I often stress this and I have been saying this for a long time -- that it is very important that Russians have a feeling of being free of any iron curtain which somebody could be erecting so as to separate them. Why is that? Even if one takes a skeptical view on chances in the face of Russian democracy, it is still important that the chances not disappear. Now, such a chance exists only when the West is open. The division in 19th century Russia between Slavophils and Zapadnikis [not further specified] existed because there was a chance. If we were now to close the door on Russia's chances of joining Europe and the West, we would weaken Russian democracy through that. That is why I think there is no closed border, so to speak. But there is a problem if NATO refuses to allow Poland and other countries which are our neighbors -- the question arises: For what reason? NATO countries are democratic countries and so is Poland, no matter how the political configuration may change. Should these countries be based on market economy? Poland has built a market economy, and Poland wants to be part of the peace process and of European stabilization. Why [words indistinct]...? [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But I am sure you have asked that question of Western politicians. How do they respond? [Geremek] They do not respond at all because they have a reasoning hidden here which we must not approve of and to which they have no right, namely: Here is the big country of Russia which should not be subjected to frustrations, and it is important that its right to a sphere of influence, so to speak, be recognized, and.... Is that kind of statement inelegant in politics? Should one avoid such statements in politics? Is it unacceptable? [Geremek, laughing] Elegance I think is not very important in politics, but history is. When statements like this appeared in the past, Poland was losing its independence. And in the memory of.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And not just in 1939? [Geremek] Correct. That is precisely our national history. When we are told that two big countries will provide guarantees to us so we should not be concerned, our answer to that is: We have already seen that, and then there were the partitions of Poland. See, so national memory is an element of shaping politics. That is precisely why I think one should regard it [the Zhirinovskiy issue] as a serious and important issue. I think it is a very good thing that all of a sudden issues of foreign policy have become the focus of attention of the people -- that is an achievement. [Woyciechowski] For the first time in the last four years, most of the talk is not just about money or unemployment but also about foreign policy. [Geremek] Yes, this is the first time. And that is a very important thing since there is a need for this kind of sensitivity to the country's defense system, the country's future, and to protecting Poland's sovereignty. [Woyciechowski] But let us talk now for a while -- to end this conversation -- about money and the budget. Will UD vote in favor of the budget? I mean once the budget returns. [Geremek] I will answer diplomatically since we are leaving diplomatic issues now: We will see what the second version of the budget will be like [words indistinct].... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But do you hope the budget will be altered in the Sejm commissions? [Geremek] I am somewhat afraid it will be -- I think it will deteriorate. Budgets are instruments of conducting policy and we do not approve of the policy [by Pawlak's cabinet]. Voting is always about showing some trust. How can we trust a team which first of all did not keep commitments it made to its own voters? They promised everything to everybody. [Woyciechowski] [Words indistinct] promised and you did not believe. [Geremek] Yes, but now they are coming to me and it is I who is supposed to show trust. They disappointed the voters so they are bound to disappoint me as well. That is the first issue. Another one is that the budget demonstrates enormous centralization trends which are dangerous because one can say that after the forty-something years there is a natural, internal pressure, so to speak, within the entire functioning of the state apparatus, I mean a pressure in the direction of centralized distribution of money. And money is power. Unless you counteract that trend with a wise and tough policy, the trend will prevail. There is no such wise and tough decentralization policy -- on the contrary, there is a spirit of taking power, and I mean taking power by officials in Warsaw. It is from Warsaw that voivodes [local government officials] are appointed -- what the coalition wants to achieve is for Warsaw officials to have the money and then to give it to the appropriate people so they can be in power. Well, we cannot accept such a concept. [Woyciechowski] Whose concept is it -- [Prime Minister] Pawlak's or [Democratic Left Alliance leader] Kwasniewski's? Which one of them acts like that? [Geremek] Well, if you allow me to, I would like to.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You would like to avoid answering that? [Geremek] No, I have a grievance against journalists that this is the way they approach issues like this. What I mean is that it is not a question of whether Pawlak is nicer than Kwasniewski or vice versa, but what kind of policy each of them conducts. It is precisely Chairman Kwasniewski -- to my surprise, I was stunned -- who said [words indistinct]: Replace voivodes, take power into your hands, we have to show we are in power in all the areas where we won. Well, that is a philosophy of power which is explained first and then implemented. On the issue of the budget, its composition and its implementation also -- there are no differences. So the first issue is where Pawlak and Kwasniewski act together and in the same manner, and secondly there is the issue of possible differences -- so far these differences are of minor importance. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the conversation. Radio Zet's guest today has been Professor Bronislaw Geremek. Thank you very much. [Geremek] Thank you.
