Something is already happening in the south: We have there sections of the Freedom Alliance consisting of Forza Italia, the National Alliance [AN], and us, the CCD [Christian Democratic Center]. Another small step, and we are there. Together with [Interior Minister] Maroni and [Defense Minister] Previti, CCD leader Pierferdinando Casini is one of the most convinced supporters of the need to merge the various center-right forces into a `single party.'" [LA REPUBBLICA] You are insisting heavily, but the resistance -- in particular from the League -- is strong. Do you believe that the project will come about in the end? [Casini] I would answer like this: If it does not come about, the Freedom Alliance will never really get off the ground. We are halfway there. We must decide whether to remain with the ambiguity of an electoral system which is no longer proportional but not yet totally majority-based, or to take the remaining step. And it is clear that a decision to move ahead has to mean uniting the forces of the alignment, on the one hand, and of the Left on the other, into single groupings. [LA REPUBBLICA] You could also not take that step. [Casini] Here the reply is even simpler: The way to a new electoral system with a single ballot and without any recovery through the proportional system is either via a vote in parliament with the agreement of the Left, or a referendum. I believe that the process needs to be put into motion rapidly, in time for the next regional elections, which ought to go hand in hand with the direct election of the president and a pure single-member system. [LA REPUBBLICA] Who is for and who is against the "single party" within the Freedom Alliance? [Casini] The discussion is very open. [AN leader] Fini is already dealing with the process as it relates to his AN. Within Forza Italia, on the other hand, two lines exist side by side. [LA REPUBBLICA] How? [Casini] Some people are trying to formalize an assumed hegemony. I am saying only: Let's calculate, because Forza Italia's 30 percent is more the outcome of emotion than a solid consensus. And then let us look at the preference votes in the European elections: Berlusconi gets 600,000 votes, the next man 50,000. [LA REPUBBLICA] And the League. [League Secretary] Bossi does not want to hear of a "single party." [Casini] Bossi many times says the right things. But in this case his reasoning is shortsighted. Like that of my PPI [Italian Popular Party] friends, moreover. We are discussing a two-party system and they do not yet accept the concept of bipolarity.
