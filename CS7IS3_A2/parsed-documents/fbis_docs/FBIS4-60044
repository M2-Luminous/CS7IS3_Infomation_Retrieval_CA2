FBIS4-60044 "drnes098_j_94004" FBIS-NES-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Sanaa Statement Reports Advance on `Abyan-Aden Axis' Sanaa Statement Reports Advance on `Abyan-Aden Axis' JN2005050994 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0334 GMT 20 May 94 JN2005050994 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A military source at the Ministry of Defense has stated that Armed Forces' units continued their advance yesterday along the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, crossed all barriers, and confronted air sorties by the forces of apostasy and secession. The air defenses forced the aircraft to retreat and flee, downing one aircraft over the al-'Anad airport. The forces of unity, democracy, and the protection of Constitutional legitimacy managed to seize 62 T-55 tanks in the mountainous paths outside the al-'Anad base, several kilometers away on the southern front between al-Hawtah and the al-'Anad base, after these tanks managed to flee the base the day before yesterday. These tanks were seized by the fist of legitimacy and the hands of our courageous and devoted forces. Our forces also managed to seize one 130-mm Howitzer gun battalion during the units' advance from the al-'Anad base toward the town of al-Hawtah. On the Abyan-Aden axis, the valiant Armed Forces' units continued their advance, and completed the tight siege of the set targets, from the eastern and northern sides of Aden, after inflicting great losses on the gangs of the rebellious secessionist forces and forcing them to retreat toward the final places of suffocation. The eagles of the air in the Air Force carried out the missions assigned to them in their combat sorties, and scored direct and destructive hits against the set military targets in a number of collapsing dens of the rebellious secessionist forces. Judging from the outcome of the field confrontation of the forces of apostasy and secession, all field, psychological, and moral signs about the rebellious gangs of the secessionists confirm the extent of the grave disappointment and the feelings of disgrace and bitter frustration overwhelming the secessionists and guiding their interpretations and rancorous conduct toward both themselves and all those surrounding them. This is also revealed by the secessionists' despicable cries and their distorted and desperate media statements. In another development, the military source said there is a daily increase in the numbers of officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers, misled by the gang of rebellion and secession in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party's leadership, who are joining our valiant Armed Forces, the forces that protect unity and champion both Constitutional legitimacy and democracy, after seeing the real infernal scheme to which they were pushed by the secessionist gang. This scheme leads to death and to the furnace of a losing war. The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that 250 officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers from the remaining elements of the 'Abbud Brigade, who fled from the al-Dali' District, returned to the district and joined the forces of unity and legitimacy stationed in al-Dali' District. They expressed their denunciation of the hideous crime committed by the secessionist gang by initiating war in the homeland and pushing the sons of the Armed Forces and the comrades in arms into the furnace of bloody fighting. They also asserted their readiness to carry out the national duty in the ranks that champion unity and legitimacy. They were welcomed by their colleagues in our Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy.
