The rec41 mutant under study was produced from the 2D-3031 haploid strain. The study indicates that rec41-1 mutation lowers the efficiency of double-strand DNA break repairs due to the interplasmid and, possibly, interchromosomal and interchromatide recombination, leading to an elevated sensitivity of the mutant cells to ionizing radiation. An incomplete block of repair and recombination processes in rec41 mutant cells is probably due to the rec41-1 mutation phenotype. The REC41 gene was cloned in the pL3 multicopy vector. Integration mapping shows that the REC41 gene is located on the left arm of the VII chromosome, very close to the LYS5 gene. Plans for sequencing this gene and further investigating its genetic properties are outlined. Figures 2; tables 4; references 24: 6 Russian, 18 Western.
