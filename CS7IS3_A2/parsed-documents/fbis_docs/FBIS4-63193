Grachev's service jacket has been deemed reminiscent of a Latin American dictator's outfit. It is noteworthy that Pavel Grachev has worn his uniform illegally. Being part of the Russian state trappings, it is subject to approval by a special legislative enactment. Several hundred billion rubles has been spent on designing the "Grachev-style" uniform. Under the orders of the USSR Defense Ministry still in effect, a new uniform, just like any other innovation, should have been first tested in a particular military unit in what is called "experimental wearing" so as to identify and take into account all the shortfalls and wishes by the military and then have it approved. This has not been done: The new uniform was simply presented to the top brass. Emulating their bosses, lower-ranking Defense Ministry apparatchiks also donned it. At present yet another new uniform is hastily being designed, based on Russian national traditions. Interestingly, the designers of the "Grachev" uniform seem to have vanished into thin air: no one knows who they are. As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned, Colonel Ivan Prekhno, chief of the Uniform Design Department, is about to resign.
