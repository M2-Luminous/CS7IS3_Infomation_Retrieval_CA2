The tanker aircraft would have increased the operational range of Turkey's military aircraft. The development, which even surprised the U.S. State Department officials, was the result of the significant pressure the Greek lobby in Washington put on President Clinton. It will be recalled that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller persistently insisted on Turkey acquiring several U.S. tanker aircraft in order to increase the operational range of its military planes. Warning to Clinton The leading members of the Greek lobby, who were disappointed by Washington's decision to recognize The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], warned Clinton that: "We shall withdraw our support for you if you continue to adopt decisions against us." President Clinton had to yield to the Greek lobby's pressure when his adviser, George Stephanopoulos, who is of Greek origin, advised him to keep in line with the Greek lobby's demands. Later, Clinton instructed the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon to "suspend the delivery of tanker aircraft to Turkey." He also informed his close associates as follows: "We already have a problem with Greece on matters related to the FYROM. Let us not allow the tanker aircraft issue to become another problem." The developments that forced Clinton to make that decision began on 9 March when he received Archbishop Iakovos, head of the Greek Orthodox Church, and 14 members of the Greek lobby, including Senator Paul Sarbanes, who supports Greece in the U.S. Congress. The Greek lobbyists asked to meet President Clinton after he disclosed that the United States would recognize the FYROM. Vice President Al Gore and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake attended the meeting. The delegation maintained a very firm approach and urged President Clinton to reconsider. It also accused the U.S. State Department of systematically acting against Greece and supporting Turkey. The Greek lobbyists recalled Washington's decision to supply several tanker aircraft to Turkey. They said: "The delivery of tanker aircraft, which will enable the Turkish military aircraft to refuel in flight, constitutes a move hostile to Greece." President Clinton disclosed at the end of the meeting that he had decided to postpone his decision to recognize the FYROM. Shortly after his back down on this decision, he suspended the delivery of tanker aircraft to Turkey.
