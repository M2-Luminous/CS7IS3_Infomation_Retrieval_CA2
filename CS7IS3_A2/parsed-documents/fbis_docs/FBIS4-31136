There are no armed Serbs within the 3-km exclusion zone around Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, which the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has also confirmed, Bosnian Serb Army sources inform. The Moslems are continuing also to violate the ceasefire in the Sarajevo area, attacking from small arms the Serb localities of Ilijas, Vogosca, Ilidza, Nedjarici and Kasindol Street. On the Ozren front, the Moslems mounted a combined artillery and infantry attack on the Serb defence positions on the southern slopes of Mt Ozren and in the Srbobran and Komar areas in the northeast, TANJUG learns. The Bosnian Croat Army and the army of neighbouring Croatia are engaged in provocations along most of the lines of separation with Bosnia's Serbs on the Orasje front in the north. Moslem operations against the Serbs are still going strong in the areas of Doboj, Teslic, Treabava and Vlasic in central Bosnia, and the Bihac and Krupa areas in the west. Moslems are provoking the Serbs also in the Sava River valley, especially around Brcko, which is situated in the neck of a vital corridor which links the east and west of the Bosnian Serb Republic, Serb Army sources say.
