After debates that were to say the least thorny, the national conference decided to form an exceptional government in charge of managing the state while awaiting a court decision on the accusations brought against President Aristide. Despite the warnings of Osner Fevry, despite the warnings of Rodaille [not further identified], the assembly castigated President Aristide. The cards will have to be shuffled again and it is supposedly all over regarding the president-in-exile. An exceptional government is in sight. The campaign began in the Toussaint Louverture Room itself. The Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress [FRAPH] vainly attempted to impose the five members of this team. [FRAPH leader] Emmanuel Constant asserted that if a referendum had to be made he would be elected president of the Republic by plebiscite given that he is the most popular. Disregarding pressure, which included bargaining, intimidation, hemming, and hawing, the assembly refrained from designating the members of this government. But Montalvo Despeignes [former minister without portfolio under the Nerette-Honorat government] was campaigning for the man whose clear-sightedness he never stopped vaunting, the man for whom he showed his profound admiration: General Raoul Cedras. [passage omitted] But during the debates, Rodaille nevertheless warned against such solutions. His was a solitary voice talking to a brick wall. At least, gentlemen, to console those who are waiting rightly or wrongly for the return of the president, take this possibility into account, said Rodaille during these debates that were taking place at the Toussaint Louverture Room of the Holiday Inn. [passage omitted] Be aware that jurist Osner Fevry warned that on the juridical plane only one scenario was possible: Return to constitutional order in accordance with the principle of precedence. Let us listen to Attorney Fevry. [Begin Fevry recording] "The first political matter is that the president of the country should designate his prime minister, that President Aristide should immediately designate his prime minister who will form his government. The second political matter is to straightforwardly form an exceptional government. This exceptional government can have several names. We can call it a military government. It can be a civilian-military government, it can be a civilian government, it can be a government of public security, and it can be a government of national reconciliation. No matter what name is given to it, it can be a political matter to form this new government, this exceptional government, this military government, this civilian government, this government of public security, this government of national reconciliation." These are the political matters. "The juridical and legal means to form this new government include first....[pauses] We said it is only one big method through a kind of general synthesis, we call it" return to constitutional order and -- if you wish -- return to constitutional and legal order. This means supremacy of the law, that is the acknowledgement of the law as the supreme force and in accordance with the principle of precedence. "This means it is either the law or not. Either you are courageous enough to play the game of the law or you (?imprison) the law and do not [words indistinct] to play the political game." [end recording] The CARENA officials will meet with the press for the official and solemn signing of the final resolution of this conference. This will take place very soon with the formation -- in prospect -- of the exceptional government. Between now and then the parliament will have to be won over to the cause of the conference. But it will also be necessary to convince the international community so that the sanctions can be lifted.
