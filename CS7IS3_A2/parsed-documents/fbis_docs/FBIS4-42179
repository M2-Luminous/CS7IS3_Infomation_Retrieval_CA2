In an interview with Deutschlandfunk, Vogel added: "We all knew that he had been ill with cancer for a long time, and one had to expect this end." Vogel could not officially confirm Honecker's alleged wish that his ashes be buried in Germany. "But if such a wish exists, it can probably be fulfilled, because there is no legal means of refusing this."
