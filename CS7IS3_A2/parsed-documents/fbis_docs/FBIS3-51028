The communique by the local government and representatives of the people came a few hours after Mexico City Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez and assembly members held a closed-door meeting at the central department's headquarters, where security measures have been increased via careful searches of citizens at the building's main access points. During the meeting, which was preceded over by a meeting attended by Protection and Highways Secretary Rene Monterrubio and chiefs of that group, the government of Mexico City and the representatives agreed on the following measures: 1. The Federal District Department will hold periodic meetings with the Assembly of Representatives to keep the assembly members abreast of the situation in the city. 2. The meetings of the Precinct Councils for Public Security and Civil Protection will be increased, and the regulations on the matter issued by the assembly will be strictly enforced. 3. A representative of the local government will be named to establish a timetable of periodic meetings with the representatives, mainly with the members of the Public Security and Justice Committees. 4. All of the city's police units, including the Bengala Group, will continue to perform strictly preventive functions, as has been reaffirmed. The Mexico City Attorney General's Office--which is headed temporarily by Rene Gonzalez de la Vega starting today--will be in charge of investigations. 5. The public is urged again to report to city police units vehicle thefts and the presence of abandoned cars or armed individuals in the streets, in addition to filing the appropriate complaints. 6. The appropriate measures will be expedited to install this week the 08 police hotline number to the remainder of the city's areas; this system was extended on 10 January to the Precincts of Alvaro Obregon, Tlalpan, and Magdalena Contreras. 7. The need was established for all of the patrols of the General Secretariat of Protection and Highways, including backups, to have the numbers and identification badges assigned to them in each of the city's political entities. 8. A timetable of meetings between Mexico City representatives and the business and commercial sector was established so that the latter may expand their own security systems in the areas where their buildings are located. 9. A surveillance operation will be established to punish those who paint graffiti on private buildings or government offices during demonstrations of support, which may not be linked necessarily to the armed movement, as established by the government's rules on civilian justice. At the end of the meeting, Amalia Garcia, chairwoman of the Public Security Committee of the Assembly of Representatives, said that in addition to this agreement, Aguilera pledged before the representatives to act at all times within the framework of the law and with strict adherence to the people's human, political, and civil rights. [Begin Garcia recording] There would never be any justification to violate the human and civil rights of Mexico City residents; that would be unacceptable. We have also stated that the constitutional guarantee to assemble, demonstrate, and express one's opinion have to be respected. [end recording]
