FR940207-1-00025 FR940207-1-00002 2. Use of 365-day basis. Institutions may apply a daily periodic rate that is greater than 1/365 of the interest rate_such as 1/360 of the interest rate_as long as it is applied 365 days a year. 3. Periodic interest payments. An institution can pay interest each day on the account and still make uniform interest payments. For example, for a one-year certificate of deposit an institution could make monthly interest payments that are equal to 1/12 of the amount of interest that will be earned for a 365-day period, or 11 uniform monthly payments and a final payment that accounts for the total interest earned for the period. 4. Leap year. Institutions may apply a daily rate of 1/366 or 1/365 of the interest rate for 366 days in a leap year, if the account will earn interest for February 29. 5. Maturity of time accounts. Institutions are not required to pay interest after time accounts mature, such as: •During any grace period offered by an institution for an automatically renewable time account, if the consumer decides during that period not to renew the account •Following the maturity of nonrollover time accounts •When the maturity date falls on a holiday, and the consumer must wait until the next business day to obtain the funds (See 12 CFR part 217, the Board's Regulation Q, for limitations on duration of interest payments.) 6. Dormant accounts. Institutions may contract with a consumer not to pay interest if the account becomes ``dormant,'' as defined by applicable state or other law. (a)(2) Determination of Minimum Balance To Earn Interest 1. Daily balance accounts. Institutions that use the daily balance method to calculate interest and require a minimum balance to earn interest may choose not to pay interest for days when the balance drops below the required daily minimum balance. 2. Average daily balance accounts. Institutions that use the average daily balance method to calculate interest and require a minimum balance to earn interest may choose not to pay interest for the period in which the average daily balance does not meet the required minimum. 3. Beneficial method. Institutions may not require consumers to maintain both a minimum daily balance and a minimum average daily balance to earn interest, such as by requiring the consumer to maintain a $500 daily balance and an average daily balance that is higher or lower. But an institution could determine the minimum balance to earn interest by using a method that is ``unequivocally beneficial'' to the consumer such as the following: An institution using the daily balance method to calculate interest and requiring a $500 minimum daily balance could choose to pay interest on the account (for those days the minimum balance is not met) as long as the consumer maintained an average daily balance throughout the month of $400. 4. Paying on full balance. Institutions must pay interest on the full balance in the account once a consumer has met the required minimum balance. For example, if an institution sets $300 as its minimum daily balance requirement to earn interest, and a consumer deposits $500, the institution must pay the stated interest rate on the full $500 and not just on $200. 5. Negative balances prohibited. Institutions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine: •The daily or average daily balance on which interest will be paid •Whether any minimum balance to earn interest is met (See commentary to Appendix A, Part II, which prohibits institutions from using negative balances in calculating the interest figure for the annual percentage yield earned.) 6. Club accounts. Institutions offering club accounts (such as a ``holiday'' or ``vacation'' club) cannot impose a minimum balance that is based on the total number or dollar amount of payments required under the club plan. For example, if a plan calls for $10 weekly payments for 50 weeks, the institution cannot set a $500 minimum balance and then pay only if the consumer makes all 50 payments. 7. Minimum balances not affecting interest. Institutions may use the daily balance, average daily balance, or other computation method to calculate minimum balance requirements not involving the payment of interest_such as to compute minimum balances for assessing fees.
