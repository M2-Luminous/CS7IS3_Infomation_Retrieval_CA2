FBIS4-9256 "dreeu078__a94035" FBIS-EEU-94-078-A Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 ANNEX Hungary Slovakia's `Lack of Interest' Noted Slovakia's `Lack of Interest' Noted AU2204074494 Prague CTK in English 1823 GMT 21 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2204074494 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Budapest April 21 (CTK) -- The Hungarian Foreign Ministry today said Slovakia's lack of interest in a working meeting between the two premiers, Peter Boross and Jozef Moravcik, was regrettable. The ministry's spokesman, Janos Herman, said Budapest received Bratislava's statement through official channels on Wednesday [20 April]. Herman did not specify who had initiated the meeting. He said that during the preparation of the meeting, Slovakia made it a condition that a joint communique be issued on the meeting which would deal with some of the questions to be embedded in the planned basic treaty. Hungary could not accept this condition, Herman said, adding that the treaty was not to be the main topic of the meeting. In today's issue of the Hungarian daily MAGYAR NEMZET, its Bratislava correspondent wrote that the meeting had been initiated two weeks ago by Slovakia and that it was to have been held on Monday [25 April]. But Hungary replied too late, the paper wrote, and moreover Budapest allegedly "laid conditions that are unacceptable to the Slovak party." It wrote that the Hungarian conditions allegedly included the demand that no joint communique be issued from the meeting and that the premiers do not hold any joint press conference. Slovakia, the paper writes, has said that such a "secret" meeting before the May parliamentary elections in Hungary would have no sense. Herman said today that at the meeting Boross was ready to give a new impulse to the development of Hungarian-Slovak relations and help solve pending problems. Hungary has laid no conditions and would not accept any from Slovakia. The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's offer for the two foreign ministers to meet on the occasion of a new Hungarian-Slovak border crossing is still valid, Herman said. Slovakia conditions the opening of new border crossings by the signing of a readmission agreement because it fears an influx of immigrants coming via Hungary from Romania and other countries.
