SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Implementation of the provisions of CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, section 507 of CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, section 507 of CAA directs EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments , in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions, and as a tool to provide further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. On November 13, 1992, the State of Maryland submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small business stationary sources in connection with the implementation of CAA; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP and the state Small Business Ombudsman. II. Analysis 1. Small Business Assistance Program Sections 1&hyph;402, 1&hyph;404 and 2&hyph;201 of the Code of Maryland authorizes the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to establish a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program which meets the requirements of section 507 of CAA. In developing Maryland's PROGRAM submittal, the Secretary of MDE has delegated the majority of its functions to the Department of the Environment, Air Management Administration (AMA) which will establish a small business assistance office. Section 507(a) of CAA sets forth seven requirements that states must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Six requirements will be discussed in this section of this document, while the seventh requirement, establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman, will be discussed in the next section. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with CAA. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The State has met these first two requirements by charging the AMA SBAP with the responsibility of serving as a clearinghouse for information related to compliance methods and control technologies, pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection. Information on pollution prevention/accidental release will focus on the requirements under the accidental release provisions of title III of CAA, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety standards, using the Pollution Prevention Information Clearinghouse (PPIC) and the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO) as resources. Relevant clearinghouse material will be translated into layman's terms and organized into information packets. The AMA will also use as resources EPA's Control Technology Center (CTC), Emissions Measurement Technical Information Center (EMTIC), as well as other state organizations, such as the University of Maryland's Technology Extension Service. The AMA will work closely with other state agencies, particularly the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development (DEED) to optimize information exchange and program effectiveness. Information dissemination shall take two forms. The proactive portion of the program (Information Outreach Network) will utilize industry groups, trade associations, Maryland's Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and additional avenues as needed to disseminate information to eligible small business stationary sources. The AMA will also disseminate information in a reactive manner by establishing an Information Clearinghouse, via a toll-free telephone hotline, which will be responsible for answering questions directly or referring such questions to appropriate agency experts. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under CAA in a timely and efficient manner. The AMA has met this requirement by planning to develop pamphlets and information packets, as well as sponsoring seminars detailing general permit requirements, new and existing regulatory requirements and methods of pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection. These informational packages will be disseminated in a timely manner by the Information Outreach Network described in the preceding paragraph. Specific questions about permitting responsibilities and procedures will be directed to appropriate experts in the AMA. The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under CAA. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with CAA. The AMA has met these requirements by planning to maintain a database of all small business stationary sources and small business membership groups subject to Federal and/or state requirements and notify these sources, in a timely manner by the proactive mechanisms described above, of rights and obligations under CAA. In support of said PROGRAM, the AMA will also conduct periodic surveys, to solicit feedback from the small business community. In addition, the AMA will provide material, through the Information Outreach Network and the Information Clearinghouse, on environmental auditors to assist small businesses in meeting the requirements of CAA. AMA staff will also be available to provide limited on-site assistance. The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practices or compliance methods. The AMA will meet this requirement by establishing a mechanism in accordance with section 507(a)(7) of CAA to receive, review and process requests for work practice, compliance method or milestone modifications. 2. Ombudsman Section 507(a)(3) of CAA requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. Maryland's Secretary of the Department of the Environment has designated the Office of Community Assistance to serve as Ombudsman for small business concerns as they relate to the SBAP. The Office of Community Assistance presently coordinates the Department outreach activities, and serves a problem mediation function for private citizens, industry, and local organizations, etc. The Ombudsman will be readily accessible to small businesses and, on their behalf, be authorized to provide reports to and communicate with state air pollution control authorities and the Secretary of the Department of the Environment. It is anticipated that the Ombudsman's office will be adequately staffed and funded to fulfill its function with existing personnel. 3. Compliance Advisory Panel Section 507(e) of CAA requires the state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (the CAP) that must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The Compliance Advisory Panel will be established by the Governor of the State of Maryland, through an executive order to be issued no later than September 1, 1994. The Panel will include seven members who will be chosen consistent with the requirements of section 507(e) of the CAA. In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel: (A) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (B) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; (C) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP; and (D) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. (Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the state PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal Statutes.) Upon review of the November 13, 1992 formal SIP revision submittal EPA has determined that Maryland specifically satisfies these requirements. Section 4.0 of the SIP revision states that: (1) The CAP will render advisory opinions concerning measures to enhance the effectiveness of the program; (2) prepare periodic reports to the EPA on compliance status of the program with the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Equal Access to Justice Act; and (3) review information directed to small businesses stationary sources to assure such information is understandable to the layperson. The SBAP will serve as the Secretariat for the development and dissemination of Panel reports and advisory opinions. The Compliance Advisory Panel will be established by the Governor of the State of Maryland, through an executive order to be issued no later than September 1, 1994. If the executive order for the establishment of the Compliance Advisory Panel is not issued by September 1, 1994, the EPA will issue a SIP call, pursuant to 110(k)(5), to ensure its timely issuance. 4. Eligibility Section 507(c)(1) of CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that: (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; (C) Is not a major stationary source; (D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and (E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. Except for source categories which the EPA Administrator or the State of Maryland determines (in accordance with sections 507(c)(3)(A) and (B)), to have sufficient financial and technical capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act without PROGRAM assistance, all small business stationary sources located in Maryland will be eligible to receive assistance under the PROGRAM. Maryland's PROGRAM criteria for defining a ``small business stationary source'' is equivalent to the criteria listed in section 507(c)(1) of CAA. The State of Maryland has not provided for the extension of eligibility for assistance under the PROGRAM beyond the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(C)-(E). However, the State may provide ``unofficial'' program assistance to any source that requests help if resources are available. III. Summary of SIP Revision The State of Maryland has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of CAA. The Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) will be administered by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), Air and Radiation Management Administration. Program implementation will begin no later than November 15, 1994. The Compliance Advisory Panel will be established by the Governor of the State of Maryland through an executive order to be issued no later than September 1, 1994. The Panel will be appointed by no later than November 15, 1994. By this action, EPA is hereby approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Maryland. Accordingly, §52.1110 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart V in order to reflect EPA's approval action and the fact that it is considered part of the Maryland SIP. EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective July 15, 1994 unless, by June 15, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on July 15, 1994. IV. Final Action The Agency has reviewed Maryland's request for revision of its federally-approved SIP and found it to be in conformance with CAA, including sections 507 and 110(a)(2)(E) thereof. EPA is approving Maryland's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. Accordingly, §52.1110 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart V-Maryland to reflect EPA's approval action. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. By this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the state. Therefore, because EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a economic impact on any small entities affected. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve the Maryland Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by [Insert date 60 days from date of publication]. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
