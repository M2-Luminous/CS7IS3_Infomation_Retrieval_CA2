The proposers of the motion argued that the government was to blame for failing to bring the crime rate under control and to act against the growth of organized crime. The Socialist deputies did not [word indistinct] their criticisms of the Berov cabinet, but called for the drafting of a national program to combat crime. The National Assembly deputies of the New Alliance for Democracy gave the government and the Interior Ministry leadership a one-month deadline to conduct a purge at all levels within the Interior Ministry to remove corrupt officials. The actual vote on the no-confidence motion will be held by secret ballot next Wednesday [9 February].
