Senior Conservatives believe that a reshuffle which could see the departure of up to five cabinet and many more junior ministers might also mark the return of at least one of the political heavyweights of the 1980s. Lord Walker and Lord Howe, two of the longest serving ministers in Lady Thatcher's cabinets, are being canvassed as potential candidates for the party chairmanship and the leadership of the House of Lords. Senior party officials have also floated the idea that the employment department and the cabinet post of employment secretary could be scrapped to make room for Sir Norman Fowler's replacement as chairman. Sir Norman intends to stand down in July. Whitehall officials last night strongly rejected the idea, but the party insiders said the department's responsibilities could be split three ways between trade and industry, education and social security. No firm decisions have been taken about the timing of the reshuffle beyond a decision by Mr Major to reject the idea of announcing the changes before the June 9 European elections. Some insiders believe the shake-up should follow within days of the June poll. Others are arguing it should be delayed until July to avoid charges that Mr Major had been "panicked" into hasty changes. But the intensity of informal discussions in 10 Downing Street points to a more radical shake-up than hitherto anticipated. There are plans also to strengthen the prime minister's team of personal political advisers. Aides want Mr Major to replace Mr Graham Bright, his parliamentary private secretary, with a much more powerful political figure. Mr Major is being warned the reshuffle will be crucial to maintaining his authority during the expected onslaught on his leadership after the June poll. Friends of Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke have been joined recently by supporters of Mr Michael Portillo in informal assessments of their chances in any leadership contest. Four middle-ranking ministers have emerged at the top of Mr Major's list for the cabinet: Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence minister, Mr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, and Mr David Davis, public services minister. With a clear-out of many middle and junior-ranking ministers, that would allow Mr Major to make promotions from the restless Tory backbenches. Likely high-level casualties are Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary; Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary; and Mr John Patten, education secretary. Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, has indicated he might decide to stand down while Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, is also seen as vulnerable.
