FR941028-0-00055 FR941028-0-00009 Environmentalist commenters criticized the portions of 30 CFR 773.20 which provide that the test for evaluating whether a permit was improvidently issued is ``the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued.'' See 30 CFR 773.20(b). These commenters asserted that OSM should clearly spell out the violations review criteria, rather than rely upon the individual regulatory programs' criteria at the time of permit issuance as the applicable standards. These commenters criticized the provisions of OSM's regulations as being contrary to the Act and cited in support portions of their brief filed in the case of National Wildlife Federation v. Lujan , No. 88&hyph;3117 (D.D.C.). OSM disagrees with the commenters' position. As indicated above, OSM's proposed rule did not propose substantive changes to this provision of the regulation. In the preamble to the improvidently issued permit rules cited above, OSM explained its rationale for using the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued as the standard for improvident issuance. See Preamble to 30 CFR 773.20, 773.21, and 843.21; Final Rule, 54 FR 18438, 18440&hyph;18441 (April 28, 1989). Further, in the case of National Wildlife Federation v. Lujan , No. 88&hyph;3117 (D.D.C.), and Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Lujan , No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C.), environmental advocates advanced similar arguments with respect to the agency's improvidently issued permit rules and the provisions of the rules applying the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time of permit issuance. In the briefs submitted by the Department of the Interior in those cases, the Department analyzed relevant statutory language and legislative history and carefully explained why the environmental advocates' criticisms were not well taken. Copies of these briefs are being placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking. OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department in those briefs herein by reference. Environmental commenters also criticized other portions of 30 CFR 773.20 for which OSM did not propose any substantive amendments as part of the September, 1991, proposed rules. The commenters asserted that OSM should clarify that the remedial measures available to a regulatory authority to cure an improvidently issued permit require that the regulatory authority impose both an abatement plan and a permit condition incorporating such plan before an improvidently issued permit is considered resolved. They asserted that the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20(c) inappropriately allow the regulatory authority to choose whether to require a permit condition or an abatement plan. OSM disagrees with the commenters that a rule amendment is needed. The provisions of the regulation require that the regulatory authority ``use one or more'' of the listed remedial measures including requiring the implementation of an abatement agreement; conditioning the permit upon abatement of outstanding violations within a reasonable period of time; suspension of the permit; or rescission of the permit. This provision affords the regulatory authority the opportunity to exercise discretion, in light of the circumstances, to make a reasoned choice as to the appropriate remedy. In the preamble to the improvidently issued permit rule, OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows: This section *␣*␣* includes four alternative remedial measures because of the diversity of circumstances under which a regulatory authority might find that a permit was improvidently issued, and the resulting need to apply a remedy that not only is administratively appropriate, but also is fair and equitable to the permittee *␣*␣*. OSMRE believes that the term [``improvidently issued''] reflects the severity of the problem involved when a regulatory authority should not have issued a permit, while at the same time not foreclosing reasonable flexibility in the adoption of appropriate remedial measures *␣*␣*. [T]he rule affords the regulatory authority reasonable discretion to consider the circumstances involving a particular improvidently issued permit and to fashion an appropriate remedy *␣*␣*. Although the rule does not require a regulatory authority to use any particular one of the four remedial measures, OSMRE intends that the measure or measures used will be commensurate with the circumstances under which a permit was improvidently issued.
