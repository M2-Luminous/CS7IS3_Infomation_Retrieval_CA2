Kazimirov met the President of the Republic of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Russian President's envoy declared after the meeting that he is satisfied by working negotiations in Baku and Yerevan, and feels that Armenians and Azeris are really interested in establishing peace. "Baku seriously wishes to facilitate the preparatory work on signing a political agreement to stop the military conflict," said Kazimirov. He stressed that opposing the CSCE and Russian projects would be erroneous, and several topics of the CSCE project were also included in the Russian plan. "We can find many similarities though there are some differences," said Kazimirov. "If CSCE only offers a schedule of measures, Russia is attempting to stipulate signing a legal inter-state document on stopping the conflict. This is the first difference, the second is that the Russian plan has better developed mechanisms of cease fire, reducing the danger of resumption of military operations to a minimum." In his opinion, CSCE Minsk group's schedule doesn't stipulate such mechanisms. Questioned whether CSCE may become an obstacle to implementation of the Russian mediation efforts Kazimirov said, he wouldn't like to believe this and hopes that Chairman of the CSCE Minsk group Eliasson will continue to collaborate. Answering the question on when the agreement will be signed, Kazimirov said that they are ready to sign it tomorrow, but readiness of the conflicting sides is also required. Paying importance to Stepanakert's opinion Russian president's envoy said he was unable to visit Karabakh this time due to unfavorable weather conditions, but he hopes such a possibility will be created in the nearest future. Kazimirov will leave to Baku and from there to Ankara today, to continue the negotiations. "I find the meetings in Teheran and future meetings in Ankara very important, as these countries are situated in the region and military operations are carried up to the Iranian border zone," he said. At the same time Kazimirov rejected the notion that a new form of regional resolution of the Karabakh conflict has been created. Presidential spokesman Levon Zurabyan said in turn, commenting on Kazimirov's visit, it is still too early to speak on signing any documents or a significant progress. Nevertheless, he expressed the hope that lull, established at the fronts, will be supported by a corresponding legal document.
