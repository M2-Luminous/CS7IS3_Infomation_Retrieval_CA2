So, it was naturally expected that the two allies would conduct the annual military drill this year too. However, Seoul and Washington canceled it as a concession in the nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and South Korea, the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Now that the hardline Stalinist state has failed to carry out its half of the bargain, this concession might be expected to be withdrawn. But Pyongyang is again threatening to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if the U.S. and South Korea resume the exercise, which Pyongyang calls a rehearsal for a nuclear war against the North. China has also come out in support of the North Korean position. Although President Kim Yong-sam stated after his summit with his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin in Beijing that the two did not discuss Team Spirit and the deployment of Patriot anti-missile batteries in the South, Chinese officials made it clear China is as opposed to them as before. A formal Seoul decision on the two matters is expected after President Kim's return home, as he promised before his departure for Japan and China a week ago. With the two presidents having called for a negotiated settlement of the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue among the parties concerned, Kim is likely to weigh the further postponement of the military drill in expectation of a change in Pyongyang's nuclear stance. It is our view that suspension of the Team Spirit drill needs to be considered, lest it provide an excuse for the North to translate its NPT pullout threat into action, leaving no room for a peaceful solution to the issue. Since Seoul and Washington have used Team Spirit as a bargaining chip in nuclear negotiations in the past, they may well decide to leave it as a card up their sleeves for use in the future. On the other hand, Korea and the U.S. need to positively consider the deployment of Patriot missiles, as it is designed for defense against the North's Scud missiles. It is illogical and unreasonable for Pyongyang to voice its opposition to the Patriot deployment in the South, while it produces and develops offensive missiles. In a nutshell, the suspension of Team Spirit is recommendable for the present in order to avoid the worst but the Patriot missiles are needed as a war deterrent to cope with the erratic and unpredictable North. Our side's unlimited concessions at this point could rather encourage the defiant North to continue adventurism and brinkmanship that are in no one's interests.
