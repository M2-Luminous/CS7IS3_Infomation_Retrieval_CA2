Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic was received in the Vatican this morning by the pope. Giuseppe De Carli reports: [De Carli] Mate Granic knows that the pope is not going to give him an easy time during their talks. He also knows that the Holy See's position is not the same as two years ago when the Vatican encouraged Croatian Catholic separatists by recognizing the new republic. At the time, it was a question of freeing Croatia from central Communist control in Belgrade, but no one expected the breakup of the multi-ethnic state to lead to the horrors of Bosnia- Herzegovina. On several occasions the Vatican has rebuked Bosnian Croatian Catholics who, together with Bosnian Serbs, are involved in dividing up the country. John Paul II has reiterated the ideas expressed in the Justice and Peace Committee's recent document: The international community cannot stand back and impotently look on as minorities are expelled or peoples exterminated. According to semi-official sources, the Vatican has reportedly asked Granic for explanations about the direct involvement of Zagreb's regular army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Granic's reply was the same as the one he had given in talks with members of the Italian Government. Finally, a development confirmed by Navarro-Valls, director of the Vatican's press room, has caused a sensation -- the pope wants to visit former Yugoslavia, Sarajevo included.
