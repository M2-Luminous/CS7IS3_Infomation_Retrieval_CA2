[sentence as published] But the actual development of Clark Air Base, the former headquarters of the U.S. 13th Air Force, into a commercial aviation complex will have to wait until 1998 when the effects of Mount Pinatubo have completely been swept away. The president said the executive order creating a special economic zone in Clark came after he approved a masterplan prepared by a Japanese group for the development of a civilian commercial aviation complex in the former American military base. Apart form an airport, the aviation complex will have space for aircraft maintenance and service facilities, an aircraft assembly and parts manufacturing plant, and other aviation-related industries. To make the airport accessible, the president also revealed plans for a construction of expressways linking Clark and Subic as well as Clark and Metro Manila. The Philippine National Railways (PNR) is also rehabilitating its tracks to access Clark which will become the nucleus of a rail network linking Metro Manila with the northern Luzon areas particularly the planned Northern Luzon Quadrangle which is composed of Pangasinan, La Union, the two Ilocos provinces and Baguio City in Benguet. The president said the development of Clark as a aviation complex will help ease congestion at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Metro Manila.
