Lage, who met with Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Angel Burelli and other authorities, stopped in Caracas for a short visit. He arrived from Brazil and will visit Colombia tomorrow. At a news conference, the Cuban leader said his country welcomes foreign capital investments, preferably from the region, with which Cuba hopes to strengthen political ties and take steps toward integration. In his meeting with Burelli, who is also Venezuela's candidate for OAS secretary general, Lage explained his country's situation, as well as the consequences of the U.S. economic blockade against the island. Lage emphasized that the so-called Torricelli Amendment, which tightens the blockade through extraterritorial measures, is not only illegal but also criminal because of its impact on the population. Lage added that the accusations against Havana of human rights violations are unjustified and just a part of Washington's harassment policy. Lage said Cuba has every right to participate in all aspects of the Latin American integration process and that regional organizations must accept all countries and respect the right of each people to choose its own path. As for the changes taking place in Cuba, Lage said that the Caribbean nation does not intend to become a capitalist nation but to adjust to current world conditions and to improve the socialist model. He added that it is very difficult to predict whether conditions will improve next year due to the U.S. blockade, but he did say that if the blockade tightens and creates even more difficult conditions, Cuba will face them. Lage also met with Abdon Vivas Teran, president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, and with Cesar Quintini Rosales, transport and communications minister.
