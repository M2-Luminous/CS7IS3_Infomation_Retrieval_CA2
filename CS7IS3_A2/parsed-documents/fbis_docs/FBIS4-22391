Born in travail like the very noisy land auction, the market was attended by only a few buyers, and this despite the fact that the commodity being offered was fast-moving and even had pretensions to high quality. If someone had the desire and--of course--the money, he could buy a building here, or a dacha, apartment, or garage in various parts of Ukraine and the near abroad. The organizers exhibited for sale everything that they could, even their own intellect and a material-technical center--offering various consulting services, transportation, and electronic equipment. A sense of orderliness and respectability, a minimum of risk and burdensome paperwork--one could not say that this was a legally unregulated market. Nevertheless, it is the latter that potential buyers seem to prefer. For a market that was well advertised, three lots constitute just a drop in the ocean--not calculated to created any changes in the weather. The reason is well known. For a long time now well-to-do citizens have been buying up everything that they need; they have gotten around the existing laws, and for these covert trades they neither want nor need the help of any "glittering" advertisement. For all other citizens--whether the commodities in question are offered at a wide-open bazaar or a civilized market--they are beyond their pocketbooks. The result is lamentable. For the first time in half a century offerings exceeded demand in the Kharkov real-estate market, and this despite the fact that the housing problem remains one of the most acute in this city. But we have not yet become accustomed to the paradoxes involved here. One of these is the position assumed by the Kharkov Procurator's Office, which has continued to "bombard" the local Executive Committee with paper-type protests. The motif is impressive in its banality. Existing laws do not permit land and real estate to be offered on a lease-type basis. But--when all is said and done--such a practice is not prohibited. This argument is persistently used to cover and protect themselves by the local authorities, while proceeding to prepare new trading places at the same time. Who will prevail? This is not just a rhetorical question, inasmuch as the Kharkov Commodity Exchange is not limited by prices, and sheds a glaring light on the long-existing opposition between common sense and narrowly bureaucratic interests. The old system has already taken everything possible from life, but it continues to keep the society in a state of deep unconsciousness. The real-estate market--like the first land auction--has not lived up to its promise of assistance; nevertheless, it has introduced a vital stream of hope into a seemingly hopeless situation. From now on trades on the KhTB [Kharkov Commodity Exchange] will be conducted with at least something to trade.
