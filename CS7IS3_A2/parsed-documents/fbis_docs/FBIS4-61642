On the telephone with the details is our commentator Viktor Levin. [Levin] Defense Minister Pavel Grachev spent an hour and a half speaking in detail about the state of affairs in the Russian Armed Forces, pointing out what has been achieved, and going into great lengths about the shortcomings. But probably the main thing which needs to be emphasized above all else is the fact that over the past two years the military, as the defense minister said, has begun to clearly realize the responsibility that lies with the Armed Forces. The defense minister gave an assurance that Russia's Armed Forces have become a reliable state institution and the guarantor of stability in our Russian Federation. The realities, indeed, are these, Pavel Grachev said: the Armed Forces -- and he expressed his immense gratitude to the soldiers, sergeants, warrant officers, officers, generals, and admirals -- remain completely battleworthy. At the same time, the defense minister noted that there are three tasks which require a solution at state level. They are, first and foremost, reliable and stable financing within the limits required by the Defense Ministry. Secondly, ensuring that the personnel are up to strength. According to the defense minister, one soldier now has to do the work of ten. This is the result of being under strength. The outcome of this is that the burden on young soldiers of 18 years of age is so great that many cannot stand up to it. In the defense minister's opinion, no matter what the army commanders do, this problem will not be solved without a state decision and without the Armed Forces being brought up to full strength. And the third conclusion was to ensure normal housing and living conditions for servicemen and their families. Pavel Grachev gave the following example: last year over 50,000 apartments were built. This is a whole town, but this is insignificantly small because over these past few years there has been a very great movement of troops from a number of states which are now considered to be foreign and even from the present states of the CIS. Replying to questions, the minister dealt in detail on the problems of staging the joint Russian-American exercises at the Totskoye proving ground. According to Grachev, if we really want to mutually get rid of the image of an enemy and move towards partnership, these exercises are vital. He admitted that these exercises were of a symbolic nature: they were not military exercises in the pure sense, they were peace-keeping exercises, and he believes that they should definitely take place. One may think about the right time -- it may be that summer is not the best time when the crops are ripening and the harvest coming up -- but this issue is, I would say, a very minor one. The defense minister stressed several times that it was necessary to hold these exercises, for the sake of peace and for the sake of friendship. This is Viktor Levin, from the Ministry of Defense.
