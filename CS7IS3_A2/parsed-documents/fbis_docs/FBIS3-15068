"I do not think that one country should monopolize" this process and sideline all others, Karadzic said. Karadzic sounded apprehensive about the confederation pact between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems agreed in Washington, and said he feared it could be used against Serbs in the former yugoslav republic. "We can welcome this agreement only if it is not aimed against Serbs, only if it lead us to peace and not to war".
