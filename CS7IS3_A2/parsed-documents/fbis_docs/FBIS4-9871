In a letter sent to Director Fernando Santos Castillo, which the most important newspaper in Colombia included on its front page today, the head of the Cuban revolution states "the issue was important and difficult." "(The incident) could have serious and unwanted repercussions, concerning the credibility of many persons and the relations between our nations," the letter emphasizes. EL TIEMPO published, beginning on 10 March, a series of alleged important revelations concerning the aforementioned January summit in Havana with Bishop Nel Beltran's participation, despite the Cuban Government's reiterated assurances and denials. The existence of that meeting was even personally denied by Bishop Beltran, Catholic Church leaders, and the most important Colombian Government officials. Nevertheless, since the Attorney General's Office presented what was purportedly evidence, the government decided to request an explanation from Cuba, which was immediately answered. The newspaper, which recanted its report on Sunday, admitted it had been manipulated by still unspecified interests, and apologized to the Cuban Government, Nel Beltran, and its readers, in an action that is termed important because it is so unusual. "I consider it my duty to express my sincere appreciation for the step taken by EL TIEMPO to deny recent reports that were published by the same newspaper and that do not conform to the truth, and to apologize to Monsignor Nel Beltran and the Cuban Government," Fidel Castro states in his letter. "By explaining the incident, reporting the hoax of which it had been a victim, and apologizing to those involved, EL TIEMPO has shown courage and honesty. We recognize this; we accept your apologies, and we congratulate the newspaper's board of directors, its journalists, and its workers for this attitude, which greatly exalts you," the Cuban statesman adds. "We hope and wish that all of us will learn a useful lesson from this unpleasant incident, and that mutual respect and relations between the peoples of Colombia and Cuba will be strengthened," the Cuban revolution leader's letter to EL TIEMPO ends.
