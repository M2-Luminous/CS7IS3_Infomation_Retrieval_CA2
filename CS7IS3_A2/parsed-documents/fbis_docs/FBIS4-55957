I would like to ask you whether you agree with this view and to give us your opinion about the reasons, consequences, and prospects of this crisis. [Manolescu] I believe that the major reason for the current political crisis is connected with the fact that the parliamentary majority and the government backed by it have not yet found the appropriate solutions to the problems that we are facing. Not only have they not found the solutions, but the y have also set off on a path that leads nowhere. Or rather, it does not lead to any of the solutions that would solve Romania's current problems. In turn, the parliamentary opposition has virtually exhausted all avenues of negotiations or understanding with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] aimed at finding a solution, other than early elections and a change in the parliamentary configuration. A month or two ago, when the negotiations between the opposition and the ruling party began, I was optimistic and believed that together we could find a solution that would not involve early elections. Today I am no longer sure that there is such a solution. [Filip] Do you believe that early elections could be the solution to the current political crisis? [Manolescu] The early elections option is double-edged. In addition, we are not sure that the elections would create an acceptable and reformist configuration of Parliament. To start burdening people with an electoral campaign now, with all the expense that this involves, would ultimately mean ignoring that people want to know what they are going to eat tomorrow, whether they will have jobs, and whether inflation will be kept more or less under control. Thus, it means forgetting all these things and producing electoral slogans again, which, no matter how generous they are, cannot ensure food or the other things that people need. That is why, in my view, early elections would involve a certain amount of immorality. However, if there is no other way, ultimately we may resort to it. [Filip] Let us imagine that the PDSR did not reach an understanding with the opposition and that this did not result in early elections. How would the country be governed under such circumstances? [Manolescu] Unfortunately it would not be possible to rule the country under such circumstances. I will give you an example in this respect. One of the objections to government policy is the excessive delay in implementing privatization and the preservation of bankrupt enterprises. The MEBO [Management and Employee Buy-On] program proposed at one stage has been contested by everybody. Even in the PDSR program there is a clear statement that the MEBO program is not efficient and involves great risks. We have suggested an alternative, that is, a privatization program, which the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] and the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)] have also accepted in principle. We presented this program to the trade unions and the economists and held a symposium on it in Buftea, and everywhere we received a favorable response, meaning that people said yes, this program indeed suggests a solution and must be given a try. But the PDSR is ignoring this program just because it comes from the PAC [Civic Alliance Party].... We believe that the program represents a viable solution and must be discussed and never mind who initiated it and who drafted it. We do not wish to turn this program into political capital. However, we are keen that it should be implemented. There is another aspect worth mentioning here. Our program, or anybody else's program of this kind, cannot be implemented at any time that we wish to do so. Thus, we are linked to a deadline and this deadline is the beginning of next autumn at the latest. To achieve a privatization program we need certain laws that must be passed by Parliament, thus presupposing parliamentary support and the broadest possible political and social basis. The majority on which the PDSR now relies does not respond to this requirement, in spite of the greater number of seats that they hold, which nobody knows for how long. Delaying the privatization process leads to hyper-inflation and, further, to a deterioration to the very limits of social life. And how can one govern under conditions of social instability? [Filip] Recently, in an interview granted to our newspaper, Mr. Corneliu Coposu [president of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party-PDSR] came up with a way to get out of the current crisis by forming a cooperation government, which should be made up of parties with different, even opposing, ideologies and programs, and which should rule on the basis of a minimal program jointly agreed upon. We can call it interesting that [PDSR President] Oliviu Gherman also expressed a similar support for the idea of a minimal program that could be followed by any government or parliamentary combination. In spite of these similarities and convergence of ideas, a cooperation government and minimal program are far from being accomplished. Thus, the following question arises: How sincere are the proposals made by political leaders? How sincere is their will to reach an understanding that is of benefit to the country? [Manolescu] I could say that in this case the issue of sincerity does not have any importance. Sometimes we are compelled to do certain things against our beliefs or interests. Basically, I am not even interested in whether the sides involved in such a discussion are sincere or not. What is important is that they should reach an agreement. Better a hypocrisy that leads to an accord than a sincerity that disunites. Second, the idea of a coalition government is no longer topical. This was discussed after the Cotroceni meeting, when the opposition put to Iliescu a proposal to mediate between the CDR and the PDSR. This issue is no longer topical. At that time we proceeded from the following course of actions: We said that first of all we, that is, both sides, should sit down and examine whether -- as Mr. Gherman said -- there is the possibility of agreement on a minimal program. This would have been the first compulsory stage. Then, if we agreed on such a program, we should examine how it could be implemented. But to implement something you need laws. Therefore, we need the support of the opposition, which it should grant to the government under certain conditions and for a given period of time. Then, finally, when we have the program and we have the laws, we must also have the people to do the work. These were our proposals: a minimal program, a different parliamentary configuration, and a coalition government. We never reached the stage of seriously discussing the second and third proposals because we never sat down to discuss the minimal program! [Filip] Why not? [Manolescu] First of all because of mutual suspicion. Each side suspected the other of being insincere. However, I want to repeat: It seems useless to discuss this issue because I can understand that even when the PDSR is not sincere in embarking on an action, it will still do so because it is under pressure from the IMF, the trade unions, its own electorate, or the general situation prevailing in Romania. [Filip] Oliviu Gherman affirmed that there is no political crisis in Romania because there is a parliamentary majority of 53 percent. He also said that the tacit understanding of the PDSR with the PSM [Socialist Workers Party], the PRM [Greater Romania Party], and the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party], which have allegedly accepted the PDSR program, is satisfactory for governing the country. Do you believe that Romania can be ruled on the basis of such a political formula? [Manolescu] Officially, there is no political crisis. We have a Constitution, a Parliament, a government, a president, an opposition, and all that. However, if we consider that Parliament does not succeed in passing laws that are necessary for the reform, that the government comes up with a draft budget that aims to support bankrupt enterprises and not revive and assist those able to produce something and the private sector, then we do face a political crisis. Because neither we nor they are doing anything. We cannot because we are not governing. Those who are do nothing because they have other interests or because they are also blocked by God knows what mental inertia, so to speak. [Filip] Do you think that the current government coalition is able to implement the economic reform in Romania? [Manolescu] The current coalition has no means of implementing such a reform in Romania. A lot of shortfalls have appeared in this coalition -- which includes the PDSR, the PUNR, the PSM, and the PRM. The PUNR currently wishes to withdraw its support and denounce the protocol with the PDSR; the PSM has made explosive declarations regarding current social life; and the PRM has acted in a similar fashion. It is clear that the PDSR cannot go any further with these allies, especially as far as reform policy is concerned. It must decide whether it wants to continue moving along with its current allies and with pseudo-reforms, which will lead to hyperinflation and disaster or look for allies somewhere else and negotiate each point of a minimal program with them. [Filip] Do you really believe that the shortcomings that you are talking about are real? What can stop the PSM, PRM, and PUNR members of parliament from continuing to vote with the PDSR? [Manolescu] The shortfalls are real. It was possible for the PSM and PRM to vote for the investiture program, and the memorandum with the IMF was a contradiction of their own doctrines and platforms. In other words, the PSM and PRM voted for a program that is 80 percent liberal. The memorandum with the IMF, except for the excessive taxation and two or three additional things, is almost a liberal program. I do not believe that [PSM President] Verdet can continue with such a program to the very end and to the very last consequences. The PDSR should take this into account. The support that comes from the left is temporary and it will last only as long as the PSM and PRM wish to remain in the coalition because they have certain interests in doing so. At the moment I do not know what type of games will be played before the elections, but you will see that the two parties, even the PUNR, will denounce the government. As a matter of fact, this is happening even now. The press is full of accusations and criticism against the government voiced by its current allies. [Filip] I agree: During the voting in Parliament, all those who criticized the government are supporting it... [Manolescu] Here we are witnessing a political game and I believe that this game will last only as long as the conditions that generated it also last. When they no longer have an interest -- around the time of the elections, for example -- the PSM, PRM, and PUNR will withdraw from the coalition, and the reason that they will invoke for this move will be that they can no longer participate in the country's disaster because they would lose credibility and their own electorate, which is attached to the idea of state ownership and does not want reform but rather the conservation of certain structures. Since the existence of these parties and their political success depend directly on a certain type of voter, they cannot afford to risk too much. There is a certain limit that they cannot exceed. That is why the PDSR must understand that if it wants a reform program, then it has to look for reformist allies. If it does not want this, then it can stay with its current allies. But in that case, it will get into an impasse and that will be the moment when the political crisis will no longer be -- as Mr. Gherman says -- only a rumor but a real one, and it might bring about the fall of the government. [Filip] If we were guided by the results of the latest opinion poll, which indicates a very high percentage in favor of the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party], we could conclude that there is a risk that the size of the CDR might be reduced and mixed up with the PNTCD. Am I mistaken or is there indeed such a risk? [Manolescu] There was such a risk especially during the last elections and it continues to remain. But this is a risk that we have accepted and the PNTCD -- we must admit this -- emphasized it as much as it could. This situation suited them.... Now it is to be seen if in the next elections the electorate will want a convention that can be identified with the PNTCD or one in which each political formation, starting with the most radical and ending with the most "well behaved," is appropriately represented. As far as the opinion polls are concerned, I read them in two ways. First, as if they were perfectly correct. However, I ask myself what will happen at the elections, because Romania is not a country where you can say that if the opinion polls come up with a certain result, this will also be the result of the elections. Then, there is another way of reading them. I do not believe that in our country opinion polls are not manipulated. The sympathies and antipathies of those who conduct them are quite obvious, so this is a situation in which I read the opinion polls as signals coming from those who manipulate them and who wish to implant a certain idea in my mind. Why is the CDR leading and why does the PNTCD have a higher percentage than it could have hoped for? The opinion polls may create a certain state of mind that makes us believe that we are already the winners. Thus, let us have early elections and win them! But then we go into the elections and realize that we have lost again! I distance myself from such opinion polls. [Filip] Is the CDR a political formula compatible with the liberal alternative? [Manolescu] We have said that it would seem normal to us if the PNL [National Liberal Party] returned to the CDR, where it was from the beginning and from which it withdrew because of an error committed by Mr. [Radu] Campeanu [former PNL leader], an error that, as a matter of fact, cost him dearly. In this way two very clear political factions could be established within the CDR. The Christian democratic side and the liberal side. This however does not mean a split in the CDR, but a certain clarification that is recommended both for parties as well as for the electorate. That is all, it means nothing else! [Filip] Let us assume that the CDR won the elections. In what direction would Romania move? [Manolescu] From an economic point of view it would move according to liberal doctrine. There is no alternative on this point, as even social democratic parties prove to be liberal when they come up with reform programs. From the social viewpoint, none of the liberal parties is so naive as to believe that a sudden liberal reform without social protection, without elements that would consolidate the family and the civic society, can produce positive results. Thus, there would be no great problem because the liberals and the Christian democrats understand each other on fundamental issues. They also talk about a liberal economy just as we talk about the civic society and social protection. There is no other way. [Filip] Currently, the liberal parties are split and some of them are troubled by internal conflicts. Therefore, the image of Romanian liberalism is about to be discredited. What would be the consequences of a possible failure of liberalism at the next elections? [Manolescu] The current image of our liberalism is very poor and if the liberal movement fails it will be a disaster. The PAC and the PL'93 [Liberal Party '93] have been in conflict not for ideological reasons in the first place, although there are certainly differences between us, but mainly for personal reasons. There is a struggle between two wings within the PNL, a struggle between two leaders who are not separated by differences of doctrine. If the liberal parties do not learn how to set aside these confrontations of a personal nature and generated by arrogance, then it means that they want to commit suicide. The unification of the liberal movement does not necessarily mean a merger. You do not walk over all the personalities and place Patriciu [member of the PL'93 leadership] in a position to give orders to [PNL President] Quintus or vice versa. But at least an alliance of principles and program can be achieved by maintaining the identity of each party. If liberalism fails, it will lead to the loss of its electorate and to the establishment of a parliament that resembles the parliament in Poland, with the consequent political consequences, among them the strengthening of the left.... [Filip] On several occasions, representatives of the "A Future for Romania" group have stated that the traditional left-right model is worn out and another political formula is required. What is your opinion of this? [Manolescu] I agree with it. In a society as confused as ours, a clear model with precise delimitations between right and left has never worked. Our electorate is not very receptive to terms such as right or left. However, we have no other choice because this is the classical definition of the fields of political force. Either we use them or we do not.... But I do not believe that the essence lies in terminology. I do not believe that an electoral campaign based on terms such as right or left will clarify things for many people. [Filip] What formula would you suggest? [Manolescu] Currently the situation is simple. Reformists and anti-reformists.... Thus, also the word reform should be checked to see whether it has been discredited in the post-December 1989 period.... However, let us say that we still have a tradition of four years of reformism and anti-reformism. Do you want changes or not? If you want changes, we understand each other. The pace and methods can be established later. But if you do not want changes, then there is nothing to talk about!
