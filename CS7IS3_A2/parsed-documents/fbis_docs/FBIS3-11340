He stressed: "This makes even more unattainable the proposal for salary equity between branches of government and increases unrest." He stated that the military has accumulated a very significant loss in purchasing power. He cited his own case: "In March 1990, while in the post of squadron commander, I received a salary equivalent to $3,000: Today I receive the equivalent of $1,200." The minister said the lack of motivation within the organization is so perceptible that 49 Navy officers are pursuing other posts within the state itself. The admiral vehemently defended the FHC2 [Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2] plan on the "Tomorrow's Journal" program broadcast by TVE [Rio de Janeiro Educativa Television] on 16 March. "If inflation drops there will be a gradual recovery in purchasing power and we are betting on this," he said. When fiscal and monetary adjustments attain their goals, previous losses lose significance, he commented. The minister also defended a return of investments to modernize the Armed Forces and the creation of a salary program for the military once stabilization has been achieved. Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul State], the government leader [in the Senate], and Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Parana State], are heading the movement in the Senate to maintain President Itamar Franco's veto against the salary equity between congressmen and Supreme Court (STF) judges. "It is an act of immorality that will have a devastating effect on the economic stabilization plan," Richa stressed. Richa and Simon on 16 March began to press their colleagues on the "unsuitability of the increase." On 17 March, the senators were convinced that their pressing would work. "It is a delicate situation; the Senate must be seen to maintain the veto," Simon said. The greatest difficulty to overcome is the blockade imposed by their colleagues that will lose their mandates this year because they will not seek reelection. One party leader said there is a group of senators leaving public life which will vote against the veto. "They wish to take advantage of the salary increase at least for the next few months," the leader said.
