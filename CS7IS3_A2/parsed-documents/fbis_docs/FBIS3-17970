National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich pointed out at a news conference that the National Bank and the Council of Ministers had drafted a joint resolution suggesting that the main directions of the monetary-credit policy be adopted; the National Bank's payment bill be proclaimed the only legal tender on Belarusian territory for the period preceding the final merging of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems; the National Bank's motion on commercial banks be confirmed. The motion envisions that commercial banks earmark at least 13 percent of their credit capital for the implementation of promising investment projects.
