Zhao Zhongling, director of the Bureau of Tibet Livestock Farming, said that last year, meat output in the sector reached 100 million kilograms and dairy products, 185 million kilograms, respectively increasing by 6.77 and 5.38 percent over 1980. He said that wool output reached a record 8.9 million kilograms. As one of the five major livestock producing regions in China, Tibet has 22.8 million head of cattle including yaks and sheep. There are about 82 million hectares of grassland in Tibet with about 52 million hectares of grassland available for cattle. He said that since Tibet popularized scientific methods of breeding and raising among the herdsmen, its livestock farming has enhanced its anti-calamity capacity. He noted that now, after big calamities, the survival rate of newborn cattle is kept at more than 80 percent. Last year, the region set up 366,000 hectares of fenced grazing land and more than 20,000 hectares of man-made grassland. The Bureau of Tibet Livestock Farming has trained about 10,000 technicians at county, township and village levels each year in application of grassland transformation and protection and refined cattle breeding.
