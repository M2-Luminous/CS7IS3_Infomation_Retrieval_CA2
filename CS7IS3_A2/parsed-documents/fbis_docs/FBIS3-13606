In fact, post-World War II events, especially following the Communist landslides, have established that U.S. decisionmakers think with the mentality of a European peasant who has migrated to a very modern city! This U.S. resemblance is not meant to refer to the positive, but rather the negative aspects of rural life, namely, backwardness, shallowness, and naiveness in thinking and making decisions. Events of the last half a century confirm that U.S. foreign policy has been a mixture of excessive barbarity and selfishness, miscalculation, shortsightedness, impetuousity, and superficiality in thinking and tackling events, contrary to the European mentality, whose maturity and cunning is exemplified by British policy. Today, U.S. politicians have proved to be no more than European peasants in control of a high-tech civilization. So as soon as their rival collpased, they danced joyfully and began disgorging their evil intentions and criminal plans against all of mankind, including their own friends. Perhaps, the U.S. attitude toward the blockade on Iraq is the worst stupidity of this European peasant, who knows nothing, and so drowns in his own ignorance. When he is slapped in the face and made to wake up from his stupor and come back to his senses, he becomes stubborn again and pursues his own stupidities until his head collides with a solid wall and bleeds, then he yells and runs away! The United States fled from Indochina in shame, despite all its victory promises and barbarity. It was defeated in Lebanon by the blowing up of the Marines headquarters, despite all Reagan's fiery words. The biggest shame was its defeat before Iraq when it failed to block Iraq's policy, course, and leadership, despite all the military buildup. As for its defeat in Somalia, it was proof of the United States' vulnerability and failure to honor its promises. We tell waverer and liar Clinton: Wake up, the blockade is being eroded, even on the official level in the world. If you do not save the situation and end this blockade, the news will come as a painful slap in the face to tell you that Iraq's will power is stronger and that Saddam Husayn is here to stay.
