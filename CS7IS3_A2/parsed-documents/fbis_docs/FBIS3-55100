[Dvalia] A constituent meeting of the Abkhazian regional branch of the Union of Georgian Citizens took place in Tbilisi today. The union is headed by Eduard Shevardnadze. The speakers noted the need to unite all forces in order to attain stability and order in the republic. Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze himself spoke at the meeting. He gave a brief analysis of the sociopolitical situation that had taken shape. Naturally, he paid special attention to the Abkhazian problem. For the first time over the few months since Georgian troops had left Abkhazia, Shevardnadze openly said that, apart from everything else, a large-scale betrayal near the Katorskiy bridge in Abkhazia was one of the main reasons for the defeat in Abkhazia. Also, this betrayal took place in Ochamchira Rayon, as well as in Sukhumi, where whole battalions were often withdrawn from advanced positions without command agreement. Shevardnadze openly accused Tengiz Kitovani, former republican defense minister, and General Paata Datunashvili, current first deputy defense minister, of handing over great amounts of weapons, ammunition, and hardware to the armed formations of the ex- president's supporters. The head of state noted that today's Georgia did not have, in fact, a unified disciplined army since the available armed forces cannot be regarded as such. Also, he said that in the next few days he intended to issue several decrees aimed at forming new unified armed forces but he did not elaborate on the subject. At the same time, it has become known from unofficial sources that serious changes are being prepared in the top echelons of the Georgian Defense Ministry.
