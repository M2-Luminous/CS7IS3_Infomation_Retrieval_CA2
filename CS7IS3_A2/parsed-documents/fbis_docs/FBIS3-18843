Clinton had dared to come out very far with a regulation that links more favorable trade conditions for China to progress in the sphere of human rights. Yet his additional signals to the rulers in Beijing were ambiguous. While his human rights delegate was pointing his index finger at moral issues in Beijing this week, next door the trade delegate was promoting new contracts involving big money. From this, Beijing seems to have drawn the conclusions -- as it did after Federal Chancellor Kohl's sales visit -- that all these Western tirades in connection with human rights are presented only half-heartedly. The brutal suppression of the Chinese opposition is disgusting, and Beijing's rulers are responsible for it. Yet, are China's conclusions and the criticism that the United States and Europe are being "two-faced" so wrong? The menacingly pointed U.S. index finger produces conflicting feelings. If it is seriously meant -- good. Yet, if it is actually rather intended to soothe the U.S. public, which is outraged about repression in China, or as an instrument of trade policy to exert pressure -- then "no thanks!" The advocates of "business as usual" should not deduce from it that pressure on Beijing might be totally dropped in the future. After all, the United States forced a human rights dialogue on the PRC. Should it have been meant seriously, then Wei Jingsheng and his fellow-fighters can gather fresh hope.
