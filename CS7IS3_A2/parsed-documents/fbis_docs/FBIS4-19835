As things get worse for Elco Brinkman [Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) leader], the Chamber speaker's star is shining brighter. Rumors in The Hague suggest that he may soon become floor leader of the CDA or even end up as prime minister. Until recently, Deetman responded to such speculation with declarations of love for his present job of Chamber speaker. This has changed two weeks before the elections. Last weekend he declared that "I will not run away from my responsibilities" if the party gives him the job of floor leader. In this week's VRIJ NEDERLAND, he did not even shy away from the high office of prime minister. As a good CDA man, he said that this would depend on consultations with the "home front," i.e., his wife and children. [passage omitted]
