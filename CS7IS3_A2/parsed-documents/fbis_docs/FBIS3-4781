The main posts in the Clinton administration are occupied by lawyers, including President Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, who is in charge of negotiations with Japan. American lawyers make free use of various logical arguments to achieve their goals. Sometimes, therefore, they are unable to see the whole situation. In the Japan-U.S. consultations, such thinking had it that because Japan was a peculiar nation, the only way to open its markets was to set numerical targets. Some of their arguments completely ignored the reality of Japan's economic position. Those who faced the U.S. lawyers were Japanese bureaucrats. The Ministry of Finance, which puts a premium on financial logic, is at the center of the bureaucratic system. Japan delayed compiling economic pump-priming measures. Moreover, the Economic Reform Study Council, which was set up to tackle issues likely to be raised at the Japan-U.S. economic talks, failed to spell out the drastic measures Japan should adopt to reduce its trade surplus because of interruptions by bureaucrats. If the two countries do not take a new approach different in the future, they will be unable to find a solution to their unresolved bilateral trade problems. Since the summit talks, the United States has begun to adopt a policy of shaking Japan into action. U.S. officials made comments approving the yen's appreciation. The country is preparing to impose sanctions, asserting that Japan is not being fair over the issue of mobile phones. The president himself criticized Japanese bureaucrats. It seems the United States is trying to get compromises from Japan by making it feel uneasy. The reason why the United States has delayed announcing an expected revival of the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act may be that it is now watching to see what moves Japan will take. The Japanese Government, which was upset by the U.S. strategy, has moved to work out new market-opening measures. It is beginning to look as though, as far as relations with the United States are concerned, Japan does not act without pressure from Washington, and is inviting strong arm tactics from the United States. However, the U.S. strategy is a "dangerous game." There is fear that Japan-U.S. relations will fatally worsen as long as the United States continues to demonstrate such an aggressive attitude. The way in which the United States takes lightly multilateral trade rules will only lead to it falling in the estimation of the international community. We would like to earnestly ask the U.S. administration to show self-restraint. As for the mobile phone issue, it is not clear which part of the Japan-U.S. accord Japan is violating. There is a strong impression that the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which was trying to find fault with Japan, and Motorola, Inc., which wants to reduce its stocks, cooperated in coercively raising the issue. The two countries should move to make concessions before sanctions are exercised. The Japanese Government will start a full study of new market- opening measures next week. We would like to make two requests, and urge the government to come up with fruitful measures. First, new market-opening action should help cut the trade surplus. The reason why the U.S. administration is hastily demanding results on trade issues is that it is irritated at Japan's trade surplus, which has not decreased at all. The Japanese Government must steadily implement measures to expand domestic demand and approve the yen's appreciation to its current level. The second request is that the government implement drastic deregulation to sweep away the Japan revisionism [nihon ishitsuron] which has deeply infiltrated the Clinton administration. It has been revealed that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry instructed economic organizations to support the economic pump-priming package recently announced by the government. The U.S. negotiators must have questioned whether "the Japanese Government, which controls domestic industries in this way, is qualified to oppose managed trade." The collusion between government and industry has grown worse. Although there are problems with the way the U.S. has dealt with the mobile phone issue, some people have pointed out the lack of clarity in the way the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications administers such issues and its excessive regulations on and intervention in industry. The government regards the promotion of deregulation as the main plank of its new market-opening measures. However, we question to what extent deregulation will be implemented. Unless the prime minister gives a shock to bureaucrats by showing his readiness to replace all officials higher than bureau chiefs at each ministry, the nature of the bureaucracy will probably not change.
