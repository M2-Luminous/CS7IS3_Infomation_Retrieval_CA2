Wang, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), reiterated that China also resolutely opposes any attempts to create "Taiwan independence." Wang made the remark at the Third Meeting of the First Council of the Chinese Mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS). After reviewing the progress between the relations across the Taiwan Strait, Wang said that the relations across the Taiwan Strait saw great development last year. He said that the publication of the White Paper "The Taiwan Question and the Reunification of China" made a complete and systematic exposition of China's principled stance and policies on the Taiwan issue, producing a realistic and far-reaching impact on the development of the relations across the straits and the reunification of China. Wang said that at the 48th General Assembly of the United Nations, the Taiwan authorities' attempt to "participate in the United Nations" was thwarted. He noted that recently some people in Taiwan advocated a step by step approach to two Chinas, which roused serious attention and vigilance on China's mainland. However, he said, Taiwan patriots including men of insight among the Taiwan authorities have made great efforts to develop the relations across the straits. Last year the Taiwan authorities relaxed some restrictions over exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan and adopted some measures conducive to promoting mutual understanding and exchanges across the Strait. He said, "We hope the Taiwan authorities uphold the sense of Chinese nation and truly adhere to the principle of one China so as to contribute to the development of the relations across the straits and the peaceful reunification of the motherland." Wang spoke highly of ARATS' work to promote the exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan in the past two years. He said that from January to November last year, the indirect trade value between the two sides reached 12.1 billion U.S. dollars. Last year more than 1.5 million Taiwan compatriots visited the mainland and more and more mainland people also went to Taiwan. He called on ARATS to make efforts to promote exchanges of mail services, air and shipping services and trade across the straits, promote exchanges and cooperation between the people on the two sides, and especially to develop economic cooperation. ARATS should help related sectors and localities to solve the problems arising in the exchanges between the people of the two sides and protect the legal rights and interests of the mainland and Taiwan people, he added. He urged ARATS to promote talks on economic and civil affairs with its Taiwan counterpart. He said that the leaders of ARATS and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will regularly hold talks in line with the agreements concluded at the "Wang-Ku" meeting and he hoped that ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Ku Chen-fu will hold their second meeting soon.
