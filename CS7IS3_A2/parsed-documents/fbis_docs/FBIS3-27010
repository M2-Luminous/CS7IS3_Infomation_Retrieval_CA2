Kandinsky] [Text] The Beijing intellectual was openly sarcastic. "Was this meant to be a festive gift for us?" he asked. He was referring to the reshuffle at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Cass), announced on the eve of the lunar new year. Wang Renzhi, the hardliner who formerly headed the Communist Party's Central Propaganda Department and carried out the purge of government critics in 1989, was made senior vice-chairman of the once prestigious think tank. Wang joined Cass in 1992 as the party boss, but did not have any defined position in the administration. The official announcement directed at overseas audiences said that new heads had been named at 43 of the 150 institutes under Cass and that liberal academics involved in the 1989 protests or close to the former party chief, Zhao Ziyang, had been removed. Loyalty to socialism and "revolutionary spirit" were considered in addition to professional qualifications in making the appointments. But the official report did not mention Wang's appointment, perhaps because even his comrades knew this might have spoiled a public relations exercise boasting a younger, more capable Cass leadership "emancipated in thought and perspective". "What a joke," sneered an older intellectual who translates social science books. "I'm surprised there is still something that can make them feel embarrassed, now that they have turned our profession into the most politically repressed and economically pointless way to make a living in the entire country." Staff were not consulted about Wang's nomination. Some had signed a protest letter to the top leadership when he was transferred to Cass. Despite the economic reform of the past couple of years, social science research in China has remained under tight control by a small group of ideologically conservative officials who rose to power with the crackdown on the 1989 mass protests. Freedom in academic pursuits and expression are still regarded as dangerous by the regime. News of Wang's appointment came shortly after a national conference on propaganda. The only message of the conference was that the party wanted to reassert "leadership on public opinion". One new twist, however, was a warning to the press not to indulge in publicising "certain issues" to such a degree that they have "excessive social impact". The "certain issues" concerned, according to Beijing journalists, include last year's high rate of inflation -- the third-highest record during the reform era -- and rampant corruption. Inflation and corruption were the two most important factors which drove millions of citizens to join in open protests in many Chinese cities in 1989, which the regime was able to disperse only by using armed force. The situation in the Year of the Dog is in many ways as serious as at the beginning of 1989, according to some social scientists. The leadership has an abiding fear of serious social research, noted one Beijing university teacher, who said it was a "lesson learned four years ago", when many Cass researchers were participants and even leaders in the mass protests. To control social science, the regime not only uses fusty bureaucrats such as Wang Renzhi -- who himself has accepted bribes, according to former subordinates at the Party Propaganda Department -- but it has also financially crippled research in many Cass institutes. Since the 1989 crackdown, the Institute of Political Science and the Institute of Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought -- two departments which produced some of the regime's most articulate critics -- have not embarked on a single important project. Administrative control of these two institutes has been merged with the Institute of Law Studies, Cass sources said. "It is a tradition in Soviet style systems that political science can never be treated as a separate discipline, but rather must be subordinated to Stalin's theory on the state and law," the source said. The library at Cass can only afford to renew subscriptions to a quarter of the foreign social science periodicals it used to import during the 1980s -- dropping from nearly 4,000 titles to only 800 -- due to the devaluation of renminbi and lack of any corresponding increase in funding. Since mid-1993, some Cass institutes have leased their office rooms to businesses or converted them into cheap hotels. In the worst cases, money earmarked for research was distributed as year-end bonuses among staff who would otherwise have to cancel their holiday shopping. Ironically, nearly every institute has set up a "leading group on money-making activities" (chuangshou lingdao xiaozu), often headed by the institute director. The money-making group is expected to eke out the institute's lean research budget and supplement the staff's meagre welfare funds. But the Institute of Political Science has not even been able to get its money-making venture off the ground. The main reason, according to one source at Cass, is that its field of learning has no commercial value. Moreover, the institute director, Wu Daying, who was also installed after the 1989 crackdown, is said to be extremely selfish as well as incompetent. He does not want to share any of his own money-making opportunities with colleagues with differing political views. A typical middle-aged researcher at Cass earns just less than 300 renminbi (HK$265 [Hong Kong dollars]) a month. To buy a decent suit in Beijing costs more than 1,000 renminbi. Finding a publisher for one's scholarly work in the market place can be an uphill battle, even if the book is not politically sensitive. A manuscript will not usually be accepted by mainland publishers unless the author promises to sell -- or buy -- most, if not all, of the books. "The whole process takes two years to complete," said a Cass literary critic, "and you get nothing out of it at the end except being worn to a frazzle." A "sense of loss" has also invaded the six Cass institutes of economic research. Some receive research contracts, thereby offsetting funding problems, but still face a brain drain crisis because economists are being offered lucrative corporate positions in the external job market.
