He also doubted the United States' will and desire to restore democracy in Haiti. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was participating last week in the meeting of the Black Caucus, thinks the United States is supporting the authors of the coup d'etat. How can one claim the U.S. Embassy was not involved in the coup d'etat? asked the president-in-exile. Aristide feels President Clinton still has a chance to prove, by restoring democracy to Haiti, that the United States was not, or is no longer, involved in the coup. It should be recalled that Father Aristide made those statements in Miami where he was the guest of the Black Caucus at its meeting. At that forum, the president-in-exile severely criticized U.S. policy on Haitian refugees, calling it racist. Rothschild Francois has filed the following report: [Begin recording] [Francois] Six months away from the third anniversary of his forced departure into exile, Jean-Bertrand Aristide seems to be beginning to lose patience and mostly to doubt Washington's will to favor his return to Port-au-Prince. Speaking over the weekend at the meeting of the Black Caucus in Miami, the Haitian president did not hesitate to criticize the Clinton administration's policies on Haiti. Jean-Bertrand Aristide thinks the Americans are supporting the military who overthrew him in September 1991. Aristide said, further, that the Haitian people set great store by the democratic principle and would like for peace to spread throughout their country. Without making direct reference to the international community, Aristide invites the Haitian people to mistrust those who, according to him, support criminals while claiming to want to defend democracy. [Aristide, in Creole] People who claim that they are defending democracy and who, until now, have not done what they said they would do, are showing that they do not respect their word. We ourselves have kept our word. We will continue doing everything possible for democracy to return home and certainly, it must end. [Francois] During the meeting of the Black Caucus in Miami, President Aristide hailed the support received to date from the Black Caucus. The president also encouraged the initiative by the members of the Black Caucus, who intend to intervene with the Clinton administration so that it adopts a more aggressive policy against the Haitian military. In his intervention before the Black Caucus, the president also brought the discussion to bear on the matter of the boat people. Aristide sharply denounced U.S. policy toward the Haitian refugees. It is a racist policy, says the president, who reminds everybody that Cubans are welcomed in the United States while Haitians are turned back. Aristide tries to compare this situation to a house on fire: Some of the people inside the house are trying to escape, while the police are forcing them to return to the house, which is burning. That is the way the president described it. The exiled president stated that a solution to the problem of the boat people necessarily entails his return to the National Palace. Furthermore, Jean-Bertrand Aristide asked for a total embargo in order to force the military to accept his returning to Port-au-Prince -- a request rejected by Washington. The Clinton government clearly pointed out that just reinforcing the sanctions cannot contribute to solving the crisis. Washington requests the president to appoint a prime minister and to support implementation of the parliamentarians' plan. To date, President Aristide has refused to go along. After a year of collaboration deemed good, the health of the relations between President Aristide and the Clinton administration is today hit by an epidemic of disagreements. Meanwhile, in situ, nothing has really changed since the legislators passed their resolution for a solution to the crisis: The Senate is still in crisis; the military are refraining from taking a stand regarding the legislators' plan; the national economy is plummeting. Meanwhile, one thing is certain: The word hope has begun to disappear from Haitians' vocabulary. [end recording]
