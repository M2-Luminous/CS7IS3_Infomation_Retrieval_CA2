FBIS4-57233 "drlat094_m_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-094 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Brazil Influence of Polls on Political Contenders Seen Influence of Polls on Political Contenders Seen 94SM0336A Sao Paulo VEJA in Portuguese 6 Apr 94 pp 30, 31 94SM0336A Sao Paulo VEJA Portuguese CSO [Text] Last Saturday, a flock of ministers, governors, and mayors who had resigned their posts before the end of their terms of office took flight to try their luck at the ballot box on 3 October. Ten of the 27 governors elected in 1990 stepped down. Only one of them, Leonel Brizola of Rio de Janeiro, announced on Good Friday that he will run for the presidency. The others plan to compete for Senate seats, a race that is never easy but will be relatively pleasant. In 1994, there are two senatorial vacancies in each state -- a situation that offers each contender twice the chances of victory as in 1990, when only one seat was available. The last governor to make a decision was Geraldo Bulhoes, of Alagoas. Until very early Saturday morning, Bulhoes was in Maceio putting together a "superslate" inspired by the big man himself, former President Fernando Collor. The name of Rosane Collor came up at the negotiating table, but was promptly rejected by the former president. Interested in running for a Chamber seat, his wife, toalheira Denilma Bulhoes was hoping until the last minute that her husband would resign and thus remove any legal obstacle to her own campaign. Besides FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso], two other stars from the Itamar Franco campaign, left office at the last minute: Mauricio Correa, who left Justice to run for governor of the Federal District, and Walter Barelli, of Labor, who is being considered as candidate for lieutenant governor of Sao Paulo on a slate with tucano Mario Covas. Among mayors of state capitals, all sworn in 15 months ago, the most notable departure is that of Dante de Oliveira, from Cuiaba, who will run for the governorship of Mato Grosso under the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] banner. Their chances for success and the reasons that led governors and mayors to enter the race vary, but all took as their starting point a decisive factor -- the opinion polls. Nowadays no candidate makes decisions based on the enthusiasm or the advice of his friends. They decide on the basis of research institute surveys. A month ago, when he ranked second in the polls among candidates for Planalto Palace, Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf announced his "irrevocable" decision to run for president. Last week, when the same polls reported he had been overtaken by Fernando Henrique, Maluf summoned the press and read a statement in which he said: "I am a candidate for president...in 1998." Another poll encouraged him to make the same decision. Eight out of 10 respondents who had voted for Maluf said they were opposed to his stepping down as mayor. Before making his final decision, he listened to some advice, and later, a promise. "If those who voted for you don't want you to run, it would be wiser not to," Deputy Antonio Delfim Netto told him. On Monday, Maluf had dinner with businessman Roberto Marinho, of Globo Network. "He told me that if I were to run, he would wish me luck, but that I am young and can wait," Maluf himself revealed. "He said that if I run, he would treat me fairly, which is saying quite a bit." On Tuesday in Brasilia, Maluf met with top PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] leaders and heard the same suggestion. "You are like Corinthians [a Sao Paulo soccer team], the paulistanos' emotional favorite, and you cannot let them down," Senator Esperidiao Amin told him. "You could run, but the people want you to stay." It is true that the PFL's [Liberal Front Party] preference for Fernando Henrique also influenced Maluf's decision. But the absence of allies has never played a decisive role in the mayor's decisions. Since 1978, he has run for president twice, sought the governorship three times (winning once, in an indirect election), run twice for mayor (and won once), and tried for and won a seat as federal deputy in 1982. If Maluf's ratings had been better in 1994, there is no doubt he would have stayed in the race. Free Sample The year 1994 is different from 1989 because of a crucial element. The election five years ago was for a single office. Twenty-two candidates for president flooded the first round. Most were merely adventurers who entered the contest without the slightest chance of victory and without letting that bother them. They were interested in giving voters a free sample for the 1990 elections, when governorships, the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, and seats in state legislatures would be at stake. The 1994 elections will cover all those posts at one time. There will not be another chance like this until 1998 when, as was approved in the constitutional revision, "joint" elections will be held again. The only opportunity between now and then will come in 1996, but those will be municipal elections -- for mayor and city councilmen. Key to the Vault "We won't see any `parachutist' candidates in 1994, the ones who enter today's race so they can try to win tomorrow's," explained Professor Francisco Weffort, of the University of Sao Paulo. "Anyone who runs now is really serious about it." A typical feature of a "joint" [casada] election are the alliances, which are very important. A candidate for the presidency needs solid support in each state if he is to prevent an internal hemorrhage of his electorate. Likewise, a candidate for governor will try to ally himself with a presidential candidate who would help to fill, rather than empty, his basket of votes. The government apparatus is another ingredient in the mortar between the bricks of this state/federal edifice. That mass of public funds, jobs, and influence helps explain why 17 governors decided to remain in office. "I cannot just hand over to Fernando Henrique a state government like that of Rio Grande do Sul," admitted Governor Alceu Collares, a Brizola campaign worker who, were he to leave Piratini, would have to turn over the key to the vault to his lieutenant, tucano Joao Gilberto Coelho, from whom he is estranged. An identical situation prevails in Ciro Gomes's Ceara State, but the party banners are reversed. Tucano Ciro Gomes is popular enough to run for and easily win a seat in the Senate. His headache is his lieutenant governor, Lucio Alcantara, a brizolista who was demanding his share of the government pie even before the campaign began. Apprehensive, last week Ciro Gomes said he would wait until his term ends before starting studies at Harvard University in the United States. Reheated Cafe au Lait Whether to stay in government or leave prematurely is a decision that each politician also makes on the basis of his own performance. Most Bahia voters believe Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes [ACM] is doing an excellent job, and he said farewell to the post in grand style last week to run for the Senate. His final act was to free 154 prisoners who had been jailed for petty theft, such as stealing a package of candy or a pair of glasses. Always with an eye to topics that can seize the voters' attention, ACM explained his gesture as a protest "in a country where the judiciary never takes action against the rich." In a different situation are the governors of the country's most populous and wealthiest states: Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho of Sao Paulo, and Helio Garcia, of Minas Gerais. On the popularity list among governors, Fleury ranks just above Helio Garcia, who is next-to-last. The booby prize belongs to Leonel Brizola. Fleury and Helio Garcia spent the last few months cooking up conversations in an atmosphere of mystery. They even gave the impression they were reheating the old cafe au lait of the Old Republic. Actually, Fleury was playing at being a presidential candidate until Orestes Quercia reentered the ticket-taker's booth at the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] amusement park. On behalf of the Minas distillery, Garcia tried to hitch a ride as vice president on Fernando Henrique's slate. Turned down, he had neither the heart nor the ratings to attempt a run for the Senate. [Box pp 30-31] Dance of the Governors - Goias: Governor Iris Rezende, of the PMDB, will run for the Senate. Since Lieutenant Governor Maguito Vilela will be a candidate for governor, the state will be governed by the president of the state legislature, Agenor Rodrigues de Rezende, of the PMDB. - Brasilia: Singed by the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee], Governor Joaquim Roriz of the PP [Progressive Party] announced he will stay put. He will try to get his public works secretary, Jose Roberto Arruda, elected to succeed him. - Parana: Governor Roberto Requiao of the PMDB resigned to seek his party's nomination for president. If he is not successful, he will run for the Senate. In his place will be Lieutenant Governor Mario Pereira, his former transportation secretary. - Rio Grande do Sul: Governor Alceu Collares, of the PDT, said he is staying in office. He does not want to hand over the governorship to his lieutenant, tucano Joao Gilberto, with whom he is not on speaking terms. - Ceara: Tucano Governor Ciro Gomes, Brazil's most popular, with a 69 percent approval rating, announced he will stay on. Tasso Jereissati, president of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], may be a candidate to succeed him. - Pernambuco: Governor Joaquim Francisco, of the PFL [Liberal Front Party], said he will serve out his full term. At the last minute, Recife Mayor Jarbas Vasconcelos, of the PMDB, announced he is staying. He gave up the idea of running for the state governorship in an alliance forged with Joaquim Francisco to defeat Miguel Arraes, the candidate of the PSB-PT [Brazilian Socialist Party/Workers Party] coalition. - Bahia: Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, of the PFL, resigned to run for the Senate. Lieutenant Governor Paulo Souto is a candidate for governor, and the president of the state Assembly, Antonio Imbassahy, will run for the Chamber. So, Bahia will be governed by the president of the Court of Justice, Ruy Trindade, who will call indirect elections in 30 days. Likely to be chosen is state Transportation Secretary Raimundo Britto. - Minas Gerais: Governor Helio Garcia, of the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], tried until the last minute to step down to become Fernando Henrique's running mate. Unsuccessful, he called a press conference to say that he will serve out his term. - Rio de Janeiro: Governor Leonel Brizola, the country's least popular governor, left office to run for president. Nilo Garcia, his lieutenant and current secretary of the Civil Police, will take over. - Sao Paulo: Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, of the PMDB, will remain in office and support the presidential candidacy of his political godfather, Orestes Quercia. Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf gave up the idea of running for president and will stay until the end of his mandate. - Santa Catarina: Governor Vilson Kleinubing, of the PFL, will try for the Senate, or for the vice presidency on Fernando Henrique's slate. He will pass on the post to his lieutenant governor, Antonio Carlos Konder Reis, of the PPR. Reis is a cousin of Jorge Bornhausen, president of the PFL.
