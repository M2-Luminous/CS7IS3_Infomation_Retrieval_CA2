Abiola, the former presidential candidate of the defunct Social Democratic Party, SDP, from his domain, continues to receive attention from the newspapers. One of them, the DAILY SKETCH, reports that the Nigeria police have explained Chief Abiola's escape, in which the force denied any complicity in the event. The paper notes that this angle to the political situation calls for explanation in order to disabuse the minds of those who believed that policemen were in Chief Abiola's house when he escaped. The SKETCH quotes the police as saying that Chief Abiola, who was alleged to have declared himself president of Nigeria on Saturday [11 June] disguised as a woman and escaped from his Ikeja residence in Lagos. The paper reports that this incident happened before the arrival of the police. Although the police refuted the story that Chief Abiola declared himself president on Saturday, THE GUARDIAN on his front page has a picture of Chief Abiola and his agents at Ekpetedo in Lagos, where he was purported to have announced his presidency in respect of the annulled 12 June presidential election last year by the former military regime. In a related story, the SKETCH reports that some eminent Nigerians have called for dialogue as a positive means of resolving the political situation in the country. It quotes the Archbishop of Lagos, Dr. Anthony Olufomi Okoje, as stating that democracy could not be achieved through violence, force, or in a chaotic situation. Rather, it would be achieved in an atmosphere of peace. Reporting on the same story, THE GUARDIAN has it that the Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, wants the Abiola and Abacha camp to use dialogue instead of confrontation to achieve peace in Nigeria. On its part, the LAGOS HORIZON described the situation in Lagos yesterday, Monday, in its lead story as that of an uneasy calm in the state. It adds that workers were at their duty posts even though transport was light because many transport operators stayed off the roads, and the petrol stations were locked up to avoid molestation by some pro-democracy groups. However, the DAILY TIMES reports that there were pockets of protests in some parts of Lagos by pro-democracy activists who called on the military to quit politics in Nigeria. According to the paper, these were peaceful as some security agents were able to control the situation.
