The progress that was achieved in relations between Iraq and the Special Commission in July 1993 has been augmented during the latest round of high-level talks that was held in Baghdad from 2-5 February. At their initial stages, the talks were attended by an IAEA representative. The current talks reviewed the steps that have been taken by the two sides to establish the frameworks for the continued monitoring and verification system after Iraq's acceptance on 26 November 1993 of UN Security Council Resolution 715 of 1991. In this regard, the talks have augmented the great progress that has been achieved since last July in both the political and technical fields, specifically the high-level talks held in New York and Baghdad in September, October, and November 1993. 2. The two sides expressed their readiness to expedite the process of setting up the continuous monitoring and verification system in a spirit of goodwill for the sake of realizing their common objective, which is specifically the submission of a report to the Security Council by both the Commission and the IAEA at the earliest reasonable time, indicating that Iraq has, in their opinion, adopted all the required measures in accordance with Paragraph 22 of Security Council Resolution 687. The Commission noted that, within this context, the phase of intensive inspection operations which have already started in all areas of its jurisdiction will continue. For its part, Iraq noted that it will welcome all these inspection teams and facilitate their work. 3. Technical talks regarding a number of issues were also held.
