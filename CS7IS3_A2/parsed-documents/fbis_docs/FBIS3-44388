They specifically discussed the issue of repatriating hijackers across the Taiwan Strait. A reporter interviewed an ARATS official on this issue. The official said: The recent round of negotiations focused on the repatriation of hijackers across the Taiwan Strait. During the negotiations, we made substantial progress and achieved major consensus. The two sides unanimously held that hijacking airliners through violent, coercive, or other means is a serious crime, that it should be punished sternly, and hijackers should, in principle, be repatriated without exception. On the basis of this understanding and through serious consultations, the two sides initially laid out the basic stylistic framework for an agreement on cross-strait repatriation of hijackers while leaving the language of such an agreement to further discussion. According to the official, the basic stylistic framework for an agreement on cross-strait repatriation of hijackers covers, by and large, the scope of applicability, the principles of repatriation, compulsory measures, repatriation requests and methods, and handovers. It is understood the agreement will apply to people on either side of the Taiwan Strait who hijack an airliner from one side and divert it to the other through violent, coercive, or other means. In principle, Mazu and Mawei will be used as handover points in any seaborne repatriation operation; the two sides also agreed to select Jinmen and Xiamen as handover points in light of their actual needs. According to the official, negotiators from the two organizations signaled the need for their organizations to carry on negotiations on the issue of repatriating hijackers at an early date and to hold further consultations on the wording of several clauses in the related document in the interest of reaching an agreement at an early date.
