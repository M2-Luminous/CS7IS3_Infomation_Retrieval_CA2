The railway was also on strike. What do you think this is? Is this a result of their social conditions, I mean a social mutiny certain circles have been threatening us with? Or is this an action planned in accordance with certain political forces' desire to come to power? [Shevardnadze] I think both. I am not going to elaborate on this. I simply want to express my attitude. I am thankful to the railway personnel, whom I have always relied on, and the personnel of the subway. They experience great difficulties and despite this, they have demonstrated a high civic awareness, acknowledged our difficulties, and taken into consideration the difficulties of the country and every citizen of the country and returned to work. I am thankful to the deputies who visited the strikers. They had thought that something unlawful was taking place. I cannot say that they appealed to them to return to work, but they assured themselves that the law had not been violated there and they did not provoke the continuation of the strike. [passage omitted] Now a few words about strikes in general. Strikes make sense in two cases. First, when the state or a private entrepreneur has possibilities and resources that are not used for the benefit of the employees. As a result, the employees suffer economic losses and feel insecurity in some other spheres. The state and the citizens are well aware what Georgia possesses today. They will not be able to gain much from their strikes. [passage omitted] An increase of salaries in coupons can eventually have a reverse effect. A better result can be achieved if it is found possible to bring in goods so that they are purchased for coupons. This could help, but the state does not have a lot of big resources or reserves. Of course, we can issue a large number of additional coupons and distribute them, but this will not be of any help. So, in this case, a strike is not a good tool to improve your own economic conditions and the economic conditions of your enterprise. Another time is when you consider it necessary that the head of state quit, the government be replaced, and so on. [passage omitted] My actions have repeatedly proved that no violent forces or strikes are required for this. I reiterate that I have always been ready for this if it is beneficial for our deeds. But I want to declare that while I am doing my job, I will do it as my conscience allows me and as my knowledge and experience, as well as physical possibilities, allow me to. Keep in mind that there cannot be more than 24 hours in a day. Hence, the physical possibilities of those who give all their power and sense of responsibility to their work are limited. Therefore, at present, there are no grounds for a demand that the authorities quit. I mean that a strike is not a means to save the state today. On the contrary, a strike will practically be directed against families, children, and our own country. [Oniniani] Certain positive changes have been observed lately in talks with the Abkhazia side in Moscow. Will these promote the deployment of peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia? Another question. The day before yesterday, you spend most of the time in the Ministry of Defense. What is being done to achieve the aim you planned when taking up the leadership of the ministry, I mean the establishment of a new Georgian army? [Shevardnadze] If signed this morning, the text of the agreement will be both a maximum and a minimum. The work on it still continues in Moscow, and I am not ready to comment on every paragraph of it because changes were being introduced during the past two days. It is a maximum of the present possibilities and a minimum for the UN Security Council to make a decision on the deployment of international peacekeeping forces. You remember their precondition that certain progress should be made during the talks, a cease-fire should be implemented, fighting should be stopped, and only after this the United Nations would make a decision to have international forces deployed. Therefore, when signed, this agreement will have an essential importance. As for the formula mentioned by Kozyrev, it will be amplified this morning, and I think it must be acceptable in principle. There is a little exception there. An armed person should not enter Abkhazia. Neither should those who are in the military service, in military units today. They cannot enter Abkhazia as servicemen. This has nothing to do with about 98 percent of the population, and only the case of about 2 percent should be elucidated. I know what will follow the publication of the agreement. There will be questions about what the other side is doing and how will the issues of demilitarization, disarmament of the units present there be handled. All this comprises the second stage. At the moment, the principal thing is to create conditions for the deployment of international peacekeeping forces. And I want everyone to understand this well. As for the Ministry of Defense, serious work has started there. [passage omitted] A lot is yet to be done. We have discussed all this at the meeting of the collegium and made certain decisions. We shall speak about the decisions later. [Oniani] Batono [polite form of address] Eduard, what do you think can be the reason of a virtually unanimous approval of your nominees to the Cabinet of Ministers? I am asking this question because before this process began, there was rather a strong opposition to them. [Shevardnadze] Do not hurry. About the unanimity. There have been difficulties. What can be said about the case with Mr. Mindia Ugrekhelidze? It is an absolutely incomprehensible case. This man is a living image of conscience and honor, one of the best experts on law. I have a deep respect for him as a lawyer and an individual and I cannot imagine anyone who does not respect him. An amazingly positive person, and I believe this was a result of some misunderstanding. But it happened anyway, and this is a difficulty. We are facing a crucial day tomorrow. The fate of 10 ministries will be decided. I believe that the parliament will stick to its good standards. Now, you are asking me what the motive is and why it has been happening like this. I would like to give the following explanation. A sense of responsibility is dominant in the case. This happened when the parliament demonstrated its unity as the police forces intruded into the building. I believe that the majority of the parliament, I do not mean the official majority but actually most of the deputies are well aware of the situation the country can find itself in if a government crisis continues. In fact, we are witnessing a crisis now because a person has been sitting in the parliament for weeks waiting for his turn to be approved. The ministries are at a virtual standstill at the moment. I reiterate, this is a sense of responsibility. [Oniani] And finally. In his TV interview, Security Minister Igor Giorgadze forecast that the current tensions would culminate on 9 April [on this day in 1989, 20 people died when Soviet troops dispersed a rally, and in 1991, the Georgian parliament adopted an Act on the restoration of Georgia's independence]. Was this the reason for the postponement of your visit to Israel? [Shevardnadze] Generally, before my foreign visits something always takes place. The same has happened now. I mean strikes, the incident that happened here [the police raid on parliament], which has not been completely settled yet, and yet another expected event Mr. Giorgadze spoke about. So, I summoned the Israeli ambassador and informed him with anguish that my leaving the country was not expedient at the moment. I would say that I am doing this to be on the safe side. So, I have put off a visit that is so important for our country and especially for the economic prospects of the country. Some people think that these visits are simply visits and excursions and nothing else. You yourself have witnessed what hard work is done during these visits. Everyone who is involved is extremely busy. And every visit has a certain effect on Georgia. We have not become rich, but the fact that we can take a breath and we exist is a result of these visits. U.S. President Clinton announced that he was allotting about $70 million in aid. Later, as a result of our delegation's activities there, the sum increased to about $80 million. Some more sums will be added to this from other sources and foundations, some from previous years, and eventually Georgia will have $140-$150 million for the current year. There would have probably been certain assistance even without this visit, but the visit played its role. Thus, it is not entertainment, and when a visit is on the agenda, we have to back up one another because this is so essential for Georgia. Thank you.
