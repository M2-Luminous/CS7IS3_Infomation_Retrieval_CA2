Einseln met today Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, Russian chief of general staff. At the meeting ideas were exchanged on the activity of the working group on military issues at the talks between Estonia and Russia and on the opportunities for military collaboration of the two countries. Kolesnikov again emphasized that solving the issue of troop withdrawal together with giving social guarantees to the retired military living in Estonia is important to Russia. As it became known to the Baltic News Service from official sources of the Russian Defense Ministry, it was confirmed while Kolesnikov and Einseln were meeting that the instruction by Boris Yeltsin concerning the creation of Russian military bases in the CIS and Latvia was drawn up by the general staff. The instruction, issued on 5 April, caused tension between Russia and the Baltic states, especially in relations between Latvia and Russia.

Today Kolesnikov (?brought for making public) the instruction's actual contents [passage indistinct].
