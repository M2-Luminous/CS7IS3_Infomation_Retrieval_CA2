This was also an exceptionally successful meeting. We discussed mainly Estonia joining the European Union via an association agreement. [Correspondent] A document has now been signed, but what steps are now expected from us? What do we need to do to be suitable partners to NATO, so to speak? [Luik] A suitable partner must present a document about our major needs for the building of the defense forces in Estonia. Work on drafting this document has already begun in Tallinn. A corresponding NATO team is in Tallinn today to provide us with preliminary advice on composing such a document. Then we will put this document together--our Foreign and Defense Ministries. We will definitely also involve members of parliament and experts. The document must fairly precisely list the needs existing for the Estonian defense forces at the moment. NATO will then select the aspects where it can provide support. [Correspondent] Did this unfortunate fact also come up in your discussions--that the Estonian-Russian round of talks, from which quite a lot was in fact expected--ended, in essence, with a fat zero? A timetable for the troop withdrawal was not presented. [Luik] Yes, this came up at the European Union, as well as at NATO. I also spoke about this to journalists at a news conference. This is, of course, extremely unfortunate, and everybody I met expressed amazement that the Russian side had failed to produce the relevant documents. At the moment, it seems that the Russian side is violating one of its basic promises, not to link the troop withdrawal to any other issues. A clearly evident link has been made between the troop withdrawal and the fate of military pensioners. This is a link we cannot accept, and this is what I have also said here in Brussels.
