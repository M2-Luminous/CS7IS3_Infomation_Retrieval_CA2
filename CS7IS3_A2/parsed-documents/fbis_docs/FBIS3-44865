A national meeting of the directors of personnel departments and bureaus which opened today reached this common understanding: Closely revolving around the central task of economic construction, we should broaden the scope of reform, quicken the pace of reform, and gradually establish a personnel management system that is in line with the socialist market economic system. It has been learned: relatively big progress has been made in the country's personnel work in 1993 -- structural reform has entered the implementation stage from the stage of study and discussion; the public service system has gradually proceeded from experimentation to implementation, and work on hiring through taking examinations and on giving rewards and imposing punishments based on one's work performance has been carried out in a planned way; reform of the personnel system of enterprises and institutions has been speeded up and in-depth study of the classified personnel management system is being conducted; the reform plan and implementation rules for the new wage system for government organs and institutions have been issued to all units concerned; the personnel market has developed quite rapidly and reasonable personnel flow has begun to take place; reform of the job title system, promotion of outstanding middle-aged and young experts, the issuance of special government allowances, and other related measures have further rallied the enthusiasm and creativity of professional and technical workers; and the task of resettling demobilized military cadres has been smoothly accomplished. To develop as soon as possible a personnel management system that is in line with the socialist market economic system, the Personnel Ministry set forth the following primary tasks for 1994: to ensure the establishment and institution of the state's public service system; to properly build up a new wage system and to put it into operation; to ensure a good job in the initiating and experimentation of the reform of the insurance system of government organs and institutions; to further build up the force of professional and technical workers, to strengthen the management of them, and to improve the service for them; to actively cultivate and develop personnel market mechanisms; and to step up the establishment of laws and regulations governing personnel affairs. State Councilor Li Guixian attended the meeting and gave a speech focusing on establishing and promoting the public service system. He said: The establishment and institution of the state's public service system is a major event in China's political life and a basic requirement for deepening the reform of the economic system and for building a socialist market economic system. Li Guixian said the establishment and institution of the state's public service system is the focus of the current efforts to quicken the pace of reforming the personnel system. He called for initially establishing the public service system next year in all departments of the State Council and in the organs of the majority of provincial-level governments and governments of cities with provincial-level economic powers to lay a solid foundation for initially establishing the public service system across the country in the following three years or a little more time. At the meeting, Minister of Personnel Song Defu made a report entitled "Broaden the Scope of Reform, Quicken the Pace of Reform, and Establish a Personnel Management System That is in Line With the Socialist Market Economic System." In his report, Song Defu set forth a new idea for reforming the personnel system -- establishing a categorized personnel management system, a scientific and reasonable wage distribution system, social insurance systems at various levels, macro personnel management systems at various levels, a personnel market system, and a system of personnel laws and regulations, and work to refine these systems.
