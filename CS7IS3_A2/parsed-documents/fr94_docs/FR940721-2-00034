FR940721-2-00034 FR940721-2-00024 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;635&hyph;000, et al.] El Paso Natural Gas Co., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings July 14, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. El Paso Natural Gas Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;635&hyph;000] Take notice that on June 30, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), P.O. Box 1492, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;635&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon the delivery point known as the Anaconda Copper Company Meter Station located in Cibola County, New Mexico under El Paso's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;435&hyph;000 and CP88&hyph;433&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. El Paso proposes to remove one 2'' O.D. tap and valve assembly, with appurtenances, and one 4'' O.D. positive displacement meter at approximately milepost 343.41 on El Paso's Permian-San Juan Crossover Line in the NW/4 of Section 18, Township 12 North, Range 10 West, Cibola County, New Mexico. The metering facility will be removed with only minimal ground disturbance with that being limited to existing, previously-disturbed right-of-way. El Paso states that it provides firm transportation service for Gas Company of New Mexico (GCNM) at the Anaconda Copper Company Meter Station pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Transportation Service Agreement dated November 12, 1990. El Paso understands that Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), successor to Anaconda Copper Company has closed an operating site and terminated its June 19, 1974 gas purchase contract with GCNM. This gas purchase contract covered gas service to ARCO's Bluewater Millsite in Cibola County, New Mexico. El Paso understands further that as part of ARCO's termination request, ARCO also requested that the segment of GCNM's line feeding the Bluewater Millsite be disconnected at El Paso's metering station. El Paso asserts that as a direct result of the Bluewater Millsite closing, and since GCNM has not requested gas service from this meter station since May 1989, GCNM has requested that El Paso abandon and remove the Anaconda Copper Company Meter Station. This meter station serves no purpose and may obstruct ARCO's clean up of the Bluewater Millsite. Accordingly, El Paso proposes to abandon by removal the Anaconda Copper Company Meter Station. Comment date: August 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 2.
