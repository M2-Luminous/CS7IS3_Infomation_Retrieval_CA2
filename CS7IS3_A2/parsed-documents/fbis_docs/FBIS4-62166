This agreement is not identical with the accords that some of our former CEMA partners in East Europe have with the EU. The Common Market agreed on free trade with them right away. Russia represents an economy that is large for the EU, and Brussels will not agree to harmonization with it without careful consideration. Nevertheless a treaty with Russia is desirable for Moscow. It provides a legal footing for trade and economic relations with the EU. The prepared draft constitutes an interim agreement. It will operate until late 1997, when a decision is to be adopted on whether it should be supplemented with a statute on free trade. In its current form Moscow will receive two and a half of the four freedoms operating with the EU -- freedom of movement for goods, services, capital, and manpower -- namely freedom of movement for services and capital, and the phased liberalization of commodity exchange. In the opinion of Foreign Ministry experts, the EU's agreeing to grant Russia the same advantages that other members of GATT enjoy was a very important gain for Moscow. Through not taking part in that organization Russia has often fallen victim to restrictive measures introduced against its competitive goods. Moscow will now obtain the right to demand observance of GATT norms within the EU -- provided, of course, that it meets them itself. It only proved possible to make a breakthrough on two problems that remained unresolved until recently -- Russian exports of nuclear materials and the status of West European banks in Russia -- as a result of contacts by telephone and fax between Sir Leon Brittan, EU commissioner for trade, and Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy chairman of the Russian Government. Moscow insisted that there should not be deliberate discrimination against Russian exports of fissionable materials but encountered dogged opposition from Paris. France also produces nuclear materials and is afraid of an influx of a large quantity of cheaper Russian output. The compromise goes like this: Moscow's demand has been met, but the EU reserves the right to use commercial means to protect the market until the term of the agreement expires, consulting with Russia on every occasion. As for Western banks, it has been decided that the Russian president's restrictive edict will be abrogated in 1995.
