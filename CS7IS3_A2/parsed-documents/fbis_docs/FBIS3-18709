Referendums and European Parliament permitting, Austria, Sweden and Finland should be able to join at the start of next year. The only regret is that Norway has, as yet, been unable to agree terms. The accession of all four states would be a cultural, political and economic boost to the Union. These countries share the EU's democratic values and each will extend the Union's diplomatic reach into new areas of the Third World. The EU would also gain much from closer links with the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The German plan to secure for these countries some stake in EU decision-making by the end of the year merits the strongest support. Establishing this close relationship will not be easy. The EU may find itself taking on a financial burden it can ill afford. But it is a risk worth taking. For it would underwrite the introduction of democracy to these states and provide a measure of the security they were denied when their applications to join NATO were rejected. They would also be encouraged to push ahead with developing market economies. Our continent, too, would be stronger. Instead of two blocs, one wealthy and self-centred, the other poor and envious, there will be a chance to build a community in which prosperity is shared. Enlargement also has considerable implications for the way the Union is governed. While there were only six, nine or even 12 members, it was possible to argue the case for a centralised Union. Even when the Union was small, the desirability of this goal was questionable; with 20 members, it is not even a practical possibility. The Union has a choice: it could become a loose confederation of nation states which worked closely together in a single economic market and operated together as a political unit when there was a consensus. This approach is favoured by Denmark and Britain. The alternative is a federal structure where many matters ranging from drinking water to education, which the Union is now involved in, would be the sole responsibility of member states. Control of the major issues, including foreign, monetary and economic policy, would be conducted on a supranational level. This would be feasible only if implemented on majority voting with countries losing their right of veto. The future of the Union is too important a question to be left to the politicians. There must be the widest possible democratic debate across the Union. There must be an attempt to build a democratic consensus. Our politicians should tell us openly what kind of Union they wish to see. They must then try to persuade us to accept their vision.
