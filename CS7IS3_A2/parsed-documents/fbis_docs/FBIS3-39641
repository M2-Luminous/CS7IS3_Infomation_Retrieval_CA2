Spokesman Djoeke Koekoek said a number of trucks, including some registered in the Netherlands, had been stopped by Greek border guards from crossing into Macedonia. The government here was alerted by the Dutch association of international transporters, EVO, after receiving a flood of telephone calls from drivers stuck at the border. EVO demanded late Thursday that Athens let the trucks through, threatening to send the Greeks the bill for the lost business otherwise. It advised its members to start transiting though Bulgaria, Hungary or Romania. Since the start of the Yugoslav civil war most trucks from the Netherlands have gone by ferry to Greek ports from Brindisi in southern Italy. Greece Wednesday closed its port of Salonika to Macedonian goods, severing its northern neighbour's main lifeline. There was no immediate word from Athens on the Dutch charges on Thursday. Greece accuses Macedonia of usurping a name which Athens says is solely part of Greek heritage and of harbouring expansionist ambitions over the Greek province of the same name. Dutch European Affairs Minister Piet Dunkert made a brief visit to Athens Thursday for talks with his Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos which included the Greek measures against Macedonia. An aide to the minister said that if Greece closed more ports it could mean an infringement of European law on goods in transit.
