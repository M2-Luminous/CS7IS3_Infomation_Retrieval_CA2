A corresponding decision was unanimously adopted yesterday at a joint session of the party's executive committee and the landtag group. Since the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] categorically rejects a coalition under Hoeppner's leadership, the only solution is a coalition between the SPD and the Greens. After the session, Hoeppner stated that he will run for the minister-president's position in any case. The SPD politician announced that in the event of his election, he wants to form a "grand coalition focusing on factual issues." To achieve this, he is ready to discuss cooperation with the CDU. There will be no talks with the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. However, the successor party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which won almost 20 percent of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt, will also play a role. A red-green minority government would have 41 of a total of 90 seats in the provincial government. The CDU holds 37 seats. It has become known from Hoeppner's circle that he wants to form a red-green minority government that would rely on "vagabonding majorities" of the PDS and the CDU. Yet some members of the executive committee and the landtag group who participated in the session expressed concern about this course. As early as in the runup to the meeting, Saxony-Anhalt's deputy SPD leader and member of the Bundestag, Uwe Kuester, warned his party against "misjudging the realities." He described the grand coalition as the only realistic possibility of forming a stable government in Saxony-Anhalt. At a closed session, the SPD wants to determine its further procedure and its course for coalition talks in the next three days. The model of a red-green coalition was strongly rejected by the CDU. Acting Minister-President Christoph Bergner announced that his party will not tolerate a minority government led by Hoeppner. Those who assume responsibility must bear it in all areas, Bergner stressed. He described the various toleration models that were mentioned as "absurd proposals." Bergner pointed out that he did not understand why the SPD rejected a grand coalition with the CDU categorically before starting official talks. The minister-president announced that he will present a proposal for talks to the Social Democrats before the end of this week. Saxony-Anhalt's CDU leader Karl-Heinz Daehre wants to do the same thing. During such exploratory talks, the balance of power in a possible grand coalition might also be discussed, Bergner suggested. However, he ruled out a renunciation of the CDU of the minister-president's position. The head of government expressed the concern that, in the runup to the Bundestag elections, the SPD is no longer willing to hold serious talks, as a result of which Saxony-Anhalt might drift into a "decisionless phase." Thus, Bergner appealed to the SPD not to form a minority government without any real need. The CDU landtag group nominated Bergner, CDU Chairman Daehre, the reelected landtag group Chairman Juergen Scharf, and the cabinet members Walter Remmers and Wolfgang Boehmer as members of the negotiating team. It was also decided that the PDS is to receive the position of a vice president in the landtag. Alliance 90/Greens confirmed their readiness for a coalition with the SPD. Exploratory talks are to start at the beginning of this week, Heidrun Heidecke announced. She stated that a Red-Green government might be tolerated both by the PDS and the CDU. Asked about the strict rejection of such a model by the CDU, Heidecke stated: "Even the CDU will stop sulking one day."
