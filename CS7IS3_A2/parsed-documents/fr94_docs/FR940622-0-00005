FR940622-0-00005 FR940622-0-00003 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;50] Modification of Class E Airspace: Dallas/Fort Worth, TX AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class E airspace at Dallas/Fort Worth, TX. An amendment to the very high frequency omnidirectional range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) at Cleburne Municipal Airport, Cleburne, TX, has necessitated this action. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level designated in conjunction with an airport for which an approved instrument approach procedure has been prescribed is needed to control aircraft executing the SIAP's. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at Cleburne, TX. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Alvin DeVane, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530, telephone 817&hyph;222&hyph;5595. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On December 1, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class E airspace at Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 63309). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Except for latitude/longitude position updates for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport; McKinney Municipal Airport; Mesquite, Phil Hudson Municipal Airport; Mesquite radio beacon (RBN); Lancaster RBN; Fort Worth Spinks Airport; Weatherford, Parker Country Airport; Bridgeport Municipal Airport; and Decatur Municipal Airport, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revises the Class E airspace located at Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, to provide for adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the SIAP's at Cleburne, TX. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
