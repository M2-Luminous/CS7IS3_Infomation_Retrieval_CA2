This statement was made during a meeting with the UN secretary general. Jean-Bertrand Aristide spoke for more than an hour with the UN secretary general while several thousand Haitians demonstrated near UN headquarters in support of the president in exile. It should be recalled that on the previous day, 4 March, the four countries, Friends of Haiti, had submitted to the UN Security Council a draft resolution reinforcing international sanctions against Haiti. The draft resolution provides for a total commercial embargo, except for food and medicine, the banning of non-commercial flights to or from Haiti, as well as some restrictions on travel by the authors of the coup d'etat and their relatives abroad. The UN Security Council is due to make a decision on this resolution within 15 days.
