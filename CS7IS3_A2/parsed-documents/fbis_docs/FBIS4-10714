Thus, Ruckauf discussed the possibility of replacing the current compulsory military service system with a professional Army. He nevertheless refused to make any additional comments because this issue does not specifically involve his portfolio, but the Defense Ministry. The interior minister stressed: "An unrestricted dignity must be guaranteed for those drafted." He added that conscripts "must not be petty soldiers, but qualified soldiers in order to defend our fatherland." In remarks to journalists accredited to the Government House, the interior minister pointed out: "In my opinion, General (Martin) Balza's quick handling of such a delicate situation is very significant."
