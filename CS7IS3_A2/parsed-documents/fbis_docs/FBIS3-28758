Ichiro Ozawa, representative of the Japan Renewal Party, who is known to be a behind-the-scenes coordinator of the Japanese coalition government, raved in an interview with Japanese FUJI Television on 6 February, which will serve as actual evidence. While saying that our Republic might take military action, he stressed that Japan should examine countermeasures to cope with an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. In addition, he did not hesitate to utter outbursts slandering our system. Ozawa's utterances are an impudent challenge to our Republic's dignity and authority and a dangerous aggressive outburst that betrays the heinous intention of the Japanese reactionaries by playing the role of a shock brigade for the imperialists in isolating and crushing our socialism. In addition, his utterances are premeditated strategic moves to find a pretext for reinforcement of the Japanese Armed Forces, the conversion of Japan into a military power, and the promotion of nuclear armament in particular. Now, going against the global trends of disarmament and detente since the Cold War collapsed, Japan has increased military expenditures and has taken to the road to convert Japan into a military power. The Japanese people raise their voices against such a plan. The Japanese reactionaries, by kicking up further clamorous commotions about our threat, are trying to influence social opinion into supporting the conversion of Japan into a military power and its nuclear armament. Ozawa talked about our military action. This can be termed a shock propaganda [chunggyok sonjon] to accomplish their purpose. However clamorously Ozawa may make jargon about our threat, the people who judge things correctly will not believe the jargon. The Japanese moves to become a military power and attain nuclear armament, in particular, give rise to the serious apprehension of the Asian people and the people of the world. Sam Nunn, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Forces Committee, said that Japan can develop nuclear weapons at any moment. The British paper, SUNDAY TIMES, reported that Japan might have already produced atomic bombs. The world believes that Japan, with its huge stockpile of plutonium, can become a nuclear power in a short time, if it decides to. Japan has already opened the way for dispatching troops overseas. Japan is going to embark upon reinvasion of Asia, with Korea as the first target. It is Ozawa who claimed that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces should be sent there as a member of the UN forces. Ozawa's call for examining countermeasures to cope with the event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula revealed Japan's intention to complete preparations for aggression on Korea and expedite the date of military action. Ozawa's outbursts are graver, because the United States and the South Korean puppets are babbling about our threat and strengthening the moves for a northward invasion. The Japanese reactionaries' belligerent utterances and movements show that Japan has become a hotbed of dangerous aggression and nuclear war. Thus the world people should enhance vigilance against this. Our people will never allow anyone to infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and hurl mud at our socialism. The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful that the conversion of Japan into a military power, its nuclear armament, and a war of aggression would lead them to destruction.
