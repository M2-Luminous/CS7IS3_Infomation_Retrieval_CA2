The president spoke at a New Year's meeting held on board the largest Polish destroyer, Warszawa. Lech Walesa also assessed the elapsed period of his presidency, saying that "everything is okay in the concept that I once chose, however there were problems with the realization of the latter." The president added: "I bet on democracy and reform initiated by the people. Poland did not let others win the race. We will never have a better legislature than the one we have now; I mean that everything was discussed over the last four years and it only has to be given legal footing now." Walesa stated that he had made no decision thus far regarding his running for another term as president but added that he would like to give it a try. The president swore that he will do his best to assist the Army, saying in Piotr Kolodziejczyk's presence: "I will try and assist [the Army] through the person who is an expert in this matter. I will not put up with political divisions in the Army." The president advocates adopting the Army's budget once every four years, so that the Army can plan in advance. Lech Walesa informed the audience that he will personally attend the 12 January conference of Visegrad Group leaders with President Bill Clinton, saying: "I hope he listens to us." Answering a RZECZPOSPOLITA question regarding hopes placed on the 10-11 January NATO summit in Brussels, the president said that we should approach the West set by step, staying in the West's orbit. The West is skillfully scheming. It is happy that the Warsaw Pact and the communist bloc have ceased to exist, while we want a unified Europe.
