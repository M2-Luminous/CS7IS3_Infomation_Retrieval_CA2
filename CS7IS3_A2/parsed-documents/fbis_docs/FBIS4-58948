In his speech, Mubarak proposed a plan to act as a nucleus for collective Arab action in petroleum spheres in light of the huge oil and natural gas resources available to the Arab countries, with their impact on the world energy situation. President Mubarak's plan, which was read on his behalf by Oil Minister Dr. Hamdi al-Banbi, calls for finding a mechanism to achieve cooperation in designing and implementing petroleum, natural gas, and petrochemicals projects in the Arab countries. The plan also calls for devising ways to coordinate among Arab countries so that they will collectively have the ability to design, implement, and administer petroleum projects and manufacture the equipment necessary for these projects. President Mubarak outlined the benefits the Arab countries would derive from this mechanism in implementing oil and natural gas projects. These benefits include lower costs, exchange of expertise, technology transfer, integration among Arab countries, and boosting capital industries with a view to creating more jobs and breaking the world monopoly on the implementation of oil projects. As part of the executive measures for the project, the president proposed the formation of a cooperation agency for petroleum projects comprising a national center for cooperation in oil projects in each of the member states and a primary coordination center in one of the Arab countries. This is in addition to forming a data bank to provide information on potential projects, the timing of their implementation, and the equipment and capabilities of the contractors. [passage omitted]
