FR940803-0-00102 FR940803-0-00039 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 072994B] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the ``other rockfish'' species category total allowable catch (TAC) in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), July 30, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with §672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the ``other rockfish'' species category TAC for the Eastern Regulatory Area was established by the final 1994 specifications (59␣FR␣7647, February 16, 1994) as 1,048 metric tons (mt). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), established in accordance with §672.20(c)(2)(ii), a directed fishing allowance for the ``other rockfish'' species category of 948 mt, with consideration that 100 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in this area. The Regional Director has determined that this directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., July 30, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at §672.20(g). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: July 29, 1994. Richard B. Stone, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18891 Filed 7&hyph;29&hyph;94; 2:13 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
