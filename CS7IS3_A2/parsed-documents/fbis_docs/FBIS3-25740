They will discuss King Hassan II's peace proposal for Angola. Meanwhile, diplomatic sources have said that Jose Eduardo dos Santos is disappointed with Angolan Ambassador to France Boaventura Cardoso's work. Ambassador Cardoso had prepared the Futungo de Belas Palace chieftain's visit to France. The MPLA-PT leader is also unhappy about a less than truthful report produced by Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura suggesting improved bilateral relations. The general opinion is that MPLA-PT leader's three-day visit to France was a thorough fiasco. French President Francois Mitterrand took a firm position and made it clear that his country did not wish to compromise the Lusaka peace talks in any way. The government led by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur supported President Francois Mitterrand's positions. [passage omitted] Using his constitutional powers, French President Mitterrand yesterday warned Acting President Eduardo dos Santos that France only supports a negotiated settlement to the Angolan crisis. The upshot is that Engineer Eduardo dos Santos will be returning home quite disappointed. [passage omitted]
