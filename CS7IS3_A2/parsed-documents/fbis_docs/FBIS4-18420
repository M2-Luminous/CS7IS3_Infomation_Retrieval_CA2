Berlusconi's institutional advisers are stressing that it is the government that will draw up the plan for a new federal Constitution. However, on the basis of disclosures from reliable sources within both leaderships, it is possible to forecast a process of institutional reforms that could profoundly change the face of Italian democracy over the coming year. Plan of Attack Berlusconi's plan of attack will have three main objectives. The form of the state will transition from a republic with centralized powers to a federal republic. The form of government will transform the parliamentary democracy into a semi-presidentialist system along the lines of the French Fifth Republic. And the electoral law will replace the Mattarella Law with a two-round system, another import from France. On the first point, federalism, agreement is less remote than it may seem. If the League relinquishes its provocative theory of the three republics (of the Po Valley, Etruria, and the South) and if the National Alliance, having already gone as far as to accept "decentralization," takes a further step, the five-party group of Forza Italia, the League, the Alliance, the CCD [Christian Democratic Center], and the UDC [Center Union] could agree on a system in which the regions are half-way between Germany's Laender and Switzerland's cantons. "The outlook is clear: Italy will have three or four `cantons,' achieved by means of a federal Constitution," the League's constitutional expert, Gianfranco Miglio said. He already has plans for how this will be achieved in parliament. "Now, with half the members plus one, we can look at Article 138 of the Constitution and modify the constitutional plan by means of referendums. In fact almost all the constitutions in history have been formed by winners against losers, without referendums. But we, being democrats, will achieve this result by means of referendums. We have all the major sectors of the media...." The powers enjoyed by these regions-cantons have yet to be defined, though there will certainly be radical changes to Article 117 of the Constitution, which grants a number of powers to the state, rather than the regions. Miglio will probably put forward again, with a few corrections, Article 7 of the federal Constitution launched at Assago three months ago. "The government is responsible for foreign policy, defense, the higher organization of justice, the currency, credit, overall economic planning, and balancing measures. All other matters are the responsibility of the republics and the autonomous regions." The MSI [Italian Social Movement] could demand, and secure, state responsibility for education, but there should be no problems regarding fiscal decentralization. Thus, as Forza Italia's program says, "the power to levy taxes must be taken away from central government and transferred completely to the local authorities, which must then pay to central government a fixed proportion of the tax revenue gathered." In other words, it is city councils (or regional governments) that will set tax rates and gather taxes and duties, forwarding part of the revenue to Rome. [passage omitted]
