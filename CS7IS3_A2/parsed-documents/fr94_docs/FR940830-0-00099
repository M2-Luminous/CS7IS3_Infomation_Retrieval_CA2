FR940830-0-00099 FR940830-0-00013 (4) Demonstration of long-term physical and social viability _(i) General. The plan shall include, on a development-by-development basis, an analysis of whether completion of the improvements and replacements identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section will reasonably ensure the long-term physical and social viability, including achieving structural/system soundness and full occupancy, of the development at a reasonable cost. For cost reasonableness, the PHA may choose to use the 90% of Total Development Cost (TDC) approach (the preliminary estimate of hard costs for work proposed at the development is 90% or less of TDC) or a cost reasonableness approach related to the cost of individual work items as indicated by National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions and the PHA's own recent procurement experience. The PHA shall keep documentation in its files to support its reasonable cost determinations of each major work item ( e.g. , kitchen cabinets, exterior doors). HUD will review cost reasonableness as part of its review of the Annual Submission and the Performance and Evaluation Report. Where necessary, HUD will review the PHA's documentation in support of its cost reasonableness; (ii) Determination of non-viability. Where a PHA's analysis of a development, under paragraph (d) of this section, establishes that completion of the identified improvements and replacements will not result in the long-term physical and social viability of the development at a reasonable cost, the PHA shall not expend CGP funds for the development, except for emergencies and essential non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated. The PHA shall specify in its Comprehensive Plan the actions it proposes to take with respect to the non-viable development ( e.g ., demolition or disposition under 24 CFR part 970). (5) Five-Year Action Plan _(i) General . The Comprehensive Plan shall include a rolling Five-Year Action Plan to carry out the improvements and replacements (or a portion thereof) identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. In developing its Five-Year Action Plan, the PHA shall assume that the current year funding or formula amount will be available for each year of its Five-Year Action Plan, whichever the PHA is using for planning purposes, plus the PHA's estimate of the funds that will be available from other sources, such as State and local governments. All activities specified in an PHA's Five-Year Action Plan are contingent upon the availability of funds; * * * * * (iii) Procedure for maintaining current Five-Year Action Plan. The PHA shall maintain a current Five-Year Action Plan by annually amending its Five-Year Action Plan, in conjunction with the Annual Submission; (6) *␣*␣* (i) The PHA developed the Comprehensive Plan/Five-Year Action Plan or amendments thereto in consultation with officials of the appropriate governing body and with development residents covered by the Comprehensive Plan/Five-Year Action Plan, in accordance with the requirements of §968.320(b)(1) and (2); (ii) The Comprehensive Plan/Five-Year Action Plan or amendments thereto are consistent with the appropriate governing body's assessment of its low-income housing needs (as evidenced by its Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy under 24 CFR part 91, if applicable), and that the appropriate governing body will cooperate in providing resident programs and services; and * * * * * (7) *␣*␣* (v) The proposed activities in the Five-Year Action Plan/Annual Statement are consistent with the proposed or approved Comprehensive Plan of the PHA; * * * * * (viii) The PHA has provided to HUD any documentation that the Department has requested to carry out its review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other related authorities in accordance with 24 CFR 968.110(c), (d) and (m), and will not obligate, in any manner, the expenditure of CGP funds, or otherwise undertake the activities identified in its Comprehensive Plan/Annual Statement, until the PHA receives written notification from HUD indicating that the Department has complied with its responsibilities under NEPA and other related authorities; * * * * * (xv) The PHA has complied with the requirements governing local government and resident participation in accordance with 24 CFR 968.320(b) and (c), 968.330(d), and 968.340, and has given full consideration to the priorities and concerns of local government and residents, including comments which were ultimately not adopted, in preparing the Comprehensive Plan/Five-Year Action Plan and any amendments thereto; * * * * * (xviii) The PHA will comply with section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, and make best efforts, consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, to give low- and very low-income persons, training and employment opportunities generated by CGP assistance, and to make best efforts, consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, to award contracts for work to be performed in connection with CGP assistance to business concerns that provide economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons. (e) *␣*␣* (2) Amendments to needs assessments . The PHA must amend its plan by revising its needs assessments whenever it proposes to carry out activities in its Five-Year Action Plan or Annual Statement that are not reflected in its current needs assessments (except in the case of emergencies). The PHA may propose an amendment to its needs assessments, in connection with the submission of its Annual Submission (see §968.330(b)), or at any other time. These amendments shall be reviewed by HUD in accordance with §968.325;
