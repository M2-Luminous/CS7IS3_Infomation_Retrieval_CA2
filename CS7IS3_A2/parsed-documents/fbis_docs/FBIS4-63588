That is how Ukraine's Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvegilskiy described the subject matter of the talks between the heads of governments of Russia and Ukraine, now in their second day. The second stage of the talks began earlier this morning. Yesterday Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his Ukrainian counterpart discussed the division of the Black Sea Fleet and its infrastructure, and the issue of separate bases for the national fleets. The talks began in a one-to-one format with the two delegations joining later. The talks are proceeding in a confidential atmosphere, but Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov told correspondents that the exchange of views is constructive and is being conducted "in a good working tone." The sides make no secret of the fact that the grounds for the current stage of the talks on the division of the Black Sea Fleet is the exacerbation of the political situation in Crimea. This follows the Crimean Parliament's decision to restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992 which, in the Kiev authorities' view, may pose a threat to political stability in the Ukraine and provoke tension in relations between Russian and Ukraine. In Valeriy Shmarov's words, no settlement of the political situation in Crimea was discussed at the talks yesterday. Crimea's Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov today joined the Ukrainian delegation at the talks.
