Within the country, all information was considered secret to varying degrees. Time has passed, and secret classifications have been removed; however, to this day we have been getting only disjointed information. I would like to remedy this situation to a degree and provide for your attention information on the general condition of the Kazakh oil and gas industry. The Kazakh Republic has recoverable oil reserves of 2.1 billion tonnes, condensate reserves of 0.7 billion tonnes, and gas reserves of 1.7 trillion cubic meters. Some 26 million tonnes of oil and condensate and 8.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas were produced in 1992. In 1993, production fell to 22 million tonnes of oil and condensate and 6.5 billion cubic meters of gas. Consumption stood at the level of 23 million tonnes of oil and 20 billion cubic meters of gas. For comparison: Nigeria, Venezuela, and Mexico have similar levels of reserves. However, Mexico produces approximately six times more than Kazakhstan, Venezuela--four times more, and Nigeria--three times more. The bulk of the proven reserves of oil and gas and hypothetical reserves are located in the western part of Kazakhstan: in Mangistau, Atyrau, West Kazakhstan, and Aktyubinsk Oblasts; small reserves exist in Kzyl-Orda Oblast. The reserves are distributed among 160 fields. However, only 58 fields are producing (10 of these fields hold about 80 percent of all reserves). The rest are not worked because they fall into the category of resource fields (in keeping with the Soviet system of reserve evaluation). It is possible that some of these fields may be reclassified as profitable, and their development may begin if they are reevaluated in keeping with the American system. Hypothetical reserves of oil are estimated to be 4,475 million tonnes on land and 3.5 billion tonnes on the shelf of the Caspian Sea; hypothetical reserves of gas--5.9 and 2.0 trillion cubic meters, respectively, and hypothetical reserves of condensate--1,635 million tonnes. These reserves have been calculated for five oil-and gas-bearing basins. In addition, there are nine sedimentation basins with oil and gas prospects in the territory of Kazakhstan. This is a very important factor because at present about 90 percent of all reserves are used for development, and it is necessary to vigorously conduct prospecting that at present is being gradually wound down for lack of funds. The fields are developed by two state holding companies with the resources of territorial production associations. Some fields, including the largest in Kazakhstan, Tengiz, have been transferred for development to joint ventures with foreign participation. Small fields that have not been developed previously have been transferred to the jurisdiction of local administrations. Kazakhstan has three oil refineries: in Atyrau (using oil from Kazakhstan), in Pavlodar (using oil from Russia), and in Shymkent (using oil from Russia and Kazakhstan), as well as two gas processing plants. However, the capacity of these plants and the assortment of products manufactured by them are by far not enough to meet the needs of the republic (their output meets only slightly more than 70 percent of the republic's needs). Take a look at the map of Kazakhstan. Oil production is concentrated in the western part of the republic whereas two of the main, relatively modern oil refineries are located in the eastern part. The pipeline that feeds these oil refineries comes from West Siberia along the Pavlodar-Shymkent line and then on to Central Asia. To be sure, a pipeline from the Kumkor field (Kzyl-Orda Oblast), which delivers about 1 million tonnes of oil to the Shymkent oil refinery is connected to the former pipeline. For a number of reasons, the Pavlodar Oil Refinery is idle most of the time at present, whereas the Shymkent Oil Refinery operates at hardly one-half of its capacity. Yet another oil refinery in Atyrau has a stable supply of raw materials. However, it has long since become worn-out and obsolete (the depth of refining comes to 56 percent and is at the levels of the 1950's), while it is capable of processing only about 5 million tonnes of raw material a year. No oil refinery in Kazakhstan produces industrial oils, although we do have fields with very valuable oil that is shipped away as far as Yaroslavl specifically to produce oils. Out of 22 million tonnes of oil produced last year, only 6 million tons were used within the republic. Where does the rest of the oil go? Some of the oil from Mangistau and Atyrau is used at the Atyrau Oil Refinery; about 5 million tonnes is exported to faraway foreign countries. Small amounts are delivered to CIS countries, including up to 2 million tonnes, which in better years were transported through the port of Aktau to Baku and Makhachkala; a large proportion goes to Russia. Therefore, the overall picture appears as follows: On the pattern created in the times of the USSR, the entire flow of oil and gas moved from east to west. Small hoses branched off this stream in order to meet the needs of republics. It was not important whether these republics had oil of their own--everything was subordinated to the overall pattern. With its own oil available, Kazakhstan was forced to use Siberian oil while pumping further west its own oil located closer to the western borders of the USSR. The Kazakh oil and gas complex has been fully integrated with that of Russia. This is why we cannot produce more oil at the fields even though we have an opportunity to do so. For this reason, Kazakhstan, which has large oil reserves and produces 22 million tonnes a year, and in previous years up to 27 million tonnes, cannot provide refinery products for itself. This fact is at the very least surprising. Now that the readers have a general idea of the oil and gas complex, I can offer something like a conclusion with which some might not agree. Kazakhstan has a very disadvantageous location, which is designated in the English language by the very felicitous and precise term "land-locked" [word published in English]; this can be translated as "locked by land." The significance of this for the oil and gas industries is tremendous because in this case access to hard-currency markets is much more complicated. The reason hampering the development of the oil and gas industries is found in the very structure of the oil and gas complex or, more precisely, the way in which it developed during Soviet times: It is comprehensive integration, which was quite logical and perhaps justified at one time. However, the further continuation of this structure and this situation makes it possible for third countries, including Russia and Turkey, to bring pressure to bear on Kazakhstan in order to achieve their objectives. The issue of economic independence remains open under such circumstances whereby other states have levers for the most powerful economic influence at their disposal.
