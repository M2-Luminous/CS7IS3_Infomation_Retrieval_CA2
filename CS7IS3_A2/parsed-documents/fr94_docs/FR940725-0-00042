L. 102&hyph;119, ``Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) Amendments of 1991.'' By statute, DoD must provide all substantive rights, protections and procedural safeguards, including due process procedures of IDEA, in the DoD Section 6 School Arrangements. This final rule provides guidance outlining the procedures for the provision of early intervention services for eligible children with disabilities ages birth to 2 (inclusive) and a free appropriate education and related services, for children with disabilities ages 3 to 21 (inclusive) enrolled in the DoD Section 6 School Arrangements. effective date: July 25, 1994. for further information contact: Dr. Hector O. Nevarez, Director, Section 6 Schools, on (703) 696&hyph;4373/4361. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On October 6, 1993, 58 FR 51996, the Office of the Secretary of Defense published an interim final rule (32 CFR part 80) that implemented the IDEA, as amended, in the Section 6 Schools and for eligible infants and toddlers. Today's final action, except for administrative amendments for clarity, does not differ from the interim final rule. This final rule reflects the change of the title of the Department of Defense organization formerly known as the Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review (DISCR). This organization is now named the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). Comments Two comments were received from the public on the interim final rule. 1. Comment: State reason for release of records and set a time limit-usually six months from the date of signature that the release is signed. Reply: The reason for release of records will be apparent in each case. Therefore, this recommendation has not been accepted. The final rule requires that the student activity for which the parental consent is being sought be specified. This necessarily involves stating the reason for parental consent. Because the final rule further provides that parental consent may be revoked at any time, a fixed time of expiration for that consent is unnecessary. 2. Comment: Why can't standardized test be used as part of the evaluation? Reply: The final rule does not preclude the use of standardized tests. Under ยง80.3(n), ``basic tests'' do not qualify as acceptable evaluative instruments. Standardized tests, however, are not included in the category of ``basic tests.'' Rulemaking Analyses Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' It has been determined that 32 CFR part 80 is not a significant regulation action. This final rule does not: (1) Have an annual effect of the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) Cause a serious inconsistency or other wise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Public Law 96&hyph;354, ``Regulatory Flexibility Act'' It has been determined that this final rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary financial effect of the final rule will be a reduction in administrative costs and other burdens resulting from the simplification and clarification of policies. Public Law 96&hyph;511, ``Paperwork Reduction Act'' It has been determined that 32 CFR part 80 does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520). This final rule is issued to provide guidance, required by statute, with respect to (1) the implementation of the IDEA, as amended, in the DoD Section 6 Schools and (2) the provision of early intervention services to infants and toddlers who, but for their age, would be entitled to enroll in such Section 6 Schools. Section 6 School Arrangements are conducted by DoD pursuant to section 6 of Pub. L. 81&hyph;874, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 241, and Section 505(c) of Pub. L. 97&hyph;31, 20 U.S.C. 241 note.
