Tausangi qualifies the Wednesday Sangheli-Topal meeting as "a useless union between Chisinau and Comrat authorities because the south population would anyway participate in the elections." PPG leader confessed that he appealed before to Lucinschi and Sangheli asking to organize a meeting of all-level deputies at which Topal's and Kendighelean's dismissal could he possible. "The deputies desire this for a long time but they were not able to act because of the dictatorship of Comrat authorities," said Tausangi. He said that "after Sangheli drank champagne with the criminals Topal and Burgudji," Comrat authorities, Chisinau governors' enemies, changed their hehaviour and began to call on the south population to vote for Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM]. There is no doubt about the victory of Agrarians and socialists in regions inhabited by Gagauzians, where officials and mass-media insistently promote the idea that only these formations will oppose the unification with Romania, states the article.
