It is represented that the proposed rate of interest for periods after the maturity date are the rates that would apply to the GIC for those periods according to the proposed plan of rehabilitation set forth by the Superior Court of New Jersey. Any proceeds paid from the GIC and received by the Plan on or before the Loan date will be subtracted from the book value. 5. Repayment of the Loan under the Agreement is limited to payments made to the Plan by or on behalf of MBL or its successor. No other Plan assets will be available for repayment of the Loan. If the payments by or on behalf of MBL are not sufficient to fully repay the Loan, the Agreement provides that the Employer will have no recourse against the Plan, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount. 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1) The Loan will enable the Plan to recover the total accumulated book value of the GIC as of the date of maturity, plus interest thereafter; (2) The Plan will pay no interest nor incur any expenses with respect to the Loan; (3) Repayment of the Loan will be restricted to payments made by or on behalf of MBL and no other Plan assets will be involved; and (4) Repayment of the Loan will be waived to the extent the Plan recoups less from the payments by or on behalf of MBL than the total amount of the Loan.
