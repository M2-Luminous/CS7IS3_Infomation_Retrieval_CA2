Leszek Miller rejected the union's accusations, pointing out a number of negotiations that have been conducted with the unions since the moment this government was formed. [Begin Miller recording] From the moment the government was formed, talks have been taking place in various ministries on the restructuring of plants in Mielec, Lodz, and Walbrzych. Talks have been taking place on the restructuring of Polish State Railways. In January, talks began with the mining trade union federations, in the form of both a review and negotiations. As a result of those talks, an agreement on social protection in the mining industry was signed last week. Finally, on 18 January, the Council of Ministers made a decision on beginning talks on social guarantees for citizens. These talks are still taking place, and significant progress has already been achieved. In conclusion, let me also mention a fact that is of great importance also from the point of view of the political system: On 15 February, the Council of Ministers made a decision on the setting up of a tripartite commission for socioeconomic affairs. This is an event that is significant for the political system because a platform for negotiating and resolving disputes has now been built into the sociopolitical landscape of our country. What is more, this will happen with the future in mind, because this is a tripartite setup, characteristic of West European systems, where employers, trade unions, and the government have an opportunity to hold serious talks and search for ways to ensure social peace. When it comes to the other two demands that have been surfacing--the demand for the budget to be amended--the government cannot negotiate this demand because the parliament recently approved the budget. If the government wanted to influence the Sejm now, in order to make it work out radical changes in the budget, the government would not only fail to be acting in a serious way, but would also breach the democratic principles of a law-abiding state. The second demand concerns the Enterprise Pact. The government cannot influence the pace at which the pact regulations are approved by the parliament. The government has already submitted five bills. One of them has been passed and is in force. The second bill on the enterprise social fund is awaiting the president's signature. The remaining ones are currently being examined by the extraordinary commission working on the Enterprise Pact. [end recording] Eugeniusz Morawski, deputy minister of industry and trade, and Aleksander Janiszewski, director general of Polish State Railways, who took part in the meeting with journalists, both agreed that strategic areas of economy such as the power and mining industries, as well as the railways, were not a scene of social conflict but an instrument of political struggle.
