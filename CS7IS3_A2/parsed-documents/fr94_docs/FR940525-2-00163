FR940525-2-00163 FR940525-2-00086 Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Ford Motor Company, Common Stock, $1 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;3950 May 19, 1994. Ford Motor Company (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Company, in order to reduce expenses and simplify its stock exchange processes, the Company has decided to withdraw those listings that are costly to maintain and have very low trading volumes. These include the Company's listings on the BSE, CHX, and Phlx. According to the Company, it will continue listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and, given the very low volume on the regional exchanges, it is not believed there will be any adverse impact on the market or Company stockholders by the proposed withdrawals. Any interested person may, on or before June 10, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
