Zdenko Vranjes reporting. [Vranjes] In a letter to Silajdzic, Kresimir Zubak says among other things, that the Bosnian Muslim side has not yet supplied information on the fate of 26 Croats taken from Bugojno, as was set out in the agreement on the exchange of all remaining prisoners. The Croatian side has fulfilled all its obligations from the agreement. Zubak also notes that Bosnian representatives from Bugojno did not come to a meeting yesterday, either. The Croatian side was thus let down for the third time since the beginning of the process of exchanging all remaining prisoners, the letter stresses. Zubak also asks Silajdzic to exert his personal influence to solve this problem that burdens Croat-Bosnian relations. Zubak also informs Silajdzic in his letter that, in line with an agreement, the Croatian side has appointed its members into a joint expert group which is to deal with the delineation of cantons. At a session held today, the government of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna demanded the Bosnian side fulfill its obligations from the economic sphere, as agreed between representatives of the Herzeg-Bosna government and the government in Sarajevo. The need to elect as soon as possible the leaders of the federation was also stressed. This would finally create one of the basic conditions for the functioning of the constitution [of the federation]. [passage omitted]
