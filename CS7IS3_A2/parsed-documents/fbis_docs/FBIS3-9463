Does this contradict UN policy? [Erdos] Not at all, on the contrary: The political settlement requires a dialogue with all sides, irrespective of how the international community judges any of the sides morally or politically. Generally, I find it extremely important to have a rational and consistent Hungarian policy toward our neighbors, and I find a courageous initiative quite correct. However, let me add that relations with the Serbs seems to be a separate issue, because things occurred along our southern border and this makes our system of relations there different from our relations with Romania, Slovakia, or any other neighbors. This does not at all contradict the fact, in terms of Hungarian policy regarding the Yugoslav crisis, that it was clear from the very beginning that this policy is not against an ethnic group, against the Serbian people, but against a certain Serbian policy and the means used to implement this policy, means repeatedly condemned by the UN Security Council such as the forced acquisition of territories, ethnic cleansing, barbaric violations of human rights, and the destruction of historical and cultural values. I think that both international and specific Hungarian viewpoints are equally important in our Yugoslav policy and, in the current political context, it would not be desirable to form some sort of priority. In other words, we must equally consider the future good-neighborly relations with Serbia and the viewpoints of the ethnic Hungarians living in Vojvodina as well as the principles and behavior norms declared at the London conference on the former Yugoslavia and stipulated by the obligatory Security Council decisions. We know from our own experience that keeping our international obligations is directly proportional with the prestige of Hungary's foreign policy and the credibility of our positions.
