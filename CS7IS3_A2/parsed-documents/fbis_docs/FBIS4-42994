He is convinced that the alliance will be enlarged by that time, even though not all countries may be accepted at the same time, Ruehe stated today on the occasion of the renaming of the General Schwarzkopf Barracks in Hamburg as Lieutenant General Count von Baudissin Barracks. Ruehe unveiled the new nameplate in front of the new Bundeswehr staff college, which is named after the father of the "inner leadership" of the Bundeswehr and peace researcher Wolf Count von Baudissin. Baudissin died in Hamburg a year ago. Russia, however, will be integrated neither in the European Union nor in NATO, but must be included in a partnership that corresponds to its size, responsibility, and significance, Ruehe pointed out. The integration of the neighboring countries in the East must be accompanied by intensified cooperation and a dialogue with Russia on nuclear security and the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. "However, it is clear that Russia will not have a right of veto concerning the enlargement of the alliance. It is also clear that there is no hierarchy among the European institutions." Otherwise, the foundations of security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic region would fall apart. Hamburg Mayor Hennig Voscherau (Social Democratic Party of Germany) stressed that the new tasks of the Bundeswehr and the acceptance of more responsibility must take place on the basis of a political consensus in Germany. "The current insecurity has a negative impact on the motivation of the soldiers and officers." According to Ruehe, the peacetime strength of the Bundeswehr should include 340,000 soldiers on a long-term basis.
