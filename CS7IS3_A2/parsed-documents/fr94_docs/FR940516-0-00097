FR940516-0-00097 FR940516-0-00031 50 CFR Part 678 [Docket No. 920409&hyph;3047; I.D. 050694H] Atlantic Shark Fisheries AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the commercial fishery for large coastal sharks conducted by vessels with a Federal Atlantic Shark permit in the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the semiannual quota for the period January 1 through June 30, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: The closure is effective from 0001 hours local time May 17, 1994, through June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: C. Michael Bailey, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347; Kevin B. Foster, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9260; or Michael Justen 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Atlantic shark fishery is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Atlantic Sharks prepared by the Secretary of Commerce under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR part 678. Section 678.23(b)(1)(i) of the regulations provides for two semiannual quotas of large coastal sharks to be harvested from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico waters by commercial fishermen. The first semiannual quota is available for harvest from January 1 through June 30, 1994. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), is required under §678.24 to monitor the catch and landing statistics and, on the basis of these statistics, to determine when the catch of Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico sharks will equal any quota under §678.23(b)(1). When shark harvests reach, or are projected to reach, a quota established under §678.23(b)(1), the AA is further required under §678.24 to close the fishery. The AA has determined, based on the reported catch and other relevant factors, that the semiannual quota for the period January 1 through June 30, 1994, for large coastal sharks, in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, will be attained by May 17, 1994. During this closure, for vessels issued a permit under §678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the management unit is prohibited, unless the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, in which case the vessel limit per trip is four large coastal sharks. However, the sale, purchase, trade, or barter or attempted sale, purchase, trade, or barter of carcasses and/or fins of large coastal sharks harvested by a person aboard a vessel that has been issued a permit under §678.4(a)(4), is prohibited, except for those that were harvested, off-loaded, and sold, traded, or bartered prior to May 17, 1994, and were held in storage by a dealer or processor. Vessels that have been issued a Federal permit under §678.4 are reminded that as a condition of permit issuance, the vessel may not retain a large coastal shark during the closure, except as provided by §678.24(a)(2). Fishing for pelagic and small coastal sharks may continue. The recreational fishery is not affected by this closure. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR part 678 and is exempt from Office of Management and Budget review under E.O. 12866. Dated: May 10, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director of Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11748 Filed 5&hyph;10&hyph;94; 3:54 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
