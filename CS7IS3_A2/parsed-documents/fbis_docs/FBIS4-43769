During a meeting with President Thomas Klestil in Vienna's Hofburg Palace, he said that by clearly saying yes to a larger Europe Austria "has regained that central position which the country had assumed for centuries." The Arab and the Islamic world is pleased about the result of the Austrian EU referendum also because it knows that it now has one more close and trustworthy friend in the EU. President Thomas Klestil, who a few hours before had received the OPEC ministers who are meeting in Vienna, expressed his conviction that Austria's opinion and advice in the EU will be in particularly high demand in the future when the cooperation of the EU with East Europe, but also with the Middle East, will be the issue. Since the time of [former Austrian Chancellor] Bruno Kreisky, Austria's special closeness with the Arab world has been known and appreciated. In the meeting with the Arab League secretary general President Klestil discussed, among other things, current developments in Bosnia, the Middle East peace process, and political and social development in Africa. 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid, who is in Vienna to visit the UN organizations, was accompanied by Arab League Deputy Secretary General Ahmed Adel and Arab League representative in Austria Samir Hezzah [preceding two Arab names spelling as published].
