An oilfield official said that Karamay, in the northwestern part of the Jungar basin, pumped 7.6 million tons of oil in 1993 and it has been rated as China's fourth-largest oil producer for four successive years. Reform and opening up have made it possible for the oilfield to put an end to its stagnant production in the 1970s, he said. Since 1979 Karamay has imported oil drilling and pumping equipment, computers, instruments, meters and ethylene-production technology from Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, the official said. Since 1980 it has co-operated with the General Geophysical Company of France, which has sent three seismic teams to make geophysical surveys in the Jungar basin. Under a contract, technicians from a U.S. company have provided technical services to the oilfield, the official said. To date, Karamay has used 800 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds to import technology and equipment, he said. These funds include loans from the World Bank and a Japanese bank.
