This statement certifies that a borrower has been informed of the collection options the Federal government may use to collect delinquent debt. The Federal government is authorized by law to take any or all of the following actions in the event that a borrower's loan payments become delinquent or the borrower defaults on its loans: (A) Report the borrower's delinquent account to a credit bureau; (B) Assess additional interest and penalty charges for the period of time that payment is not made; (C) Assess charges to cover additional administrative costs incurred by the Government to service the borrower's account; (D) Offset amounts owed directly or indirectly to the borrower under other Federal programs; (E) Refer the borrower's debt to the Internal Revenue Service for offset against any amount owed to the borrower as an income tax refund; (F) Refer the borrower's account to a private collection agency to collect the amount due; and (G) Refer the borrower's account to the Department of Justice for collection. (14) Articles of incorporation and bylaws. The following are required if either document has been amended since the last loan application was submitted to REA, or if this is a borrower's first application for a loan under the RE Act: (i) The borrower's articles of incorporation currently in effect, as filed with the appropriate state office, setting forth the borrower's corporate purpose; and (ii) The bylaws currently in effect, as adopted by the borrower's board of directors, setting forth the manner by which the borrower's organization will be governed and regulated. (15) State regulatory approvals. In states in which regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over the borrower's rates, the borrower must provide satisfactory evidence, pursuant to §§1710.105 and 1710.151(f), based on the information available, such as an opinion of counsel or of another qualified source, that the state regulatory authority will not exclude from the borrower's rate base any of the facilities included in the loan request, or otherwise prevent the borrower from charging rates sufficient to repay with interest the debt incurred for the facilities.
