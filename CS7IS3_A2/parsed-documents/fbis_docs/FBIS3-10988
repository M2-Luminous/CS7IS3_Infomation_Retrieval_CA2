The meeting was held following the conclusion of an OAS visit that lasted several days to the areas in conflict. Leo Valle Lanza, president of the international commission, indicated they had received reports from the CPR settlers on harassment by Army soldiers, mined camps, and restrictions placed on their movements. "It is obvious that as a result of the proximity of the combat areas, there could be guerrilla movements, but this does not necessarily imply the CPR are cooperating with the subversives," Valle Lanza added. "The only thing they want is to be recognized as a civilian population and for their most basic rights to be respected," noted the international official who also indicated President de Leon Carpio had confirmed his intentions to respect those rights. This is why the OAS delegates consider the demobilization of the military detachments near the CPR a top priority. Nevertheless, they received Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez' assurance that no military operation are being carried out in those areas. The international commission was made up of Valle Lanza, David Padilla, Elizabeth Houppert, and Osvaldo N. Kreiner. The commission was accompanied by Fernando Alvarez Guadamuz who indicated they had visited Xalbal, Cantabal, Cuarto Pueblo, San Francisco Los Angeles, San Luis, and La Esperanza; they also spoke to the soldiers of the nearby detachments.
