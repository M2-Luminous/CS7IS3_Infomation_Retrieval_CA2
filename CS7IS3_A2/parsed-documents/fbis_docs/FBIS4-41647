Chernobyl, June 1994..."] [Text] Kiev-Chernobyl -- Arriving in Kiev, we bought the newspapers and read: "Yet another accident at Chernobyl AES's [nuclear electric power station] second power unit." Naturally, we headed for the station. It is silent in the 30-km exclusion zone. Not a single vehicle passes us. On each side of the track are what look like low tumuli overgrown with grass (these are homes or scaffolding dug into the ground). We drive past the silent fifth (now almost ready for action) and sixth units and roll up to the square that is so familiar from photographs and cinema and television stills, where the Ilyich [Lenin] whose name the station bears stands as if on sentry duty. In the control center little green letters on a dark screen carry an advertisement for the seances of some healer who works miracles and can even cure "the evil eye." Probably people go there believing and hoping, but thinking that the station itself needs to be cured of "the evil eye." We go to see the director, where it turns out that we have been beaten to the mark by television journalists from the popular Ukrainian independent television company "Tete-a-Tete." They are on a special assignment: to dispel fears. And here in the main controller's room shift chief Sergey Sharshun is already smiling broadly into the microphone: "Dear citizens of Kiev, nothing serious has happened at our plant. If anyone thinks that he has a tickle in his throat, let him drink a little mineral water -- the background round here is absolutely normal...." He is calm -- sincerely calm -- yet in Kiev there is once again the sort of agitation which cannot be measured in numbers. Everyone is asking: What has happened there this time, and once again at the ill-starred second unit; there has already been a hydrogen explosion there, damaging the turbine and bringing down the roof. What now? "No, it is not an accident this time, not an accident," Sharshun assures us, as he has just assured television viewers. "It is a mundane unscheduled situation. A crack had formed in the metal of a vessel containing contaminated water. But it was emptied, as laid down in the safety procedure, into an empty container nearby...." Whereupon they remind you that the same sort of thing has happened at other stations -- at the Leningrad Station, for instance -- and no one has been bothered except the specialists; but here of course, there is the "nark of Chernobyl." There is a watershed of consciousness here: Outside the station there are global fears on account of the Chernobyl catastrophe, its consequences, and most of all -- God forbid -- the possibility of a repetition; while inside the station itself everything is normal, a repetition is impossible, the first unit could operate until the year 2007, the others -- longer still, and they should be allowed to do so. You can understand the Chernobyl people. They live under constant pressure: The station could be closed down at any minute. Three times the Ukrainian parliament has adopted -- and revoked -- such a decision. The government is the same: Now it promises that the station will continue to operate, now it signs a statement on the time scale for closure. True, Kravchuk has been here, promising his support; moreover, a directive has been issued to start up the second unit by the end of next year. Everything is as it should be, but every straw in the wind, even the lightest, the Chernobyl people themselves say, inclines the answer to the question "To be or not to be?" toward "not to be." Especially since the world community is still on its guard, and since at the beginning of July the G-7 heads of state are meeting in Naples especially to examine the question of shutting down the Chernobyl station. There is a direct conflict of interests between the 25,000 inhabitants of the new city of Slavutich, which was built for the AES employees, and the ideas of the U.S. and French presidents, the British and Japanese prime ministers, and the German chancellor.... The Chernobyl personnel are confident, and they would reassure the G-7 leaders, if they could get to Naples. And it is clear why. They came here from all over the Union, they earn good money -- from 3 million to 87 million karbovantsy, which in local prices is actually quite a lot -- and most of all they live with amenities which they could not even have dreamed about before, some in excellent apartments, many in individual homes built on the BAM [Baykal-Amur Railroad] principle: There is a Yerevan quarter, a Vilnius quarter, a Tallinn quarter, a Moscow quarter.... Must they lose all this at a stoke? At the station we met several veterans who worked here before the catastrophe, and continue to do so (they are actually called "predisasterites"]. They are strong, healthy people. But then we discovered that such people only constitute 10 percent of the present work force. Where are the rest? Where have they gone, what shape did their destinies take? We were told absolutely nothing of consequence on this score. You can also understand Sergey Parashin, the station's current director, who took up the post only two months ago. He has one constant concern: to preserve the station and to keep the collective from a social and psychological explosion. So he talks about speculation on the consequences of the disaster ("the more brazen ones milk the situation for all it is worth"). It is possible that this does happen, but in our tour of the Crimea and Truskavets sanatoria we had seen sick children with "Chernobyl-related" illnesses. Here, both at the station and in Slavutich -- we sensed this -- they somehow abstract themselves from the tragedy. They live, as is seemingly natural, concerned with their immediate cares -- their work and daily bread. And they see many things in "their own" light. Take the aforementioned G-7. Are they worried about safety? No way! They want to close Chernobyl first, in order to close down the Russian stations with similar reactors afterward. Why? To acquire a new sales market, since the major corporations which produce equipment for AESes are going bust. So they are pushing their interests through the nuclear lobby in various international organizations.... It is not for us to judge how serious such hypotheses are, but that they exist is a fact. All the same, you get a sense of some confusion from the Chernobyl people's calm and assurance. But are they really working with faultlessly safe equipment? Is there really absolute radiation safety in and around the station itself? As many people know, today the Chernobyl AES's most vulnerable spot, its Achilles heel is the "sarcophagus" under which the fourth power unit was buried. The press and the television from time to time report that the "sarcophagus" is not hermetically sealed and that radioactive substances are being discharged through it into the atmosphere -- and in considerable quantities. "Is this true or not?" we ask Boris Goncharov, the station's deputy head engineer. "Right now," he explains, "we are indeed closing chinks in the `sarcophagus' which have formed where the reinforced concrete structures join. But total hermetic sealing is not only unnecessary but actually dangerous. There must be a constant interchange of air within the covering. As for discharges from the `sarcophagus,' they are within the permitted norm." That is a specialist's viewpoint. How are we nonspecialists to judge it? If everything is within the norm, that means everything is in order. But it turns out that there are other specialists with a different view. Back in Kiev, we phoned the Ukrainian State Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety and spoke to Deputy Chairman Anatoliy Demyanenko. His opinion is that the Chernobyl AES must be shut down, and as quickly as possible, since according to many parameters it fails to meet world safety requirements. And all is not well in the "sarcophagus," he believes: There should be no leakages from it, and the interchange of air should be carried out not "anyhow," but through special ventilation pipes. But most important of all, inside the reactor of the destroyed unit, buried under the "sarcophagus," the upper plate has shifted to an angle of 45 angles. What if it falls? What will happen, what will be the possible discharge, and where and how far will the wind carry the death cloud? Another "stress factor" for station employees and Slavutich inhabitants is the ambiguity of assessments, expert analyses, and conclusions. But it is not just their own drama, as it were "genetically" fixed in the Chernobyl tragedy. Deceit, falsification, and vagueness continue to characterize the situation, and all the while the question hangs over station: To be or not to be? As we were leaving we saw the sun set over Slavutich -- it was breathtaking. There are giant catfish in the rivers, although not for eating, you understand....
