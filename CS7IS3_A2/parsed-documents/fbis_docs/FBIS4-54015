What is your opinion? [Yamagishi] The LDP is asserting that the Hata cabinet deserves to be voted out of power merely because it is a minority government, but I believe that the LDP's assertion lacks persuasive force. The opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has to alter its simple logic that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some SDPJ members are voicing their support for holding the next general election under the current multiseat constituency system. What do you think? [Yamagishi] If the next general elections are held under the multiseat constituency system, the SDPJ would win some more seats in the House of Representatives, but the LDP also would increase its seats there. The next general election could be held under the multiseat constituency system depending on how the political situation develops in the future. I, however, believe that it is desirable to hold the next general election under a new electoral system. The SDPJ is now at a loss. If the SDPJ intends to rally liberal forces, it cannot forge any alliance with the LDP. If the SDPJ does not take the position of not allowing the LDP to retake power, it would leave ruling coalition parties in disarray. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of the SDPJ returning to the ruling coalition? [Yamagishi] I believe that it would be difficult for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition unless a major development occurs which makes the people understand its return to the ruling coalition. I hope that such a "major development" will occur to open the way for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. The SDPJ's intention of rallying the liberal forces does not contradict its return to the ruling coalition. If the SDPJ does everything it can to rally the liberal forces, this would cause the "major development" to occur. There is no change in the widely held impression that the coalition government is shored up by new conservative forces and liberal forces. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you mean by the major development? May I interpret the major development as the resignation of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] representative Ichiro Ozawa? [Yamagishi] If I comment publicly on that, it would cause confusion and make it hard for the major development to occur. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata government is shaky because it is a minority government. Do you think that the Hata government can trigger the major development? [Yamagishi] Given the values and integrity of Prime Minister Hata, I cannot rule out that possibility. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of Mr. Ozawa? [Yamagishi] I do not know him well, but he is currently making a lot of belligerent comments. He imposes his ideas on others when he holds a dialogue with them. He is causing human relationships to worsen. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of the SDPJ returning to the coalition government? [Yamagishi] The possibility still exists. If the SDPJ clings to its own policies, it is doubtful whether it can reach an agreement on basic policies with Sakigake [Harbinger]. The SDPJ would be isolated from the rest of the political parties in the end. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will it not difficult for the SDPJ to rally the liberal forces prior to the general election? [Yamagishi] If the SDPJ fails to rally the liberal forces prior to the general election, it will face self-destruction. If only the SDPJ and Sakigake wage a concerted campaign under the single-seat constituency system, they will be no match for other political parties. A majority of the liberal forces are now in the ruling coalition parties, and they are affiliated with the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], the Japan New Party, Shinseito, and a splinter group from the LDP. Now is the best time for the SDPJ to open the way for concluding a policy agreement with those liberal forces, forging an alliance with new conservative forces in Shinseito and Komeito, and choosing a single candidate to run in the next general election. Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi and Sakigake representative Masayoshi Takemura can take the lead in rallying the liberal forces. I think that it is desirable to form a liberal coalition policy study group which transcends party affiliations. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is whispered that DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi will resign as chairman at a party convention scheduled for June. [Yamagishi] Any decisions to be made at the party convention will have a great impact on the future of the former ruling coalition parties, including the SDPJ. I will pay close attention to the party convention. I hope that the DSP will play a key role in urging the SDPJ to return to the coalition government. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When are you going to give your approval to raising indirect taxes with "some conditions attached?" [Yamagishi] In principle, I do not favor raising any taxes, but I intend to urge the Policy Consultative Council formed by the SDPJ and the DSP to speedily work out a joint proposal, thereby deepening their mutual understanding, and to ask the two parties to present the joint proposal to other parties.
