FR940630-1-00046 FR940630-1-00011 (1) Allow checking for proper shutoff operation before each fueling of the tank; and (2) For commuter category airplanes, indicate at each fueling station, a failure of the shutoff means to stop the fuel flow at the maximum quantity approved for that tank. * * * * * 18. Section 23.1001 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(2) to read as follows: * * * * * §23.1001 Fuel jettisoning system. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) A climb at the speed at which the one engine inoperative enroute climb data have been established in accordance with §23.69(b), with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines at maximum continuous power; and * * * * * §23.1013 [Amended] 19. Section 23.1013 is amended by removing the word ``crankcase'' in paragraph (d)(1). §23.1041 [Amended] 20. Section 23.1041 is amended by adding the phrase ``and maximum ambient atmospheric temperature conditions'' between the words ``maximum altitude'' and ``for which approval''. 21. Section 23.1043 (a), (c), and (d) are revised to read as follows: §23.1043 Cooling tests. (a) General . Compliance with §23.1041 must be shown on the basis of tests, for which the following apply: (1) If the tests are conducted under ambient atmospheric temperature conditions deviating from the maximum for which approval is requested, the recorded powerplant temperatures must be corrected under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, unless a more rational correction method is applicable. (2) No corrected temperature determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may exceed established limits. (3) The fuel used during the cooling tests must be of the minimum grade approved for the engine and, for a reciprocating engine, the mixture settings must be the leanest recommended for climb. (4) For turbocharged engines, such turbocharger must be operated through that part of the climb profile for which operation with the turbocharger is requested. (b) *␣*␣* (c) Correction factor (except cylinder barrels) . Temperatures of engine fluids and powerplant components (except cylinder barrels) for which temperature limits are established, must be corrected by adding to them the difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature for the relevant altitude for which approval has been requested and the temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of the maximum fluid or component temperature recorded during the cooling test. (d) Correction factor for cylinder barrel temperatures . Cylinder barrel temperatures must be corrected by adding to them 0.7 times the difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature for the relevant altitude for which approval has been requested and the temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of the maximum cylinder barrel temperature recorded during the cooling test. 22. Section 23.1045(a) is revised to read as follows: §23.1045 Cooling test procedures for turbine engine powered airplanes. (a) Compliance with §23.1041 must be shown for all phases of operation. The airplane must be flown in the configurations, at the speeds, and following the procedures recommended in the Airplane Flight Manual for the relevant stage of flight, and that correspond to the applicable performance requirements that are critical to cooling. * * * * * 23. Section 23.1047 is revised to read as follows: §23.1047 Cooling test procedures for reciprocating engine powered airplanes. Compliance with §23.1041 must be shown for the climb (or, for multiengine airplanes with negative one-engine-inoperative rates of climb, the descent) stage of flight. The airplane must be flown in the configurations, at the speeds and following the procedures recommended in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), and that correspond to the applicable performance requirements that are critical to cooling. 24. Section 23.1091 is amended by revising paragraph (c)(2) to read as follows: §23.1091 Air induction system. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (2) The airplane must be designed to prevent water or slush on the runway, taxiway, or other airport operating surfaces from being directed into the engine or auxiliary power unit air intake ducts in hazardous quantities. The air intake ducts must be located or protected so as to minimize the ingestion of foreign matter during takeoff, landing, and taxiing.
