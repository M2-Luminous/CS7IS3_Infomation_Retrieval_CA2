This is a despicable anti-DPRK smear campaign, which grossly distorts the might of the socialist economy of the DPRK making a long drive, unaffected by the international economic fluctuation, and the reality of Korean society where all people live a worthwhile and happy life. As far as the development of the Najin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade Zone is concerned, it is a project promoted under the external economic policy of the DPRK. The DPRK Government has consistently maintained the line of building an independent national economy by enlisting internal potential and resources to the maximum under the banner of self-reliance, while establishing economic relations with other countries and developing foreign trade on the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit. The project is promoted also in close relation with the Tumen River Area international cooperation and development sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme. This shows an aspect of the external economic development of the DPRK. The Japanese reactionaries, however, describe it as "an open-door policy to overcome economic difficulty." This is a vicious slander against the DPRK. Their anti-DPRK smear campaign is a graphic expression of their perplexity in face of the invincible vitality of the socialist system of the DPRK that satisfies the needs of the people for food, clothing and housing. The Japanese reactionaries must drop the false propaganda against the DPRK, mindful that if they continuously resort to the anti-DPRK smear campaign, they will get nothing good.
