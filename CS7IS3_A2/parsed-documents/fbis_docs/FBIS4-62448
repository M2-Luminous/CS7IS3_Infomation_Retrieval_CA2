A total of 22 people's deputies, representing various political forces, suggested that a resolution should be considered with regard to recognizing the powers of People's Deputies Volodymyr Hrynyov and Pavlo Kudyukin. The draft resolution made provision for "additionally verifying the presence of grounds for the elections in their constituencies to be deemed invalid, and only then passing a decision on the interim credentials commission's submission." This resolution was voted down by a majority, with as few as 100 of the 338 deputies present having voted for it. Representatives of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR] proposed that a special deputies' commission should be formed to deal with this issue. That proposal, however, was rejected, too. The sitting also examined the draft resolution "On deputies groups (factions) in the Supreme Council of Ukraine." Most criticized were the articles on the numerical strength of groups, the provision of them with technical means [to organize] their work, the institution of groups (factions) on a regional or territorial basis, and the possibility for a deputy to work in several groups (factions). This resolution is to be adopted today after the proposals are generalized. It has already been reported that MBR cochairmen Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov are to hold a news conference at 1400 today. The venue is the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, 36 Khreshchatyk, Kiev.
