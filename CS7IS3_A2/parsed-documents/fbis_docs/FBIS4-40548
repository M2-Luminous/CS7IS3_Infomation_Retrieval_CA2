He said it was not Pyongyang's decision to withdraw from the IAEA and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that called for sanctions. Sanctions were not introduced against a country for this kind of decision, Panov said, because any country had the right to join a treaty or withdraw from it. Panov went on to say that the international community was discontent with Pyongyang's failure to show good will and cooperate with the IAEA. As a result, the IAEA had failed to get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program and had moved to raise the issue of sanctions. Panov said that both Russia and its partners were interested in a negotiated solution of the problem. The Russian call for an international conference was gaining support, he said.
