The team of doctors, who visited Hebron shortly after last month's massacre, told the Egyptian daily AL-AHRAM ``three types of bullets and splinters were extracted'' from the bodies of the wounded. ``That proves the massacre was not carried out by one person,'' they told the paper. The Israeli army has insisted Goldstein acted alone when he opened fire on February 25 in the mosque killing 30 Arab worshippers. Israeli ballistics experts have said that all those wounded and killed were hit by bullets from a Galil short-barrelled gun. But witnesses at the official inquiry into the massacre have testified that they saw another armed settler with Goldstein, and that two soldiers also fired at people and not just in the air as the army has maintained. One 12-year-old boy told the inquiry that copper splinters were taken from his back, lending weight to claims that a grenade was used. A separate PLO inquiry recently concluded that at least two soldiers had shot at Moslems at prayer in the West Bank mosque. The official Israeli inquiry is still hearing evidence.
