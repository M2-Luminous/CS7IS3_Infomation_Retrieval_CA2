Army Gen. Raul Castro Ruz, second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC], together Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, member of the Politburo, visited a large Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary Air Force [DAAFAR] unit of the Eastern Army. The minister [Raul Castro] and his first vice minister and chief of the General Staff [Ulises Rosales] were accompanied by Division Gen. Ramon Espinoza Martin, chief of the Eastern Army; Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first secretary of the PCC in Holguin; as well as other Central Committee members, generals, and high-level officers. The unit chief, Colonel Carlos (Negrin) Rodriguez, briefed the minister about the results attained during the past year, and the prospects for this year, stressing the seven main tasks of the Western Army. He verified the progress achieved in the training of personnel, maintenance of armaments and of the theater of military operations, morale and discipline, and the fighting capacity of the troops. The work carried out in livestock production can be clearly seen in the 30-percent higher growth than last year. An example of the creativity in this area is the production of milk: larger cattle farms in larger units; minicattle farms in smaller units; and goat milk production in the more distant, smallest units. The agricultural and livestock plan for 1994 seeks steps beyond those of the previous year, making the troops almost self-sufficient, to the point of providing a modest food provision to the families of the officers' corps. Brigadier Gen. Ruben Martinez Puentes, DAAFAR chief, and Col. Negrin Rodriguez gave a tour of the combat operations center to the FAR minister and his retinue. Raul here greeted the soldiers and the many female personnel who work at the National Airspace Defense screens. At the flight ramp, the FAR minister was shown various types of equipment for air safety built by the rationalizers [racionalizadores] and innovators who replace the numerous forms of equipment that used to be imported, but which today would demand a considerable amount of currency. Raul also held a lively conversation with Comrade (Raciel Bovines), a civilian worker who has been in the unit for 18 years, a National Vanguard member for the past three years, and whose contributions are decisive solutions for the Air Force operation. At the technical research unit, master engineer, (Raul Trinchet), graduate of the Technical Military Institute, showed the Army general other achievements in fighter plane repair, and the creation of basic materials for study. Proof of the quality of work is the fact that no aircraft from this unit has experienced an accident due to technical failure over the past three years. During the chat with Raul, Master Engineer (Trinchet) said that his efforts are inspired by the metaphorical words of the minister when he said that inventions during the special period could reach the point of flying an aircraft by a gasoline-operated generator. [Begin recording] [Raul] [passage indistinct] ... from generals to the last soldier, to civilian workers, technicians, and engineers, you are a good example. So, allow me to congratulate you on behalf of the commander in chief, on behalf of my fellow comrades who are accompanying me, and for myself, wishing you greater success because now, as I told (Trinchet) a few minutes ago, that our technicians, engineers, experts, having reached an accomplished level, life is forcing us to develop even further. We must admire this, especially since you are responsible for such a fate. [sentence indistinct] But that is not the essential point. The essential thing is that with what we have, we are capable of solving problems such as those you have solved. Is that correct, Comander? [Unidentified colonel] Yes, General. [Raul] Then, I ask my comrades who are accompanying me, that as a humble homage to you, and through you to everyone throughout the country, to recognize that our air force, our DAAFAR, and our Armed Forces have achieved and have greatly contributed to maintaining the fighting capacity of our FAR, and in an increasingly less expensive manner, as we said recently. We are going to have, or are continuing to have the most powerful Armed Forces in Latin America, and besides, the least costly Armed Forces. And you here play an essential role, repairing an engine, or carrying out some of those activities that Engineer (Trinchet) just explained. (Negrin), we are talking here about millions of dollars. [passage indistinct] I ask for applause for these officers, our comrades. [applause] [end recording]
