The incident occurred in Hamlet 8, Troeuy Sla village, S'ang District of Kandal Province on 9 April. This act has caused strong indignation within the Vietnamese Government and population. It is not the first massacre. The Khmer Rouge have never given up their intention to kill Vietnamese nationals who are now living in Cambodia. Hundreds of Vietnamese nationals, especially fishermen in Battambang and Siem Reap Provinces have been killed or wounded by armed attacks from the Khmer Rouge. The attacks were very barbarous. This time, 13 people were killed and 27 others wounded; nine were children and one woman with a 23-day-old child. The mother was killed and the child wounded. In its statement on Monday [11 April], the Vietnamese Government held that following a series of previous cruel acts of terrorism against Vietnamese nationals, this massacre once again was an open challenge to mankind's conscience and brazenly violated human rights recognized in international conventions. The statement said that this savage act was clearly aimed at arousing national hatred and destroying the traditional friendship between the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples. The Vietnamese Government strongly condemns the latest mass killing and earnestly asks Prince Sihanouk and the Government of Cambodia to take urgent and effective measures to ensure safety of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. They have the right to a peaceful life as do other foreign residents in Cambodia in conformity with the spirit and words of the joint communique of 4 April 1994. The Vietnamese Government also called on the United Nations, other signatories of the Paris agreement on Cambodia, and the world public to voice their protest and to take resolute measures to prevent such terrorism against Vietnamese nationals. A representative of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry had a meeting with the Cambodian Charge d'Affaires in Hanoi Mr. Chhong Toeng, telling him of the anger of the Government and people of Vietnam over the mass killing. The Cambodian official was asked to convey immediately to the Cambodian Government Vietnam's demand for urgent, effective measures to put a stop to the killing of Vietnamese nationals. Earlier, the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia sent note to Cambodians, diplomatic corps, and international organizations in Cambodia denouncing this cruel act of the Khmer Rouge.
