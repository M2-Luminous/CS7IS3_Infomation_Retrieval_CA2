This statement was made yesterday by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys following his return from a visit to Lithuania. According to Baudys, the reason is that the Lithuanian Army does not have a clear concept for its structure or for its armament program. Baudys said that the Lithuanian Army, in essence, has no equipment; however, a much better atmosphere prevails in it than in the Czech Army. According to him, this is because Lithuania feels more than the Czech Republic that it has to guarantee its own security, first and foremost, alone.
