This is what RFE Director Robert Gillette said in Bratislava today, adding that this is the real reason for the Slovak side's termination of the agreement with RFE. According to Transport and Communications Minister Roman Hofbauer and Culture Minister Dusan Svobodnik, whom Director Gillette met, RFE broadcasting is biased and is directed against the Slovak Government. Gillette said that this was unsubstantiated and added that the RFE hoped to reverse the Slovak side's decision and conclude an agreement at the next meeting scheduled for the end of January.
