We believe that it will encourage the process of calming the armed conflict throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina even more. However, it has not yet protected Maglaj, which has been under a siege for nine months and has been subjected to a general offensive by the Serbian forces in the past month. The aggressor is constantly increasing pressure by introducing new weapons withdrawn from around Sarajevo. Several tens of thousands of people in the besieged town will not be able to put up resistance for much longer against the technically incomparably much stronger attacker. The situation is critical and requires an urgent action of the Security Council. It is necessary to halt the attacks immediately and send international observers and peacekeeping troops to the besieged town. Otherwise, there will be another genocide. If the international community allows this to happen through its passivity, all progress made in the past month would be devalued. If, on the other hand, the tragedy of Maglaj is prevented with a resolute action, this will give a new impetus to the process of establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Esteemed sir, I beg you that the Security Council immediately adopt a decision appropriate to the gravity of the situation.
