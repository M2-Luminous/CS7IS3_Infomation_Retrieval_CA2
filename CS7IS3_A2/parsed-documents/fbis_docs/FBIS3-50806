He also said that he will begin a tour in March, as a politician, through all of Honduras to try to restore the National Party [PN]. President Callejas, who inaugurated the Siguatepeque Municipal Palace at a cost of 3 million lempiras, has said that he disagrees with the U.S. Embassy, which accuses Honduras of being irresponsible and of not honoring the rights of American citizens regarding properties, which, according to the law, belong to the Honduran state; an example of this is the United Nations Park. An example of a good situation between Honduras and the United States is the contract I have just signed with the U.S. Motorola Company, which at a cost of $25 million will install cellular telephones in our country, Callejas said, adding: We have also signed a contract for $60 million to install a 25-megawatt power plant. [Callejas] "I am concerned sometimes about radical positions that U.S. foreign policy sometimes adopts. One of the largest U.S. telecommunications companies, Motorola, was granted the day before yesterday a contract to install cellular phones, and it will invest more than $25 million. We have just signed a contract for the installation of a 50-megawatt [as heard] private power plant by a U.S. company at a cost of $60 million. This means that while the U.S. Embassy--especially U.S. foreign policy--is trying to create difficulties around the problems concerning the properties of certain Americans in the country, sectors from the U.S. economy are coming here to invest over $100 million." Concerning the properties for which certain American citizens are fighting, Callejas said he will ask the Supreme Court to explain each case so that the people can find out to where the U.S. Embassy wants to irresponsibly lead our country. [Callejas] "As for the lands, there is much that remains to be said. Actually, one of the problems has been the way in which many Americans have come here to buy lands, especially in Islas de la Bahia, even though the Constitution states that no foreign citizen can buy lands located 40 km from the border. "What has happened in the past is that the offices of the mayor first determined which urban areas could be sold and then sold the plots of land and properties; this created certain difficulties regarding the legitimacy of the lands. Very often the lands were just leased for long periods. "I recognize that when an American has the right the law should protect him, but what I perceive is that attempts are being made to create the impression that all Americans have this right, because their position is the correct one. I do not agree with that, because many Americans come to our country and violate the law, and that does not give them the right to be protected by the state's judicial systems. The courts are there to solve it. "I would ask the media and, especially, the Supreme Court to inform about each one of these cases so that we cannot end up believing that everything the United States does is ethical, correct, and right. There are U.S. citizens who may have the right, and there are others who do not." The president said he will not sign any more contracts and has instructed the Comptroller General's Office not to carry out these types of actions that could create problems for the next government. [Callejas] "I would like to refer to this. I have recently seen, with a certain degree of concern, accusations being made permanently in the media, especially concerning new contracts or actions taken by the government. I would like to inform the Honduran people that I asked the Comptroller General's Office not to authorize new contracts toward the end of my administration, so as to avoid problems. "We want to clear up any doubts that may exist regarding the actions taken by my government. There are certain charges that lack totally any basis. The sale of the (Cobasa) Company is something about which we have not even thought. No sale has been made, and we do not even have time to hold a public bid; that will be the next government's responsibility. "I saw in a Tegucigalpa newspaper today a serious accusation against a public official simply because he traveled to the PRC, and instead of taking the daily allowance of $250, he took $400, which was what the board of directors had authorized. The newspaper reported it on the front page as an act of corruption. One thing is trying to get the sympathy of the moral revolution and the next government, and another is to have the fundamental basis not to make accusations that can adversely affect people, who have been honest throughout their lives." Concerning the reductions in the price of gasoline-- which have been announced at 1.40 lempiras per gallon--Callejas said he opposes it, because it would leave Dr. Carlos Roberto Reina without a protective cushion if prices fluctuate. He said currency devaluations could occur before March. Callejas said he will ask the Economy Ministry to reduce prices by only 1 lempira per gallon; otherwise, it would be an irresponsible thing to do by his government. [Callejas] "There has been a substantial reduction in oil prices internationally, and our policy is that when there is a change in prices of more than 5 percent, the price is transferred to the consumer. I have seen some figures in the media with which I do not necessarily agree, especially regarding the reduction that should be passed on to the consumer. This reduction does not consider the new gasoline price increases in the upcoming shipments or currency devaluations. I sincerely do not want to leave the next government the immediate responsibility of having to increase prices. "I will probably discuss the reduction in prices with the Economy Ministry. The next government should have a small cushion which can allow it to work based on currency fluctuations or international prices at least until March. I can tell the Honduran people that there will be a gasoline price reduction, but it will not be the kind of reduction included in the proposal brought to me by the Economy Ministry. Instead of 1.40 lempira, it will probably be a 1- lempira reduction." On his private life the president said that he will travel to Miami and New York starting 27 February to have his shoulder examined, as he is experiencing pain. In March he will conduct his first national tour to restore unity and recover power in the next elections. He will be accompanied by the National Party's central committee, but he hopes the February convention will elect the new National Party authorities with whom he will tour all of Honduras. [Callejas] "In February I will conduct a private visit to the United States, particularly in Miami and New York. I want doctors to take a look at my shoulder, because I am still feeling pain in the muscle and tendon in the right shoulder. I will visit the doctor and then travel to New York with my wife to rest. I will return in March to participate in the business firms with which I am an associate or owner. I am also going to try to contribute to the new political options of the National Party. I hope to visit the different departments of the country in March. I want to tell the people there that the National Party believes unity is essential for recovering power. We believe that clearly established processes of democratic participation are essential as well." Finally, the president of the Republic, in this exclusive interview with Voz de Honduras, said that the debts owed by his party's transportation workers will be paid off within the next few days. He said a meeting with the finance commission was held, and the funds are now available at a banking institution so that transportation workers can collect the money. They should not be concerned, he said.
