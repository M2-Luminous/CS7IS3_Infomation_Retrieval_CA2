Frankly, cynically, and unhesitatingly, Britain has proved its pro-Turkish stance by blocking the European Union [EU]-Cyprus fourth financial protocol. The Greek presidency's draft plan on the financial protocol struck a chord of British reaction. During the meeting of the permanent representatives of the EU member states the day before yesterday, the British spokesman insisted on securing financing for the pseudostate without the necessary consent of the lawful Cypriot Government. This British stance exhausts Cypriot Hellenism's final margin of patience. In an initial reaction, President Glavkos Kliridhis said that if something like this happens, we will not accept the EU fourth financial protocol. The president's reaction is correct. But the president, the government, and the House of Representatives must not limit their reaction to just that. As we have stressed in recent reports because of other British blows against us, we are obliged to react accordingly. We must react dynamically. Why not even strike back at Britain? We are in a position to do it. We have the power and the means to harm many of Britain's serious strategic and financial interests in Cyprus. We recall that both the president as well as the other party leaders have repeatedly described the British bases as the remains of the British colony in Cyprus. The State Prosecution has opined that the British bases are not sovereign. Therefore, we are in a position to deactivate these bases, the remains of the British colony. It is time that the government and the House of Representatives examine legal ways to implement this. The decision must be made based on two basic facts: first, the British refusal to reimburse the Cypriot Government for the facilities it is offering for the operation of the bases; second, the use of the bases for purposes that go against the interests of Cyprus and its people.
