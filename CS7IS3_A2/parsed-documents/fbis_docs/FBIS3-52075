[Funes] Good evening, Mr. President. I have been given one minute to ask a question on a complex subject. From a political viewpoint, crime -- in particular, organized crime -- has been regarded as one of the problems with the greatest impact in the country. Why does one get the impression that your government and the new National Civilian Police [PNC] are powerless to check and break up organized crime? Do you and your government know what forces lie behind organized crime, which make it possible for crime to operate in blatant impunity? So far, no investigations have made any significant progress. Also, the people are concerned. My specific questions are these: What has the government done and what is it doing to check organized crime, although the government appears to be powerless? What forces are at work in this problem to the extent that the opposition could be right in saying there must be a relationship between organized crime and the government, considering the impunity of criminals? [Cristiani] Good evening to all. Mauricio, I think we should first define the nature of the problem, crime, and our situation as a country. There are a number of causes to this problem. In our country, several factors come to mind: 1) we are in a postwar period; 2) the country's economic and social situation; 3) the world situation, which has much to do with communications and the situation to which children, young people, and adults are exposed. We will have to tackle the problem at its roots. Organized crime, as you described it, is made up of individuals who are used to and know how to operate in a climate of violence. This is to say, they are used to handling arms. They live in a world of their own. This could play a significant role in making criminals. In addition, the peace agreements led to the disbanding of three public security organizations and the creation of the PNC. I must say that, if an agreement is not achieved in this area, we could hardly have peace. There also has been much to say about the government's inability to effectively confront rising criminal activity. We believe that as result of the armed conflict, the country's security apparatus was more prepared to deal with a military type situation -- in other words, military strategy as opposed to criminal strategy. In this respect, there was a need to create a new body that would adapt to the country's new public security reality -- a new security body with modern specialized training, not only capable of repressing criminal activity but also with programs to prevent it, as well as having the ability to confront other forms of criminal activity. So far, the PNC has not yet reached its full potential. Logically, we cannot yet expect this organization to perform at its full potential. Currently, the PNC is being deployed throughout the country. I would even dare say that the PNC deployment has brought about some positive changes. In effect, we have been able to see some improvement mainly because of the training the agents must go through at the National Public Security Academy, and also because the PNC is better equipped than the current National Guard [GN]. In this respect, I believe the fight against criminal activity is in the process of being solved. Also, improvement in investigation techniques into every aspect of organized crime is already showing results. I would not agree with those criticis who say that no cases have yet been solved. Lately there have been cases in which Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] members have been murdered. These cases have been followed by a campaign in which death squads are mentioned, or it is reported illegal armed groups are committing murder for political reasons. Aside from receiving information from the PNC Criminal Investigation Division, formerly the Criminal Investigation Commission, I should note that the Heleno Castro murder case, as well as the one involving the FMLN representative in San Jorge, has practically been solved. In short, special treatment was given to these cases. We have also implemented the so-called joint working group to find if politically motivated illegal armed groups do exist. Also, there are other matters related to organized crime, such as vehicle thefts. Lately we have been able to see increased efficiency in recovering stolen vehicles. Investigations into vehicle thefts are showing other links that we must also investigate if we are to destroy the entire vehicle theft network. With respect to drugs, I cannot recall any other period in which we have been able to disrupt such large drug shipments such as those disrupted over the past year. I believe this is another type of dangerous organized crime-related activity operating in the country. I believe the PNC is not yet operating at its full potential. This is something which is going to take some time until we can really witness a complete and competent PNC. To expedite the presence of the PNC, officers are trained six months versus one year, which is the normal training period of other public security academies. This is because of the urgent need to deploy those forces. In addition, costs are high and pose limitations. Some people have asked why 10,000 policemen cannot be deployed. The reason is that it costs 60,000 colones to train and equip each PNC member. [passage omitted] [Moderator] Ricardo Chavarria from TPS news is next. [Chavarria] [passage omitted] In your 1 January 1989 inaugural address, you talked about four guiding principles: liberty, honesty, reality, and security. I would like to refer to the honesty principle. At that time you said this: To eradicate the scourge of corruption, which angers Salvadorans so much, and for public property to be managed with utmost honesty, our commitment is clear and unalterable. We invite the people to support us by being vigilant, as well as with their constructive and patriotic criticism. Nevertheless, it is now being noted that corruption has not been eradicated. On the contrary, the Salvadoran people are asking how many members of the past two administrations are in jail. Also, they are asking where are your party members who are, according to the public, involved in corruption. Specifically, I am member of a Chamber of Commerce committee, and there is much talk about Social Security as well as the public construction projects. [Cristiani] First of all, I believe government corruption must be evaluated from two viewpoints -- not only two viewpoints, but two types of corruption. The first type involves the corruption of an official -- in other words, corruption by high government officials. Then we have another type of corruption which is a more institutional. The people have mentioned specific cases, such as the Customs Department, traffic police, immigration, and so on. In terms of corruption of public officials, as relates to the question of the whereabouts of the members of the past administration, I can say there were three or four cases of corruption. There is even the case of one official where an arrest warrant has been issued; he, however, is not in the country. This is an example of a trial which has lasted a long time. In our opinion it has taken too long to be resolved. In addition, this same trial has blocked any possibility of rebuilding the well-known Carretera de Oro. In terms of this administration's high government officials, we have already filed charges against two people. In this respect, we have tried to be very straightforward. Every government official was summoned to a meeting at the Presidency, and we appointed a commission tasked with undertaking audits to every state organization. It is quite easy to criticize corruption from outside the government, and yet it is another thing to understand what is actually taking place. One cannot simply send someone to jail just to please someone who likes to make a lot of noise and stir things up. The bottom line is that charges must first be proven if we expect to send someone to jail. In this respect, the audits undertaken did not find sufficient merit to file suit against any high-level official, except in one case which was sent to court. I understand that, unfortunately, the person in question is no longer under arrest. I am referring to the case of (Lamba). Nevertheless, we have been able to ascertain that what is required at this level is, first of all, to try to professionalize, or at least give more leeway to, the Accounts Court to carry out its duties. Most of all, it is the Supreme Court of Justice's Ethics Office which is responsible for ensuring that corruption does not take place. In all the auditing that has been performed, some problems have been detected in Social Security in terms of the bids that are granted. There is a case involving a ghost company, which is in the hands of the judicial authorities. It is under investigation by the Criminal Investigations Division at the judicial level. There has been a lot of talk about bids in other cases. Some problems have occurred in the bidding, because perhaps that is where we have zealously guarded against irregularities. In none of the accusations regarding the bid allocations has there been proof or evidence of corruption on the part of high- ranking officials. I personally know almost all the high-ranking officials, I mean from before the political campaign, and I can say there were proved to be honest even before they came into the government. In this sense, we have tried to act very firmly, but also trying not to make mistakes. Obviously it is easy to blame a person, but it is something else to prove charges. The other part, which is the institutional part, perhaps is a bit more delicate, because there is never evidence. For instance, when someone gives a kickback to a policeman, how can you prove it, unless you go and make the charge. If someone charges a traveler $100 to put a seal on a passport, who can denounce it? There was one peculiar case in which somebody did say something to a policeman at the airport. The person was dismissed from his post, and his fellow companions who were opposed to his removal almost went on strike. We believe the institutional problem should be resolved. That was perhaps the fundamental recommendation made by the commission that we created. The state must be modernized, especially state controls. Public officials should not be allowed to act arbitrarily, because that is where citizens take advantage of the situation to get a kickback, commission, or whatever. Steps are being taken. Immigration entry points are free. Land immigration is implementing a virtually free entrance at Comalapa Airport, where customs regulations are being modified so that there will be a sworn statement and so that this sort of corruption will not exist. The PNC is trying to train good policemen who are incorruptible. Moreover, there is another thing for which we cannot blame the state. I always hear about corruption and the corruptor. Unfortunately, we have reached a stage in our country where moral values have greatly deteriorated. The thinking that prevails is this: If I do not do it, I will not be able to compete because my competitors do it. In turn, a serious problem has been created. There could be drastic solutions, as they are called. We could remove all immigration personnel and all treasury policemen, but we do not think this is the way to do it. Soon there will be not only changes in regulations, but also laws to strengthen them, reducing chances for corruption. [Chavarria] You said three kinds of arrests have been carried out by the government, and two or three people have been fired on this occasion. To satisfy many Salvadorans who insist corruption still prevails, what will happen concerning the cases presented by the commission? Will this be a problem for the next government, or will this come out in the open and the culprits sent to trial before you leave? [Cristiani] We have sent certain cases to the National Audit Office; other cases have been sent directly to the Attorney General's Office, and still others have been sent to the PNC Criminal Investigations Division. The social security case was perhaps the most obvious. Cases like these are directly sent for a judicial investigation. The case sent to the National Audit Office.... [pauses] The National Audit Office is able to conduct what you might call an investigation. You must remember that the commission members did not conduct a criminal investigation, though. They conducted an audit, searching for evidence, because the truth is that a corrupt person never leaves evidence, unless he is truly inept or unless his brain does not function very well. In cases of corruption you seldom find the evidence; for example, no receipts are issued when commissions are paid, or anything like that. The idea is to conduct an audit and find something that will allow you to send someone to court. People have been sent to court in cases where we have found evidence, both involving officials from the previous administration and--I repeat-- two in our administration. [Cardenal] Thank you, Ricardo. Thank you, Mr. President. The third question goes to Mrs. Aida Farrar of Channel 6 Television's "The Newscast." [Farrar] Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President. I have a more specific question, but it is nevertheless of great interest to the Salvadoran people, always dealing with crime issues. It is said production groups in the country's eastern sector have publicly requested deployment of the Armed Forces as a measure to fight crime. What is your position on this issue? [Cristiani] First of all, the Constitution of the Republic authorizes the use of the Armed Forces in special situations, let us say in times of crisis when it is necessary to settle something during a short term; then they return to their normal functions. First of all, to deploy the Armed Forces and authorize them to investigate, prosecute, capture, and send criminals to court would cause two problems: One, we would be somehow contradicting constitutional norms; two, soldiers are not exactly trained to play a role in public security. They are trained in a completely different area. They do not know how to handle certain cases; for example, they do not know what to do in case of a traffic accident. Consequently, we would be involving personnel who are not trained to perform a complex task. We think the Armed Forces can play a dissuasive role; meaning, they can perform their military exercises in broad daylight, using roads where most of these incidents occur. In our opinion, the Armed Forces can play a dissuasive role, and this does not violate the Constitution, because--even if they find someone involved in a criminal action at a given moment--we must remember that the Constitution also authorizes a citizen's arrest. This can be done by anyone who finds a person en flagrante delicto. We do not believe it is beneficial to authorize personnel who are not adequately trained in public security techniques to carry out these tasks, not to mention the doubts regarding the constitutional provisions. [Farrar] Thank you very much. [Cardenal] Thank you. The fourth question is asked by Miss Norma Jimenez of Channel 4. [Jimenez] Mr. President, I will be brief. What was the most difficult decision you had to adopt during your term, meaning, a political decision that was extremely difficult to adopt, and why? [Cristiani] I believe the most difficult decision was adopted late in 1989 concerning the advisability of continuing a negotiation process. I think--speaking for myself and the government level--we felt betrayed by the FMLN's [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] attitude, because it had signed an agreement and then planned an offensive that caused so much bloodshed and destruction; nevertheless, the decision we have adopted was to continue the negotiation process, because we were convinced it was the only way to achieve a long-term solution, while the opposite meant we would have to face a conflict for a much longer time, with the consequences this would entail for the country and the people. We now believe the correct decision was adopted even though you may recall the feedback we received from an extremely large number of groups was that we could not talk with people who even betrayed a process that had recently started. [passage omitted] [Farrar] Do you believe the FMLN is prepared to govern our country? [Cristiani] The truth is, regarding economic matters, I do not know their programs, but what does cause concern is that the FMLN was a group that had a Marxist-Leninist ideology. After the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, and the Soviet Union itself breaks up and accepts the failure of that statist ideology, the FMLN is logically going through an adaptation process. It is leaving that ideology and saying it no longer believes that ideology and that it now believes in other types of economic policies. We have already heard someone who is a social democrat; we have heard of much support for private enterprise, whereas we know that its basic ideology was essentially anti-private enterprise. Now the question is whether there is a tendency to improvise, because I am no longer sure of what they really believe. I believed in something, and now the circumstances have made me change; the question is, how much flexibility will they have regarding economic matters? [passage omitted] Exports have doubled over the past five years, despite the low price of coffee, sugar, cotton, and other products. It is not true that there is no development policy or that it has failed. I would not say that doubling exports in five years, in four and one-half years of government, is a failure. [passage omitted] We had the largest harvests in history concerning cereals. In coffee, we had the largest harvest in 1992 since 1979; in sugar, last year's harvest was the largest in history. There are approximately 150,000 new manzanas that are already being used for agricultural production. The Agricultural Development Bank [BFA] has doubled the amounts of granted credit over these five years, despite the fact that its finances have been reorganized. BFA credit is for small producers, and if it has been doubled, we cannot speak of a lack of attention to the small- and medium-size producers of the agricultural sector. Certain problems have arisen regarding the credit problems that some producers--particularly the producers of the eastern area, which was the most devastated--still had once the conflict ended. We have tried to solve the problem. We have issued a specific decree to provide them with a line of credit; we have eliminated all of the accrued interests, and the interests to pay were recalculated at a lower rate, thus eliminating the capitalization of banks as their loans became overdue. We have stopped all the embargoes and so on. We have tried to help all of them; there may be some that perhaps do not even have the monetary capability to solve their economic problems. It is regrettable, and one understands and sympathizes with them. The government cannot help a company that has gone bankrupt, however; in other words, the government cannot go bankrupt. There are things that can be done and others that we cannot do. I believe the main problem is prices, particularly of our export products. In that regard, the government can only do with coffee exports as we have been doing. On the other hand, the problem of profitability in the agricultural sector is not due to the lack of facilities; it is because the international price of products is low. A government cannot subsidize low prices in the agricultural sector. The agriculture sector in our country will have to be updated. We cannot separate the agricultural and livestock sector from globalization or economic openings. We cannot lend a specific sector a hand by subsidizing it. Someone has to pay for these subsidies. If the other sectors are not subsidized, we cannot make an exception with this sector. I admire Ulises Gonzalez very much, because he is probably one of the few who has carried out this struggle without owing a cent. I question the attitude of others who have come forward shouting things, but I regard Gonzalez as an honest person, a man of principles. As I said, he has been fighting for a more flexible decree. He has discussed the matter with the Central Bank president many times. What we must realize, however, is that the government cannot subsidize any sector. When prices are low, farmers must create their own mechanisms to face the situation. This applies to all economic sectors. I believe we have done much in the agricultural sector, from privatizing commercial activities--particularly with coffee and sugar--to offering more credits to the small and medium producers. As for investments, according to statistics from the Central Bank two out of every three credits are given to small or medium enterprises; in other words, we cannot say that small and medium enterprises are not receiving help. [passage omitted] [Passage omitted] [Cardenal] The fourth question is by Mauricio Funes of Channel 2. [Funes] Thank you. I am going back to a response you gave to my colleague. You said the increase in imports stimulates exports in the long run. The problem is that we have had an increase in imports based on foreign currency that was not generated by the country's own capability, no matter how many times one hears that Salvadorans living abroad are still Salvadorans and that this is a domestic effort. Analysts concur that the 5-percent growth the government announced at the end of 1993 was based on the number of remittances sent from relatives and foreign aid. This aid is decreasing, as the U.S. Government announced recently. Can the country keep on supporting itself on what economists refer to as fragile bases for economic growth? Given that we have been unable to stimulate exports as a source of foreign currency, we continue to depend on remittances sent from relatives abroad and foreign aid. Although you said dependence on other countries has been reduced, we continue to depend on the remittances of relatives and foreign aid to sustain economic growth. Wouldn't we have to redesign the model implemented so far? As Anep [National Association of Private Enterprise] has constantly suggested, the state must become modern and create an adequate policy to promote exports so that growth can take place on solid bases, not on what is called fragile bases. [Cristiani] I think this is an axiom one reads in economic texts, or at least I did when I went to university. One ingredient in promoting exports is to eliminate all import problems and barriers. You said the dollars coming in from abroad are contributing to the trade deficit. That is true, but the contribution is decreasing all the time. I am going to repeat my answer to the previous question. Would you consider it a failure to have tripled exports in the country in a period of four and one-half years? This happened, despite the price of coffee. The price of coffee.... [pauses] When we know the bases that will help us determine whether exports have doubled.... [pauses] We are talking about a rather considerable export, namely, coffee. There has been growth in nontraditional products. I am asking if this is truly a failure or if we are headed on the right course. Granted, we have not closed the gap yet, but nothing happens overnight. If the model is mistaken or the program to boost exports is wrong, how are we to account for the fact that exports based on nontraditional products doubled in four and one-half years, considering we had a war going in three of those years, and we did not have the economic drive we now have, given the insecurity aspect is out of the picture. [passage omitted] [Castellanos] Our economy is growing, but I wonder when will this growth reach me personally. At the beginning of this government, much was said about the economy overflowing and cascading down onto the people. People are saying, however, the benefits stay at the upper layers of society and never reach the lower ones. The following question has been asked a thousand times: If the economic and macroeconomic indexes are so encouraging and promising, why does a large segment of the population still live in extreme poverty? [Cristiani] I wonder what the moderator would say. I could answer your question, although by doing so we would go fully into the social aspect of the situation. We could speak about social development, which works for the good of the Salvadoran people. [Cardenal] Mr. President, we will have to leave this answer for the social portion of the conference, because we are somewhat behind schedule; nevertheless, we appreciate these questions. We will now move on to the third and last block, which deals with social aspects, and we will broach health, education, housing, poverty, employment, and the family. Again, we would like to remind our distinguished guest journalists about the need to keep their remarks as brief as possible due to time; this request is also extended to the president, although we know it is difficult to sum up certain types of subject matter. Ricardo Chavarria will ask the first question in this block. [Chavarria] It will be easy for me, because I will only expand on Castellanos' question. The Christian Democratic Party did us a favor by faxing nearly everything for us. The planning minister has told us extreme poverty has been reduced by just one percent. Castellanos spoke about an appeal to reduce poverty even further. Laborers, secretaries, and plant workers share a common trait. They are no longer taking lunch. They are content with a snack. At the most, this can be regarded as a double breakfast. This is a serious sign that people at present cannot afford to pay seven, eight, or 15 colones for lunch plus a bus ride. My specific question is whether you have been working for the poor among the poor. A 1-percent reduction has been the result [words indistinct]. [Cristiani] I would like first to say that someone lives in extreme poverty when he receives no income whatsoever. The most important thing is to begin by helping those who possess the least. Those who have a job are better off than those who have nothing and, in addition, have no income. Approximately 150,000 new jobs have been created. These jobs are determined by observing both the number of people who pay quotas to the Social Security Fund and statistics. This figure is the number of jobs for which have been accounted. This means 150,000 people can no longer be regarded as extremely poor. Regardless of the accuracy of your figures, it would be necessary to determine how many people are jobless and how many of them are now employed. In this regard, I quote John Paul II, who says the problem of extreme poverty will not be solved if production is not established and if jobs are not created. It is also necessary to talk about the standard of living; that is, the care of the people. We can mention several indexes. The United Nations has certain parameters to measure a society's standard of living. One is life expectancy, which statistically has improved from 57 to 65 years. [passage omitted] In the health sector, the budget has increased from approximately 300 million to a little more than 700 million colones. More and more, we have been using our own resources, not foreign resources. This refutes the person out there who says we still depend on foreign resources. The fact that we succeeded in lowering our imports from 24 to 9 percent indicates foreign assistance is becoming less and less. Figures taken out of context, without analyzing the state budget or state investment situation as a whole, may not suitably mirror the general situation. [passage omitted] Since the beginning of the administration, the trend has been a reduction of budget investments in the nonsocial sector and an increase in the budget percentage apportioned to the social sector; that is, the percentage of investments in the social sector is growing, and this trend should continue. [passage omitted] Adjustment policies are required only when there are distortions. I am sure the next government will not need adjustment policies. It will simply have to be responsible in handling economic activities and public finances. We have resolved the problem for the next government. We are the ones who had to shock treat economic distortions due to the economic mess to which the country had been led. Had we not implemented that policy at that moment, we could have had inflationary levels similar to those in certain South American countries. Nicaragua [words indistinct] has had inflation levels of three digits. I think surgery is performed when there is an illness. Once there is health, why perform surgery? All that has to be done now is to continue acting in a responsible fashion and to manage government finances free of demagoguery. Our economic policy is not a simple structural adjustments program. No. The fact that at a given moment we had to make structural changes due to distortions does not mean this is our economic policy. Our economic policy is based on a social market economy, the honest handling of public finances, and the development of exports. These are not adjustments but efforts to develop the country. [passage omitted]
