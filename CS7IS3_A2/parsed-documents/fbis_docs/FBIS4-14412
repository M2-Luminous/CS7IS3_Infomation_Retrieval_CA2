Russian diplomacy celebrates a new success. Without Moscow's mediation the truce between the Serbs and Croats would probably not have happened. The efforts over many months of Vitaliy Churkin, President Yeltsin's special representative, have finally borne fruit. "The agreement signed today is the first step toward settling the conflict and normalizing Serb-Croat relations," Churkin told journalists on the talks' completion. The truce comes into effect at 0900 hours on 5 April. By this time mortars and antiaircraft guns must be withdrawn 10 km from the demarcation line, and tanks and heavy artillery must be withdrawn 20 km. Before 8 April all Serb and Croat formations will have retreated 1 km into their own territory, giving up advanced positions to UN "Blue Helmets" and EU [European Union] observers. By signing the cease-fire agreement the Serbs and Croats have closed the age on a bloody period in their history when they were in a state of war for two and a half years. As a result of the hostilities around 10,000 people died and one-fourth of Croatian territory is occupied by Serbs and Yugoslav Army subunits. The cease-fire treaty will undoubtedly make further talks between Zagreb and "Serbian Krajina" easier, although by all accounts they will again require Russian mediation. The main task is to define the status of Serb areas in Croatia. As of today the sides' positions are diametrically opposed. The Krajina authorities are demanding separation from Croatia, but Zagreb is not even entertaining this notion, offering Serbs broad autonomy but as part of a united state. The Serbian leaders' separatist sentiments are supported by few people in the world. The vast majority of UN members recognized Croatia with its original borders. The United States, EU, and Russia with certain reservations are inclined toward the settlement option proposed by Zagreb. In this situation much will depend on Belgrade: If Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic persuades his fellow countrymen in Croatia to compromise and not to seek separation at any price the conflict could be finally settled, and Yugoslavia will obtain additional grounds for demanding the lifting of sanctions. For their part the Croatian authorities, who are interested as never before in solving the problem as quickly as possible, could agree to certain concessions. The truce with the Serbs will enable the country's economy to switch back to a peacetime track, will ensure the return of hundreds of thousands of refugees to their homes, and will decrease social tension. Croatia, which before the war had the fourth-highest number of foreign tourists in Europe, will get the chance to redevelop its tourist business, which, according to expert estimates, could bring the country up to $5 billion a year.
