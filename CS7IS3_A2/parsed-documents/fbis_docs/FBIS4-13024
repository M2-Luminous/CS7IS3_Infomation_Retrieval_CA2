[Al-'Ashmawi] Saudi Arabia, in the Arab and Islamic countries, follows the same method that Zionism used to control the economy, media, and press of the United States and Europe. With this, Saudi Arabia seeks to control the minds, eyes, and ears of the Arab nation, with particular interest in Egypt. So it buys people to use against Egypt, whether directly or indirectly, particularly to promote the Wahhabite doctrine in Egypt. [Hasanayn] Does this mean we are living the Saudi era and that Egypt's role and leadership have shrunk? [Al-'Ashmawi] I cannot say that Egypt has lost its role. But we notice this Saudi trend of trying to control the affairs of the Arab world, particularly Egypt, whether by buying writers or exploiting institutions and maneuvering them from behind the stage. [Hasanayn] We seek to establish sound inter-Arab relations that can enable us to face world challenges. But are Saudi hands financing terrorism in Egypt? [Al-'Ashmawi] No question. Clearly, some Saudi circles and individuals finance terrorism in Egypt and support some preachers here and there. I believe the Egyptian Government knows of this and occasionally tries to draw Saudi officials' attention to the issue calmly. But Saudi Arabia tries to clear itself of this charge by claiming that the financing comes from the private sector. Some people wonder about this because in Saudi Arabia there is no private or public sector. A recent announcement regarding a Bin-Ladin family member who lives in Sudan and who is accused of financing terrorism and the naming of three Ladin sons who work in a private security firm that tried to infiltrate Egyptian security are the best proof that what I am saying is true. I could confirm that there is covert cooperation among Saudi Arabia, U.S. intelligence, and Israeli intelligence--whether Saudi Arabia knows of the consequences of this or not--to finance terrorism in Egypt and throughout the region. Foreign magazines have published reports that U.S. intelligence financed over 100 Islamic conferences attended by extremists. In collaboration with the Mosad, U.S. intelligence encouraged the extremist movements, which are called Islamic, to promote Islamic nationalism to counter pan-Arabism. Some continue to encourage extremists in Egypt with a view to weakening it for the next 10 years. From their point of view, this will be enough to virtually freeze its role as a leading country in the region for over a century. [passage omitted] [Hasanayn] Some people believe the confrontation with Israel as the main enemy of the Arab nation must be based on the religious state, as is the case with Israel itself. How do you view this issue? [Al-'Ashmawi] I mentioned before in my book Political Islam that the establishment of the State of Israel was one of the most important causes behind the spread of extremism in Egypt and the Arab world. But I hope it is now understood that Islamic extremism serves Israel's goals by distorting the image of Islam and weakening the Egyptian state, the natural leader of the Arab nation. The cultural way is the right course for confronting the State of Israel. The struggle between us and Israel is not a fundamentalist one. It is a cultural one. If we do not master every factor of culture, then Israel will win. I stress that Islamic extremism is enhancing Israel's position in the world and giving it the golden opportunity to distort Islam and make Egypt backward. [Hasanayn] What is your view of the slogans of freedom and democracy that some of political Islam's groups are raising and that are demanding that authority be rotated through free elections? [Al-'Ashmawi] They claim this because most Arab and Islamic governments are totalitarian. These groups seek to attract the ordinary people and the opposition to their ranks. They also want to address foreign circles and international human rights organizations. But they want democracy to destroy democracy through democracy and spoil freedom through freedom. For these groups, democracy means one voice for one man and once only. When they attain power, they will eliminate every democratic movement, because their nature is totalitarian, not democratic. They believe sovereignty does not belong to the people and that the people have no right to legislate for themselves. These are antidemocratic views. This was declared by Ali Belhadj, the second man in the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] in Algeria, after the first round of elections, when he said democracy is blasphemy. This compelled the Algerian Army to confront the FIS outside the framework of democracy, which the FIS believes to be blasphemy. In Egypt, the religious extremist leaders have often said that democracy is blasphemy. Dozens of leaflets are found on the pavements confirming this. When they talk of democracy, they are voicing that which they do not believe in and following the method of al-Taqiyyah, which is one of the pillars of the Shiite sect [allowing followers to hide their religion to escape persecution], to which the groups of political Islam resort.
