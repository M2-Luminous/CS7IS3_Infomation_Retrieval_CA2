This is because Malaysia is not a GATT signatory on procurement, which stipulates that a country opens its contracts to free competition, he told newsmen after the presentation of prizes for the sixth national furniture design competition here. However, we have not slapped any trade sanction on Britain and the private sectors of both countries are free to trade with each other, he said in response to queries that a British firm had stopped its order of furniture from Malaysia. Asked whether this was a retaliation from the British company, he said, we are not afraid ..... We are ready to face any consequences. .. It looks like the British firm has succumbed to the emotional effect of the patronising attitude of the British press. He said Britain was only a small market as far as Malaysian commodities were concerned, adding that efforts had always been underway to diversify export markets of local products, meaning which the action of the British firm was unlikely to have any impact. Dr. Lim, however, said he was compiling the list of commodities being sold with Britain which would be presented to the cabinet if the need arose for information on commodities traded with that country. He also said that the action by the government showed Malaysia's daring in questioning the values that the British press has set, which are alien to us and which they insist we uphold.
