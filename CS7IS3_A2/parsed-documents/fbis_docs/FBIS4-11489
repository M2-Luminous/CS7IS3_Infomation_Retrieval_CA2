The fact is that the natural competitive advantages that sustained the country's basic exports for years no longer suffice. Therefore, Colombia needs to create a competitive environment that will keep its external sector alive into the next century. In view of the above, the government must urgently establish a series of tax breaks for export firms, promote investment in companies that sell on foreign markets, boost domestic savings, and invest seven-figure amounts in training national human resources. Sizable amounts must be appropriated on a priority basis to improve domestic infrastructure (ports, air terminals, roadways, and communications). This is a summary of the conclusions reached by the study that the Monitor company conducted on competitiveness in Colombia. The research project, which went on for more than a year, was directed by Michael Porter, one of the most prestigious economists in the United States. The final document, entitled "Creating Colombia's Comparative Advantage: Patterns of Competitiveness and Sectorial Analysis," focused on specific sectors of the economy such as capital goods, fruit juices, flowers, graphic arts, leather goods, and textiles. The conclusions were presented yesterday at the forum entitled "competitiveness: the new name of the game." The study offered the following general recommendations for the aforementioned sectors: - Give tax breaks in the form of accelerated depreciation to companies that export more than the average in their respective industry as a percent of total earnings. - Give permanent investment tax breaks to companies whose overseas sales are outstanding in their sector. - Allow all Colombians to have tax-free savings accounts and individual retirement accounts. - Encourage banks to boost the amount they lend to the industrial sector as a percentage of their total portfolio. - Give special tax credits for investment in computers and other information-technology assets. Such incentives must exceed the current 14 percent deduction from the sales tax. - The president of the republic should call a regular monthly or at least quarterly meeting so that he and his economic advisers and the representatives of Colombia's leading companies and trade associations can analyze export trends. - Unions and marketing firms should gather and disseminate information on the available technology licenses that are pertinent to their industry. - The authorities should offer permanent tax credits to promote research and development. - Develop enforceable intellectual-property laws to protect patents, copyrights, and other innovations. - Create a research and development institution, together with other Latin American countries, similar to Europe's Eureka. - Found a university that specializes in science, technology, engineering, and research. - Industries and unions ought to set up institutes that focus in particular on technology for developing skills and innovations in each sector. - The government should establish a prize for the company that invests the most in people, promotes the training of human resources, and encourages the development of its employees' abilities. - Tax breaks must urgently be created for investment in specialized training. - The Executive Branch must provide scholarship funding for companies interested in sending their employees overseas for commercial or technical programs. - Establish more advanced degrees in the Colombian universities that focus on science and technology in their curricula. - Unions should set benchmark prices for their companies that can be compared with those of their foreign competition, using factors such as customer satisfaction, relative costs, capital structure, and investment in innovations. - The government should award annual prizes to the trade associations that further the success of exports. - The authorities should finance the development of private cargo airports and all of the infrastructure needed to achieve greater competitiveness. - Multimodal transport should also be started, and roads ought to be made safer and improved substantially.
