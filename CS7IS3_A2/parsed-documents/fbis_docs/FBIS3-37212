Vladimir Ivanovskiy, a Russian Foreign Ministry representative, said this today at parliamentary hearings, which the State Duma's committee on geopolitical issues is holding. He accused both Serbs and Muslims of committing genocide against their own people, stressing that the aim of Russian diplomacy is to actively "encourage the use of political means to settle the conflict." At the same time Vladimir Ivanovskiy described suggestions that peacekeeping forces should be pulled out of former Yugoslavia as "premature." He stressed that Russian diplomatic efforts were directed at achieving a single approach to the way that all interested parties -- Russia, the United States, and the European states -- view a political resolution of the conflict.
