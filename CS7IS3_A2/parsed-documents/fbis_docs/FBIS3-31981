Gaviria's nomination will reportedly be doomed by the government's noncompliance with the Inter-American Human Rights Commission [CIDH], which has asked the Colombian Government to severely punish human rights violators. For the lawyers who have denounced 15 human rights cases before the OAS, the black mark the Gaviria administration has in the organization's files will shatter the president's candidacy. The future of Gaviria's candidacy is being threatened by the case of Fernando Lalinde Lalinde, who was murdered in 1987; the disappearance of 13 students between 1981 and 1982, when the police were searching for the kidnappers of the Alvarez children; and the cases of attorneys Alirio Pedraza, Martin Calderon, Primitivo Silva, Isidro Caballero, Patricia Rivera, and Olga Ester Bernal. In all these cases, the OAS asked the Colombian Government to financially compensate the relatives and punish severely those responsible for these actions. President Gaviria's government has said, however, the commission's resolutions were recommendations and, therefore, were not mandatory. This attitude annoyed the CIDH, which in the following days decided to file a suit against the Colombian Government before the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Court, which is headquartered in Costa Rica. The suit regarded the cases of rural teachers Isidro Caballero and Maria del Carmen Santana, who disappeared on 4 February 1989 in Cesar Department. The lawyers who denounced these events before the OAS believe this constitutes a major setback to Gaviria's candidacy, because the government's accuser, the CIDH, has weight and influence throughout the continent. According to the lawyers, this lawsuit against the government represents an unavoidable obstacle to Gaviria's candidacy, because whenever he would have to make any decision--should he became the new secretary general--nobody would trust a person who did not comply with the organization's resolutions during his administration.
