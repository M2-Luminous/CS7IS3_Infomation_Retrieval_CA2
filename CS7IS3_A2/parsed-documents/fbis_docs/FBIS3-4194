Last year a total of 100 items of advanced farm technology were introduced into the province, remarkably increasing agricultural output value. Despite serious natural disasters, this central province's total grain output was 26.31 million tons last year, with per unit area yields of rice and cotton ranking the highest in the country. Its production of pork, oranges, tea and fresh-water fish were also among the highest in the country. As the birthplace of hybrid rice, Hunan boasts a large number of well-known agricultural experts such as Yuan Longping, Li Bihu, Zhou Kunlu, Kang Chunlin and Zhou Guangqia, who have succeeded in breeding a series of new varieties of three-stage hybrid rice after years of efforts. In 1993 the province planted 2.26 million ha. Of hybrid rice, increasing rice production by over 1.5 billion kg. And this year it plans to plant 2.4 million ha. Of hybrid rice. The experimental planting of "Hengliangyou No.1", a two-stage hybrid rice, has yielded good results. Its average per ha output is over 7,800 kg. Last year, it planted 6,000 ha. of "Hengliangyou No. 1" in experiment and plans to grow 53,000 ha. to 67,000 ha. this year. The province has also succeeded in developing two-stage wheat, sorghum and crossbred chili, as well as new varieties of carp, pigs and cows. Since 1986 the province has had over 500 agricultural scientific and technological projects that have won state- or province-level awards. They have produced an annually additional income of over three billion yuan (about 350 million U.S. dollars) for the province. Hunan has nearly 20,000 agricultural experts and technicians working at state and collective research institutes, as well as 435,400 grassroots farm technicians. In recent years the province has set up agricultural science and education centers in 2,100 townships, 70 percent of the total. They are playing an important role in helping farmers to learn new skills and raise their cultural level. The nationally renowned Hunan radio agriculture school has enrolled 176,600 students, 56,000 of whom have graduated with diplomas of polytechnic school education. The province also attaches importance to publishing and spreading new technologies and skills. "HUNAN AGRICULTURE", a leading agricultural magazine, has a subscription of 600,000 nationwide. Agriculture officials say that the majority of farmers in Hunan have mastered new techniques for applying fertilizers and planting new breeds of grain and cotton. Local peasants have also realized the importance and advantages of using new techniques and skills in farm production. At the same time, Hunan has strengthened farm technical services and supervision of seed and crop quality.
