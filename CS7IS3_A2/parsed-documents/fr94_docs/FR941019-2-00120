FR941019-2-00120 FR941019-2-00080 (3) Not constitute unfair methods of competition against competitors engaged in the export of the class of goods or services exported by the applicant; and (4) Not include any act that may reasonably be expected to result in the sale for consumption or resale in the United States of such goods or services. 25 25 15 U.S.C. §4013(a) (1988). Congress intended that these standards ``encompass the full range of the antitrust laws,'' as defined in the ETC Act. 26 26 H.R. Rep. No. 924, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 26 (1982). See 15 U.S.C. §4021(6). Although an ETCR provides significant protection under the antitrust laws, it has certain limitations. First, conduct that falls outside the scope of a certificate remains fully subject to private and governmental enforcement actions. Second, an ETCR that is obtained by fraud is void from the outset and thus offers no protection under the antitrust laws. Third, any person that has been injured by certified conduct may recover actual (though not treble) damages if that conduct is found to violate any of the statutory criteria described above. In any such action, certified conduct enjoys a presumption of legality, and the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees. 27 Fourth, an ETCR does not constitute, explicitly or implicitly, an endorsement or opinion by the Secretary of Commerce or by the Attorney General concerning the legality of such business plans under the laws of any foreign country. 27 See 15 U.S.C. §4016(b)(1) (1988) (injured party) and §4016(b)(4) (1988) (party against whom claim is brought). The Secretary of Commerce may revoke or modify an ETCR if the Secretary or the Attorney General determines that the applicant's export activities have ceased to comply with the statutory criteria for obtaining a certificate. The Attorney General may also bring suit under Section 15 of the Clayton Act to enjoin conduct that threatens ``a clear and irreparable harm to the national interest,'' 28 even if the conduct has been pre-approved as part of an ETCR. 28 15 U.S.C. §4016(b)(5) (1988). The Commerce Department, in consultation with the Department, has issued guidelines setting forth the standards used in reviewing ETCR applications. 29 The ETC Guidelines contain several examples illustrating application of the certification standards to specific export trade conduct, including the use of vertical and horizontal restraints and technology licensing arrangements. In addition, the Commerce Department's Export Trading Company Guidebook 30 provides information on the functions and advantages of establishing or using an export trading company, including factors to consider in applying for a certificate of review. The Commerce Department's Office of Export Trading Company Affairs provides advice and information on the formation of export trading companies and facilitates contacts between producers of exportable goods and services and firms offering export trade services. 29 See Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Guidelines for the Issuance of Export Trade Certificates of Review (2d ed.), 50 Fed. Reg. 1786 et seq . (hereinafter `` ETC Guidelines ''). 30 U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, The Export Trading Company Guidebook (March 1984). 2.8␣Related Legislation 2.81␣Wilson Tariff Act The Wilson Tariff Act, 15 U.S.C. §§8&hyph;11, prohibits ``every combination, conspiracy, trust, agreement, or contract'' made by or between two or more persons or corporations, either of whom is engaged in importing any article from a foreign country into the United States, where the agreement is intended to restrain trade or increase the market price in any part of the United States of the imported articles, or of ``any manufacture into which such imported article enters or is intended to enter.'' Violation of the Act is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum fine of $5,000 or one year in prison. The Act also provides for seizure of the imported articles. 31 31 15 U.S.C. §11 (1988). 2.82␣Antidumping Act of 1916 The Revenue Act of 1916, better known as the Antidumping Act, 15 U.S.C. §§71&hyph;74, is not an antitrust statute, but its subject matter is closely related to the antitrust rules regarding predation. It is a trade statute that creates a private claim against importers who sell goods into the United States at prices substantially below the prices charged for the same goods in their home market. In order to state a claim, a plaintiff must show both that such lower prices were commonly and systematically charged, and that the importer had the specific intent to injure or destroy an industry in the United States, or to prevent the establishment of an industry. Dumping cases are more commonly brought using the administrative procedures of the Tariff Act of 1930, discussed below. 2.83␣Tariff Act of 1930 A comprehensive discussion of the trade remedies available under the Tariff Act is beyond the scope of these Guidelines. However, because antitrust questions sometimes arise in the context of trade actions, it is appropriate to describe these laws briefly. 2.831␣Countervailing Duties Pursuant to Title VII.A of the Tariff Act, 32 U.S. manufacturers, producers, wholesalers, unions and trade associations may petition for the imposition of offsetting duties on subsidized foreign imports. 33 The Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (``ITA'') must make a determination that the foreign government in question is subsidizing the imports, and in most cases the International Trade Commission (``ITC'') must determine that a domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of these imports. 32 See 19 U.S.C. §§1671 et seq. (1988 & Supp. 1993). 33 An alternative procedure exists under Tariff Act §303 for countries that have not subscribed to the Subsidies Code or measures equivalent to it. See 19 U.S.C. §1303(a)(1). CF. Cabot Corp. v. United States, 694 F. Supp. 949, 955 (Ct. Int'l Trade, 1988). 2.832␣Antidumping Duties
