This is the view of VU [People's Union] Senator Willy Kuijpers, who yesterday disclosed to the senate the content of the Foreign Affairs Committee's report on the arms trade. Kuijpers calculated that Belgium exported no less than 24 billion Belgian francs [BFr] in arms last year. Divided between the three regions, that means that exports were BFr16.1 billion; BFr2.7 billion for Flanders and Flemish-Brussels and BFr13.4 billion for Wallonia and French-speaking Brussels. The new 1991 arms law applies to the first eight months of 1993 only, due to the delays in implementation decisions, but Kuijpers still calculated in 1993 Belgium exported no less than BFr24 billion in arms. That is half as much again compared with the previous year. Belgian weapons go mainly to the North and Middle East (BFr9.5 billion) and Asia (BFr1.5 billion). In Europe, BFr3.4 billion were exported to the former Yugoslavia, compared with BFr2.4 billion in 1992. Kuijpers has strong suspicions that part of this comes from Belgium. [passage omitted]
