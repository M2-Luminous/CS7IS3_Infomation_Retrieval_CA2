A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said Andreatta and Stoltenberg expressed great satisfaction with the accord reached in Washington for the formation of a confederation in violence-torn Bosnia and view this as a positive turning point in the negotiating process. Italy, the communique recalled, has actively favored rapprochement between Sarajevo and Zagreb and sought to further dialogue between Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the Bosnian Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, at the time of a visit to Rome by Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, on February 3, for talks with Andreatta. The Italian minister, who has directly followed developments in this area through meetings and contacts with Croatian and Muslim authorities, agreed today with Stoltenberg on the point that the institutional framework now crystallizing between the two sides could become a fundamental stage for the settlement of the entire set of disputes pertaining to ex-Yugoslavia. Andreatta and the international mediator also stressed the need to maintain the pace of political and diplomatic initiatives in the successive phases of the accord. For this purpose, greater commitment will be required to win a deeper involvement of Bosnian Serbs so as to move on to a global political solution to the conflict. The importance of strengthening consultations among the European Union, the United States and Russia, for the purpose of consolidating the coordination of international actions, will also be indispensable for achieving results, within the framework of the Geneva Conference, acceptable to all sides, said the two men. At the end of their meeting, Andreatta invited Stoltenberg to Trieste for a meeting of the Central European Initiative, scheduled for Friday [4 March] and Saturday. Expected for this assembly are the Bosnian and Croatian foreign ministers for discussion on the details of the accord reached today in Washington.
