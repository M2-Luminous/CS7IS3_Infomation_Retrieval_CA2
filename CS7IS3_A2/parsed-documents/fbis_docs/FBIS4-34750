Granados: "Miami After Cartagena"] [Text] [No dateline as received] After organizing four summits through their own initiative to discuss matters of cooperation and integration, and without relying on the United States whatsoever, later this year Latin American leaders will go to a meeting convened by President Bill Clinton in the city of Miami. According to an announcement from U.S. authorities, the goal of this event will be to establish the rules of the game for what the White House has called "a new era in inter-American relations." The last time a U.S. president met with the presidents of the hemisphere was in 1967 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, when Washington sought political loyalty at any cost, fearful of the gradual advancement of communism in this region in the years of East-West confrontation. Times have changed, however, and, although the loyalty of the hemisphere continues to be of paramount importance for the United States, it appears to be inclined to offer new incentives to continue to enjoy that loyalty. Michael Skol, who is second in charge of Inter-American affairs in the State Department, says that the countries south of the Rio Grande now have the opportunity to become First World members jointly with the United States. "We want to consider two topics: First, how to strengthen our democracies, defending them as a group and improving our administration; and second, how to promote economic growth, while promoting a sustained development strategy that will protect the environment and alleviate poverty," Clinton said when he formally convened the summit at a brief ceremony on 11 March at the White House. At least this is the emphasis that has been placed on preparations for the hemispheric summit, which is scheduled to be held the first half of December in the city of Miami. The meeting convened by Clinton will take place six months after the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Some foreign ministries of the continent have ruled out the possibility that Washington has an interest in offering an alternative to such summits. Nobody, however, has been able to explain Washington's decision to choose Vice President Albert Gore to make the announcement of the proposed hemispheric conference during his late 1993 visit to Mexico -- the country that hosted the first Ibero-American summit held in July 1991 in Guadalajara. Professor Henry Raymont, a Latin American expert at the University of Boston, was surprised by the person and venue chosen for the announcement of the planned summit. His first conclusion was that the White House had made a mistake, because it lessened the impact of the initiative, but in politics and diplomacy, nothing, or virtually nothing, happens by chance. The hemispheric summit in Miami appears destined to become the forum that will permit the United States to guarantee its own interests in the region through new practices that promote the cooperation of Latin America and the Caribbean. This will be done within the limits of an initiative based on three pillars of Washington's foreign policy: economic development, national security, and promotion of democracy worldwide. Nevertheless, there are still lingering old prejudices of the Cold War in the handing out of invitations to governments accepted as democratic by Washington. The Clinton administration, moved by the old ideological differences with authorities in Havana, has excluded Cuba. "If Cuba is excluded, one might question the sense of the meeting," according to Jose Serrano, New York Democratic representative and leader of the group of U.S. legislators of Hispanic origin. "The U.S. Government speaks of holding a summit with all of the leaders of democracies in America. I think the best way to hold such a dialogue in this part of the world is by including everyone, regardless of what government philosophy they might have," he added. According to the Clinton administration, Miami was chosen as the site of the summit because of the active interaction of that city with Latin America and the Caribbean. Still, there might be other reasons. One is that many of the governments that were invited maintain normal relations with the Havana authorities and do not support the U.S. economic blockade policy against Cuba. Therefore, Miami appears to be an ideal site for Washington in order that no one who wants to avoid conflicts with the influential extremist sector will dare speak of lifting the blockade against Cuba, much less hint -- even remotely -- of the need for a negotiated settlement of differences between Washington and Havana.
