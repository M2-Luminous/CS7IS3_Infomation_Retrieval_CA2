It urged them to make sacrifices for the honor of Iraqis and for Kurdistan to regain its freedom, joy, and national allegiance. In a statement issued by the party's political bureau on the 24th anniversary of the 11 March Statement of 1970 and the 20th anniversary of issuing the autonomy law in 1974, the party said the evil criminals -- the brokers of world politics -- are not satisfied with the war of annihilation they waged against our Kurdish people. Thus, they have gone a step further by stealing the property of the Kurdish masses, smuggling this property to Iran, and selling it in their own interest. Those evil criminals are not satisfied with undermining Kurdish national rights and sabotaging the autonomy institutions. Thus, they have embarked on a new mockery to split in half power centers, institutions, and interests. The party hailed the wise leadership of President Saddam Husayn, the hero of liberation and engineer of autonomy. It praised President Saddam Husayn's courageous stand in the face of all the vile plots being hatched against our Iraqi people.
