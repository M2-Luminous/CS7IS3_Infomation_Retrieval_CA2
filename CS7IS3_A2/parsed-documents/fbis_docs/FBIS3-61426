Ivchenko, RAS Technical Institute of Physics, St. Petersburg, Russia] [Abstract] Numerical computations of electron minibands in the (GaAs)[.sub]N[/](AlAs)[.sub]M[/] superlattice conducted previously by pseudo-potential or strong coupling methods demonstrated that the mixing character between electron states G and X[.sub]z[/] is significantly different for even or odd M. In studies by other authors cited here, the miniband structure of the GaAs/AlAs superlattice was computed within the framework of the effective mass method applying some boundary conditions for the electron wave function, and contrary to the empirical results, the even or odd property of the M monolayer was not affecting the miniband spectrum. It is demonstrated in this study that these boundary conditions require a revision. After introducing a sign changing multiplier, depending on the number of the superlattice monolayer, the computations in approximation of the effective mass also indicate a dependence of the GX-mixing effect on the even-odd property of the M number. Electron dispersion for two lower miniband is found in the superlattice transition region from type I to type II. Figure 1, references 9: 2 Russian, 7 Western.
