The guest of this second part is President Alpha Oumar Konare, who thinks that this devaluation was unavoidable and that the African countries belonging to the franc zone should display more solidarity with each other from now on. Ghislaine Dupont first asked the Malian president if he agreed with the World Bank, which declared that the devaluation of the CFA franc could be beneficial to Mali: [Begin recording] [Konare] It is certain that a devaluation includes positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects are that we need to take measures to keep inflation under control and also take necessary social measures. Having said this, there are positive aspects of which we can take advantage. This includes everything that concerns the improvement of national production in the rural areas and in small- and medium-sized companies. Our exports could also benefit. I think this devaluation is an opportunity for us to create conditions for a genuine control of our economy. [Dupont] Your prime minister has called on the population to adopt patriotic behavior. For instance, he asked traders not to increase prices. This appeal has apparently not been heard. Certain prices have already been doubled in the Bamako markets. [Konare] As you know, this is a reaction I would describe as almost normal after the announcement of the devaluation. We hope that things will get back to normal after the explanation we are going to give and the measures we are going to take. [Dupont] Are you satisfied with the promised package of measures linked to the deal? [Konare] I think the measures are certainly important, but they cannot be a substitute for the work and discipline that we should impose on ourselves. It is important that these measures should be implemented very quickly. We should create a package of important and lasting measures very quickly. This is the condition for avoiding social and political crises. I would even say that this is the only condition for preserving our relationship of cooperation with our partners.
