Discussion of Russian President's Directive in Chechnya"] [Text] Chechnya President Dzhokhar Dudayev has announced that his analysis services are carefully studying Boris Yeltsin's directive ordering the Russian Government to hold consultations with the North Caucasus Republic. In Groznyy they are also tired of confrontation, and, presumably, time is on the side of those who are prepared to seek compromises. But the upcoming talks will be complicated by two facts: Moscow will demand that Chechnya acknowledge that it is a component of the Russian Federation and, moreover, the Russian leaders are still in contact with political forces in opposition to Dudayev. But these facts are an increasing irritant to Dudayev and his associates. Certainly, one cannot regard as coincidental the fact that in these past few days the Chechnya state security department has received an order to deploy its subunits. The point is, according to Ayub Satuyev, the department's deputy chief, the opposition could become more active next week. "The leadership has the strength and resources to curb the enemies of the people, and we will adopt the toughest measures with regard to the opposition," he said. But the opposition, which intends to hold its own meeting in Moscow next week, is accusing certain circles in the Russian leadership of attempting, as Abdulla Bugayev, leader of the "Marsho" party said, to "find a compromise with the Dzhokhar Dudayev regime, ignoring the interests of the Chechen people and of the republic's entire multinational population." "One should realize that the people are tired of Dzh. Dudayev's tyrannical regime and of Moscow's inconsistent and unclear position," one Chechen opposition leader said. "Otherwise there will be a spontaneous explosion and the consequences could be very serious." A. Bugayev called for free, democratic elections in Chechnya, involving all social and political forces. "Chechnya democratic forces do not intend to retreat from this position, even if the Russian Federation Federation Council or some other organ of authority decides to declare the Dzhokhar Dudayev regime legal," A. Bugayev said. Not that all Chechen opposition figures are that resolute. Yaragi Mamodayev, head of the republic government of people's confidence, urged the leaders of all political forces and movements in Chechnya to achieve national reconciliation and work out a common position at the upcoming talks with Russia. Commenting on Boris Yeltsin's directive, Ya. Mamodayev said: "My government of people's confidence believes that the Russian side's efforts to work not only with Dzhokhar Dudayev, but also with opposition political movements could result in a deeper political split in Chechnya and could complicate the already fragile negotiating process. For that very reason we are urging all our compatriots not to split into pro- and anti-Dudayev factions, but to subordinate their personal or group ambitions to national interests in order to deliver Chechnya from total crisis after it has been through so much." Ya. Mamodayev believes that no single political movement or group of forces can objectively express the will of the entire people. So, he said, we are proposing to hold a congress of the Chechen people in the very near future to get to grips with the problems of the relationship between Russia and Chechnya.
