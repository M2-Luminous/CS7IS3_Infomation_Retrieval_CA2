Erstwhile ministers now in opposition are casting doubt over the realism of these intentions. What, then, are the real opportunities and reserves for cutting inflation? The January 1992 price leap not only brought the economic system to the point of equilibrium between supply and demand but, at the same time as destroying the population's savings, it destroyed enterprises' circulating capital. The tax base narrowed as the economy went into decline, and tax receipts declined. At the same time, the government switched part of the state's traditional revenue away from the banking system and foreign trade into private structures -- commercial banks and export-import firms. After losing tax receipts and giving up revenue, the state encountered an excess of expenditure over revenue, in other words a state budget deficit which had to be covered with the help of emissions. Owing to a lack of circulating capital, enterprises could not pay each other for supplies, and thus mutual offsetting of non-payments had to be implemented and compensatory credits issued. This also required the issue of additional means of payment. Following the organization of the ruble zone, over a dozen central banks began to compete in issuing completely unsecured monies. Thus began the post-shock inflation which has persisted for over two years. Why has it proved so stubborn? The fact is that the amount of money in circulation and prices are rising faster than enterprises' circulating capital, for which reason the slump in production is continuing at a rate of 18-20 percent per year. Accordingly, actual tax receipts into the budget are falling, and the budget deficit is again making it necessary to print "superfluous" money. The economy has fallen into the trap of stubborn post-shock inflation and decline. Calculations indicate that the complete abolition of compensatory credits will cut inflation to 10 percent per month, but this will prompt a wholesale slump in production of over 30 percent a year. And if enterprises are compensated in full for inflation, then the economic slump will halt, but rates of inflation will rise to 50 percent per month. It is impossible to stay in such a position for long, insofar as the tactics of taking the middle course merely postpone the moment of the onset of an uncontrollable economic slump. One such method is based on the use of an abnormally large foreign trade surplus -- that is, the excess of Russia's exports over its imports. In 1992, this surplus comprised roughly one-third of GDP, while in 1993 it was approximately one-fourth. This enormous, nonreturnable export of Russia's resources derives from two streams -- aid donated to former USSR republics and the flight of foreign capital to foreign commercial banks. It is essential to find acceptable methods for halting these streams, which are bleeding the country of material resources, and the Central Bank of inflationary streams of money. In the second half of 1993, a portion of the steps in this direction had already been taken. The ruble zone was demolished; donated aid to the republics had stopped in part; and a modicum of control, albeit weak but control nevertheless, had been introduced over currency exporters. This allowed the country to stay afloat despite the unprecedented economic slump. However, the flight of capital continues pretty much at the former level. And tax reforms, which could close the way to outward-bound streams and remove the pressure from commodity producers, is slowing down. Unless the chance given to Viktor Chernomyrdin's government is exploited, then like it or not the country will be left with just one more option -- to introduce an economic state of emergency, to freeze wages and prices, and to return for a while to state regulation -- in other words to go back to where it was in December 1991, only this time with a semi-destroyed economy.
