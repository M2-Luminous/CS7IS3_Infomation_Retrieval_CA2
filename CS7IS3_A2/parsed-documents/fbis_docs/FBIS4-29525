Relevant authorities said Monday the government would probably start consultations among related ministries this week to accelerate internal economic exchanges that have ground to a standstill because of the row over North Korea's nuclear program. A government official said the first stage of meetings would involve the National Unification Board (NUB), the Economic Planning Board (EPB) and the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, but more detailed consultations would come after the summit and an ensuing premier-level meeting. "After the summit and premiers' meeting," he said, "the NUB will map out the overall framework for the political, social, economic and cultural fields and then the issue of internal economic cooperation will be discussed intensively." Southern business circles, which have been skeptical about internal cooperation because of the nuclear wrangling, will soon resume their investment programs for North Korea as well as indirect and processing-on-commission trade. If the presidential summit is realized and obstacles to South-North economic cooperation are removed, the private sector in particular is expected to accelerate direct internal trade, joint investment and visits to North Korea by businessmen and technicians. Detailed projects in North Korea that have been planned by South Korean business circles include an advance into the industrial zones of Rajin and Sonbong, construction of the Nampo industrial complex, and investment in the Kimchaek iron and steel factory. Earlier the government disclosed a three-stage economic cooperation program, with the first phase pushing such demonstrative projects as construction of the Nampo industrial complex. The second stage was designed to activate exchanges in the mineral, agricultural, fisheries and communications sectors. The third stage was intended to organize a South-North Korean economic community on the basis of the previous stages. If the South-North meetings can agree on mutual opening of economic offices, the government is expected to expedite institutional means of expanding internal economic cooperation such as protection of industrial property rights, an investment guarantee accord, a dual-taxation prevention agreement and establishment of open accounts to settle trade balances. In addition, talks on opening more direct sea routes are likely to support such economic cooperation. Last April, a direct sea route linking Pusan and Chongjin was formally opened and Inchon and Nampo ports were utilized as a virtually direct sea route between the two Koreas. At the same time, other direct routes linking Sokcho and Chongjin, and Pusan and Rajin are likely to be opened formally. In the meantime, the government is expected to resume preparations for restoring rail lines that have been cut off since the 1950-53 Korean war. The railways under study include lines linking Seoul-Uiju and Seoul-Wonju. With the expansion of mutual exchanges, opening of air routes between Kimpo and Sunan will become a vital project.
