But since the new appropriations bill cannot pay for everything, costs will have to be cut! The 1995-2000 military appropriations bill, which defense minister Francois Leotard describes as "99-percent wrapped up," is slated for presentation to members of parliament on 20 April. Though less than enthusiastic, those most concerned by the package--the chief contractors for military programs--are visibly relieved. Plans for a 0.5-percent volume increase in annual equipment spending over the next six years make defense look relatively spoiled. But problems remain. Experts are unanimous that funding programs which are reaching maturity would have required "an annual 3-percent increase in the volume of appropriations." The difference will be made up, first of all, by asking weapons manufacturers to cut costs again. To that end, Francois Leotard organized a meeting last Thursday with defense company CEOs, who are prepared to acquiesce in the defense minister's request. General weapons delegate Henri Conze has targeted productivity gains of two percent a year. "We should make it," says Daniel Rapenne, general director of Thomson-CSF. "In the past, the use of (less expensive) non-military components for certain programs produced much greater gains." But such a switch presupposes coordination with the DGA as well as lower performance demands from the general staffs. Moreover, this type of cost-cutting can only be implemented for programs whose designs are not yet finalized, and which have not reached the industrialization stage. The Tigre and NH 90 (Eurocopter) helicopter programs may be put on a such a cost-conscious diet. But that will not be enough to stay within the total package of some 615 billion French francs [Fr], especially since geostrategic planning has highlighted other needs in the areas of conventional equipment and force deployment capability. Inevitable Adjustments For instance, the new appropriations bill included the launch of a tactical transport plane, the FLA (Future Large Aircraft), to replace now obsolete Transalls. Germany seems interested in signing on to the program, which would provide a workload for Airbus partners, but will require France to invest at least Fr33 billion. Further adjustments of programs in progress, in addition to those made recently, thus seem inevitable (see table). The fact is, France can no longer afford the structural increase in costs caused by the growing sophistication of modern weapons systems. For anyone who reads between the lines, the new appropriations bill will confirm this. The only way out of the vicious circle is to accelerate the European mergers for which the DGA (General Weapons Delegation) has been calling and all manufacturers have been preparing. Uncertainty in the Electronics Industry With turnover of Fr36.6 billion in 1993, the electronics industry, which does 63 percent of its business with the defense sector, posted its fourth straight decline (12 percent). Total business has dropped by about 25 percent since 1990. But Jean Climaud, president of SPER (Trade Union of the Electronics and Radio Industries), thinks he sees a few breaks in the clouds. A notable cause is the stabilization of military appropriations in 1994. The new military appropriations bill will not prevent painful choices, and with that in mind, SPER suggests concentrating on France's strengths, namely guidance, communication, and information systems; electronic warfare; and optronics. Moreover, the need to further boost the industry's competitiveness will prompt new reductions in staff, which will have to drop from 44,000 today (50,900 in 1990) to 42,000 in late 1996.
