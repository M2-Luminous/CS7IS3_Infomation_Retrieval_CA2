During his tour of southern China in early 1992, he believed that the key to prolonged political stability, in a sense, lies with men, urging the central authorities to uphold the basic line of "one centre, two basic points" for a long time to come. What counts is that the CPC must organize a good political bureau, especially a good political bureau standing committee, he stressed, adding that so long as there is no problem with this link, China will be as stable as Mount Taishan. This is why since he established the third generation of the central leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core after the 4 June incident in 1989, and especially since he set up the seven-member political bureau standing committee comprising Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, and Hu Jintao, Deng has repeatedly expressed his appreciation for the CPC central leading body with Jiang at the core. Former Politburo Standing Committee Members Sharply Criticize "Central Leading Body With Jiang at the Core" CPC elders including Chen Yun, who made a public appearance in Shanghai on the eve of the last Spring Festival, and Yang Shangkun, Bo Yibo, and Wan Li, who went to various regions on inspection tours, praised the central leading body for its strong leadership and good performance and told local leading cadres at all levels to consciously safeguard the authority of the central leading body. The CPC elders' moves show they are eager to guarantee political stability after their deaths. However, a Beijing source leaked word that central as well as local cadres are divided over this appraisal of the central leading body's work performance. To have a better understanding of the situation, the central authorities called many forums from late February to early March this year, namely, before the Second Session of the Eighth NPC, to solicit the opinions of CPC elders and retired generals and cadres on Premier Li Peng's "government work report (draft)" and the CPC Central Committee's work performance. As disclosed in a briefing distributed by the CPC Central Committee General Office, participants in the forums had identical views on some matters and differed on others. And some offered sharp criticism. Song Ping, a former CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee member, said: "The problem at present, which has a direct bearing on the destiny of the party and the country, is party building. If this problem is not solved, building socialism with Chinese characteristics will turn out to be empty talk and a lie." He added: "If inflation cannot be brought under control, stability will not last. If corruption cannot be eliminated, the party will lose its prestige." Yao Yilin, also a former member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee, said: "We should always give top priority to efficiency in economic construction. We are now at the initial stage of building a socialist market economy; it is not advisable to brag about its role and correctness." Song Renqiong, a former vice chairman of the Central Advisory Commission, noted the tendency of going from one extreme to the other in the political and economic fields and in party building. However, former NPC chairman Wan Li, former defense minister Qin Jiwei, and former CPC chairman Hua Guofeng praised the incumbent central leading body for its ethical integrity, decency, pragmatism, competence, vigor, and authority and hoped that party members and non-party cadres would unanimously support the central leading body. In all fairness, the central leading body should find sufficient consolation in the praise accorded by these three representative figures. In fact, the central leadership has also realized the importance of fostering authority. It was for this purpose that Li Peng unprecedentedly quoted Jiang Zemin on three occasions in his 1994 government work report. Different Appraisals of the Central Leading Body Exist Within the Party A source said that although the third generation of central leadership has done a large amount of work over the last few years and earned much praise, some people within the party believe it cannot be placed on a par with the first generation of the central leadership with "Mao Zedong at the core" or the second generation of with "Deng Xiaoping at the core." The process of establishing the third generation of CPC central leadership points to its inadequate natural endowment in three respects. First, the leadership came to power in a hurry when the CPC's prestige suffered a great deal because of the 4 June incident in 1989, and before this most members of the leading body had failed to gain experience in making policy decisions as successors to the supreme CPC authority and lacked popular support. Second, of the five years they have been in power, at least three were spent on improving the economic environment and rectifying economic order, namely, they did not make spectacular achievements in economic reform and development for about three years and bridging the rift between the CPC and the people. And third, the leading body is a product of a compromise between various forces within the CPC, and these differences were ironed out by several political elders to "maintain unity." When these elders pass away in turn, there will be a problem with the balance of power. However, some CPC theorists believe the central leading body will be able to achieve a smooth transfer of power after Deng's death. A commentary entitled: "Will China Avoid Confusion After Deng Xiaoping's Death," recently carried by the restricted publication CANKAO XIAOXI [REFERENCE NEWS], listed the reasons as follows. First, the present successors are different from Hua Guofeng, who came to power after Mao Zedong's death. As Hua had no real power, there was a power vacuum, but there will be no power vacuum in the future because the present central leading body has real power. Second, the people wish to maintain stability because they have constantly received benefits from over a dozen years of reform and the opening up. Third, the central leading body is now in a much better position to restore the CPC's prestige due to the reorganization decided at the 14th CPC National Congress, and it will not go astray politically because it has Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as guidance. And fourth, most countries in the world, particularly the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, hope China's economic development will stimulate economic development in the Asia-Pacific region rather than being eager to see China in chaos. In short, the present macro and micro climates are different from what they were during the cultural revolution and 1989, when the pro-democracy movement took place, so the writer believes China will not be have chaos after Deng's death. People in Beijing political circles point out that the party will see two internal factions holding different viewpoints for a long time to come, adding that only future events will prove which is correct. If the present "central leading body with Jiang Zemin at the core" wants to ensure that there will not be a power vacuum after Deng's death, they must do a more solid job to gain popular support. Ding Guangen Becomes a Liaison Man Between Deng and Jiang The source said that although Deng had handed the power to make day-to-day policy decisions to the central leading body, he is ready to give his advice on major policies upon request. Apart from concerning himself with the operation of the central leading body through his office and his children, Deng has recently contacted the central leading body through Ding Guangen, who is a member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, secretary of the Central Secretariat, and head of the CPC Propaganda Department. Since Guan, together with Wang Hanbin (CPC Central Committee Political Bureau alternate member and NPC vice chairman) and Wang Daming (Beijing CPPCC chairman), often plays bridge with Deng, Jiang usually asks him to tell Deng about Political Bureau meetings and Deng, in turn, also gives feedback to Jiang through Guan, thus virtually making Guan a liaison man. Because Mao Yuanxin acted as a liaison between the Political Bureau and Mao Zedong in the past, people jokingly call Guan a contemporary Mao Yuanxin. Reportedly, Jiang also often asks Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, to brief Chen Yun, who usually stays in Shanghai, on Political Bureau meetings, and Chen also gives instructions to the bureau through Wu. So Wu has also become a liaison man between Chen and the Political Bureau. People in Beijing political circles maintain that Jiang can get more assistance from Deng with the help of the liaison man, but this is quite detrimental to his efforts to foster his independent authority. Therefore, to ensure stability after Deng's death, it is better to remove the liaison man.
