FBIS3-5921 "dreas049__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-049-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Various Sectors React to Super 301 Measure OW1403022794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 11 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1403022794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The U.S. Government identified eight Japanese industrial sectors -- wood products, paper, plate glass, computers, supercomputers, electric telecommunications, medical equipment, and insurance -- as candidates subject to retaliatory action under the Super 301 trade provision (designed to impose sanctions on trading-partner nations which employ unfair trade practices). Companies in all of the sectors -- except for insurance, which comes under the control of the Finance Ministry's administration of issuing licenses and permits, and telecommunications, which enjoys an excess of exports over imports -- are perplexed and oppose the announcement. It seems that the plate glass and wood product industries, whose imports exceed exports, are having difficulty understanding what the United States' true intentions are. Many of these firms feel bullish, partly because of a lull in the appreciation of the yen. Plate Glass According to 1992 customs clearance statistics, Japan imported plate glass worth 4.5 billion yen from the United States, and the United States imported 1.6 billion yen of plate glass from Japan. The difference is that Japan spent 2.9 billion yen more than did the United States. Yasuhiko Kogawa, managing director of Asahi Glass Company, which is the largest glass producer in Japan, did not hesitate to express his dissatisfaction. He said: "Japan's imports exceed exports as far as the flat glass trade with the United States is concerned. Moreover, the scale of the glass trade between the two countries is small. Why is the United States so insistent about the plate glass sector?" In response to a request made by the United States, the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] investigated the realities of business practices in the industrial sectors. As a result, the FTC pointed out that business ties between glass manufacturers and their special agents are firm and that there was room for improvement. However, three plate glass companies maintain that the progressive rebate and postdiscount systems known as unfair traditional business practices, which are the cause of keiretsu, were successively abolished. Therefore, they say that "we no longer have the systems that can be improved further" (according to the same managing director). Paper Products The same thing can be said about paper products, of which Japan imports more than it exports. Since a settlement was reached for the time being following the conclusion of the Japanese-U.S. paper accord, Takashi Mano, managing director of the New Oji Paper Company, said: "The use of imported paper is increasing. Our customers are making their own decisions as to how to use the imported paper. They are using imported papers to print newspapers, telephone books, and other items. However, foreign manufacturers need to make greater efforts to improve the quality of their products and to meet their promised delivery dates. We have no cases of unfair traditional business practices." Electric Telecommunications Japan exported telecommunications equipment worth 304.8 billion yen to the United States in fiscal year 1992, but Japan imported telecommunications equipment worth 70.5 billion yen in the same year. The United States does not produce fax machines, which make up one-third of the telecommunications goods that Japan exports to the United States. As far as network equipment, such as switchboard machines, is concerned, Japan is steadily increasing its imports. In fiscal year 1987, Japan exported 2.7 times as many switchboard machines as it imported. In fiscal year 1992, however, the situation became reversed, and the export of network equipment became 0.8 times greater than imports. The imbalance was corrected. The Telecommunication Machine and Industry Association gives this refutation: "The situation improved in fiscal year 1993 as well. Imports will increase more because a system under which customers will be able to buy their own mobile telephones [rather than renting them] will be introduced in April." Wood Products Japan is importing 75 percent of the lumber it needs. Moreover, lumber produced in the United States holds 27 percent of the market in Japan. Because of this, the National Federation of Lumber Associations [NFLA] is of the opinion that "we do not think Japan is a closed market." However, the import rate of U.S. lumber grew by only 2 percent while Japan's lumber imports increased by 17 percent in the two-year period of 1992-93. The United States is demanding that Japan remove all tariffs on imported lumber, but Japan is saying that "the issue of tariff rates was settled at the Uruguay Round talks late last year" (according to the Forestry Agency). The NFLA says: "The market share of U.S. lumber is lower than that of Canadian lumber simply because it does not meet the needs of Japanese. We just cannot understand the U.S. countermeasures." Supercomputers Currently, only three Fujitsu and one NEC supercomputers are being used in the United States, according to Fujitsu Ltd. and the NEC Corporation. Compared to this, nearly 40 supercomputers made by Cray Research Inc. of the United States are in use in Japan. Computer industries are at a loss, saying, "We do not know why we are subject to the instances of retaliation because this is an area where imports exceed exports." Fujitsu said: "The Defense Department, the Energy Department, and other U.S. Government agencies are buying U.S. supercomputers. In reality, it is the United States which is forcing foreign supercomputer makers out of the U.S. market. We just do not understand why the United States is attacking only Japan in the supercomputer field." Medical Equipment According to the results of a survey conducted by the Toshiba Corporation, Japan exported to the United States medical equipment worth some 100 billion yen in fiscal year 1992. At the same time, it imported about 800 billion yens' worth of medical equipment from the United States. Toshiba complained about the U.S. action, saying, "We do not understand why the United States thinks that we are an unfair trade partner." As for Japan's small automatic blood analyzers and other medical equipment which are being sold in the United States, some Japanese companies are saying that "U.S. consumers will suffer if these types of equipment become subject to retaliatory action" (according to Hitachi). Computers Japanese and U.S. computer makers are actively supplying their products to each other and are promoting technological cooperation. Fujitsu said: "Depending on the product, it is difficult to tell if it is made in Japan or in the United States. Retaliation is impossible." Insurance Services Being conscious of the Finance Ministry, which acts as the responsible authority, life insurance and nonlife insurance companies are avoiding commenting on the recent "identification" of the business sectors. The Sumitomo Life Insurance Company and other insurance firms say that "we would like to remain calm and to continue observing the development of the situation." However, Toshitaka Urakami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association (and chairman of the Sumitomo insurance company), commented on the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. trade talks by saying: "We avoided the worst-case scenario, in which both countries would agree to establish numerical targets without having a thorough understanding of the situation. We could not help but do this."
