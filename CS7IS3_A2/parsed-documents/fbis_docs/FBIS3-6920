The warning by North Korea's ambassador to China, Chu Chang-chun, is the latest threat in the stand off over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. Mr. Chu says the deployment of American Patriot missiles in South Korea will only accelerate the speed towards war on the Korean peninsula. The ambassador also says if international sanctions are imposed on North Korea, Pyongyang would, what he called, make the necessary response. From Beijing Ali Moore reports. [Moore] North Korea's ambassador Chu Chang-chun says America should not forget the Korean war of the 1950's and should use the experience as a lesson. As well, he accused the United States of organizing international pressure against North Korea and said all the moves will only accelerate the speed towards war. If there is another war he said the United States and South Korea will be fully responsible. North Korea has a large diplomatic presence in China, its most important ally and trading partner. Chinese leaders say they oppose using pressure to resolve the nuclear dispute. Ali Moore, Beijing.
