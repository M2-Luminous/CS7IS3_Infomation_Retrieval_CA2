This is the central point made in a strategy paper that Research Minister Paul Krueger presented in Bonn. In developing future priorities of environmental research, politicians want to cooperate with science and technology and the users of the research findings. In Krueger's view, activities must be better coordinated to achieve a more user-oriented environmental research. The Christian Democratic Union politician admitted that there are shortcomings in adjusting activities among the ministries, the research establishments, and industry. This is due to the surge in environmental research. Annual government subsidies, excluding environment-oriented energy, transport, and construction research, have been increased from 250 to 720 million German marks since 1982. Of these, 50 percent each are used for projects and as subsidies for research organizations. Instead of a number of small projects, pilot projects are to be established where various fields of science will deal with model environmental problems. Institutes shall increasingly cooperate with science and producers or users of environmental technologies. Germany is the world leader in environmental research and technology, Krueger said. He mentioned sewage treatment and waste incineration as examples. Over the past few years, 1 million jobs were created in environmental technology-related industries, and 21 percent of world exports came from Germany. In a new environmental research program for 1995 to 1999, the environment minister wants to set priorities in the fields of water circulation and climate as well as environment-friendly use of land. In addition, solutions are to be found for avoiding problem substances as early as at the research stage and for establishing closed circulations of substances. This way pollution is to be avoided at the source.
