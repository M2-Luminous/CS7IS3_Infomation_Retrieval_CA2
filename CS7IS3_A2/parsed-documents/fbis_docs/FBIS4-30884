The BSP Supreme Council and Socialist deputies authorize the BSP parliamentary group to reach a decision on supporting or rejecting the vote of confidence that the prime minister has requested, depending on whether acceptable proposals are made on changing the government's membership and policies. If no such proposals are made, there will be no grounds for supporting the government. In such an event, the only solution will be to hold free democratic elections as soon as possible. Our position is dictated by our conclusion that, with its present membership and activities, the government does not enjoy the degree of trust needed to resolve the real and grave problems facing Bulgaria today. 2. The BSP is ready immediately to join bilateral and multilateral talks under the aegis of the prime minister. The purpose of these talks would be to try to revise the unacceptable points in the Council of Ministers's program of 18 May and provide legislative guarantees for carrying out the most important tasks included in this program. 3. The BSP proposes including the following commitments in a framework agreement: -- The Council of Ministers should compensate the population's incomes, which have fallen drastically as a result of the price shocks in March and April 1994; it should repeal the section of Council of Ministers Decree No. 77 that froze the pay of employees in the state-financed sphere; and it should immediately reactivate the work of the National Council for Trilateral Cooperation. -- The parliamentary groups that support the government should pass the following legislation: in June 1994, the changes in the Privatization Act and privatization programs; in July, the Law on Defense and the Armed Forces; and, before the end of the summer session, the necessary laws on holding free democratic elections, as well as continuing work on the bills on protective bankruptcy and insolvency. 4. The BSP considers that the initiative that the president of the Republic of Bulgaria took on 20 May 1994 can be discussed when the constitutional need arises, within the framework of the mandates held by the parliamentary groups for forming a new government. The BSP reaffirms its determination not to participate in any attempts to form within the term of the present parliament a new government along the lines of political confrontation, revanchism, or restoration of the old regime. 5. The BSP reaffirms its unchanged position that Bulgaria's main problems can only be solved by constructive political dialogue. At the final stage of concluding the agreement on the foreign debt, any government must win broad parliamentary consensus, based on an analysis of the internal and external resources for financing the debt and the country's ability to bear the burden. 6. The BSP Supreme Council and Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy [PSSD] confirm the mandate given to the BSP Executive Bureau and the PSSD leadership to analyze the situation, define the position of the BSP, and conduct negotiations.
