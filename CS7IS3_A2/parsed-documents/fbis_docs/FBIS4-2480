Local experts at planting and stock-raising or well-informed businessmen are now acting as farmers' market advisers, teaching them useful techniques and seeking marketing channels for their products. A farmer named Xiong Zaifu lost more than 1,000 yuan by planting watermelons last year. At the beginning of this year he signed a contract with a consultant, who advised him to grow soybeans instead and guaranteed that he could market them. Another farmer, Hu Xinan, earned 10,000 yuan last year by raising pigs, following the advice of his market adviser. This year he signed another three-year contract with the same adviser, which clearly stipulates that the adviser must buy his pigs for a price already agreed upon by the two sides. "So I need only see to the raising," Hu said in a cheerful tone. "Market advisers" have also benefited from such cooperation, as one adviser explained, "farmers get marketing channels and we get an ample supply of goods." Song Guizhi of Wangtan village, near Tianmen city, an expert at cotton growing, has organized an association of market advisers in her village to provide services for farmers. According to a local official, although the output of aquatic products and fruits in Hubei increased hugely last year, marketing has run smoothly, thanks to the positive role played by the "market advisers" in invigorating circulation and guiding farmers to adjust their activities to market demands.
