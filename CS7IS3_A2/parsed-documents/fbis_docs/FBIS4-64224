It would be sensible to say farewell to the troops of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, and France in a joint ceremony in Berlin, the supreme commander of the Western Group of Russian Forces, Burlakov, told journalists in Berlin on Friday [29 April]. Burlakov is not content with the planned farewell ceremony in the Weimar national theater and at the monument to the Russian Forces in Berlin-Treptow, which is to be attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The main reason for his objection is the proximity of the former Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar. It would be a sacrilege "to dance in that place." [passage omitted] Burlakov said he is "very concerned" about housing and the troops' reintegration in their home country. While withdrawal from German territory is on schedule, housing construction lags far behind. A total of 48,824 families have left Germany without having apartments to got to in Russia. Under the housing program funded by Germany, of the planned 32 housing estates with 34,982 apartments, only six estates with 9,080 apartments have been built over the last nine months.
