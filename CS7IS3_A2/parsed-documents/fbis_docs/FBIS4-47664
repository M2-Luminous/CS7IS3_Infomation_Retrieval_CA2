Have you heard the lies spread by the clique of killers on their radios, RTLM [Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines] and Radio Rwanda? The clique continues to lie to the world about Rwandan issues, saying that the problem in Rwanda is ethnic. However, in reality the problem is political. The clique continues to mislead Rwandans by using the ethnic issue, even though it is irrelevant. They claim their troops are fighting against Belgians and Ugandans in addition to the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. These are pure lies. In their claim that they are fighting Belgians, Ugandans and the RPF, we want to know how their troops are fighting? What are their numbers so as to be able to fight whites, foreigners and the RPF all at the same time? Rwandans, you can understand that these are lies. You should not listen to the clique of killers who are following their own interests, as has always been the case when they dare to claim that their troops are doing well at the front, as if the troops themselves are unaware of how they have been defeated by the RPF troops. They were defeated, they fled [words indistinct].
