The NDF also insisted on the presence of exiled Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose Ma. Sison during talks with government. Although Fr. Luis Jalandoni is the NDF's official representative, Sison -- who is believed to be the current CPP chairman under the nom de guerre Armando Liwanag -- is recognized as a "consultant" of Jalandoni on the peace process. In a 22 January letter addressed to Ambassador Howard Dee, chairman of the government panel dealing with the communist rebels, Jalandoni stressed the need to "adequately resolve certain matters of principle and procedure. The NDF is willing to resume exploratory talks," Jalandoni wrote. However, he said government must first "adhere to the Hague Declaration" and remove the obstacles to the peace process. Members of the panel and its working groups confirmed the contents of the document but refused to discuss it further, as well as the courses of action the panel is considering. Dee in 27 December accepted the NDF's invitation for a preliminary meeting in Europe before holding further exploratory talks in Vietnam. But he said the NDF must drop "their preconditions to the exploratory talks." In response, Jalandoni wrote "contrary to your allegations that the NDF is making a precondition of EO [Executive Order] 125, it is Mr. Ramos who has thrown a monkey wrench into the peace process by issuing EO 125." He added "any delay in the NDF-GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] talks is ascribable to the Ramos regime's refusal to adhere to the letter and spirit of the Hague Declaration, and setting up obstacles to the peace process." Jalandoni said the executive order is "a violation of the Hague Declaration because it delimits the NDF-GRP talks to what already appears in the existing GRP constitution." But Dee had said that EO 125 cannot be rescinded because the order "in effect creates the office of the peace process and also the three panels (dealing with the country's rebel groups)." In addition, a source in the panel explained that the EO "does not necessarily delimit the talks...it is an internal document and the NDF is not covered by it." Jalandoni also denounced what he called "the Ramos regime's continuing total war policy." But the source said the protest was "uncalled for," claiming the firefights between government troops and communist guerrillas have been declining steadily. "Isa pa," [One more thing] he added, "aren't they the ones who had earlier stated that we should conduct talks first before declaring a cease-fire, that any cessation of hostilities should come after the talks and not before?" Jalandoni also claimed government "has been coddling (NDF) renegades and expellees from the revolutionary movement." He said this, along with "statements threatening to withdraw from talks with the NDF and to hold peace talks with the renegades and expellees," were all part of government's "psy-war" efforts.
