Entergy also may agree to pay to the agent Bank (if any) an agent fee for the period from the commencement of the borrowing arrangements to and including the date of termination of the commitments, not in excess of $200,000 per year. The facility and/or commitment fee and agent fee would be payable on a quarterly basis and on the date upon which Entergy shall terminate the commitments. Entergy also may agree to pay to the Banks an up-front fee not in excess of 1% of the total commitments. The proceeds of the borrowings under the proposed arrangements will be used by Entergy for general corporate purposes, including: (1) The acquisition of shares of Entergy's outstanding common stock pursuant to outstanding Commission authorization and any future similar authorizations; (2) further investments by Entergy in related non-utility businesses, subject to receipt of any further Commission approval, if necessary; and (3) investments in exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility companies. Eastern Utilities Associates, et al. (70&hyph;8381) Eastern Utilities Associates (``EUA''), a registered holding company, and EUA Service Corporation (``EUA Service'' and together with EUA, ``Applicants''), a wholly-owned subsidiary, each located at One Liberty Square, P.O. Box 2333, Boston, Massachusetts 02107, have filed a declaration pursuant to Section 12(c) of the Act and Rule 46(a) thereunder. By order dated February 18, 1986 (HCAR No. 24020) (``1986 Order''), the Commission authorized EUA to make capital contributions to EUA Service in order to support interim financing for constructing EUA Service's office complex (the ``Service Center''). EUA made a $5 million equity capital contribution to EUA Service during 1987. The 1986 Order also authorized EUA Service to charge other companies in the system amounts in order to provide a return on EUA Service's equity capital, as increased by the capital contribution. By order dated December 18, 1987 (HCAR No. 24543) (``1987 Order''), the Commission authorized EUA Service to issue and sell up to $20 million in notes (``Notes'') to pay or reduce outstanding short-term borrowings incurred to construct the Service Center. The Notes mature in 2008 and are being repaid pursuant to a sinking fund schedule. The Applicants state that EUA Service desires to reduce the $5 million in equity capital in order to reduce its fees to companies in the EUA holding company system. The Applicants further state that reducing this amount over the next fifteen years will permit payments out of internally generated cash and avoid the incurrence of additional debt to finance the payments. EUA Service proposes to declare and pay dividends to EUA out of EUA Service's paid-in capital account, from time to time through December 31, 2008, in amounts aggregating $5 million. Specifically, EUA Service proposes to pay $500,000 in 1994, $1,000,000 in each of 1995 and 1996, and $200,000 annually through 2008.
