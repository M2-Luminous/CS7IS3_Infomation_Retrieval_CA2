Petrov: "Is Only Big Money at Stake?"] [Text] In Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] there exists a real hunger for arms. According to psychologists and sociologists, the reason for such an enormous increase in interest for these kinds of objects for taking human lives lies in the rising uncertainty of the citizens for their personal security, as well as in the psychological determination preconditioned by the military activities in our close and not-so-close region. One of the most common examples of the enormous interest of the citizens in the purchase of arms are the long queues in the Interior Ministry department for issuing permits to carry and possess arms. As a matter of fact, the shops selling these "goods" are the ones that are the most visited in Skopje. The shopkeepers say that guns, firearms, hunting knives, and "Rambo" knives are the most popular. In other words, arms are slowly becoming an indispensable tool for the new businessmen, politicians, and often for common people, too, who are ready to pay 1,000 German marks [DM] or more to purchase a good "Magnum," "Beretta," or the somewhat cheaper "Zbrojovka," "Zastava," or "TT." In a way, one can somehow understand the interest in firearms for personal protection reasons, such as the guns and pistols for which there is a legal regulation for carrying and possessing (the permit issued by the Interior Ministry). The problem arises when we talk about light infantry armaments -- automatic rifles, machine guns, mortars, bombs, mines, or sniper rifles, in which case we cannot speak of a traditional Balkan love for "shooting" or self-protection. Even at weddings, when only until recently guns and pistols were fired, we now often hear the firing of automatic weapons as if it were a real front line. Wherever there are arms, there are unprofessional handlers (there was such a case two years ago when a citizen was killed while a person was shooting dogs with an automatic rifle), but there are also real professionals, that is eliminators, as was the case of the triple murder in Strumica. The police reports say that last year 42 cases (there were 39 in 1992) of illegal trading and possession of explosives were discovered. Then (in 1993) four machine guns, 34 automatic rifles, 33 bombs, a mine, 8,532 rounds of different ammunition, 6,290 grams of explosives, 112 meters of slow burning fuse cord, 72 powder cartridges, and 50 explosive fuses were taken from 92 persons. In most of the cases the arms were bought through different channels from Bosnia and Herzegovina, from Croatia, as well as from the arsenal of the former Yugoslav People's Army, from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Speaking about the illegal arms trade, it is a well-known fact that they can be purchased at almost all greater market places in Macedonia, and the prices for these "assortments" are not a secret at all. "Kalashnikovs," for instance, can be purchased from DM1,500-2,000 apiece, but if greater quantity is bought, the price is drastically decreased. Automatic rifles of the types "Makarov" or "Scorpio" can be bought for DM1,000-1,500; pistols and semiautomatic pistols, depending on the model and the year of production, cost from DM400-1,000; a bomb sells for DM50; while the average price for ammunition is DM1 per round, again depending on the kind of weapon it is used for. What is especially indicative in the context of arms smuggling is the fact that most often they end up in western Macedonia. As a matter of fact, it is no secret that the citizens of Albanian nationality are the constantly hungry market for weapons, and they are the greatest customers of the illegal arms trade. The big actions of the Interior Ministry in the Struga village of Radolista of a year and a half ago, as well as the recent action in Gostivar, connected to the "all-Albanian paramilitary army," indicated the last station for smuggled arms, because aside from the common automatic rifles which are usually supplied from Albania (the Chinese version of the "Kalashnikov"), bombs were also discovered, as well as radio stations, mobilization lists, literature, uniforms.... In spite of the rigorous fines, according to which criminal charges become unavoidable, it is a fact that arms are coming into our country from all sides. The statistical data related to the phenomenon called illegal import and possession of arms indicate a tendency toward continual rise, and the number of these criminal acts is constantly increasing. It is a social problem, with further serious political implications, because it is not just necessary to stop an illegal profitable business, but a potential powder keg which can explode at any time. Ultimately, the danger can be clearly viewed in the fact that nobody in the state knows the psychological stability or mental balance of each one of those carrying a "Colt," a "Magnum," a "Smith & Wesson," or a "Walther" under the coat.
