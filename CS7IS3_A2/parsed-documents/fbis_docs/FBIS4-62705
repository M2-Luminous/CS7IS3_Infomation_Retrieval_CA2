Ukrvneshtorg is designed to export produce (commodities and services) within the framework of the State Order and State Contract involving nomenclatures to be determined by the Cabinet of Ministers. The State Contract's amounts were specified by the Cabinet's resolution, which was adopted in mid-March 1994. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rolled ferrous metal, ths. t.

Presently, Vadim Plotkin is its acting president. He is to register the Concern within a 10-day period. Commenting on the resolution at UKRINFORM's request, Alexander Nasekan, the Industry Ministry's foreign economic relations agency superintendent, said the Ministry would, to a certain extent, take part in Ukrvneshtorg's activities. However, specific forms will be clear only after its statute has been drafted and approved. The role to be played by the former so-called "special exporters" remains unclear. One is left to wonder, if the move was purposefully prompted by the director corps to make a show of supposedly rigid control under the Cabinet's pressure, or whether it should be interpreted as the government's step toward a more centralized system of effort distribution and sharing export incomes. However, the details and underlying goals of the changes underway are likely to surface in a matter of days.
