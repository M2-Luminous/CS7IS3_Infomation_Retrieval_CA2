Minister Montero explained that the respective files are being studied by the court martial and the court in charge of the case in order to make recommendations to President Caldera. [EL NACIONAL] And how long will that take? [Montero] I can't say, but we are studying them all. [EL NACIONAL] What can you tell us about the return of the military personnel who sought asylum in Peru? [Montero] So far we haven't had any contact with them, but we are studying their files to solve the problem. [EL NACIONAL] They must come before the law? [Montero] The president already said that they must come before the law. They have been notified of this several times. [EL NACIONAL] How are your investigations proceeding regarding the alleged sale of weapons to Colombia by the Venezuelan soldiers? [Montero] We have a DIM [Directorate of Military Intelligence] officer in Colombia right now coordinating the investigation, and we are trying to determine whether their is any connection between the two cases. Right now we are in the middle of the investigations. [EL NACIONAL] The Zulia State governor said Yucpa Indians were massacred in Sierra de Perija. What do you have to say about this? [Montero] There was no massacre. What happened was that a trooper reacted. He was attacked with sticks and machetes, he reacted, and, regrettably, it happened. Vice Admiral Huizi Clavier will go to Zulia on 7 February to coordinate with the governor for an investigation of the problem at the scene. [EL NACIONAL] Is the possibility of reintegrating the coupist officers into the Armed Forces being studied? [Montero] Yes, it is being studied, and they know it will be difficult for them to be allowed to return to the Armed Forces. We are looking for the best way for them to leave the organization but through the front door with no problems later in civilian life.
