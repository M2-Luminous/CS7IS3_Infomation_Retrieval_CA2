The PRT, which is reorganizing, threw its support behind the PRD in a communique that stated that the latter offers an internal structure "that allows for the opening of (basic) maneuvering room for participation that is comparatively more democratic." In its analysis the PRT leaders gather that since the Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance took control in 1989 it began "to fragment as a result of the decisive impact of its abuses, irrational greed, ill-disguised corruption, and, of course, its systematic measures against the nation and the people." According to the PRT, the errors of that alliance "were nothing more than the inevitable and fitting result of the social nature of the governing individual." The PRT document, signed by Graciela Dixon, Egbert Wetherborne, and Ramiro Guerra, indicated that "based on its ideals, origin, and historic reason, the PRD is more committed to the national tasks pending at the end of the century." The group also pledged to work for the PRD platform, "because with the people in power it will be possible to continue the struggle for an improved national and popular option."
