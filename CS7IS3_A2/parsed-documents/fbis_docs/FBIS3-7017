[Sonoda] Their rapid approach is related to a realignment of political parties. It is a move to defeat the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the next election. The LDP remains a powerful political force. Our party understands and agrees with their intentions to defeat the LDP in the next election. If the two parties are to form a major parliamentary group only for the purpose of cooperating with each other in the next election and in running the Diet, our party cannot go along with them. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Then, are you against forming a new political party? [Sonoda] If attempts are made to realign political parties to create a new party to counter the LDP with differing political beliefs, policies, and political tactics being left uncoordinated, this would merely be done to attain a majority. The plan for a major parliamentary group smacks of a new political party. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Your party has maintained an engagement-type relationship with the Japan New Party. How will your party proceed with its dialogue with that party? [Sonoda] If the two parties are to form a major parliamentary group to cooperate with each other in the next election and in running the Diet after merging themselves into one party, our party is willing to discuss various matters with the JNP. However, the formation of a major parliamentary group is different from the creation of a party. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will the engagement between your party and the JNP be broken off? [Sonoda] Prime Minister Hosokawa and the JNP have said that the engagement will not be broken off. It is true that the prime minister is wary of the JNP. Both Sakigake [Harbinger] and the JNP have agreed to merge into one party to contest the next election and to practice politics to enact reforms. My understanding is that the time has come for the two parties to merge into one party. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The prime minister, however, shows no intention of calling for a shift from an "engagement" to a "marriage." [Sonoda] I do not know about that. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The relationship between the prime minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has worsened. Would you comment on this? [Sonoda] Although you may not believe me, their relationship is nearly back to normal. While the prime minister is a single-minded man, Mr. Takemura is an obedient man who does his best if asked to by the prime minister. It once was the case that they rarely met at the Prime Minister's Official Residence for discussions, but I assume that such a situation no longer is the case. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Shinseito appears to want to forge an alliance with Sakigake or the LDP. What do you think? [Sonoda] If Shinseito is suspected of making contacts as a party with the LDP, this is incorrect and a misunderstanding. There have been only personal contacts. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] A prerequisite for a realignment of the political parties is that not only the ruling coalition parties but also the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] must change themselves. [Sonoda] If there is no such prerequisite, it would be impossible to realign the political parties. It is also impossible to form a genuinely new political group only months after the LDP-SDPJ system, which existed for a long time, has been torn down. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Would you explain Sakigake's strategy for a realignment of the political parties? [Sonoda] Power games within the ruling coalition parties are inevitable. There are some people in the LDP and the SDPJ who can move toward realigning the political parties. Under present circumstances, however, they cannot make such moves. Although it is desirable to realign the political parties, the ruling coalition parties have to implement policies every day and to attach more importance to holding their coalition together than to realigning the political parties. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will a realignment of the political parties definitely take place? [Sonoda] Now that a single-seat constituency system has been adopted for the House of Representatives, in the end, the current political parties will be merged into two political forces. Therefore, our party is conscious of the realignment, but it believes that now is not the time for a realignment.
