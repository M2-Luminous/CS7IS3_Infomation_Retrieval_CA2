Aliyev, President of the Azerbaijan Republic, and the National Assembly of the Azerbaijan Republic"] [Text] The appearance of the private television company VMTI has played an appreciable role in the life of independent Azerbaijan--which is experiencing a difficult sociopolitical situation--by contributing to the establishment of principles of freedom of thought and pluralism and to the formation of democratic institutions of power. From the day it was created VMTI television set for itself the goal of serving the people who are experiencing a difficult period in their history, who are tired of political cataclysms. By advocating human and national cultural values, the television company has contributed to the development of high aesthetic taste in the viewers. This is why in a short period of time VMTI has been able to win the sympathies of a broad viewing audience. Any success begins with creative competition. The newly created television company has helped in all ways to develop a high level of professionalism among television workers. There is still much for the television channel, which is not even a year old, to do along this path. But as in other areas of our life, obstacles have appeared on the path to the new--in this case the television company. The sudden closure of VMTI, which was founded in compliance with existing legislation, has evoked protest from the intelligentsia. We, the undersigned, request that you provide for the restoration of democratic norms and overturn the illegal decision to close down the private television company VMTI. Respectfully, Anar [Azeri writer], Mikhail Abdullayev, Fuad Poladov, Dzhevanshir Kuliyev, Rafig Guseynov, and others. (A total of 22 signatures.)
