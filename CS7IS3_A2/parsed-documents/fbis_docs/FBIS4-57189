If the government succeeds in passing it rather handily, it will be very instrumental in creating the appropriate conditions so that the 1994 elections do not wind up surrounded by suspicion and recrimination. But if the government fails this exam, it will do severe damage to the elections and cast a dark shadow over their integrity and impartiality. PAN's charge is that Carlos Hank Gonzalez and his private secretary violated Article 407 of the Federal Penal Code. This article prohibits public servants from using whatever funds, assets, or services they have at their disposal to support a political party or candidate. According to the official PAN charge, which carries on through legal channels what the national press began in the media, Carlos Hank used resources from his secretariat to place a full-page insert in all national newspapers in support of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] presidential candidate. The evidence that PAN has submitted to back up its charge apparently includes copies of documents that were issued by the office of Mr. Hank's private secretary and that mention conversations which the agriculture secretary had with several well-known figures to drum up support for the PRI candidate. I have no way of knowing whether these documents constitute sufficient evidence to bring the accused before a criminal court, but what is clear is that broad segments of public opinion have enough evidence to believe that Mr. Hank is indeed guilty of the charge. Naturally I do not claim that what counts in the press will also count before the public prosecutor, much less before a judge. But I do not find it acceptable either that the Attorney General's Office should dispense with the matter by simply shelving it, inasmuch as there are sound legal and political reasons why this matter ought to be treated seriously. Legally speaking, the Attorney General's Office ought to take up the matter and rule whether there are sufficient grounds to bring criminal action against the accused individuals or against whoever may turn out to be responsible. In that case, the consequences would not be at all minor, because the law describes the crime quite clearly and provides for a fine of between "200 and 400 days pay and one to nine years in prison." This harsh law puts all of the people involved to a severe test. I am sure that Carlos Hank is not at all afraid of the fine, but I do think that the prospect of a year in jail bothers him. And in this instance the judge cannot opt for the easy way out because the law says that the penalty consists of a fine and jail time. To make things worse, the final section of Article 407 of the Penal Code itself says that "release on bail shall not apply in the case of this crime." The political pressure will be mostly on Attorney General Diego Valades, of course, but it could extend to electoral authorities as well, especially the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), because although it does not have specific authority to conduct the corresponding criminal investigation, it does have a political and legal interest in the case. Article 82 (Section "v") of the current election law says that the General Council of the IFE has the power "to ask the General Executive Board to investigate, with the means at its disposal, incidents that significantly affect the rights of political parties or the electoral process." The case at hand obviously affects the electoral process because a high-level official of the federal government has been implicated in the commission of an electoral crime. As a result of this law, we can expect a loud debate on the matter during the next session of the General Council of the IFE; this could well be the last session of the current council or it could mark the debut of the new one, which has already been constituted by its new members, who will apparently take charge of the final stages of the electoral process. Moreover, the crime of which Carlos Hank is accused also affects the delicate political negotiations that have been taking place over the past few months. If the authorities do not offer a convincing response to the charges that have been filed and if they do not proceed fairly, they will be proving right those who accuse the government of being unwilling to organize a clean election. The opposition's reaction is understandable, since the crime involved is not a minor one. The offense does not consist of the improper use of a few faxes or of a few hours of the highly valuable time of senior officials and civil servants to whom taxpayers pay splendid salaries. The offense does not even consist of the huge cost of inserting the document of support in the press, if it was in fact paid for with public funds. The offense, if it is proved to exist, would consist of the violation of a criminal law by a senior government official. It would also consist of a flagrant violation of the government's repeated promises to hold clean elections. In this regard, it jeopardizes the country's political stability. So then, it is an offense against the opposition parties in particular and against society in general, especially at a time like this when a failed election would be a disaster of enormous consequences for the country. It would be even worse if these already severe offenses were compounded by impunity. The potential political advantage of appeasing a justifiably annoyed opposition should not prompt us to convict the defendants before a serious investigation and, if appropriate, a fair trial. It is very wrong to use scapegoats. Likewise, however, we must not acquit the defendants without conducting the investigation that justice demands and without proceeding to the appropriate trial, inasmuch as the privileges of powerful, untouchable officials and authoritarian impunity are also very wrong. Therefore, the attorney general must take legal action in response to a serious charge. Therefore, Carlos Hank Gonzalez and his private secretary must answer this serious charge legally and politically.
