Three versions of the petroleum benzin-refining process were studied: 1) catalytic enrichment; 2) removal of the 70�C-90�C benzene fraction from the petroleum benzin for subsequent enrichment; and 3) removal of the benzene fraction for petrochemical purposes, removal of the low-boiling through 70�C (l.b.-70�C) fraction for subsequent etherification by C[.sub]1[/]-C[.sub]3[/] monohydric alcohols, and removal of the 70�C through catalytic cracking (70�C-c.c.) fraction for catalytic enrichment and subsequent mixing with the l.b.-70�C fraction after etherification. The catalytic enrichment was conducted on a consolidated laboratory unit with a fluidized bed of zeolite-containing catalyst such as Tseokar-2 at a temperature of 100-120�C and pressure of 2.5-3 MPa. When petroleum benzin was subjected to catalytic enrichment under stringent conditions (i.e., at 520�C), a yield of gasoline with an octane number of 85 according to the motor method (98 according to the research method) of 82.9 percent was achieved; however, the said gasoline had a high aromatic hydrocarbon content (49.2 percent). Under less stringent conditions (i.e., at 480�C), the gasoline yield increased to 87.2 percent and the content of aromatic hydrocarbons dropped to 37.2 percent (the said gasoline had an octane number of up to 83.5 according to the motor method and 94.5 according to the research method). Catalytic enrichment of petroleum benzin without the 70-90�C fraction resulted in an 84.8 percent yield of gasoline with an octane number of 85 (motor method) and with an aromatic hydrocarbon content of 39 percent. The third version of the process resulted in a 5 percent increase in gasoline yield. The said gasoline had a reduced aromatic hydrocarbon content and an oxygen-containing compound content of 2.5-2.6 percent. In addition to boosting aromatic hydrocarbon production efficiency, the new process flow also eliminates a number of the problems involved in producing high-octane fuels.
