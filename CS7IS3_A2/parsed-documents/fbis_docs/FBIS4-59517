The north, rejecting a southern ceasefire plan, said troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih also captured the town of Musaymir, northwest of the south's stronghold of Aden. The south had suffered "heavy losses." In al-Dali', 90 kilometres (55 miles) down the road from the port city, northern forces were mopping up the last pockets of resistance and making further advances, Sanaa said. Southern military officials said their warplanes were mounting raid after raid on the al-Dali' region, where correspondents saw seven northern soldiers dead on the side of the road, just five kilometres (three miles) from the village. On Friday, the mountain village itself was almost deserted apart from southern soldiers, they said. Hundreds of residents have fled to Aden. The two sides have not issued a casualty toll since the war erupted on May 5, although the north said Monday that 74 of its troops had been killed and more than 200 wounded. A Scud missile Wednesday on Sanaa claimed 25 more lives. Clashes were also taking place in the Abyan region, east of Aden, but fighting had eased in Kharaz, on the coast 120 kilometres (75 miles) to the west of the city. The south has said the war between Salih's troops and the forces of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, was being waged on five fronts. On the diplomatic front, an Arab League delegation has been here since Thursday waiting to see the president and deliver a call from the League's secretary general, Esmat Abdel Meguid, for an immediate ceasefire. A northern spokesman in Sanaa said the meeting was finally likely to take place on Saturday. But a source at the organisation's Cairo headquarters said the League was not expected to make any headway because both the south and north had toughened their positions. The ruler of Bahrain, Amir 'Isa Bin-Sulayman Al Khalifah, Saturday joined the ceasefire calls and urged Yemen's rival leaders "to allow reason to prevail." [passage omitted on previously reported cease-fire proposal] In the latest evacuation of foreigners, more than 200 nationals of the former Soviet Union arrived Saturday in Moscow on a flight out of Moscow, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS said. The Philippines foreign ministry said at least 619 Filipinos, including 40 children and six pregnant women, were still waiting evacuation from Yemen.
