The launch of the frigate, baptized Mop-1, took place at 0300 and was attended only by a Taiwan delegation. According to the port authorities, this launch was done at night for "technical reasons." In reality, however, the French Government always has been reticent about this 14-billion-franc [Fr] naval contract known under the codename "Bravo," and it only very reluctantly admitted to the existence of a second contract with Taipei for 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft (Fr30 billion). The Mop-1 frigate then was moved to a Lorient-Keroman port dock for further arming. The Taiwan vessels will be equipped with French equipment and arms systems, contrary to what government circles had said at the time when the French press disclosed the contract. The second vessel, Mop-2, is scheduled to be launched in September.
