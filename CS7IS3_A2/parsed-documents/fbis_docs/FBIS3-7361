As a pro-Japanese stooge, his every move made during the junket was consistent with begging, asking, and traitorous acts from first to last. What cannot go unnoticed before anything else is the fact that traitor Kim Yong-sam, in the meeting with Japanese Premier Hosokawa, plotted joint countermeasures and asked Japan to join in possible UN sanctions pn us by finding fault with our fictitious nuclear issue. This vividly shows that his junket to Japan was a total antinational junket aimed at harming his fellow countrymen in collaboration with the outside forces. As everyone knows, our nuclear issue is a by-product of schemes and conspiracies hatched by the imperialist reactionaries who aim at crushing [apsal] our republic. The U.S. imperialists totally overturned the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New York contact and massively deployed its aggression troops on the Korean peninsula and its surrounding region, thus driving the situation to the brink of war. This is also aimed at realizing such a goal. If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula as intended by the United States and its stooge South Korea, the entire land will suffer the nuclear holocaust. If the Kim Yong-sam clique had the slightest national conscience and wants peace and reunification, it should have rebuffed the imperialist reactionaries' maneuvers instead of banding together with them who try to harm the fellow countrymen. However, instead, he led the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war with the outside forces and did not stop there. He even begged the Japanese reactionaries to take part in joint countermeasures and sanctions, and thus attempted to do something against us. What a vicious traitor the rascal [nom] is! Traitor Kim Yong-sam, during his junket, raved about economic cooperation by enumerating on the rectification of the trade imbalance, the settlement of the industrial gap, and so forth. This, too, cannot be go unnoticed. The South Korean economy is a colonial subordinate economy and is a fragile economy which cannot be sustained even for a minute without U.S. and Japanese equipments, facilities, capital, and technologies. The puppets have been babbling all along that they will reduce their trade deficit with Japan. However, because of their weak economy, rather than reducing the trade deficit, it has been increasing every year. The Kim Yong-sam ring agreed to expand investment, open up the construction market, and allow Japan's small and medium-sized businesses to advance into South Korea. This will only result in further intensifying Japan's political and economic domination and subordination against South Korea. Moreover, what cannot be tolerated is that as a single remark of reflecting on the past, Japan's emperor and prime minister tried to speak ambiguously of the crimes of the Japanese imperialists' aggression on Korea and barbarous colonial rule which lasted for almost half a century, and in this connection, Kim Yong-sam said that the past must no longer restrain the future and babbled about establishing a new South Korea-Japan relation. During the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule which lasted for some 40 years, the calamities and sufferings which the Japanese imperialists inflicted upon the Korean people are truly innumerably tremendous. This criminal history cannot by any means be erased with the single remark of making a reflection. When viewing the issue of comfort women, the Japanese imperialists committed a sin against God and man by forcibly dragging in some 200,000 Korean women to carry out all kinds of atrocities and even took their lives. Its truth must be thoroughly explained and this issue can be resolved only when appropriate compensation is made. Therefore, the South Korean people waged demonstrations right before the puppet traitor's junket to Japan and urged that Kim Yong-sam wholly reveal Japan's crimes and strongly demand compensation from Japan. However, traitor Kim Yong-sam did not even open his mouth on this matter. Nevertheless, because of the single remark on making a reflection, he said that he highly assesses this, that the past must not restrain the future, and so on. Thus, he made the crimes committed by the past Japanese imperialists' into white paper. How is this different from the Ulsa-5 Treaty? As a result, traitor Kim Yong-sam's junket to Japan was a nation-selling junket to tarnish the nation's dignity and sell the nation's interest. Therefore, the rascal once again revealed his true nature as an ugly flunkeyist nation-seller currying favor with outside forces without knowing shame or honor if it is for his personal idleness and to maintain power. The criminal conspiracy between the South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries runs counter to the cause of peace and will only result in all the more aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula. All the Korean people will absolutely not forgive traitor Kim Yong-sam who is all the more running toward confrontation and division by visiting outside forces.
