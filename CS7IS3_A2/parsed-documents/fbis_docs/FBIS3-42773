Production is declining, inflation is on the rise, ethnic conflicts are raging on Russia's periphery, and conservatives have come to power in the Russian Government. Tell me, how do you see Russia's immediate future? [Rybkin] I would call myself a cautious optimist. Yes, of course, the crisis is all-encompassing, and it will not be easy to overcome it, but it seems to me that we have reached a point where people have begun to understand not only down below but also here, in the upper echelons of power, that a creative principle and national accord are more important than anything else. This is the main source of my optimism. The most important thing that distinguishes the present government and parliament from those that existed before October of last year is that they are prepared and have already begun to work together. This has always been difficult, but today the absolute majority of those who have left the government at various times are working in the State Duma and the Federation Council. They or people with similar convictions are working today in key posts of committees and commissions of parliament. Leaders of the Duma and the government have just prepared a consolidated report on the condition of the country's economy. In the next few days it will be submitted for parliamentary hearings. [Makarov] I am very much afraid that words about working together, although they sound very nice, will end up as meaningless noise. The government, without asking anyone, has already allotted a trillion for agriculture. You and I are well aware that this money will immediately end up on the stock market, because you cannot obtain from the land such gigantic profits as you can on the stock market playing the game with the rise of the exchange rate of the dollar. The money simply will not make its way to the peasants, and the Russian economy will follow the path of the Ukrainian. [Rybkin] Your misgivings are quite justified. We must not turn Russia into a universal social security department.... [Makarov] But what if the government does this without your permission? [Rybkin] The Duma has a powerful means of control--the budget. Gathered together in the budget committee are the most powerful economists and financial experts, who belong to various factions--M. Zadornov, A. Pochinok, G. Kulik. Like many of my colleagues, I am categorically against thoughtlessly pumping money into the economy, and therefore the budget will be fairly austere. The budget is the law for the government, and in order to monitor it an Accounting Chamber has been created, in which 530 people will be working. In the near future Duma organs will be able through their own committees to monitor the granting of credit precisely for the final result. [Makarov] According to the Constitution, you have to give your consent for the appointment of a prime minister. But for Chernomyrdin the consent was given by the Congress of People's Deputies, and for some reason they did not ask for your consent, even though almost the entire government changed. [Rybkin] It was explained to us that this was a reorganization, and not a change of the cabinet. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We must wait until 18 February, when the president delivers his message in the Duma. [Makarov] I am afraid that even having control over the government will not do much. The power is gradually making its way to the bureaucrats, who are answerable neither to the parliament nor to the government. [Rybkin] It only seems that way. I am convinced that the power is indeed trickling away. But not from the government into the presidential structures, but from the center to the regions. And thank God. But we need a clear-cut delimitation: What part of the authority should go to the regions so that they will eat better and not suffer from indigestion, and what should remain at the federal level. This has not been done so far. Additionally, all three branches of power must be clearly separated: Who should be in charge of what. A bureaucrat who has gotten out of control is transformed into a power in his own right. We have the advantage over the other power structures that our discussion of candidates for any post is public. We form public opinion. And the further we go, the more strongly its voice will be heard. Today, perhaps, a person who has no use for the parliament will achieve local success, but ultimately he will meet with defeat, immense and all-destroying. It is no accident that promising young politicians have gone to the Duma.... [Makarov] They are preparing a place in case Chernomyrdin does not accept them into the government. [Rybkin] Not only that, but there is undoubtedly an element of horse sense here. Just look at what kinds of people have gathered here! They are highly intelligent and purposeful. They are vitally interested in raising the status of the Duma. [Makarov] You have said that bureaucrats must be under control, but the Federation Council is made up of provincial bureaucrats in the absolute sense. How can they be controlled locally if the Federation Council is the supreme power in the country? That would be the worst version of the Supreme Soviet. [Rybkin] I will not deny that I am apprehensive about this. But I will say something else too. Be that as it may, all of them have passed through the filter of the elections. That was not easy. Along with leaders of the regions, there are also people who hold insignificant positions or no positions at all. And still their high potential for reform was observed in the elections. And you know that in any assembly at least 10 percent of the people are the most powerful irritant. And in the Federation Council there are plenty of these irritants on both the left and the right. It will not be easy for a bureaucrat to remain a bureaucrat there. He will have to think on the scale of the state. [Makarov] Ivan Petrovich, the Army is causing a very great deal of uneasiness. With relatively small salaries, they still are not paid for several months at a time. Someone in the Russian leadership is persistently playing with fire. Can you make an official statement regarding this? [Rybkin] I am very familiar with this problem; my brothers are serving in the Army. At the session of the State Duma on 4 February, we heard a promise from the finance minister and chairman of the Central Bank to immediately rectify the situation that was created. I personally will monitor its implementation. [Makarov] Have you met with the president since you were elected to the post of chairman of the State Duma? [Rybkin] Three times. One meeting was during our trip to St. Petersburg for the 50th anniversary of the breaking of the blockade, and we took two business trips. I have had a detailed exchange of opinions with the president regarding the entire range of issues we have just discussed. Ultimately, we arrived at the conviction that we have similar views regarding many issues. [Makarov] Tell me, cross your heart, do you still consider yourself a communist? [Rybkin] Well, what is a communist? In 1918, when we adopted the new name for the party, it was a time of militant communism. Then everything really was shared equally, in a communist way, in both the country and the city. In a state of euphoria over the civil war, we departed from social democracy. During the years of the NEP [New Economic Policy] we returned to it again, but later we tried to prolong the condition of military communism again. And we experienced severe disturbances because of this. Things are now such that we must get away from all nicknames and titles as quickly as possible and not look back. Someone put it well: We are walking backwards, and it is very dangerous that way. People who call themselves members of the Russian Communist Party today are hardly communists in essence. After all, they have included in their program a diversity of forms of management and their equality under the law. Today in the Duma there are entrepreneurs and bankers in the communist faction. In the agrarian faction there are farmers, bankers, lawyers, economists, and even anticommunists. Actually, many of the former labels are simply obsolete.
