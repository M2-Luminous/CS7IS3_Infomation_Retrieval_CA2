The news media of Azerbaijan, skillfully stirring up interest in them, have been creating, not unsuccessfully, in the person of the mujahidin the heroic image of fighters for the faith and professional warriors. However, for a long time we were unable to find out what the mujahidin actually represent. Various gossip and rumors from Karabakh were highly contradictory, and it was difficult ascertaining anything specific. Altogether recently the Karabakhers succeeded in capturing near Fizuli a mujahidin whose evidence has thrown a good deal of light on the situation. Bakhtior Verbollakh Baberzai, commander of a "twenty" (20 men), was born in 1974, is from the Rashiddustan tribe, lived in the city of Mazar-e Sharif in the north of Afghanistan, and had left behind at home a mother and sister. During a bout of artillery shelling he was wounded in the eye and arm. Our doctors had to work very hard to get him back on his feet. What, for all that, has brought the mujahidin to Azerbaijan: Muslim solidarity or a chance to make some money? The prisoner confessed that all the talk about fighting for the faith and against the infidel is merely an attempt to conceal the real reason for the appearance of the mujahidin in the zone of the Karabakh conflict. They were all promised generous compensation. Each warrior was promised approximately $5,000 a month. Even before arriving in Azerbaijan, each Afghan was paid an advance of 50,000 toman. They were then taken to Beylagan, where the first disappointment awaited them. They were arrested in the city by a military patrol and were sent to prison, where they were treated none too kindly and, in addition, had all their money taken from them. Baberzai received his baptism of fire near Goradiz, which is where they are positioned still. The talk about several thousand mujahidin is correct as far as it goes since there are at the front one [line missing] 200 or 300 men. They fight according to this schedule: One day a week they are at the front, the remaining days are time off. The mujahidin are allowed to go in their time off to Baku and Mingechaur. A special flight takes those wishing to spend their time off at home in Afghanistan. All problems arising with the mujahidin are resolved by their compatriot, one Vaidallakh, who is to be found in Baku and who is their official representative. The prisoner was the commander of a "twenty." Of the 20 men, 15 were Afghans, five, Azerbaijanis, whom, Baberzai maintains, they killed themselves. Relations with the Azerbaijanis did not amount to much right from the start, and all contacts with them were reduced to a minimum. "Money and drugs--that's what [line missing] the prisoner, maintaining that the Azerbaijanis remember them only when they want to obtain narcotics. The drugs trade is highly profitable, he says, and the income from it is frequently higher than the compensation promised by the Government of Azerbaijan for military services. Concerning habitation and sustenance, the prisoner confirmed that they eat and live separately, since their coreligionists "live like the impious." Medical services are organized in Beylagan, where the wounded and sick mujahidin are treated. Despite the promises of the authorities, not all return home, it is true. Lest they attract the discontent and anger of the relatives of the deceased and also to conceal the true picture of losses among the Afghans the Government of Azerbaijan does not send all the deceased home. Many of them have found eternal refuge on Azerbaijani soil. As far as the rumors concerning clashes with Russians are concerned, the prisoner admitted that his group had not encountered them personally. But clashes between the mujahidin themselves, the supporters of various groupings and parties, occur very often, which is causing the authorities of Azerbaijan a great deal of trouble. The prisoner is, despite it all, optimistic. He acknowledged that he misses his mother and sister very much and hopes, with Allah's help, for a safe return home.
