The signing ceremony opens a two-day EU summit at which the 12-nation bloc will also formally sign up new members Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden -- its first enlargement since Spain and Portugal entered in 1986. Speaking on his arrival at this Mediterranean island on Thursday, Yeltsin thanked the EU for leading the way in "ending the discrimination" traditionally accorded to Russia. He said Moscow and Brussels were becoming "equal partners." The agreement will greatly increase Russian trade access to the EU, open up the prospect of a Russia-EU free trade zone after 1998 and provide for wide-ranging political dialogue. It is the latest in a flurry of initiatives to bolster reform in Russia by binding it more closely to western political, economic and military institutions. Two weeks ago Russia signed a cooperation agreement with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On Wednesday it joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's partnership for peace programme of military cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet bloc. And next month Yeltsin will join in political consultations of the G-7 group of industrialised nations -- the United States, Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- at a summit in Naples, Italy.
