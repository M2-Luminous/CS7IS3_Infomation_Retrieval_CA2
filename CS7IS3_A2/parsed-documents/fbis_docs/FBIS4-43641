The Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of Europe (UNICE) said the way to economic recovery lay through lowering the burden due to the state, improving labour flexibility and boosting small business. "There can no longer be any question of imposing more charges on businessmen. They are sinking. They are no longer competitive," UNICE president Francois Perigot said. He presented a UNICE report entitled "Making Europe More Competitive" which said that businessmen needed to wean themselves away from state aid and that EU governments should not depend on business to fund swollen welfare programmes. The report called for deregulation and privatisation of such government sectors as posts and telecommunications, energy and transport, plus a more efficient public sector and more open public procurement tenders. It urged stricter conditions for unemployment, health and other welfare handouts, along with a lower minimum wage, fewer restrictions on dismissing workers, and pay rises pegged to productivity. Perigot rejected suggestions that governments should fund welfare programmes from an energy tax. "For 30 years we have been continually expanding the sources of (government) revenue without ever attacking spending," he told a press conference. UNICE's call came four days ahead of an EU leadership summit on Friday and Saturday which will look for ways to cut unemployment and boost Europe's declinin competitiveness against the United States and Asia.
