These elections, which are the result of struggle, sufferings, and sacrifices, has put an end to apartheid which had turned racial discrimination into a system of government. These elections represent an important link on the path to national reconciliation and the advent of a united, non-racial, and democratic South Africa. These elections also constitute an obvious achievement for the stability, solidarity, and cooperation in the southern subregion of the continent, and at the same time open new prospects for cooperation between South Africa and the rest of Africa. Mali is happy about the advent of majority rule and pays tribute to all the pioneers of the struggle against apartheid who made enormous sacrifices for the principle of one man one vote to prevail. Mali hails the great work accomplished by the South African people to make this day a reality. It assures them of its friendship [words indistinct]. Finally, Mali considers that nothing should henceforth oppose the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of South Africa and the Republic of Mali.
