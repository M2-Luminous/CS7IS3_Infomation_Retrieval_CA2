Kinkel stressed today in Bonn that during yesterday's EU discussions in Brussels on the war in Bosnia, he was again forced to experience what it meant to have to refer to German constitutional reality in this situation. Therefore, the SPD had to give up its "blockade" and agree to an appropriate amendment to the Basic Law.
