Now other steps must be taken. For instance, the Chamber of Deputies must also act. I think that the effort that has just been accomplished here is a major one, and I believe that the whole country, following this action, must appreciate it very much. We are almost sure that in the Chamber of Deputies there are some men, some representatives who are more or less responsible, who understand the seriousness of the situation. We therefore hope that good news will also come out of the House of Deputies... If they reject it, they will again create some serious problems in the country, and I believe the population will finally speak its piece. [Reporter Francois] "Will you be willing to accept the post of prime minister if they call on you? [De Ronceray] "If they call on me, I will consult with the party and if the party agrees, then I have no problem." [Francois] Mr. Despeignes, your comments. [Despeignes] When it comes to the Constitution, there is nothing one can do, but I question the implementation and applicability of what has just been done because the parliament is not the only actor in this play. [Francois] The Senate is not the only actor.... [Despeignes] The Senate, the parliament -- it is still the same entity -- let us say they are not the only actors despite the principle of sovereignty in this crisis. [Francois] Do you mean the Army? [Despeignes] There is the Army on one side, there is the international community, and there are the political forces. Perhaps it will be necessary at an appropriate time to reinforce this Article 149 with the vast possibilities offered by Article 111. Because in any case, this is already an ad hoc government. It will therefore be necessary to broaden the operational field of this ad hoc government in order to institutionalize the state, the society, and to organize the nation. [end recording]
