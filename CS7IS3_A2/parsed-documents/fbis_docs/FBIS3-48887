The adverse reaction derived from a sense of alarm about "LDP-SDPJ cooperation," and although it is said to be the biggest urgent task to the Hosokawa government, it ended up exposing disarray within the coalition government parties. But what is attracting attention is the point that the question of opening the rice market is being discussed on the same level as the question of election system reform. The Connection to Reform of the Election System A Komeito executive who was an active leader in smashing the Diet-member league said "the hardline faction opposing opening the rice market is apt to overlap the faction that is opposed to reform of the election system," and there has also arisen in some quarters speculation that "there may be a secret agreement between the LDP and the SDPJ on the question of opening the rice market and crushing reform of the election system." To the Hosokawa cabinet, opening the rice market has become a big task, along with reform of the election system that would introduce in the lower house a system which combines single-seat electoral districts and proportional representation, and the problem of reducing income tax and increasing the consumption tax rate. Whichever one you take, it is a hurdle that could easily prove fatal to the cabinet, depending on how it is dealt with. The opening of the rice market and election-system reform, in particular, have been spoken of as being linked, as in, for example, "it is a means for the conservative parties, which want to ease the problem of economic friction with the United States, to shift their base of support from the agriculture sector to the urban sector; former prime minister Nakasone's `86 system' can be ranked as something on the same line." It has become clear that, in regard to the question of opening the rice market, which has become the focal point of the new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round), Japan and the United States have secretly reached agreement on a policy in which the Japanese Government would establish a six-year grace period and accept tariffication of rice. It is said that during the grace period there would be a course of Japan accepting minimum access (minimum volume of imports), and that the volume of imports would be adjusted between a minimum of 3 percent of domestic consumption to a maximum of 8 percent. The Japanese Government is denying this. There is also a policy agreement of the coalition governing parties to the effect that "we oppose opening the rice market by tariffication," so it seems that they will not be able to shift all that easily, but it is certain that the question of opening the rice market is about to reach the crucial point. There is also the view that agreement will be reached between Japan and the United States in the not-too-distant future. Concerning this plan to "accept tariffication of rice after six years," Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Ichiro Ozawa said in mid-October, "It is probably not saying that Japan will tariff rice right away. It does not contradict to that extent the policy agreement among the coalition government parties; if the government explains it properly, the government parties may also be able to understand." Even looking at the results of recent public opinion polls, opposition to opening the rice market has been declining gradually. According to a MAINICHI SHIMBUN poll, opposition to opening the rice market continues to decline, with 45 percent in December 1988, 36 percent in April 1990, 33 percent in December 1990, and 27 percent in December 1991; conversely, opinion for partial opening has risen. The opinion for partial opening of the rice market is becoming a great ground swell. The "League of Diet Members Opposed to Tariffication of Rice," which was centered on the LDP and the SDPJ, was created in response to this kind of movement and climate, with a nucleus of so-called rice Dietmen such as lower house member Shizuka Kamei in the LDP and lower house member Takeshi Takeuchi in the SDPJ. Komeito and others attacked at a meeting of the Board of Governors of the coalition government parties which was held immediately before the league was to be formed, because of their judgment that they did not want to leave live embers within the coalition government parties because of the problem of opening the rice market, and because there was a danger that opposition to tariffication of rice would link with opposition to a system that combined single-seat election districts with proportional representation, because the number of urban-sector Diet members would increase more than those of the agriculture sector if such a system were introduced. At the time of the LDP's Toshiki Kaifu cabinet, agricultural organizations reacted against a system that combined single-seat election districts and proportional representation, saying that opening the rice market and a system that combined single-seat election districts with proportional representation would lead to neglecting and abandoning agriculture; it is related to this like the reverse side of a coin. As Professor Michitoshi Takabatake of Rikkyo University said at the time, "on this occasion financial circles calculated that it would be more desirable if a conservative government could be maintained, even if it reduced at one stroke the influence of the agriculture-sector Diet members and cut off from the LDP agriculture Diet members who are resolutely opposing opening the rice market, so it would not be at all strange if the core of the LDP thought so," a system which combines single-seat election districts with proportional representation has become a device that will increase the number of urban-sector Diet members much more than that of agriculture-sector Diet members. The Agriculture Faction Will Be Ruined by Single-Seat Election Districts We investigated to see how the number of Diet members for the four large metropolitan areas (the nine urban and nonurban prefectures of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, Aichi, Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, and Fukuoka) and for the other prefectures would change compared with the present because of the current government plan for a system that combines single-seat election districts and proportional representation. In contrast to the fact that, for the current system of midsized election districts, the number of Diet members for the four large metropolitan areas is 203, 39.8 percent of all Diet members, if it became a system that combined single-seat election districts with proportional representation, their share of the single-seat election district portion (250) would be 180, 43.2 percent of the whole. As to the remaining 250 seats of the proportional representation portion, executive committees have strong power in deciding on candidates, so it would probably be very difficult for candidates who represent the provinces or farm villages to run, so it is also conceivable that the number of Diet members who are supported by provinces and farm villages might decline still further. It would be an extreme case, but if all proportional representatives were to be Diet members who were not from the provinces or from farm villages, the number of Diet members for provinces and farm villages outside the four large metropolitan areas, who accounted for 60.2 percent under the current system of medium election districts, would decline drastically to 28.4 percent. On the other hand, when we compare the proportion of the entire complement of Diet members under the current system for the 47 urban and nonurban prefectures, and which would be accounted for under the single-seat election districts of the government plan, there are 25 urban and nonurban prefectures in which the proportion of the complement would decline. In the Tohoku region the proportion would decline in every prefecture except Miyagi Prefecture. In the Chubu region, it is Yamanashi, Nagano, and Gifu. In the Shikoku region, it is every prefecture except Kagawa, and so on. Prefectures with a high proportion of agriculture are overwhelmingly numerous. Even judging from this, clearly the influence of Diet members who are supported by the provinces and farm villages would decline, and that of urban Diet members would rise. The reorganization of political circles which made possible establishment of a non-LDP coalition government is about to move from Act I to Act II. All sorts of unions and alliances have been developed on the premise of introducing a system combining single-seat districts and proportional representation. It will probably continue on to Act III and Act IV. It is judged that, in such a case, an "urban-type conservative party" will become a single cohesive entity. Shinseito and Komeito have, since early on, shown a posture of approving partial opening of the rice market. It seems likely that the non-LDP coalition government parties will select future development as, basically, an urban-type political party. As might be expected, what attracts attention in this case is the SDPJ. As to whether it is indicating development as an "urban-type political party," such certainly not the case. As is shown by the fact that former Executive Committee chairperson Sadao Yamahana was the only one of that party elected by Tokyo in the July lower house election, in recent times the SDPJ has a strong tinge of a rural party. It is a political party whose actions are difficult to anticipate.
