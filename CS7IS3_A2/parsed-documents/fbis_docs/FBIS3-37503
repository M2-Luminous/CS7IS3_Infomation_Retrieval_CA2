Commenting on this situation in a telephone interview with the news service, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed the opinion that there will not be any bombardment of Sarajevo. He believes that, after the decision made by the Bosnian Serbs, the problem of an ultimatum has been completely removed and that after Sarajevo is unblocked it will be necessary to take prompt measures to secure positive results. To accomplish this, the Security Council should establish a UN administrative authority in Sarajevo, take measures to strengthen safety in other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and resume talks in Geneva. Touching on the reason Russia has been accused of holding a clearly-expressed pro-Serbian position, the Russian deputy foreign minister noted that, given many countries' unambiguous anti-Serbian position, Russia's position helped preserve the balance and provide equal rights to the participants in the conflict.
