In these assemblies, everyone has the opportunity to give his opinion on different aspects of our economy and finances. Juan Bautista, a worker at this factory, answered questions asked by our reporter, Roberto Cavada. [Cavada] One of the topics that came up in this assembly, which has been called the Workers Parliament, today here in the Miguel Fernandez Tobacco Factory was the issue of whether money of dubious origin, accumulated in great quantities by small sectors of the population, should be confiscated. I was very interested in the opinion that Juan Bautista expressed to the rest of his comrades and I have asked him to express that opinion for the rest of the Cuban people. What is your opinion, Juan? [Bautista] We believe that this money of dubious origin should be confiscated, especially since the money was obtained illegally and by exploiting the needs of the workers due to the situation that the country is currently facing. [Cavada] How would you determine who obtained it through dubious means and who obtained it through legal means and hard work? [Bautista] This is simple. No worker can have 200,000 pesos stashed in the bank or in his home. [Cavada] Another of the questions that was asked today in your factory and which was debated by the workers concerned the price policy [politica de precio] that the country should follow. What is your opinion? [Bautista] Marx established that the principle of socialistic distribution was not entirely fair but that it was the only principle realistically applicable to socialism. In other words, everyone should contribute according to his capacity and receive according to his work. The price policy would fulfill this principle of distribution that applies and should apply in socialism. Each person should contribute to society according to his capacity and should receive according to his work. This principle should allow him to have access to determined products that could be offered. [Cavada] Juan, in a nutshell, as an old tobacco worker, how do you think the state can confront the excess of currency and restructure the economy? [Bautista] I believe the way to confront the excess of currency is by increasing production. At the moment, we must take steps to overcome the situation; in other words, find an equilibrium between the amount of currency and the amount of goods available. The definite solution to this problem is to increase production and the efficiency of our enterprises. I believe one of the topics that was analyzed at the assembly was subsidies to the enterprises. I believe inefficient enterprises should not be subsidized. I believe every enterprise director, together with the labor union and the rest of the organizations, should find the way for those enterprises to become efficient. [Cavada] That is the opinion of Cuban workers. This is the case of Juan Bautista, an longtime tobacco worker, who continues to produce and give his opinion at the Miguel Fernandez Factory where today began what the Cuban Workers Federation has called the Workers Parliament.
