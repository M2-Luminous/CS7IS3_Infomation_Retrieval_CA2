The meeting resolution literally stated the following: "The meeting participants have a critical attitude toward the behavior of `Ittifak' Party Chairman Fauziya Bayramova, who herself continually violates the party charter and personally and singularly resolves questions of excluding unsuitable members from the party ranks, dismissing governing board members, etc. Using the deputy mandate of the RT [Republic of Tatarstan], she has demanded special attention toward herself and special working conditions. Her authoritarian dictate has led to the disintegration of the party and to discord in inter-ethnic relations in the RT." In order to eliminate unrest, the meeting participants adopted the decision "to convene an extraordinary congress of the Tatar Party for National Independence [TPNN] `Irrifak' at the end of March 1994, to be held in the city of Kazan..., and to consider the participants of the said meeting as the organizing committee for convening the above-mentioned extraordinary session of the TPNN `Ittifak' under the chairmanship of F. G. Zaynullina." We must note that this measure was a logical continuation of the conflict between Fauziya Bayramova and her former deputy within the party, Flera Zaynullina. By Ms. Zaynullina's admission, the conflict stems from personal interrelations: "Bayramova always saw in me a political rival. But I do not need anything--just happiness for my people..." However, according to the unanimous opinion of local observers, the real outcome of this conflict may only be the split of "Ittifak" into two parties. Parties which differ (like many others) not in their views, but in the names of their leaders. We might add that in Tatarstan, according to approximate accounts, there are more than 20 registered and unregistered, small and very small parties and societies of nationalistic persuasion. The conflict between the radical and moderate wings of the All-Tatar Community Center (VTOTs)--the largest political organization in Tatarstan which has given rise to almost all the parties of nationalist persuasion--has also not been resolved. And while before we could speak of a national movement, today the split among the Tatar national-patriots is becoming ever more apparent.
