Even now, because of the excessive social costs, the introduction of additional social insurance to be financed through compensation by employers and employees alike is economically unacceptable, they said in a first reaction in Cologne. It will be "fatal for the labor market." Moreover, additional burdens would be shifted onto future generations that will be impossible to bear in view of demographic developments. "Thinking in terms of political prestige rather than economic reason has been the decisive factor," the Federal Association of German Employers Associations said in its first comment on the Bonn resolution. What is particularly disappointing is that, with the agreement on compensation, the firm promise has not been honored to define bindingly in advance the compensation for employers' contributions for the second stage, too. "Since industry and labor in the major economic areas are making a considerable contribution to the protection of Germany as an economic center, these efforts are now being undermined by the state's social policy."
