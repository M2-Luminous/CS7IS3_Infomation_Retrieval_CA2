The president was addressing Pakistanis in New York. The president said the response of foreign investors to the government's incentive package has been very positive. As a result of macroeconomic management, foreign investment in several sectors -- particularly in the sector of power generation -- will increase in the days to come. He said Pakistan's nuclear program is not weapon-oriented. We have taken a conscious decision not to use our nuclear capability for weapon production unless our security is threatened. The president said Pakistan has told the United States that no unilateral solution could be imposed on Pakistan. Any solution to the nonproliferation problem in South Asian region has to be evolved in the regional context. He said Pakistan had proposed in 1974 that the South Asian region be declared a nuclear-free zone. Since then, Pakistan has made six more concrete proposals to achieve nonproliferation in the region, but India has rejected all of them. Under the circumstances, the United States or the world at large could not expect realistically that Pakistan would accept any unilateral obligation.
