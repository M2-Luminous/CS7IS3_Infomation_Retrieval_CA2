FR940830-2-00078 FR940830-2-00047 The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000 1 , a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This RFA, ``Employment Intervention Demonstration Program,'' is related to the objectives set forth in Chapter 6, Mental Health and Mental Disorders, in Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives. 1 Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0; or Summary Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone: 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238). Part II_Target Population, Issue and the Programmatic Goal and Project Requirements and Activities, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date Purpose: The goal of this RFA is the generation of knowledge about effective approaches for enhancing competitive employment for adults with severe mental illnesses through support for the implementation and evaluation of promising employment intervention programs. Applications are being solicited for Demonstration Sites to conduct a multisite, cooperative study of employment interventions to enhance competitive employment. Applications are also being sought for a Coordinating Center to provide overall coordination and data management and to carry out the common protocol which will be developed. Target Population: The population of concern for CSP grants includes individuals 18 years and older with severe mental illnesses (including, but not limited to, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, mood disorders, and severe personality disorders) that substantially interfere with a person's ability to carry out such primary aspects of daily living as self-care, household management, interpersonal relationships, and work or school. Statement of Issue: Rehabilitation is an essential component of care for adults with severe mental illnesses. In order to enhance independent living as fully as possible, rehabilitation services need to include appropriate vocational rehabilitation, which may include: assessment of potential for employment, training, job placement, continuing support, and reasonable accommodations at the work site. In addition to providing remuneration and social contacts, employment may promote improvements in self esteem, independence, community integration, and self-management of illness. People with psychiatric disabilities are the second largest group of applicants for vocational rehabilitation services and have the lowest rate of success. Even with high client motivation and the support of families, rates of employment for this population are very low, ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent. Special attention should be focused on persons from ethnic minority communities who are over-represented in the adult severe mental illness population. With involvement of these community members at each stage of design, implementation and evaluation, culturally competent interventions can be successful. Program Goal: This demonstration program addresses a priority mental health need: competitive employment in integrated settings for adults with severe mental illnesses. Competitive employment is defined as a paid position which is open to anyone and pays at least minimum wages. Employment may include positions in a mental health system as long as the positions are not restricted to adults with diagnoses of severe mental illnesses. On-site and/or off-site long-term supports may be utilized. Because there is a need for systematically bringing together information concerning employment intervention programs, CMHS is initiating this program to determine the effectiveness of interventions. Findings concerning the most effective approaches and the associated direct costs are needed by policy makers and program planners. This program of study is focussed on employment interventions which will lead to competitive employment. The goal of the intervention, which may include vocational training and environmental accommodations, must be competitive employment in mainstream (not sheltered) work environments. Outcome measures may include, but are not limited to, days of paid employment within a specified time interval, level of social and occupational functioning, and consumer and employer satisfaction. 2 Effective employment interventions are an integral part of a community support system and, therefore, are expected to be integrated with other services as appropriate. 2 Technical assistance, provided upon request, will include a review of instruments prepared by Cook, J., Bond, G., Hoffschmidt, S., et al., Assessing Vocational Performance Among Persons with Severe Mental Illness, published by Thresholds National Research and Training Center, Chicago, IL: 1992.
