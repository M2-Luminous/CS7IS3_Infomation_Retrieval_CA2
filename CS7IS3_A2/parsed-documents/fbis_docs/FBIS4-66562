The military and geographical interest is very clear. The Kashmir region joins three countries geographically--Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China [as published]. The only surface route between China and Pakistan is the Karakoram highway which passes through the Northern Areas. This highway was inaugurated in 1978. This is the only route for China to access the Arabian Sea. China has built another road which joins Xinkiang with the western part of Tibet. This road passes the uninhabited region of Aksai Chin which is in the northeast of Ladakh. Although India still claims ownership of Aksai Chin, this has become a part of China and is very important for it from a military perspective because this is the only route between two Chinese provinces. This rough but unbelievably beautiful region is very important for China and Pakistan for military reasons. China and Pakistan will have to depend on the Karakoram highway if there is a war with India to keep lines of communications and transportation between the two countries open. God forbid, but if the whole state of Jammu-Kashmir (which according to the United Nations includes the Northern Areas) is put under UN administration, this very important connection between China and Pakistan will be lost. Neither country would tolerate such a situation. Historically, Gilgit, Nanada, and the Northern Areas including Jammu and Kashmir were considered very important areas between British India and China. The Nanda mountains is especially important for several reasons. In the 18th century, Nihatra had recognized Xinkiang as a tax-collecting power. They paid 15 ounces of gold dust annually to Xinkiang. In exchange they were permitted to use the grazing grounds in the Pamirs and Sikkim. There was no clear and permanent border with Xinkiang. This had become a tributary of Kashmir in the 19th century. Later, the maps of the British era show it as part of the Indian Subcontinent. China is very interested in the Kashmir issue both from geographic and military viewpoints. It appears to be very active in at least two areas--Pakistan-China border issue and the Aksai Chin issue. The first situation was created by the 1963 Pakistan-China border agreement. The document of the agreement was ready by February 1963 and it was formally signed in Beijing on 2 March 1963. At that time, China's borders around Gilgit and Balistan were not settled. One year before May 1962 when the Chinese government started serious discussions over the border with Pakistan, the tension between China and the Soviet Union had already increased. At that time it seemed that Gilgit was a point of contention between China and the Soviet Union. One Indian journalist had written about it in 1964. Control of the whole area from Gilgit to the Pamirs could have proved dangerous to the Soviet Central Asia. Therefore, military interests forced the Soviet Union to support India on the Kashmir issue in order to keep its control on Gilgit. That way the United States could not establish a base against the Soviet Union there. When discussions to determine the border between China and Pakistan started, an area covering 3400 square miles was undecided. China, however, showed unusual flexibility and generosity and Pakistan got 1350 square miles in the final decision which included 750 square miles of area under Chinese control. This agreement gave China 2050 square miles area which was already under its control. In addition, three-fourths of the Godon and Sainka hills area known as K-2 came under Pakistan's control. India was extremely furious at this agreement. It said that Pakistan has no right to such an agreement as this area is part of Jammu and Kashmir state and Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. India also accused Pakistan of illegally occupying the Northern Areas. However, it has been made clear in Article 6 of the Pakistan-China agreement that the disputed character of Jammu and Kashmir should be kept in mind. This is the most important article of the agreement because this means that China must be involved in any future discussions about Jammu and Kashmir. China cannot be kept out. Article 6 of the agreement states: "Both countries agree that after the dispute between India and Pakistan is settled over Kashmir, the ruler of this region will hold talks all over again with the government of China and a new agreement will replace this agreement." China's direct interest in what is happening in Jammu and Kashmir is natural. The great interest of the United States (from behind the UN facade) in Jammu and Kashmir region is enough to make the Beijing government become alert and cautious. The Western power thinks that China is moving very cunningly when asking for new talks over the borders. Similarly, India and China's dispute over Aksai Chin is also the cause of a great interest for China in the Kashmir issue. Aksai Chin is a desert and an unpopulated region in the northeast region of Ladakh. At present it is under China's control. Its importance has increased because China has built a road in this area which unites its two border provinces--Xinkiang and Tibet. India still is adamant that Aksai Chin is a part of Jammu and Kashmir state. The British government in India had sent a proposal to Peking on 14 November 1899. In this note of 1899, the British Prime Minister Sir Claude McDonald had said that the British government of India suggests that keeping in mind the forthcoming problems and uncertainties about the future, the British government desires decisions about the border between China and the British India. Thus, the 1899 note means that Aksai Chin region was accepted as part of China. Some changes occurred in 1905, however. The Aksai Chin region remained within China's Xinkiang province. In 1914, the British government included Aksai Chin in Tibetan maps very quietly. A conference was held in October 1913 between British India and China in Shimla. In this conference, the British government very cleverly expanded the western border of Tibet to prove that Aksai Chin was a part of Tibet. This was done to include Aksai Chin into British India at the right time. However, the Shimla conference failed and the map that was included in this conference does not now have any official status. Independent India all of a sudden showed Aksai Chin region part of India in its maps in 1954. Thus this record was prepared to prove that Aksai Chin was also an integral part of India. Then prime minister of India, the late Nehru, wrote to the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to claim India's ownership of Aksai Chin while erroneously referring to the 1899 agreement. China, however, had completed a road between Xinkiang and Tibet in 1950. This road passed through Aksai Chin. India could not do anything about it except to make the whole affair more complicated. The Survey of India agency published maps of Jammu-Kashmir in 1952 to present them in the United Nations as the Kashmir issue was introduced in the United Nations at that time. These maps showed the Aksai Chin region as part of Jammu-Kashmir so that this become a part of the UN proceedings. This affair is still going on and the Aksai Chin affair is still there. Whenever the Kashmir issue is discussed in the United Nations, the important issue of Aksai Chin will also emerge because it is there on the Indian maps. At that time, China had to oppose it and become a party to this debate. India now claims that China is occupying 12000 square miles of its territory. This includes Aksai Chin and the areas that were given to Pakistan in the 1961 Pakistan-China agreement. This situation is very interesting to our American friends, and unfortunately this is giving them plenty of material to start mischief. However, Pakistan is not unaware of this situation. China and Pakistan have a great responsibility for the people of Kashmir. Both countries have always supported the right of Kashmiri people for self-determination. The Security Council resolutions are for resolving the Kashmir issue. However, India is not moving even an inch, and had adopted an aggressive and belligerent attitude. This has endangered peace in this region. India and Pakistan have almost started a war in Siachen glacier region. India is spending billions of rupees daily in that place. That is why India wants to resolve the Siachen glacier issue separately in order to reduce its expenses there. This issue is related to Kashmir. India had crossed the Line of Control in 1984 and had thus torn the Shimla Agreement to shreds. Therefore, this issue cannot be discussed separately with India. As for the border dispute between China and India, we have already given details about it. The truth is that any region around Jammu and Kashmir cannot be given to any country until the Kashmir issue is resolved. The government of Pakistan should take China into confidence and and tell the international community that this state cannot be divided since it is waiting for a resolution in the Security Council. In our opinion, this is a very important point and deserves immediate attention.
