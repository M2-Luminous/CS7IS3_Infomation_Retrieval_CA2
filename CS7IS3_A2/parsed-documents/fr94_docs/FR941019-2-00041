Take notice that on October 5, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar), 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP95&hyph;8&hyph;000 pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.216(b) of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to abandon a regulator station and appurtenant facilities under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;491&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Questar proposes to abandon and remove their Debenham District Regulator Station (Debenham DRS) and appurtenant facilities located in Summit County, Utah. The Debanham DRS was previously utilized to deliver natural gas to Mountain Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel), an affiliate of Questar. Mountain Fuel has installed and is currently operating a new intermediate high-pressure (IHP) distribution line adjacent to the Debenham DRS, to serve a new residential subdivision and additionally receives natural gas through Questar's DRS WA0388, located west of the Debenham DRS, to serve its remaining customers. Questar states that the Debanham DRS consists of two 3/4-inch taps, approximately 105 feet of 3/4-inch pipeline, a can-type regulator set and appurtenant facilities. Questar further states that the total investment associated with the DRS facilities proposed to be abandoned is $788. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after the Commission has issued this notice, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the allowed time, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA.
