However, the results of implementing the bankruptcy law in the last five to six years have not been satisfactory enough. Some contents of the law are now unsuited to the situation whereby the structure has been changing into the market economy in recent years and different ownership forms are coexisting. It is said that the authorities are now considering a substantial revision of the bankruptcy law. According to incomplete statistics, in the five to six years of implementing the bankruptcy law, only some 1,000 enterprises applied for bankruptcy. A large number of these enterprises were under collective ownership, state-owned enterprises only accounting for a small proportion. In addition to such objective factors as changes in market conditions, the enterprises went bankrupt mainly because of problems in their internal management. For example, their self-control mechanisms were not working; their accounts were not in order; they were short of working funds; their products were of inferior quality; they concealed business losses or incurred losses through lack of experience or being taken in; and they had been running in the red for a long time through poor management and had failed to repay their debts. What has perplexed people is the fact that many state-owned enterprises which were running in the red for a long time, and living solely on state financial subsidies, did not apply for bankruptcy. Reportedly, this year, one-third of several hundred million state-owned enterprises will incur overt business losses [ming kui 2494 5719]; another one-third will incur covert business losses [qian kui 3383 5719]; and only the remaining one-third will show small profits. The mainland department concerned recently investigated some state-owned enterprises which were running in the red in six provinces and reached the conclusion that at least 30 percent of state-owned enterprises should go bankrupt. In fact, the number of enterprises having applied for bankruptcy accounted for just 0.001 percent of the total number of enterprises on the mainland. This shows that the results of the bankruptcy law's enforcement were not satisfactory enough. As a rule in market competition, enterprises having lost their vitality and failing to survive should be eliminated; however, a large number of enterprises which have been running in the red for a long time are now unwilling to apply for bankruptcy and still rely on government subsidies for their continuing existence. This is indeed a big problem. In fact, the implementation of the "PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law" has encountered many difficulties. First, some government departments were worried that, beacuse the social insurance system was not perfect enough, if a large number of enterprises were allowed to go bankrupt then a large number of workers would become jobless and it would be hard to arrange new jobs for them, adding an unstable factor to society. Second, most of the loss-making enterprises were floated by bank loans, so the banks did not want to see that their loans would never be recovered if the enterprises went bankrupt, because, as the banks said: "Bankruptcy will just shift the losses onto the banks." As the money loaned by the banks came mainly from ordinary people's deposits, if a bank also goes bankrupt, society would experience major turmoil. Therefore, the banks would rather see the enterprises indefinitely in arrears with debt payments than having the debtors go bankrupt. Third, the bankruptcy of a large number of enterprises will inevitably bring about a chain reaction because debt chains exist among all enterprises. If one enterprise goes bankrupt, other enterprises with business relations will suffer serious losses. In addition, as some enterprises play a major role in processing local resources, if they go bankrupt the development of local resources will be seriously affected. All this shows that the implementation of the bankruptcy law, especially for state-owned enterprises, is facing mountains of difficulties. However, if the bankruptcy law cannot be implemented smoothly, the situation will be unfavorable to the new round of enterprise property rights reform beginning this year to establish the modern enterprise system and aslo to the further development of the market economy. In order to force more state-owned enterprises which have been running in the red and failing to repay debts go bankrupt as they should do, the authorities are adopting some measures to deal with the difficult points. One of the measure was to set up a system of keeping tens of billions of yuan in reserve funds in the banks to cope with bad debts and make up for the losses caused by enterprise bankruptcies. This year, 7 to 8 billion yuan will be assigned to 15 cities, including Shanghai and Shenyang, to offset bad debts appearing in pilot schemes of enterprise bankruptcy. Another measure was to set up a foundation for workers losing their jobs in enterprise bankruptcies. Each worker will be given about 20,000 yuan as redundancy compensation so that they can pay the living costs while remaining jobless. It is expected that a new breakthrough may be made this year in the number of bankruptcy application cases among loss-making enterprises.
