Nearly a year ago -- on 31 March -- the Seimas [parliament] approved the program of the sixth Lithuanian Government headed by A. Slezevicius. The prime minister noted that his cabinet was the first among the six governments to prepare its program and curb inflation which was 1,162 and 189 percent in 1992 and 1993, respectively. The government will seek that the inflation rate does not exceed 50 percent in 1994 (4.8 and 2.9 percent in January and February). According to A. Slezevicius, the sixth government was the most resolute in liberalizing prices: About 80 percent of all prices are regulated by the market. The government controls only prices for energy, transportation, and communications. However, the key unresolved problems for the current government are mutual debts and settlements of enterprises and organizations, as well as the inefficient collection of taxes and work of the economic police, prevention of contraband, land reform and credits, the construction of the oil terminal and the pumped-storage electric power station in Kruonis, and the drafting of the national transportation program. The prime minister claimed that even though the criminal situation has stabilized, it still remains complicated. Incidentally, the crime rate has dropped by 17 percent over the first two months of this year against the same period of last year, and it is the lowest among all neighboring states.
