The charge: unfair competition. This is a first, and the subject is important because it has legal, economic, social, and cultural implications. Does a commercial company have the right to market hardware and software bearing the name of a big manufacturer if the latter has not expressly agreed and authorized it to do so? What are the duties of a computer service company? Is the approval granted by the Ministry of National Economy not sufficient? The debate is of special interest domestically at the moment, considering that the economy is being privatized, laws regulating the distribution trade are being enacted, and consumer protection is becoming an increasing reality. But also internationally, considering that the GATT agreement has been signed and that it guarantees the protection of industrial, commercial, and cultural property. And using a manufacturer's brand image constitutes encroachment if an agreement has not been reached. It is being noted more and more that the days of the exclusive privileges provided by "protected markets" are past and that there are coming to be fewer and fewer exclusive dealers. IBM has about five authorized dealers, Apple has three, and so on. But the multinationals impose their own distribution policies, "suggested" prices, and marketing methods. How can that be reconciled with the requirements of the Tunisian economy and the interests of the Tunisian end user? The Tunisian market is a small one, but since it is growing rapidly and steadily and because it is liberal and open, it is experiencing sharp competition. That competition is reflected in a proliferation of computer companies, some of which stress the reputation for seriousness and innovation of the big brands that have built their enviable reputations by good performance, to be sure, but also by expensive advertising. Other companies, on the other hand, stress the quality of service and of their customer relations. And last, there are those whose prices are unbeatable--for example, five companies have distinguished themselves in recent months by their "low, low prices" while selling a major brand without authorization from the parent company. The investigation launched by the parent company and the three authorized dealers has revealed the "how" of the operation: the five "pirate" companies were paying low prices for obsolete hardware with outdated technology from regional distributors in Belgium and elsewhere and then selling it in Tunisia at a low price and, especially, with no follow-up: no after-sales service. Their unfair competition has several aspects: use of the Apple-Macintosh logo, in some cases in conjunction with the famous apple design, failure to obtain proper authorization, failure to comply with the prices approved by the manufacturer, and failure to conform to the standard profile established by the manufacturer--that is, failure to guarantee maintenance and to meet installation standards. Since the complaint was filed, the companies in question have disappeared only to reappear under new names. With those findings to back it up, Apple MCI, which is based in Paris and has the exclusive right to distribute hardware and software, decided, in agreement with the three authorized dealers and for the purpose of protecting the brand name and their interests, to file a complaint charging unfair competition. Major manufacturers select their dealers around the world very carefully on the basis of objective criteria arising from the nature of the sector of activity in question and ranging from product design, manufacturing standards, and marketing terms to the constraints inherent in the product's maintenance. In the case of computers, for example, each manufacturer--at least if it is one of the most reputable and popular ones--requires that its local dealer provide a site for displaying the hardware and a certain number of technicians and engineers for handling sales and after-sales service, including a repair facility with a minimum inventory of hardware, software, and spare parts enabling it to honor the guarantee and provide maintenance. To preserve its brand image among its customers, the manufacturer is concerned to provide follow-up service that will not harm its reputation. "Help: prices are dropping" is a slogan that could very well be adopted by computer dealers. The computer industry experienced rapid growth in Tunisia and around the world in the 1980's, but it has spent the past four or five years in a deep crisis that has affected not only the manufacturers (IBM has laid off 50,000 employees) but also the service firms in Europe. The industry is characterized by rapid technological progress--and therefore by the rapid obsolescence of computers already manufactured and poor sales--and by rapidly falling prices, a situation that makes a quick inventory turnover necessary precisely because of the progress being made, with the result that computer dealers find their profit margins being eroded. The consumer's interests are twofold when it comes to computers: he wants moderate prices with easy payment terms on the one hand and, on the other, good-quality service, meaning availability, training for the operating personnel, installation, guarantee, maintenance, advice, and so on. For the computer industry, lower prices are an advantage for the consumer provided that there is no dumping or illicit increase. The lack of service to the consumer remains to be proven. The offense, on the other hand, resides in the absence of after-sales service, which harms the interests of the users. At a time when laws exist to protect the consumer and the ODC [Consumer Protection Office] is preparing to launch a vast awareness campaign in defense of consumer interests and rights, a complaint of this kind is extremely important. It is likely to set a legal precedent for other industries, for which reason the verdict expected on 6 January will attract the attention of all businessmen.
