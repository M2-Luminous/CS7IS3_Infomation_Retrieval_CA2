Some of them are switched to round-the-clock operation. All alimentary products which may carry cholera pathogens, and this extends to both food produced in Moscow and that brought from other regions, will be subjected to rigorous inspection in order to identify the cholera bacillus [sic]. Nikolay Filatov elaborated that ``these measures do not, nevertheless, mean a ban on food imports into the capital.'' In his opinion, the source of cholera infection is most likely located in Moscow and calls upon everyone to observe the rules of personal hygiene more carefully and not to consume unwashed foodstuffs.
