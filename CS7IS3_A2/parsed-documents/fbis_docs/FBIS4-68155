The Maoist group perpetrated its first attack on 17 May 1980, and since then more than 30,000 people have died as a result of political violence. Several explosions last night shook the offices of local banks in the districts of Surquillo, San Martin de Porres, San Juan de Lurigancho, and Brena and in the industrial zone in Lima, wounding at least four people and causing material damage. These attacks follow similar ones that occurred between 4 and 5 May in Villa Militar, in the coastal Lima district of Chorillos, at bank branches and at an office of the public enterprise Electro Lima. Since then security forces have stepped up patrolling in Lima and in the port of Callao, as a preventive measure in case a wave of terrorism takes place on the SL anniversary. The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) has expressed fear that the Maoist group could unleash a wave of attacks and crimes in Lima, ordered by its current leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano." [passage omitted] The SL celebrates its 14th anniversary in the midst of internal divisions, and weakened by the harassment of the Armed Forces, which since 5 April have been conducting a new offensive against the subversive columns in the jungle area of Huanuco Department. The SL's attacks are no longer as fierce as they were before the arrest of its main leader [Abimael Guzman] on 12 September 1992. Political violence has caused 30,215 deaths in Peru since 1980, of which 14,239 are alleged terrorists, 12,932 civilians, and 2,737 member of the security forces, as well as 307 drug traffickers.
