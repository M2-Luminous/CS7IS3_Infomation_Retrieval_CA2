Al-Iryani, whose name has been linked with this war and who is one of its advocates, planners, and enthusiasts, is sparing no effort -- after his artillery war was silenced on different battlefronts by the action of the steadfast people and the heroes from the army of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and its brave soldiers -- to seek new exits and misleading excuses, in view of the predicament in which the Sanaa authorities find themselves, through convoluted and repetitive statements about negotiations with what he calls the moderate group of the YSP. This reflects the misleading style northern leaders have followed in the past concerning stopping the war and saving Yemen from destruction. Instead of responding to calls and patriotic, arab, and international appeals, al-Iryani has proceeded to burn his smelly incense in the holocaust of death imposed on the Yemeni people by him and those like him from among the war advocates. He has been aiming to tear apart the YSP from the first day of the union by base methods. YSP militants and the people are well aware of these methods, which are well known, and which al-Iryani is now using again at this time when the Yemeni people are aspiring for a serious stand on the war, instead of this deceptive misleading style, which carries with it the decision to continue this destructive war. This party, which announced its initiative to stop the war on the first day that the war was touched off by the Sanaa rulers, continues to adhere to its stand, which rejects and [word indistinct] the war [words indistinct] by all standards. [passage indistinct] The responsibility for the political situation brought about by the war must be borne by those who touched it off. The party, with its political, social, patriotic, and popular allies, will face this situation together in the same manner that it rejects the war, which it condemns. It calls for the immediate cessation of this war, the withdrawal of forces, and peaceful negotiations. Those who imposed the war must bear responsibility for it. Those on whom the war has been imposed have no alternative but to defend themselves and their homeland against the arrogance of the war criminals, who are smeared with the blood of the innocent sons of our homeland and great people. God gives us success.
