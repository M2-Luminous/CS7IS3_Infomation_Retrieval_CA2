Assumed as a basis were the recommendations of the international union of electrical communications, which proceeded from the fact of an extremely poorly developed telephone system in the republic, especially in the village. More than 2,500 rural population centers in Uzbekistan do not have a telephone. By the year 2015, the instrument will be in 72 out of each hundred rural families. In cities where fiber-optic communications will be developed, the capacity will grow to 3.3 million numbers, and out of each 100 families, 90 will have apartment telephones. A Transasiatic-European fiber-optic cable line passing through the territory of Uzbekistan will unite China with Western Europe. To satisfy the internal requirements of the mass installation of a telephone system, the republic will require not less than $20 billion, which it generally cannot afford. But, then, in international business, you cannot do without the establishment of joint enterprises and foreign investments. The famous German Siemens and Alkatel firms and the Japanese association for assistance to international cooperation, which unites 216 large companies, have shown a serious interest in Uzbek projects.
