Roundtable participants include Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister; Kozo Watanabe; acting chief secretary of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party); Ryutaro Hashimoto, policy research council chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP); Koken Nosaka, Diet administration committee chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ); and Iwao Nakatani, professor at Hitotsubashi University. The program is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto. The discussion begins with Yamamoto asking Finance Minister Fujii whether Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was referring to a consumption tax hike when he recently said that the government would create a balanced tax system by reviewing income and consumption taxes. After noting that various measures have been discussed to promote tax reform, Fujii says: "His remarks meant that the government will rectify overly heavy reliance on income taxes." He admits that it also means the review of the ratios of direct and indirect taxation. Concerning the government's attempt to draft a concrete tax reform plan during June, Shinseito's Watanabe notes that there are strong hopes for compiling the plan on schedule, while the SDPJ's Nosaka predicts that it will be difficult for the government to draft such plans by the end of June. The LDP's Hashimoto says the government has not exerted efforts to gain public understanding on the planned tax reform. When asked why the government should set a deadline for formulating concrete reform plans, Fujii stresses that the tax reform is being studied as a measure not to implement tax cuts but to cope with the graying of society. He says: "Our goal is to draft concrete plans by the end of June, or if this is impossible, by the end of the year." Professor Nakatani, however, expresses doubts about the effectiveness of a government plan to implement a tax hike and reduction at the same time, and about the necessity of hastily formulating the tax reform plan in time for a Japan-U.S. summit meeting and the Naples summit in July. In this connection, Fujii notes the need for the government to secure financial sources to fund tax cuts, suggesting the simultaneous implementation of a tax hike and reduction. He adds: "The government is considering implementing multi-year -- not single-year -- tax cuts and taking necessary measures to carry out the cuts." Hashimoto criticizes the government for examining only tax reform as a means to cope with the aging of society, saying that the government must view the nation's burden in terms of taxes and social security premiums as a whole. He also chides the government for having raised fees on many public utilities, claiming the increased fees will reduce the effects of tax cuts on the economy. Nosaka stresses that the government should promote tax reform after gaining the people's understanding. Commenting on this, Fujii promises utmost efforts to gain public understanding, saying: "Reform will not be implemented without the support of the general public -- in particular, without the support of Diet members of each political party." Also, referring to Hashimoto's call for reviewing not only the tax burden but also the burden of social security premiums, Fujii says that while taking this into consideration, the government will make efforts to gain the understanding of the people. The roundtable participants then discuss what the government should do to gain popular understanding. Hashimoto asks the government to take enough time to listen to the opinions of the people. Fujii agrees with him, saying it is a matter of course for the government to hear public opinions. Asked about whether the ruling coalition will seek out the opinions of opposition parties in the process of formulating the tax reform plan, Shinseito's Watanabe says: "We will naturally do so. The plan will amount to nothing if it is scrapped in the Diet." Explaining the SDPJ's position on tax reform, Nosaka says: "We think that it is inevitable for the government to first consider increasing the ratio of indirect taxation and establishing a new tax to finance income tax cuts." In answering a question on whether the ruling coalition plans to specify the size and timing of a tax increase in its tax reform plan, Watanabe notes the need for the coalition to seek the support of the LDP and the SDPJ, again saying the plan will amount to nothing unless it is adopted in the Diet. Turning to administrative reform, Nosaka says that although the government is calling on the private sector to promote restructuring, it has to restructure itself as well. Asked if the government can compile effective deregulation measures for administrative reform by the end of June, Fujii, while stressing the importance of administrative reform, says: "Deregulation is very important from an international point of view and in light of the need to transform Japan's economic structure. The government is dealing with deregulation with these points in mind." However, Professor Nakatani questions the effectiveness of deregulation measures currently being studied by the government, saying that with these measures, the government will not be able to open Japanese markets wider and promote deregulation fully enough to satisfy the people and other countries. He points out that if the government can lessen the differences between domestic and overseas prices by promoting deregulation, domestic demand will increase greatly. Fujii agrees with Nakatani, saying that what the latter said is very important. Meanwhile, noting areas in which he believes the government should promote deregulation, Hashimoto urges a review of the country's systems of standardization and validation, referred to as non-tariff barriers by other countries, to meet the expectations of the United States and other nations. He also stresses: "To promote deregulation, it is necessary to strengthen the power of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC). Otherwise, the FTC will not be able to cope with such unfair business practices as dumping." The SDPJ's Nosaka also stresses the importance of deregulation, saying: "While taking into account Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States, the government should promote regulation in such a way that it abolishes unnecessary regulations and maintains necessary ones."
