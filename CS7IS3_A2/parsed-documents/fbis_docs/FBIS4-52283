A senior official at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said that Minister Kim Chol-su is scheduled to leave for Mexico next Sunday and the government is likely to announce its decision on Samsung before he departs. Another official said that as far as he knows, "This problem has already been decided." For the sake of formality rather than anything else, he added, the government is holding discussions with Samsung and the Chamber of Commerce in the southern port of Pusan, where Samsung hopes to build car manufacturing plants. Samsung, one of the country's largest conglomerates, plans to submit for government approval its technology cooperation agreement with Nissan Motor Co. of Japan to produce passenger cars in Korea.
