The appeal reads as follows: The election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine, despite various pessimistic forecasts, took place in the overwhelming majority of the constituencies. This is evidence of the growing political consciousness of the citizens of Ukraine. Their faith makes us, people's deputies of Ukraine, especially responsible before the people. The new Supreme Council is called to make decisive steps that would change the state of affairs for the better, because the situation that took shape in our country is a crisis situation. Taking into account the fact that the new Supreme Council will assume plenary powers in one month's time only, and time is pressing, we appeal to the people of Ukraine and all the people's deputies in this critical moment to estimate the seriousness of the political situation and its possible consequences. We call on the president of Ukraine to suspend, within the framework of his plenary powers, the effect of Article 3 of the Law of Ukraine on the early election of the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the president of Ukraine of 24 September 1993, and the effect of Article 2 of the Supreme Council resolution of 3 February this year on enforcing the Law of Ukraine on the formation of local bodies of power and self-government, until the new Constitution of Ukraine is adopted. We are convinced, says the appeal, that such a step is utterly necessary in the interests of the state and the people of Ukraine. One hundred and twenty people's deputies of Ukraine from 20 oblasts and the Crimea Republic signed the appeal.
