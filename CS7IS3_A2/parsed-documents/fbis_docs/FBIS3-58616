"One does not serve as education minister if one cannot handle a crisis. One should not be a sailor if one is seasick," he said in interview with the radio station Europe 1. Bayrou said he did not think that the leftist-backed demonstration, which drew hundreds of thousands of people from all over France, signaled a resurgence of the leftist opposition, which had seemed demoralized since its defeat at the polls last March. "One should not look at what happened yesterday in strictly political terms," he noted. "We do not want this to become a pretext for playing politics in order to revive a struggling political party or politicians who are responsible for the current state of French schools." He also backed a proposal by Socialist Party Michel Rocard to convene a national forum on education. Organisers said the demonstration drew more than one million, although police set the figure much lower. But the number of participants seemed well in excess of the 350,000 originally expected by organisers. The demonstrators, many of whom arrived aboard dozens of special trains and thousands of buses, waved banners calling for the resignation of Education Minister Francois Bayrou, beat drums, blew whistles and played bagpipes under grey skies and drizzling rain. The protest was called to denounce a reform of the financing of private, mainly Catholic schools, adopted by parliament in December and it drew on France's deeply ingrained anti-clerical tradition on the left. The new legislation was annulled Thursday as inegalitarian by the constitutional court, France's highest constitutional authority.
