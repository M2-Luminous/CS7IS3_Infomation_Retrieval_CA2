The agency put its seal of approval on Fukuoka city's assessment concerning the construction of an artificial island in Hakata Bay, off the Wajiro tideland, clearing the way for the controversial project. The agency nevertheless submitted a statement to the Transport Ministry, making a strong call for the preservation of waterfowl habitat conditions throughout the entire bay, on Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu. The agency's approval paved the way for the ministry's permission for the 460 billion yen project, which is expected later Friday. The ministry plans to call on Fukuoka to prepare for registration of the tideland with the Ramsar Convention to preserve waterfowl and other wildlife. The project, to create a research and housing complex on a 400-hectare tract of reclaimed land, is expected to start at the end of June. The Wajiro tideland is known as a wintering site for many water birds, some of them endangered species. The project has drawn opposition from environmentalists at home and abroad. Besides the preservation of living conditions for waterfowl, the agency also called for keeping the water clean in Hakata Bay and for long-term surveillance of the regional environment for a review of the assessment after five years. Environment Agency Director General Wakako Hironaka said her agency will seek Fukuoka's efforts to acquire the cooperation of local communities to register the entire Hakata Bay with the Ramsar Convention. The Wajiro tideland preserves much more nature than the Yatsu tideland in Chiba Prefecture, which is already registered with the convention, she said. ``I believe the environmental protection in the region can be compatible with the (reclamation) project but I would like to ask for reconsideration if it greatly affects the ecosystem.''
