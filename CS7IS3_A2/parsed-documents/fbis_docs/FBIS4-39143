The group included General Guram Nikolaishvili and General Gia Vashakidze, Georgian deputy defense ministers; and Vladimer Chikonani, the commander of the Georgian interior troops. Jaba Ioseliani, the head of state's representative, led the group. In accordance with the document of 14 May on a cease-fire and the disengagement of forces, the participants in the Moscow talks carried out the precise delineation of the peacekeeping troops' deployment areas and marked these on the map. At the first stage of conflict settlement, peacekeeping forces will enter and take control of an area which is 78 km long, between [placename indistinct] and Ochamchire, and 56 km wide, between Tkvarcheli and (Atskura). Thirty control posts and five checkpoints will be set up and four mobile groups will be deployed throughout this territory. The headquarters of the joint command will be in Sukhumi. The UN representatives who are now working in the area as observers will be attached to the peacekeeping forces deployed in the area. The peacekeeping force will include troops from the Russian Federation's Leningrad, Volga, and Ural military districts. These troops will start entering their areas of deployment from next week. Later, CIS peacekeeping forces will also be introduced. It should be noted that the leaders of almost all CIS countries have supported the decision to deploy peacekeepers. As Vladimer Chikovani pointed out, it is now difficult to speak of the so-called buffer zone any more, since the peacekeeping forces will enter and take control not only of a (?strip) along the Inguri river but also of an area of 2,184 square km around Gali. The area will include such large places as the towns of Gali and Tkvarcheli, and the villages of Zemo Okumi, Kvemo Okumi, Ghumurishi, Saberio, Sabedao, Otobaia, and Achigvara. In answering our correspondent's question about the safety of returning refugees, Mr. Chikovani said that good working conditions have been created for the UNHCR and that the peacekeeping forces are legally entitled and have the ability to control the situation in any settlement in the Gali region. Generals Aleksandr Sokolov, Yuriy Kozlov, and Aleksey Khapin represented Russia in the working group. The Abkhaz delegation included Anri Jergenaia, Ardzinba's personal representative and brother-in-law, as well as Sergey Dabar and Sultan Soslaniyev.
