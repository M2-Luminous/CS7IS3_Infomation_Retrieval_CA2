The new publication is the most systematic and comprehensive military work to date by Mao Zedong. It documents in detail the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA] from next to nothing, its development from a small into a large army, and its outstanding war record; sheds light on the formation, maturation, and development of Mao Zedong's military thinking, vividly showing Mao Zedong's highly successful troop maneuvers and brilliant art of military command; and displays relatively comprehensively the theoretical structure of Mao Zedong's military thinking. The work is Mao Zedong's rich and valuable theoretical heritage for military theory and philosophical thinking. The first volume of the Writings contains 247 of Mao Zedong's military essays written during the Agrarian Revolutionary War which highlight Mao Zedong's painstaking exploration of a range of issues, such as carving out a path for the Chinese Revolution, establishing a new type of people's army, and people's war and its strategies and tactics. After the fiasco of the 1927 Revolution, the CPC began to probe seriously for a path for the Chinese Revolution. In his "Speech at the Emergency Central Conference," "Outline of the Hunan Movement," and "Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan Requires Army Support," Mao Zedong puts forward explicitly the idea of seizing political power by force and by combining peasants' uprisings with military support. With the defeat of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, Mao Zedong boldly pulled his insurgent army back to rural areas, where the enemy's rule was weak, and established a revolutionary power base in Jinggangshan, where he built an "armed independent regime of workers and peasants." In the "Writings," letters and papers, such as the "Letter to the Central Committee Through the Good Offices of the Hunan and Jiangxi Party Committees" and the 20 March and 5 April 1929 letters from the Red Fourth Army Front Committee to the Central Committee, concentrate on probing for a theory to account for "armed independent regimes of workers and peasants," and policies and strategies on the struggle against the enemy. The publication in early 1930 of A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire marked the formation of Mao Zedong's basic theory on the path of the Chinese Revolution. Mao Zedong made the most important theoretical and practical contributions to the process of founding a new type of proletarian revolutionary army. A range of key principles he advanced during this time -- such as affirming party leadership over the Army, the establishment of a democratic system within the Army, the pursuit of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," the three assignments of combating, fund raising, and mass work for the Red Army, strengthening political education, and laying down correct military-political relationships -- drew a fundamental line between the Red Army and all the previous armies. Mao Zedong's "Letter to Lin Biao" on 14 June 1929 is an important piece of literature on the development of the People's Army, spelling out the basic principles for a new type of army and paving the way for the "Gutian Conference Resolutions." The Writings prints the full text of the "Resolutions at the Ninth Congress of the Fourth Army of the CPC Red Army" (that is "Gutian Conference Resolutions"), which systematically sums up the army-building experience since the founding of the Fourth Army of the Red Army, and is a programmatic paper for the development of the People's Army. Exploring the warfare experience, which involved great hardship, Mao Zedong came up with a whole set of strategies and tactics tailored to the characteristics of China's Revolutionary War. The Writings fully reflects the famous "16-character formulation of military principles" -- that is "when the enemy advances, we retreat; when the enemy camps, we harass; when the enemy tires, we attack; when the enemy retreats, we pursue" -- authored by Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the early years of the Red Army, and the active defensive strategy centered on "luring the enemy to penetrate deeply," which was formulated during counter-campaigns against "encirclement and suppression." During the counter-campaigns against "encirclement and suppression" and strategic retreats, Mao Zedong advanced many important military principles on troop concentrations, mobile warfare, war of quick decision, and war of annihilation. As a distillation of the Red Army's decade-long experience of pitched battles, Mao Zedong's "Problems of Strategies for China's Revolutionary War" displays a mature theoretical structure spelling out in a systematic way the abovementioned problems concerning strategies for China's Revolutionary War, and moreover, examining their philosophical and methodological implications. This marks the formation of Mao Zedong's thought on military affairs. The second volume of the Writings contains 244 essays written by Mao Zedong during the War of Resistance Against Japan which highlight his theories, lines, principles, and policies on the national united front in Resistance to Japan, War of Total Resistance, protracted war, and guerrilla warfare. The War of Resistance Against Japan was advocated by the CPC and pursued under the banner of Anti-Japanese National United Front, itself based on the KMT-CPC Collaboration. Led by Mao Zedong, the Chinese communists buried the hatchet; valued the national cause above all; and made detailed plans for the deployment of the Eighth-Route Army and New Fourth Army, strategic unfolding, and the prosecution of war. Moreover, with a positive attitude, they continuously made suggestions to the KMT authorities about providing guidance on a national anti-Japanese strategy. Essays such as "Cable to Chiang Kai-shek on the Japanese Invasion of the Lugou Bridge," "On National Defense," "On the Strategy for the North China Front," and "On Strategic Arrangements in North China Following the Loss of Taiyuan" underscore problems in this area. Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War" argues most forcefully for the general principle of waging a protracted war, and was immensely important in providing guidance to the Chinese people in winning the final victory in the war against Japan. Mao Zedong expounds fully on the strategic value of guerrilla warfare in the war against Japan in "On the Principles of Warfare for the Red Army" and in many other essays. These essays played a key role in the rapid development of guerrilla warfare in the war against Japan. One outstanding feature of army building in the war against Japan was the insistence on party leadership and the guaranteed political, ideological, and organizational independence of the Army. Mao Zedong's systematic summing up and incisive analysis of army building in the seventh party congress political report raised thinking on army building to a new dimension. An important part of the second volume of the Works concerns correctly handling the national and class contradictions in the war against Japan and the KMT-CPC relationship. Early in the Anti-Japanese war period, the Eighth-Route Army and the KMT Army were the two forces to bear the brunt of fighting on the North China front. For a time, part of the KMT Army came under the command of the Eighth-Route Army. Regarding this group of KMT troops, Mao Zedong has this to say in his cable to Zhu De and Peng Dehuai: "We should care about and help them; they should not be assigned the most dangerous missions, nor want for food and supplies" (p. 70). He also instructed: "We should criticize constructively and make suggestions about certain weaknesses with friendly parties and armies, and should not laugh at and ridicule them" (p. 130). After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, the KMT diehards pursued the policy of passive resistance against the Japanese, but active fight against the communists, constantly creating frictions with the communists. Mao Zedong laid down the policy and measure of struggling against the diehards on just grounds, based on our advantage, and with restraint adopted "a militarily defensive position," and stressed "unification in fighting against the Japanese" (p. 567) to counter the attacks by KMT diehards. Led by Mao Zedong, our party was able to adhere to correct policies and measures in the national united front against the Japanese, and thus ensured victory in the war against the Japanese. The third and fourth volumes of the Writings consist of 902 of Mao Zedong's essays written during the Liberation War period. This was an important stage in the development of Mao Zedong's military thinking. The essays collected in these volumes highlight Mao Zedong's theories and practices in strategic decision, war planning, and the art of high command. 1. Arriving at a strategic decision, and proposing new strategic missions, principles, and methods to achieve these missions based on the practical conditions of both our side and the enemy. With victory in the war against the Japanese and aimed against the reactionary KMT's policy of actively preparing for a full-scale civil war, Mao Zedong reminded the whole party and Army of conducting prompt strategic changes, which consisted of switching the guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare and the pursuit of "moving toward the north and defending the south." With the outbreak of full-scale civil war, Mao Zedong, based on the strength of our side and the enemy and on the combat experience of our troops gained early in the civil war, formulated the interior-line operations and a policy of active strategic defense, consisting of wiping out the enemy's effective strength and refraining from seizing or holding strongholds. Under the guidance of this formulation, our Army scored the momentous victory of smashing the KMT's full-scale offensives and countering their selective attacks with concentrated forces. When the momentum of the enemy's concentrated attacks was spent, but when the PLA still was outnumbered by the enemy in total troop strength, Mao Zedong made the bold strategic decision to direct the PLA main force to attack the exterior lines in order to expand the war into areas under KMT rule, thus initiating the historic change in People's Revolutionary War from strategic defense to strategic offense. Beginning in the fall of 1948, he directed our Army to launch in a timely fashion the three great Liaoshi-Shenyang, Huai-Hai, and Peiping-Tientsin Campaigns, which basically wiped out the KMT main force and shook the KMT rule to its very foundations. Thereafter, in a fearless, combative, and triumphant spirit, Mao Zedong refused to be duped by Chiang Kai-shek's "peace talk" plot or intimidated by the imperialists' threat of armed intervention, and made the strategic decision of widening the war to the whole country in pursuit of the revolution, thus smashing Chiang Kai-shek's hope of rearming himself for a comeback on the strength of his half-diminished power base south of the Chang Jiang, forcing the imperialist powers to pull back from armed intervention, and finally winning the great Liberation War. 2. Putting forward in a timely fashion a highly relevant principle of military operations that was able to meet the needs evolved from the development of war and adjust to specific conditions of different battlefields. Early in the war, in view of the rearmament of the KMT by the United States and therefore its greater combat power, Mao Zedong laid great emphasis on the principle of "concentrating a superior force to destroy the enemy forces one by one." Parallel to this was the guiding thought of adhering to the war of annihilation and mobile warfare. Regarding areas with heavy concentrations of enemy troops, the emphasis was on caution, waiting for an opportunity, working for more than instant results, and luring the enemy to penetrate deeply. In waging battles that had decisive strategic significance, the emphasis was on boldly taking over enemy strongholds and heavily fortified cities, and launching wars of annihilation on an unprecedented scale. The 10 famed military principles summarized by Mao Zedong in his "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" embody and highlight the guiding principles for all our Army's operations during the time of the War of Liberation. 3. Great mobility and maneuverability; good at luring or drawing away enemies; creating favorable opportunities for battles; holding firmly the initiative to launch offensives; and handle everything with great flexibility and according to changes in enemy movements, time, and locations -- these are the obvious characteristics of Mao Zedong's art of high command. Essays in this period also reflect new developments in Mao Zedong's thinking on army building. The sixth volume of Works includes 219 essays written between the founding of the PRC and December 1972 which trace how Mao Zedong ordered the PLA to continue the strategic pursuit; liberate the whole country and certain important islands; move troops into Tibet and peacefully liberate it; conduct the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; and defend the country, its national security, and territorial integrity; and build a modern and regular army for national defense. Mao Zedong paid great attention to the construction of a powerful, modern, and regular army of national defense. He pointed out: We now have come to the highest stage of army building, which is the acquiring of modern technology. China must build a powerful national defense army, a powerful air and naval force, and a good logistical system. He was determined to launch research and development of hi-tech weapons, and wanted to develop atomic and hydrogen bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles. In line with modernizing army equipment, he demanded that the Army be regularized and that it install a "centralized command, hierarchy, and establishment, and discipline and training system" to instill "organization, planning, accuracy, and discipline" (p. 341). Mao Zedong's military thinking sums up the experiences of China's Revolutionary War and wars against aggression. It is a theoretical distillation of those experiences. It was born in revolutionary war practice and continuously developed alongside the practice and changes in historical conditions. Today, learning and studying seriously the Military Writings of Mao Zedong, and appreciating profoundly and acquiring its basic tenets, principles, and scientific methods, hold important significance for our conscious effort to adhere to Mao Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's theory on national defense and army building in the new era as the guiding thoughts for our Army.
