During a recent Shenzhen property exhibition at the China Resources Exhibition Hall, lawyer Zhang Zhuan Jiang of the Shenzhen Land Planning Bureau said his government had sent a report to the central government telling it "of our intent to retain the current 20 percent policy". The central government has announced plans to implement a Land Appreciation Tax (LAT) on the profits of developers and property investors. However, the government has not yet announced how the tax will be implemented or how much it would allow developers to make before implementing the tax. Mr Zhang said irrespective of details of the LAT, Shenzhen would argue "it was a special case" and need not necessarily abide by the LAT. He said Shenzhen authorities had emphasised to the central government that their 20 per cent fee had been in place since 1988 and they must "ensure the continuity of their policy". Mr Zhang said Shenzhen officials believed that since investors and developers took a lot of risks in building their projects, they should be guaranteed a certain amount of profit before implementing the LAT. "So, the 20 per cent profit is reasonable," he said. The Shenzhen lawyer said he hoped the local government would be provided with "sufficient leeway" in implementing details of the tax and that it would be allowed to be flexible in applying the tax. Mr Zhang said the LAT had not deterred developers in Shenzhen. "Before, we had four levels of tax. This one tax is less than before. So, the 20 per cent fee has not had a negative impact on development," he said. According to one Shenzhen official, property development is the single biggest industry in the economic development zone.
