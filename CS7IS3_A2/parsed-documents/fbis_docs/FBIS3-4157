The protocol on cooperation in peaceful use of and research into space was signed by visiting Deputy Director of the China National Space Administration Wang Liheng and director of the Russian Space Administration U. Koptev. Wang told a press conference after the signing ceremony that a joint working committee with seven people from each side will be set up to work out the details of cooperation projects. Noting the good cooperation the two countries have enjoyed in the past, Wang said the document is a frame agreement to lay a basis for extensive Sino-Russian space cooperation. Koptev pointed out that under the protocol, Russia and China will cooperate in virtually all fields of space science, including communication satellite, satellite television broadcast and space technology application. He said that although both countries have collaborated in space science for years, the potential for such cooperation are far from being fully tapped. Sino-Russian space cooperation is faced with difficulties in terms of law, finance and economy, Koptev said, but normal cooperation will not be affected. On Russia's plan to build a new space rocket launching center in the Far East, which is only 100 kilometers away from the Chinese border, Koptev said this will create more favorable conditions for close Russian-Chinese cooperation in this field. Wang, who led a delegation of China National Space Administration, arrived here on Monday [21 March] for a week-long visit.
