Mr Chen, 54, was deputy party secretary in Fujian and has been Mr Jia's right-hand man since 1985. The reshuffle was confirmed unanimously by 464 delegates at the provincial people's congress. Speaking to reporters after his election yesterday, Mr Chen said he would continue to put Taiwan affairs at the top of his agenda. He said that, in particular, he would focus on protecting Taiwanese investment in Fujian and would push for early direct links with the Kuomintang stronghold. Despite repeated overtures from Beijing, the Taiwanese Government has steadfastly refused to open direct communication, transport and government contacts with the mainland. The new governor also pledged to work closely with Mr Jia to further improve the economy. Fujian, in spite of its close proximity to Taiwan, has lagged far behind economically booming Guangdong, a fact sources attribute to a lack of co-operation among the province's top officials. On other matters, both Mr Chen and Mr Jia said they would continue to crack down on the smuggling of illegal workers from Fujian to the United States. But they admitted Fujian's long coastline made anti-smuggling efforts difficult. Meanwhile, sources said the provincial leadership had decided to postpone the election of two vice-governors due to differences of opinion at the top. They said the original plan was for congress delegates to elect two vice-governors to fill the vacancies left by Mr Chen and another vice-governor, Li Mingkang, who was expected to retire soon.
