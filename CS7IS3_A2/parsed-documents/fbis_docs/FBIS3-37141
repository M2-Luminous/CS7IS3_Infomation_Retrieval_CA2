The invading airplane dropped two cluster bombs near the defensive positions around Yegvard in the rayon. Unfortunately, the foggy weather prevented determining from which country the airplane came. The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported that it is assumed that it took off from the Iranian border. Armenia's air-defense forces have taken relevant measures. Data on the fate of the warplane are being determined. The same source reported that two SU-25 war planes, this time certainly from Iranian territory, invaded Megrinskiy Rayon and dropped two cluster bombs on the railway station at 1540. They later flew toward Kapanskiy Rayon and dropped two more cluster bombs on the borders. The two aircraft then flew toward Iran. Data on the consequences of the bombing are being determined. Taking into consideration that the war planes appeared from the territory of a neutral country, Armenia's air-defense forces did not take counter-measures. The aforesaid violations were also registered by the Russian border troops stationed in Armenia, and the Armenian Armed Forces command was informed about it.
