FBIS4-48408 "drafr096_d_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Frelimo Blamed for Separatist Movement's Activities Frelimo Blamed for Separatist Movement's Activities MB1705200094 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1730 GMT 17 May 94 MB1705200094 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network Portuguese BFN [Report from Quelimane by correspondent Abdul Madib] [Text] A communique issued by the Zambezia branch of the Mozambique Liberal and Democratic Party, Palmo, and disseminated by Radio Mozambique, says it is worried about recent political developments in the country and about peace, in the wake of the emergence of the so-called Rombezia [Rovuma-Zambezia] grouping. Palmo says Rombezia is headed by militants of the ruling Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party who, together with Gimo Phiri, have been forcibly recruiting youths, training and arming them. The communique says Rombezia stems from a Frelimo maneuver aimed at disrupting the elections scheduled for October. We spoke to Domingos Sande, a member of the Frelimo Party's Provincial Committee and head of its Organization Department. Sande says he regrets Palmo's attitude in disseminating, quote, a shameless lie, unquote. He said the communique is completely false, noting that Frelimo stands for national unity, whereas Rombezia is for secession. [Begin Sande recording] As reported, Rombezia is a movement with separatist tendencies. That is against the Frelimo Party's policy. Actually, we have already informed the Central Committee and the issue was debated at its last session. We have been working with the government to disband the group. [end recording]
