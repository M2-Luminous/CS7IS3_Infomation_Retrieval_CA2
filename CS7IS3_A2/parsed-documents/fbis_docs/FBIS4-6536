FBIS4-6536 "dreas078__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-078-A Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Poll Shows Support for Hata as Prime Minister Poll Shows Support for Hata as Prime Minister OW2104140894 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2104140894 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] While political parties have been engaged in the final coordination of selecting a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide opinion poll on 16-17 April to sound out the trend of public support for "Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata" and the people's view on various issues, including Hosokawa's resignation announcement. A majority of the respondents indicated support for "Prime Minister Hata." For example, 61 percent said they would "support" Hata if he becomes the next premier, while only 21 percent said they would "not support" him. As for Hosokawa's resignation announcement, 60 percent of the respondents said "he is irresponsible"; this number exceeded the proportion of those who said "he acted with good grace in announcing his intention to step down." These results indicate the people's strong criticism of Hosokawa for suddenly giving up the administration. At the same time, 57 percent of the respondents said they "wanted Hosokawa to remain in power." This number exceeded by 20 points the 37 percent of respondents who said "there was a good reason for him to step down," indicating Hosokawa is still popular among people. In addition, 65 percent spoke highly of the achievements made by the Hosokawa administration during the past eight months. The 61 percent support rate for Hata is high, exceeding the nonsupport rate by 40 points. We cannot compare it with the support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet because the figure is not an actual support rate for a Hata cabinet. However, it is higher than the support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet (55.1 percent) in the survey conducted last March. Thus, the poll revealed the strong hopes the people place on "Prime Minister Hata." Moreover, regarding the question of "who is the most appropriate person to be the next prime minister?" Hata ranked highest with a 37-percent approval rating. This compared with 12 percent for former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], who was regarded as a probable candidate at the time of the poll. These ratings are followed by 7 percent for former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and 4 percent each for Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, LDP Policy Research Council Chairman Ryutaro Hashimoto, and LDP President Yohei Kono. As for the most desirable composition of the next government, respondents answered as follow: 1) an administration composed of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, the Japan New Party, and a portion of the LDP (28 percent of the respondents); 2) the same administration led by the current coalition, excluding the LDP and the Japan Communist Party (21 percent); 3) an administration composed of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, the Democratic Socialist Party, Sakigake [Harbinger], and a portion of the LDP (15 percent); and 4) an administration composed mainly of the LDP (14 percent). In response to Hosokawa's resignation announcement, 60 percent said "it was irresponsible" while 35 percent said "he acted with good grace." Regarding accomplishments made during the past eight months of the Hosokawa administration, 65 percent of the respondents said "it can be highly evaluated" while 31 percent said "it cannot." As specific achievements to be noted, 37 percent said "the Hosokawa government put an end to the LDP one-party administration"; 34 percent cited "it raised people's political consciousness"; and another 34 percent said "it enacted political reform-related bills." On the other hand, the poll also revealed the people's negative attitude towards the Hosokawa administration. Criticism was mostly centered on Hosokawa's lack of decisive policies and power struggles within the administration. For example, 35 percent of the respondents said "Hosokawa often retracted his decisions on important issues"; 33 percent noted "Shinseito coleader Ichiro Ozawa had too much influence upon the administration"; and 32 percent said "there were too many discords and conflicts within the administration."
