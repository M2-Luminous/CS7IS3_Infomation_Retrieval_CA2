But it became clear yesterday when the Bloc's program was presented that the content is largely anti-European: Party leader Dillen and his colleagues support cooperation between peoples, but within limits. Above all, Europe must not meddle in too many matters, and especially not education or culture, because that compromises "individuality." [passage omitted] Civilization Above all, the VB wants to brush aside anything which is foreign, and that in the broadest sense of the word. Europe must not become an "open door zone for the Third World." The VB also rejects a European Union which would affect the "cultural identity of different peoples." Gerolf Annemans does not believe in "utopias" such as, in his opinion, the notion of a multicultural society. But the VB wants to see a varied Europe with its "common civilization." Which does not prevent the VB from believing that it is not utopian to clearly define "own" cultures and peoples within this larger Europe. The VB also rejects the idea of European citizenship as "a lifeless and rootless concept." The VB naturally opposes the national member states, and Belgium above all, but is equally unenthusiastic about the Europe of Regions. "The Committee of the Regions is a dummy," says Annemans, "as Flemings we want nothing to do with the regions. We want a Europe of independent people's states." The VB made repeated references yesterday to the Czech-Slovak model (a photo of Vaclav Havel even adorned the Bloc's brochure). The split has been achieved "peacefully" there, the VB says. With this, Annemans sought to dispel suspicions that the VB has in mind regions and peoples such as we find in the former Yugoslavia. "Europe has no precise definition of what the regions are supposed to represent. As far as the peoples are concerned, we believe that they must each sort out their own problems and keep their own house in order." How this "spring cleaning" by the people fits in with cooperation within "the real Europe," as Karel Dillen describes it, is not clear. And whether or not the VB had a precise definition of its people's states was also unclear, except that it is "of course not going to come about overnight." The VB wants to see a confederal rather than a federal Europe.
