These actions consist of paralyzing beginning tomorrow up to 100 percent of the heavy-transportation services, said last night leaders of the Fuel Transportation organization, which is grouped under the National Transportation Board, CNT. CNT Spokesman Rudy Merida has reiterated that the government is being pressured on account of "several pending petitions, and if they are not attended to, the problems will be greater not only for the government but for the community in general. This is why the government should attend to the petitions, which total seven in number. Among the issues to be taken up are, for example, the customs problem--as it has a fixed eight-hour work day. Two others are the transportation cost of fuel and cement, given that these have not been brought up to date," he said. "The four other problems are the interference--covered up by several mayors--of urban transportation lines in nonurban areas. Another is the Nonurban Transportation ruling, which has not been enforced. Still another is the ruling for the operation of international shipping companies and the problem of retentions, which are illegal and which are being collected by private cargo companies. These are some of the points this sector is demanding be discussed." "Nevertheless, given that government authorities have expressed their incapacity to reach an agreement, the directors of organized transportation have decided to start staging the strikes as of 25 January, after noon. It is almost certain that the first to go on strike will be those who transport fuel, followed by other heavy-transportation services. This will continue until a total transportation strike takes place if the government, finance, energy and mines, and communications ministers do not meet with us this very day. We are giving you until noon tomorrow; if no solution is presented, we will definitely go on strike," said Rudy Merida, who made the statement.
