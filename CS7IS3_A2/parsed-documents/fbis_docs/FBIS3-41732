A particular insidiousness of the severe infection is that it cannot be diagnosed by the conventional methods. Cholera is a truly terrifying disease because of the lightning speed with which it spreads. Fifteen to twenty five days elapse before the onset of typhoid fever. Cholera does not allow man to mobilize resources and nip the infection in the bud. All too often its incubation period lasts only a matter of hours. A day or a couple of days pass, and an infected person dies if he does not receive qualified aid. Neither do preventive inoculations help being next to useless and, so, they are rarely resorted to by medics. Cholera continues its triumphal march across the planet and it takes root even in states it never visited before. Up to 70,000 cases of cholera were registered worldwide in 1988-1990. In 1992-1993 they topped the million mark with thousands of fatalities. Russia is no exception in this regard. Last years six Russians were cured of cholera. This year there were 20 such ``Russian'' cases and two foreigners, but one patient in Moscow succumbed to the disease. ``It is a sheer miracle that the infection has not erupted anywhere yet,'' says the Rostov Regional Centre of the Sanitary-and-Epidemiological Inspectorate Deputy Chief Doctor Gennady Aidinov. Wars, refugees left to their devices, the ``tentative'' Russian borders with a virtually total absence of sanitary control, an influx of illegal migrants from the Middle East and Asian countries, a multitude of lice-ridden homeless tramps and unemployable provide breeding grounds for almost any infection! Further, there is street trade, overflowing with filth and garbage and other waste, and dealing in worthless and substandard wares. And an appalling quality of drinking water... It is perhaps the hand of God that an uncommon variety of cholera erupted precisely in Rostov. For a long time we heard virtually nothing about infection cases, infectious diseases were a closely-guarded state secret; even in service correspondence the plague was disguised as ``form 100'' whereas cholera was styled as ``form thirty.'' If the authorities were compelled to admit anything in this respect they did it through clenched teeth. Rostov is traditionally a cholera-visited region. How should one behave in an emergency situation? Even an isolated case of this disease is an emergency. Moscow should be informed forthwith of every case and the WHO should be notified within twenty-four hours. The local epidemiologists know ``their'' disease not from books. There is a State Plague Research Institute in Rostov, the leading institution of this kind in the country, it is also concerned with cholera. Should a person succumb to cholera somewhere in a Russian hinterland, and not here, the local doctors might even fail to diagnose the case. It is fearsome to contemplate the consequences. The uncommon cholera variety was ``delivered'' to Russia by plane. And in future it will also more likely than not find its way here by air. Remember how many international airports we had in Russia only a few years back. We had the airports of Sheremetyevo-2, Pulkovo and Khabarovsk, perhaps. Now there are no fewer than fifty and their number is growing. Our traders and merchants have been shuttling to and from places and locations where they can buy cheaper merchandise. That those places and locations are often infection-ridden is a matter of little significance to them. The sanitary services have been lagging behind Aeroflot flights catastrophically. Regular flights to foreign countries from the Rostov airport were started six years ago, whereas a sanitation control centre is only being organized today. The chief of the local air fleet buckled under to the sanitary doctor (Lyudmila Prilutskaya heading the North Caucasus centre for sanitary-epidemiological inspection) and allocated the requisite funds. But before long the planes will start flying to foreign countries from eleven cities in this country, and then the charm exerted by Prilutskaya will be powerless. ``True, sanitary control centres are being set up and financed in a rather haphazard way,'' they heaved a sigh in the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Control. ``But we intend to set up 410 such outfits in our airports, on the seas, rivers and on railways, and we request 28 billion roubles for this.'' That the amount will be received from the scanty state treasury is not an accepted fact yet. The program is to be implemented by the year 1997 but how can we explain to cholera that it should refrain from visiting us until then? ``We shall not be able to prevent cholera visits by air of course,'' they nodded their understanding at the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Control. The main thing is to prevent the spread of the infection.''
