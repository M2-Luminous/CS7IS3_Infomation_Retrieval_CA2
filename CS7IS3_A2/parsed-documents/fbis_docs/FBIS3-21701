The crisis became more acute following the dissemination of charges about alleged links between high-ranking MIR leaders--including [former Bolivian President] Jaime Paz Zamora--with drug traffickers. MIR and ADN congressmen have been observed to maintain a discreet silence over the issue, thus causing the two parties middle-ranking leaders' to leave the parties' ranks. ADN leader Gaston Encina, who was previously one of the main MIR defenders, does not want to comment on the issue and is withdrawing from the political scenario. The public, however, would like to hear his opinion because it is known that he also participated in the meetings with drug traffickers, as the charges state. The crisis is affecting not only former President Jaime Paz Zamora's party; it has also stained Mr. Hugo Banzer Suarez' party. In the last few hours, the withdrawal of several ADN members and middle-ranking leaders has been reported. Among the withdrawing ADN members is Jorge Landivar Rua, a former Chuquisaca Department ADN governor. He said: We have been fighting corruption and are now indignant that trafficking may have permeated the national structure of our political parties. I bluntly repudiate the situation because these links, particularly MIR links, with drug trafficking are twofold corrupt, Landivar said. The MIR and ADN crisis is becoming more acute.
