FR941117-0-00215 FR941117-0-00014 The Commission noted in the Proposing Release, however, that a customer may waive the receipt of an immediate confirmation in the context where a fiduciary has discretion over the customer's account. 34 The Commission noted that, in its view, the account, rather than the fiduciary, was the customer for purposes of Rule 10b&hyph;10. To effect a valid waiver, the broker-dealer must (1) obtain from the customer a written agreement that the fiduciary receive the immediate confirmation; and (2) send to the customer a periodic report, not less frequently than quarterly, containing the same information that would have been contained in an immediate confirmation. 35 The customer may not waive this periodic report. 36 34 See Proposing Release, supra note 10, at 59 FR 12767 n.3. 35 To satisfy this requirement, a broker-dealer may deliver, directly to its customer, duplicate confirmations representing each of the customer's transactions for the prior period, together with the customer's account statement. This procedure would allow investors to rely on the account statement to monitor their accounts, while referring to the confirmation for the details of each specific trade. Investors already look to old confirmations for details which are not present on the account statement, and this procedure would allow investors to continue to rely on their confirmations and their account statements in substantially the same way. 36 Some concerns have been raised with respect to the application of this policy and its relationship with Rule 409 of the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''). See, e.g., letter from Kevin J. Mackay, President/Compliance and Legal Division, Securities Industry Association (``SIA''), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (July 22, 1994). Specifically, Rule 409(b) permits NYSE member firms to send a confirmation to a non-member person holding power of attorney over a customer account if ``either (A) the customer has instructed the member organization in writing to send such confirmations, statements, or other communications in care of such person, or (B) duplicate copies are sent to the customer at some other address designated in writing by him.'' NYSE Rule 409, 2 NYSE Guide (CCH) ¶␣2409. Under the Commission's position articulated above, a customer who waived receipt of the immediate confirmation would receive more information with his quarterly account statement than that currently required under NYSE Rule 409. To the extent the rules of the NYSE, or any self-regulatory organization, conflict with the Commission's stated policy, the more restrictive requirement would govern. Thus, a NYSE member wishing to take advantage of a waiver would be required to adhere to these Commission requirements in addition to any obligations imposed by Rule 409. The SIA argued that this position would (1) lead to duplicative efforts on the part of broker-dealers because broker-dealers already will have sent trade information to the fiduciary in an immediate confirmation; (2) depart from standard industry practice; and (3) require expensive system changes to comply with the position. The Commission emphasizes that this substitution of quarterly statements for the immediate confirmation is optional. No broker-dealer is required in the first instance to include all relevant trade information in a quarterly statement; however, if the broker-dealer, with the written authorization of the customer, wishes to omit sending the customer an immediate confirmation and instead send it to the account fiduciary, then the requirements of written instructions from the customer and a non-waiveable periodic report, as described above, must be satisfied in order to effect a valid waiver. These requirements are necessary to allow investors to monitor their accounts in the absence of a transaction-by-transaction report in the confirmation. The requirement to send a periodic report is intended to ensure that the beneficial owner of the account receives material information needed to verify the transaction in the account. 37 As the Commission noted in the release originally adopting Rule 10b&hyph;10, the Rule is not intended to require a broker-dealer dealing with the trustee of a plan to deliver statements to plan participants where the trustee is the shareholder of record of the securities being purchased or sold. In those instances, the Rule would require the broker-dealer to deliver a confirmation, or upon written request, a periodic report, only to the trustee. 38 A beneficiary of the trust would be required to receive an immediate confirmation, or upon written request, the periodic report, only if that beneficiary was a beneficial owner of the trust assets on the books of the broker-dealer, enjoying the rights and privileges of beneficial ownership. 37 The requirement to send a periodic report to the customer, if the customer has requested in writing that the immediate confirmation be sent to the customer's fiduciary, applies only if the broker-dealer has an existing duty under Rule 10b&hyph;10 to send an immediate confirmation directly to the customer in the absence of such a written request. This requirement therefore would not apply to paragraph 10b&hyph;10(b), which governs purchases and sales of securities in a money market fund, as defined in newly amended paragraph 10b&hyph;10(b)(1), a periodic plan, as defined in paragraph 10b&hyph;10(d)(5), and an investment company plan, as defined in paragraph 10b&hyph;10(d)(6). Paragraph (b) of Rule 10b&hyph;10 permits, upon written request of the customer, written statements containing the information specified in that paragraph to be sent not less frequently than quarterly, directly to the customer or some other person designated by the customer for distribution to the customer. Because there are circumstances, not enumerated specifically in Rule 10b&hyph;10, that would make compliance with the rule unduly burdensome, paragraph 10b&hyph;10(f) authorizes the Commission to exempt broker-dealers from the rule's requirements with regard to specific transactions or specific classes of transactions for which the broker or dealer will provide alternative procedures to effect the purposes of Rule 10b&hyph;10. This authority has been delegated to the Division of Market Regulation. 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(32). 38 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13508 (May 5, 1977), at n.24. The Commission also believes that the broker-dealer can satisfy its obligation to send a confirmation to the customer if it sends the confirmation to a custodian of the customer authorized to receive securities and disburse funds for the customer. 39 The custodian in question must not be affiliated with a broker-dealer or an investment adviser or have any role in choosing the broker-dealer or investment adviser used; 40 and the customer must retain the right to request that the confirmation be sent directly to the customer, at no extra charge by the custodian or broker-dealer. Moreover, an account custodian may not choose to receive a periodic report in place of an immediate confirmation. 39 The custodian must not hold itself out as a broker-dealer or an investment adviser. But see Investment Advisers Act Release No. 1406 (March 16, 1994), 59 FR 13464 (proposing a rule to require investment advisers to ensure that custodians of investment adviser client accounts provide the client or its designee with account statements not less than quarterly). 40 Securities orders must be placed by the customer or the customer's investment adviser, not the custodian.
