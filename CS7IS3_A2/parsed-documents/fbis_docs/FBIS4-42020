Issues on the program for economic reform in the autonomous republic, on the structure of the government, and on target subsidies to people with low incomes in connection with the expected rise in prices for bread were put on the agenda. The deputies approved a resolution on raising the excise duties for wines, hard liquors, and beer produced in the republic. The resolution will come into force as of 1 July. By the way, its text coincides with a similar decree by the president of Crimea which was signed and validated on 24 June. The deputies postponed the issue on target subsidies so as to discuss it in the presence of Yuriy Meshkov. The deputies decided to consider the situation which took shape in the militia bodies after the approval by the Supreme Council of Ukraine of amendments and additions to the law of Ukraine "On militia" and "On the delimitation of powers between the bodies of state authority of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea" on 28 June. In the opinion of Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea, the Ukrainian parliament "infringed upon the laws on the status of the Republic of Crimea and on the delimitation of powers." A deputy commission headed by deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea Oleksiy Melnykov was set up to consider this issue. On the same day the commission got down to work and met the members of the collegium of the chief Directorate of Internal Affairs in Crimea under the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. As Oleksiy Melnykov told the deputies, only three members of the collegium agreed to work at the Chief Directorate of Internal Affairs of Crimea. There were proposals on the part of the deputies to lift a moratorium on holding the Crimean referendum and terminate negotiations with the delegation of the Ukrainian parliament. The commission was charged with drafting a resolution on the situation which took shape. The debate on the issue will be continued at a regular plenary sitting on 30 June.
