In addition to Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries, he mentioned South Africa, India, China, and Russia. Lula made it clear that he does not intend to attach priority to traditional Brazilian partners: "Over the past five centuries Brazil has had trade relations with practically Europe and the United States alone, which have now closed themselves off into large blocs." He said his foreign policy would be "active, with as much traveling as possible, to make Brazil approach those countries and show the governments of rich countries the problems and the development model that Brazil wants to implement." Lula spoke shortly before dedicating the headquarters of his campaign's central committee on Angelica Avenue, in downtown Sao Paulo, on the eve of his departure for the United States. He will leave today on a five-day visit during which he will meet with U.S. officials, businessmen, and official organizations. Lula also referred to the type of "strong state" that he wants to build in Brazil: "It will not be a state that will meddle with the economy, but a strong state that will promote a good taxation policy and increase revenues and investment to resolve the problems of starvation and misery in the country," he explained. He added that in his government, "the sectors that are not strategic" for national sovereignty might be transferred to the private sector, yet he said that instead of thinking about the privatization of existing hydroelectric plants or highways, entrepreneurs should try to build what Brazil still needs to promote its development.
