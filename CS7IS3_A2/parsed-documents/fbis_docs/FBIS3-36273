But it is virtually identical to the rise of Yeltsin. Like Yeltsin, Rutskoy rose to prominence alongside the head of state. His policy was based on criticizing the president's entourage, but not the big man himself. In the same way, Yeltsin criticized the CPSU elite for a long time, while stressing that he and Gorbachev only differed with regard to reform tactics. The Army was also sympathetic to Rutskoy. According to one survey, he was supported by one-third of the officer corps. Not bad for a beginning. Boris Yeltsin did not immediately win the sympathies of the military. Their friendship grew as resentment grew against Gorbachev, who unequivocally "betrayed" the Army: After the events in Vilnius, for example. Yeltsin, on the other hand, promised to show concern. It is clear from the fortunes of many of today's generals that he kept his promise after the Belovezhskaya Forest Agreement. But the number of dissatisfied military men is, of course, far greater. Rutskoy could perfectly well count on them to improve his rating. Admittedly, he did not really have a ramified political structure to fulfill agitation and propaganda functions, if only along the lines of "Democratic Russia." The "Free Russia" People's Party (FRPP), only nominally headed by Rutskoy, was not noted for its organization. "Civic Union" hesitated to nominate him as its leader, and, moreover, was actively engaged in infighting. The opposition's support was not so much unconditional as desperate. The hardliners still had not nominated a leader. Indeed, they could not. Only in propaganda folklore is it possible to firmly unite monarchists and communists. In real life they could only reach a compromise. Rutskoy proved to be the bridge they needed. But, as his popularity grew, these and many other factors moved into the background. Two or three weeks before the tragic events at the White House, the "Public Opinion" Foundation carried out a survey to establish the degree of popular support for the various political blocs. The results were stunning. Particularly considering the election results. "Civic Union" emerged as the undisputed leader. It was even several steps ahead of "Democratic Russia" and "Russia's Choice." But, while placing a high degree of trust in "Civic Union," contrary to the true state of affairs, the population linked it to Rutskoy's name. On the other hand, at that time 71 percent of respondents were negative about Yeltsin's activity. The conclusion is obvious: Aleksandr Rutskoy was very successfully ousting the Russian president from the public consciousness. If there had been simultaneous early elections, the idea of which was being actively discussed at the time, the result would have been predetermined. The events around the White House could not have come at a better time. One can understand the irritation of some radicals that Rutskoy did not shoot himself. Was Rutskoy still a rival to Yeltsin? There are politicians who, thanks to their courageous behavior, have gone straight from jail into palace apartments. However, there are also those who have voluntarily left politics. But it is a fact that Rutskoy is not forgotten. According to the "Person-93" poll carried out by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion, he confidently holds fourth place in the popularity ratings. His name largely helped V. Lipitskiy's victory in the election campaign. The FRPP, on the other hand -- neatly blended into the "Future of Russia-New Names" bloc, which no one had ever heard of -- suffered defeat. The FRPP now intends to take part in elections to local bodies of authority under its own identity and with Rutskoy's name. However, was it worth Rutskoy's while to undertake such a dangerous venture as setting up an independent political party? After all, his fortunes could have turned out quite well. He was the first official in Russian history -- and, according to the now abolished Constitution, the last -- to be publicly declared as successor to the president. He had gained some popularity among the people, uttered a few words of criticism, and consequently distanced himself from Yeltsin, so all he had to do was sit patiently by, not thrust himself forward, and bide his time in order to smoothly make the transition to the president's chair. Yes, but in that case the person would have to be a political sophisticate, rather than a military man like Rutskoy. Moreover, the traditional pattern of ascent is not in itself a guarantee of success. However the contender for the post of president may maneuver, whatever parties he may form, and whatever deals he may make even with the Army, he will nevertheless come up against the wall that is the elite. He could break through, of course. But that would require a revolution -- even if it is a velvet revolution -- or a military coup d'etat. A peaceful outcome is only possible in one case: If the contender reflects the interests of the elite. Zhirinovskiy -- A Shield For the Elite? However paradoxical it may seem, Zhirinovskiy is exactly the candidate for president who plays entirely by the rules of the present elite. His views are its views. His interests are its interests, that is, the interests of big capital. That is the main point. Zhirinovskiy's criticism of the policy of reforms goes no further than criticizing its tactics. This kind of condemnation can be continued for a very long time with absolutely no harm to the policy itself. As far as his bellicose plans are concerned, the "rush to the south," they are more a tribute to tradition. India attracted the attention of Peter I. Paul I could not restrain himself: He dispatched the Don Army to wage war on India, soon after which he was killed. The expedition ended there. The famous General Skobelev nurtured global ideas of uniting all the Slav lands.... Why should Zhirinovskiy not recall all this, and our elite as well? With its chameleon-like abilities, it is perfectly capable of speaking in a patriotic bass, even if it does concern such details as the color of television presenters' hair and eyes. Incidentally, Zhirinovskiy himself understands perfectly well that, without the elite, he has no real road to power: Support for him is not so very great, which is why some extraordinary measures and Russia's desperate plight are needed. Is the lawyer's son capable of taking all this upon his shoulders? The elite's position is no better: It has no one in reserve for the role of president. The opposition is breathing down its neck. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy has taken his seat next to Yeltsin and Filatov for all to see. He has already done the elite quite a service by supporting the Constitution. In his own interests, of course. But it is ludicrous to expect altruism of a politician. Finally, no one before Zhirinovskiy has shown such staggering loyalty to power: to Gorbachev, the State Committee for the State of Emergency, Yeltsin himself, and even those in the White House. Having condemned the Lefortovo prisoners' opposition to Edict No. 1440, he now advocates releasing them. Zhirinovskiy treats power like a sacred cow, thereby guaranteeing the survival of the elite and its property in the event of his victory. The process of adapting to each other's characters and interests is now under way. Zhirinovskiy impetuously demonstrates what he is capable of doing. The elite reflects. Zhirinovskiy says something coarse. The elite frowns in disdain. But it will also smile if it has to. The Leader's Name Is Compromise Of course it has been offensive to watch the new elite scheming against "outsiders" and trying to fashion a new leader for the last year or so. We can do little more than lament the fact that our elite is bad. But if we were to stage another revolution, we would get an elite no better than the last, and, moreover, with the same qualities and resources at its disposal. Why each successive reproduction should be distinguished by this permanency and how we can limit its growth is another matter. But the elite's job is to supply leaders great and small; intrigues cannot be avoided. Another irritating feature is that a course rejected by society is being dictated to the incumbent president. Persistent efforts are being made to ensure that others continue this work. Not only various political institutions, such as the Army, are being approached for their support. History is also being brought into service. Lavishing praise on autocracy, attention is focused on the "strong hand" with which it so gloriously held Russia. However, the present power has forgotten the monarch's main concern: To try to achieve a balance between the passions of the elite and the people. History also teaches us that when the autocrat listed toward one side, the other side hatched conspiracies, rebelled, and sometimes carefully removed him or swept him aside. Nothing has changed since then. The White House tragedy and the failure of reform stem from a disregard of experience. Having begun his political ascent from ruin, Yeltsin does not realize that the historical imperative has gone. The leader's task today is not to show superhuman qualities, but to master the art of compromise. The theme of compromise is not new. From the moment it was formed, "Civic Union" reiterated the need for compromise in politics and the need to seek ways leading to accord. There is progress in this respect among some members of the opposition. Even the president has expressed a desire to cooperate with all forces in the Federal Assembly. It can be said that attempts are being made to get along with one another. The only exception in this is the main participant in the process, the ruling elite itself. So far, its backbone in the State Duma intends to demonstrate the principles of the noncontamination of the democratic ranks by the influence of extreme forces. Although, as is well known, the stance taken by extreme elements changes with time. It is not just caprice, of course. These are the torments of Tantalus. After all, behind every compromise lies the need to moderate one's appetite in the consumption of power and make room for others in these very ranks. But there is no going back. No less than 40 percent of the electorate in our country are romantics. The 40 percent who did not turn up to vote. The "left wing" and the "right wing" are in a hurry to enter them in their assets. A futile exercise. These people are not yours. Most of them say: "We do not trust anyone." So they are waiting.... They are waiting for the right person to come along. In a country which still has open wounds left by the destruction of a great state. They wait, scornfully observing the petty intrigues "above." They wait, with no future, soaring prices, and rocketing crime. They include a vast mass of people who know from experience how you have to go about begging for something. Where is the guarantee that this wave of desperation, fearlessness, and need will not one day surge through the country, sweeping aside everything in its path, to the impassioned appeals of the latest spokesman for the aspirations of the masses? If the present elite is really an elite, its direct duty is to make room for others, cultivate a leader capable of balancing on the cutting edge of the interests of all strata of the population, and promote a figure on whom the main political forces will agree. Only then will they have to bury their vast talent -- their ability to make our life hell. If the elite does not do its duty, the time of noble heroes, the Minins and Pozharskiys of this world, will come. How do we know who they are? Where are they now: In the crowd jostling at the throne, on the barricades, on the firing lines of our divided country? There is no answer to these questions. These people will come like lightning, like a sword. When the time for compromise has run out. Or been let slip by arrogant rulers. When the country is not simply on the brink, but in the abyss. Incidentally, Prince Pozharskiy was a Ryurikovich. With his services to the fatherland, he had every right to the throne. But, for the sake of peace in Russia, he spoke out in favor of Mikhail Romanov, a figure of compromise who suited the hostile boyar families. To this day, historians cannot say with certainty where exactly this great man is buried. Moreover, doubts arose even during the reign of the Romanov dynasty. Is this coincidence or the revenge of the elite: To wipe out every trace of an example offering the key to compromise?
