[Begin Arsenis recording] We proceeded with courage on the Cyprus issue by announcing the joint Greek-Cypriot defensive area. Without many words and much publicity, we have passed everywhere the message that Greece is not joking, that we--the government and the people--are ready to deal with the danger from the East because we are not willing to give up even an inch of territory, airspace, or sea to Turkey. We will defend our national rights. [end recording] Discussing the Armed Forces, the national defense minister stressed that they belong to the Greek people and are not to be used in anyone's feud.
