FR940811-2-00135 FR940811-2-00084 Virginia (which uses the ``Star of Life'' symbol) and California and San Diego (which use the Medic-Alert symbol) all reported that they were aware of no problems of identification or verification with the system they use. 4. Benefits and Disadvantages NHTSA requested that comments discuss the benefits and disadvantages that are likely to result from using the ``Star of Life'' to identify persons requesting a particular treatment or withholding of treatment by qualified EMS personnel. California and San Diego commented that they saw no benefit to expanding the use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol regarding the identification of patients who elect to execute DNR directives. In fact, California saw it simply as a training issue. The State said EMTs could as easily be trained to identify DNR candidates using other symbols. California also asserted that use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR services would be contrary to NHTSA training programs, which focus on the search for a Medic Alert bracelet to determine vital patient information. Comments from Virginia, on the other hand, point out that the DOT National Standard Curricula provide for EMTs and others ``to check a patient's `Medic Alert' bracelet as part of the patient assessment after initial resuscitative measures have been carried out.'' California is correct that the DOT National Standard Curricula advise EMTs and others to seek patient information from medical identification items, such as ``Medic Alert'' bracelets. However, NHTSA disagrees that use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR purposes is contrary to this training. As explained in Virginia's comments, EMTs and others are trained to seek patient information (as part of patient assessment) only after advanced directives (such as initial resuscitative measures and other treatment and transportation protocols) are followed. The 1994 edition of the DOT National Standard Curriculum for EMT-Basic makes clear the distinction between patient identification information and advanced directives. The Curriculum also indicates that the use of advanced directives (such as DNR) is a State issue and informs instructors to modify the curriculum to accommodate those advanced directives used in the State where the instruction is taking place. A few commenters expressed the concern that use of the symbol for a DNR program would either dilute or be entirely incompatible with the original meaning of the ``Star of Life.'' Leo R. Schwartz, who was Chief of NHTSA's Emergency Medical Services Division at the time the symbol was developed and registered as a certification mark with the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, argued that the mark was envisioned as and should remain ``a symbol of life,'' not a ``barrier'' to care. He strongly objected to the use of the ``Star of Life'' with an ``act of omission, with death as an end result.'' Others disagreed with these comments, and strongly supported expansion of the use of the symbol. A number of comments, for example, recognized that the role of EMS has expanded since 1977, when the ``Star of Life'' was first registered as a certification mark, and asserted that the proposed expanded use of the symbol is not incompatible (indeed it is appropriate) with current broader EMS missions. Other comments went further. The Department of Fire/Rescue Services, Frederick County, MD stated: The current request for an EMS&hyph;DNR program use is consistent with the direction of modern, managed health care, where the patient may give advance directives for their level of treatment. This is going to be more apparent in the health care reform recommendations that will be published in the near future. Similar sentiments were expressed in comments from Dr. Nicholas Benson, East Carolina University School of Medicine: As our nation becomes more involved with health care reform, one of the key issues to be resolved is which patients with sudden cardiac death should be resuscitated and which should not *␣*␣* Physicians, including myself, do not wish to make this determination alone; this is a decision that must include the express wishes of the patient, or his/her legal guardian. The Prehospital Do Not Resuscitate programs across the nation seek to respond to this need by predetermining which patients wish to be resuscitated and under what conditions. NHTSA's cornerstone contribution to this should be the use of the Star of Life, because of its long-standing use as a symbol denoting professionalism and compassion in prehospital care. As the profession of EMS has grown in the past 20 years, the implications of the use of the Star of Life have grown, as well. It has become a universally recognized symbol of professionalism and expertise in emergency medical care. The use of the Star of Life in Prehospital Do Not Resuscitate programs is 100% consistent with this growth. The benefit most often cited in support of using the ``Star of Life'' symbol for DNR purposes is the level of recognition enjoyed by the symbol. The comments were uniform in their acknowledgement of how highly visible and widely recognized the symbol has become. The U.S. Fire Administration commented that, ``EMS personnel are already trained to look for these bracelets, and as such save valuable time in situations where time is a critical factor.'' Maine EMS stated, ``The decision to begin resuscitation must be rapidly made by EMS personnel if it is to [be] implemented successfully *␣*␣* The Star of Life, alone or as part of a logo, is instantly recognized by EMS personnel *␣*␣* The availability of this universal symbol will greatly assist in this purpose.'' The States of Washington and New Jersey could think of no disadvantages to using the ``Star of Life'' for a DNR program. 5. Competitive Effect NHTSA requested comments on the competitive effect of the proposed ``EMS&hyph;DNR'' bracelet/``Star of Life'' symbol on private organizations that offer services which alert EMS personnel to a patient's condition. We received no comments alleging any adverse competitive effects. One State commented that, if there are any such adverse effects, they will have to yield to the more important public interest in the use of symbols that are universally recognized. 6. Use of Symbol for Other Medical Conditions Comments were sought regarding whether the agency should authorize the use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol for services or programs that would alert EMS personnel to other medical conditions of a patient, i.e. , diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure. Comments on this issue generally tracked the commenter's position on the use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR. Commenters (such as Maryland) that favored use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR purposes, supported the symbol's use for diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure or other medical conditions. Commenters (such as San Diego) that did not favor use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR purposes, opposed the symbol's use for these other purposes. The State of California, however, expressed a different view. While it opposed use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR purposes, it stated that if the symbol is approved for use in DNR programs, its use should also be approved for services and programs that will alert EMS personnel to other medical conditions of the patient.
