The document notes that, as a result of the steps which have been undertaken by the Russian leadership, "the firm and consistent line, excluding unilateral ultimatums, has produced results." In response to an appeal from Russia, the Bosnian Serbs adopted a decision to withdraw their heavy weapons from the region of Sarajevo. In this connection, the Russian Foreign Ministry calls on the Bosnian Government "without delay to place all its heavy weapons in the region of Sarajevo under the control of the UN forces." Russia's Foreign Ministry considers that in addition to lifting the blockade from Sarajevo, the UN Security Council should "urgently begin searching for ways to establish UN administrative rule in the city, as well as implement measures aimed at reinforcing other safety areas on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina." Russia also announces that it is ready to send part of its military contingent within the UN forces "on a mission of ensuring that the agreements on removing the blockade from Sarajevo are observed."
