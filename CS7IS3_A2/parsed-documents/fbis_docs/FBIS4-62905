He added that the Russian side has overpoliticised the issue and is using it to exert pressure on Estonia. Niitenberg, who chairs a four-minister government commission, announced that another commission will be formed to coordinate Estonia's general activities in the liquidation of the Paldiski military base. Russia has not yet announced the starting date and wants to conclude a single agreement on the dismantling and the removal of nuclear fuel. [passage omitted] Government representative Juri Tikk added that cases of arson have become frequent in Paldiski and three Russians suspected of attempted arson had been stopped at the Russian submariners' training centre last week. The arsonists generally attack buildings turned over to the Estonian authorities, Tikk added.
