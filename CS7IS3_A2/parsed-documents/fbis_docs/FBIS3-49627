[passage omitted] Clinton summed up the outcome of the meeting after the lunch. He was followed by Vaclav Havel, who spoke on behalf of the Visegrad Group. Vaclav Havel said: [Begin Havel recording] We are living in a time of dramatic search for a new order, in which no one will be subjugated or endangered, and which will enable all European peoples and states to enjoy an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation. Our meeting in Prague today is proof that the United States of America and NATO are well aware of the great importance that stability, security and peace in central Europe have for peace throughout Europe and for the security of the United States. We welcome the Partnership for Peace proposal as a good point of departure in NATO's quest for a new identity as a true stabilizing core of European security. We also appreciate that Partnership for Peace allows individual approaches to different countries. At the same time it rests with individual countries on just how powerfully and quickly they move to give Partnership for Peace a content that meets its interests and possibilities. We want to do our utmost to ensure that our partnership will result in full NATO membership because we do not see it as a substitute but as a first step toward joining NATO. We want to join NATO because we share the civilization values it protects, and because we want to take part in their protection. We are well aware that it is neither possible nor desirable to isolate Russia. We are, however, independent states, and we decide ourselves about our affiliations and our orientation. As we agreed during conversations with the representatives of central European nations, those who are taking part in this meeting in Prague, our countries have very similar views on the issues I have just mentioned. This surely is a gratifying circumstance, and it is to the benefit of us all. In closing, please allow me to express my firm belief that this gathering has become an important landmark on the road to the new, democratic and truly peaceful Europe, sharing firm and natural ties with the North American continent. The city of Yalta went down in history as a symbol of the division of Europe. I would be happy if today, the city of Prague could emerge as a symbol of Europe standing in alliance. [end recording]
