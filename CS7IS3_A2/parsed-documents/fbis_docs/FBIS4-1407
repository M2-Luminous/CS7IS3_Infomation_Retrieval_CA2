"Communism, just like racism, is a very serious threat to our country. If the ANC, for its own reasons, offers a safe harbor to the SACP, it should not expect that the church will look the other way for the sake of peace. Excusing and accepting atheistic communism is entirely too great a price to pay for `unity in South Africa.' The church dares not agree to that. Is the church engaging in `partisan politics' when it advises its members against voting for an anti-Christian party with a history of persecuting the church? If this is so, then it becomes the church's mission in this case to engage in `partisan politics,'" the lead article contends. The argument that the ANC's alliance with communists is comparable to the coalition between the Allies and the Soviet Union in World War II to bring Germany to its knees, is rejected. "The sad truth is that after World War II the Soviet Union left an even more terrible trail of blood in its wake than did Nazi Germany prior to and during the war." According to the article, the Reverend Kobus Van Der Westhuyzen, moderator of the Western Cape's most recently held synod, has said that the church cannot do otherwise than to tell the faithful that they cannot vote for communism. "Throughout the years the church has spoken out against communism, which advocates a form of atheism, and this is still the case. It is a pity that the ANC has not distanced itself from the SACP. It would have made its message easier." Dr. Pieter Bingle, minister of the Cape Town Reformed Congregation, told the newspaper that believers cannot support an ideology such as communism whose values are alien to the values of the Bible. "The communists are known for the fact that they will try anything--at any price and regardless of the path they pursue--to achieve their Marxist ideals." Prof. Pieter Potgieter, moderator of the most recent General Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church, denies that the church's discouraging people to vote for the SACP can be regarded as interfering in the political arena. He said that the SACP is not participating in the election as a separate party. Professor Potgieter said that a specific ideology is at issue here to which the church is opposed and the church believes that its members should take this into consideration when they go to vote.
