According to the SWG polling institute, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's party should register 25 percent, compared to 21 percent in the March 27-28 general elections, and the Left Democrats 23.2 compared to 20.4 percent. In the general elections, the vote was held under the new mixed electoral system with 75 percent of the seats filled by winner- takes-all voting and the remainder proportionally. For the Eurovote, there is proportional voting for all the seats. With a ban on the publication of poll results coming into force at midnight on Friday [27 May], SWG said that the ex-Christian Democrats of the People's Party would hold their ground in the centre of the political spectrum with 10.6 percent, down by 0.5 percent. The questioning of a sample of 6,600 voters on May 19 indicated that, in the conservative ranks, the hard-line rightists of National Alliance would return an unchanged 13.5 percent while the Northern League would lose 1.6 percent to 6.8 percent. The Pannella Slate, also elected in the right-wing alliance on March 27-28, should fall to 2.2 percent. On the left, the smaller parties were all seen as losing ground. SWG said the Network would drop from 1.9 to 1.1 percent, the Greens from 2.7 to 2.1 percent, Communist Refoundation from 6 to 5.9 percent, and the partnership between Socialists and Democratic Alliance from 3.4 to 3.1 percent.
