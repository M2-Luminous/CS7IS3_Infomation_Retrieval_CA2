Popov's version, the political prisoners amnesty act is an action that had been planned in the Kremlin. But is it really so? The Duma and Its `Harmlessness' The State Duma's central apparat is about to exceed the size of that under Khasbulatov. Counter to the Constitution, I. Rybkin is becoming a political figure of significance. Strangely enough, B. Yeltsin himself, as well as V. Chernomyrdin, is helping him in that. They interact not with the Duma council, as they are supposed to, but with him personally. The first most important stage--the takeover of the Duma apparat--may be considered a fait accompli. Which means: Its tremendous transportation capabilities (up to the use of private airlines); access to all government and military objects; equipping their offices with all sorts of government communications; the right to summon to the Duma any officials; and so on. Next on the agenda is the removal of the main political opponent--B. Yeltsin. It is possible in principle? They need the support of only 20-25 more deputies to reach the 298 votes needed to impeach the president. The Kremlin and Its `Geniuses' Let us leave the president himself outside our commentary. As is known, the retinue makes the king. How did it behave in the amnesty incident? Presidential advisers G. Satarov and Yu. Baturin undoubtedly are good as political scientists of the "Itogi" program, but in this case, with the help of that same television, they have demonstrated an inability to make on-the-spot decisions. It was disappointing and strange to realize that sometimes they did not know what was happening right next to them. The president's Chief of Staff, S. Filatov, did not make his position clear, either. The same goes for R. Orekhov, chief of the state-legal administration (GPU). As is known, the style of B. Yeltsin's retinue is to react frantically to events that have already happened. So today rush preparations are being made for the president's television address. The resignation of General Procurator A. Kazannik has been accepted. It came to the point that the president finally fired the head of the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] (formerly the KGB) N. Golushko. The investigative detention facility in Lefortovo was under the latter's jurisdiction. Let us remind our readers that B. Yeltsin had not dared to do this even after the October events, when the MB [Ministry of Security] demonstratively stayed out of the fray. * * * * One very much wants to believe that the Kremlin is conducting a sophisticated and farsighted policy. But the doubt persists: Are we not witnessing unpreparedness and confusion among the Kremlin chiefs as we did in the beginning of the October rebellion in Moscow?
