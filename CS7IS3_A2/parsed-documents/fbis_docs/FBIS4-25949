This is also a part of carrying out international promises, a spokesman from China's State Education Commission told XINHUA here today. On December 16 last year, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing attended the nine-nation education-for-all summit in New Delhi and signed the declaration together with the leaders and representatives from the other eight countries, Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan. China published the "Delhi Declaration" today. In the Delhi Declaration, the leaders of these nine highly populated developing countries reaffirmed their commitment to meeting the basic learning needs of all their people by making primary education universal. The spokesman said that the publication of the declaration in China would promote the reform and development of the nation's education agenda.
