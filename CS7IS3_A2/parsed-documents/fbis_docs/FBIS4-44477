Their effect was decisive particularly among workers in the cities, and it can be said that family planning work was more effective in the cities than the rural areas because the role and efficacy of economic rewards and penalties are inseparable. For a long period of time, whenever one analyzed why the urban birth rate was more effectively controlled than rural birth rate, one often assumed that it was because urban population had a higher educational and cultural level or better access to social services, rather than forthrightly recognizing that economic rewards and penalties were the most important reason, and that penalties were much more effective when applied in the cities than the rural areas. But those were the facts. During the 1970-80s, the effectiveness of economic rewards and penalties in family planning among urban workers could not be duplicated in the rural areas: urban workers who violated family planning rules were fined, denied bonuses, deprived of wage increase, demoted or even discharged. These penalties were aimed at the "life line" of workers at that time. One can just imagine in the era when the necessities of life depended on the coupons issued, the difficulties a worker faced if he lost his "iron rice bowl" and had to support an extra mouth at home; one can therefore easily appreciate why disobeying the system at that time was out of the question, and why urban workers, regardless of their desire for more children, did not dare give birth to more of them. According to a survey of women with one-child certificates in Beijing, their desired number of children was two.[.sup]1[/] In point of fact, under this reward-penalty system, workers in the cities were faced not with a balancing between rewards and penalties, but with a cruel choice between "existence" and "reproduction." Under normal circumstances, man would not give up "living" for "reproducing." In the urban areas, this forceful and effective system was relied upon to control the reproductive behavior of workers. From a long range perspective of population control, this type of control was very beneficial and necessary. Psychology recognizes that modifying man's reproductive behavior can help change man's idea toward reproduction. After a suitable reproductive behavior is developed and fortified, people would change their idea of reproduction and family and, in the end, when they see the various benefits to limiting family size, they would consciously practice family planning. Among urban populations today, the consensus is not to have more children, and some people even do not want any children, suggesting that a close relationship indeed exists between the former forceful and effective reward-penalty system and the subsequent change of reproductive behavior. In the rural areas, economic penalties in family planning never did carry the same degree of threat as in the cities. This is because the context in which economic penalties were applied was entirely different: peasants were not wage earners, they had no bonuses to withhold or wages to cut, and they were not afraid to be fired; they were responsible only for farming a few mu of land and keeping up their own shelters, and the basic principle of the socialist system itself limited the applicability of economic rewards and penalties in rural areas. Peasants who exceeded their birth quota could not be driven from the field they were responsible for farming; this explained why in the years when China's family planning work was proceeding smoothly, the rural birth rate was much higher than the urban birth rate. Data based on one percent sample of the 1987 population survey shows that the average number of births for all Chinese women age 15-64 was 1.87, but 2.44 in the rural areas; and that the overall rural birth rate was 2.6, while the urban birth rate was 1.3. But this is only one aspect of the problem, for we should recognize that since family planning has been in effect, the rural birth rate has actually declined by a large margin, and that economic rewards and penalties did play an important role in the decline. This was because of the fact that for over a decade, economic penalties for excess births could deprive a rural family of a large part of its income for the whole year, putting the family in straitened circumstances and even poverty. This was not entirely without mental pressure on families that exceeded their birth quota; they could not calmly overlook the economic penalty imposed. According to a study of villages in Hebei by Zhou Ping et al.,[.sup]2[/] if peasants with single children (whether boys or girls) could choose one of the following economic rewards if they agreed not to have the second child -- additional land, wavier of collective labor, or access to employment -- 57.3 percent, 56 percent and 68 percent respectively agreed; but if the penalty for having the second child involved money or land, the proportion of peasants that agreed not to have the second child dropped from 71 percent (without any penalty) to 12.7 percent. The investigators concluded therefore that to control births in the rural areas, a light penalty is better than no penalty, and a heavy penalty better than a light one. [Passage omitted] Difficulties Involved in Economic Penalties and Rewards in Family Planning In recent years, following the growth of rural commercial production enlivening the rural as well as urban economies, and particularly with the rise of a market economy, the reward-penalty system in family planning, which hitherto played an important role in controlling population increase, has run into difficulties. To begin with, the single-child reward has lost its psychological effect in the rural areas. One reason is the measly reward. The "single-child subsidy" of several yuan per month, unchanged for a decade or more, has only symbolic meaning today and no effect whatsoever on peasants' reproductive behavior. Another reason is that economic rewards in rural areas were never conscientiously applied. Economic rewards such as doubling the land allotment for home construction, planting vegetables and grain, or priority for school admission and promises of some other types of economic support, all of these have become "open lies." Peasants neither believed nor were they interested in these rewards. The writer personally learned from a survey that a peasant named Zhang from Yaojia hamlet, Chengbei village in Linsui county of Sichuan Province, was the only one in that hamlet to respond positively that year to the family planning appeal and therefore awarded the "one-child certificate." When his child was 12 years old and he still had not received a single fen of the "single child living subsidy," he petitioned the village authorities and after making repeated requests for more than a year, he was given 300 yuan after discount and deduction. As for an extra allotment of land for his own use growing vegetables or building his house, he received no response despite inquiries. On the other hand, other families with multiple-births actually received several more times his share of land which they had since celebrated bountiful harvests. When the reward-penalty system loses its credibility, families with single children are discouraged and couples planning on having only one child also become disheartened. In rural areas in China, many child-bearing age couples would rather pay the penalties and have more than one child, than accept the reward for having only one child. Peasants cannot be blamed for these kinds of results. The reward and penalty system, which encourages peasants to practice family planning, limit the number of children and focus on the quality of children, has reached the point of practically zero effectiveness. Furthermore, the reward-penalty system in rural areas today no longer carries the same clout, and peasants who exceed the birth quota are not at all afraid of the penalty, whether they have money to pay for it or not. The market economy has changed the former autarkic state of things in rural areas where eggs were bartered for salt and oil, and peasants income has since risen by a large margin; several hundreds or even thousands of yuan in penalty would no longer put many peasants in straitened circumstances or poverty, and they can come up with the money. Today, many excess-birth families in the rural areas invariably give birth only after consultations with parents and spouses and with the required penalty money in hand; therefore, imposing a fine on these newly rich peasants for excess birth amounts to no more than "pulling one hair of a cow," having no effect at all on their well being. To this group of peasants, the right to give birth has become a market commodity. In the context of family planning, such a viewpoint is wordless condemnation or bitter satire of the policy. And in another ironic twist, even poor peasant households are not afraid of the penalty, they dare give birth because they don't have any money anyway to pay the fine. This is another aspect of the difficulties the family planning reward-penalty system finds in the rural areas today. Peasants who have no money to pay the fine have no reason to be afraid of any penalty; this group of poor peasants in fact is a product of the developing market economy. When penalty is imposed on these peasants for breaking the family planning rules, they would invariably resort to tactics of "running wild, cheating, denying, or running away." Relying on such tactics, some having no qualm or fear of excess birth would, in complete equanimity, simply say that "having no money to pay, [I'd] have a life instead"; some would move [their possessions] to homes of friends and relatives so that the cadre inspector, seeing they hardly have a wok to cook in, could not in good conscience levy the fine; some would delay paying the fine, offering up a few yuan every six months, saying all the right things, and after three or four years, stop paying altogether; others would threaten their neighbors and create a scene in the village so the people dare not reveal that their poverty was make-believe; still others would utilize their relationships with friends and relatives to obtain their share of land for growing vegetables and building houses; and finally there are those who would simply move away and disappear completely. All these make it almost impossible for the planning reward-penalty system to fulfill its role. Turning to the urban areas, because the businesses need to transform their operating system and enter into market competition, they need to completely reform the system of employment; with the "iron rice bowl" no longer intact, and a system of wages and bonuses set up in replacement, workers and enterprises have room to maneuver, and workers are free to move in response to market demands. Therefore, the penalty in the reward-penalty system which used to get workers "by the throat" as it were, no longer carries that threat, and family planning effectiveness correspondingly declines, and the at-one-time most effective reward-penalty system now finds itself mired in difficulties. We should not treat lightly the fact that effectiveness of the family planning reward-penalty system has diminished in a market economy, because to do so can revive the workers' desire for two or more children and, in time, lead to a backlash against family planning in the cities. This is particularly true for townships and villages below the county level. [passage omitted] Footnotes: 1. WENHUI BAO, 11 July, 1991 2.
