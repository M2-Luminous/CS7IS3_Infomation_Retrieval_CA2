Many special courts were set up to handle such cases, said Gao Changli, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, at the national conference of presidents of higher people's court, which ended here today. "The courts protect the legal rights of all parties involved, without discrimination against any side, helping create a better legal environment for China's opening up to the world," said Gao. With more investments coming to China's mainland, and the development of foreign trade and economic co-operation, the economic cases concerning outside companies have been surging in China's border and coastal regions, Gao noted. He said the number of such economic and maritime cases in 1993 increased by 36.6 percent and 41.33 percent, respectively over the year before. President of the Higher Court of Shanghai Hu Ruibang said that the Shanghai courts have been exercising independent judicial power in economic cases concerning foreign companies, in accordance to China's laws and the international conventions China is a party to, and in line with the norms of international conduct. In handling cases concerning companies from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, Chinese laws and policies are adhered to, he said. The overriding principle for the courts is to protect equally the legal rights of all parties, Hu said. The Shanghai courts also make efforts to make Chinese laws known to the foreign business people, the judge said. He offered an example: A Swedish company decided to withdraw its business from Shanghai after it was sued by a Chinese company, because of suspicion it would be discriminated against by a Chinese court. However, Hu said, after the mediation of a Shanghai court, the two companies reached an agreement. The Swedish company's confidence was boosted and it decided to invest further in Shanghai, Hu said. President of the Shenzhen Intermediate Court Wang Changying said a special court, the second economic court, has been established to handle cases concerning foreign companies or companies from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. It is the first of its kind in China, he noted. He explained that this is part of the judiciary's efforts to safeguard and promote the reform and opening up of China's leading special economic zone. The court has so far handled 700 cases, with 900 million yuan (about 112 million U.S. dollars) involved, he said.
