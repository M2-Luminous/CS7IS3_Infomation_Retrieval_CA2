Hong Kong, China's main gateway for international trade, would also lose between 19 to 26 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.4 to 3.3 billion US) in income, while 54,000 to 75,000 people would lose their jobs, the trade department said in its latest assessment. "A reduction of up to 77 billion Hong Kong dollars (9.87 billion US) worth of re-export is double the impact that we estimated in 1990," Christopher Jackson, deputy director-general of trade, said. "This is largely the result of the very rapid growth in Hong Kong's re-export of China-made goods to the United States over the past few years," he said. US President Bill Clinton has demanded improvements in China's record on human rights, trade and arms sales, before renewing its MFN status for another year. Renewal falls due in June. Since Friday, China has detained eight dissidents in defiance of US warnings that improvements in its human rights record are a precondition to MFN renewal. The issue is likely to top the agenda when US Secretary of State Warren Christopher visits Beijing on Friday. The withdrawal of China's MFN status would also have a significant adverse effect on manufacturing investment ventures and other production projects by Hong Kong and foreign companies in China, Jackson said. "We have to step up our lobbying activities in Washington," said Jackson in order to impress upon members of the US administration and Congress the damage which MFN withdrawal would do to Hong Kong and to American interests in the region.
