Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference that Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), explained his party's economy-spurring program adopted Tuesday. Hosokawa replied that he will try to reflect the LDP's ideas as far as possible in the government's stimulus package his cabinet is to approve Thursday, Takemura said. The additional economic program is expected to amount to 15 trillion to 16 trillion yen, becoming Japan's largest pump-primer ever. Earlier, Kono told reporters after emerging from talks with the premier, "I emphasized it would be a disaster if meaningful and substantial stimulus steps were not taken this time," he added. During the 90-minute meeting, Hosokawa and Kono agreed on the need for a successful Japan-U.S. summit in Washington on February 11, Takemura said. Hosokawa will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton to assess progress in stalemated bilateral trade talks. Although the LDP chief pressed a demand for a large-scale income tax cut to breathe new life into the stagnant economy, there was no discussion on how to offset the tax reduction, Takemura said. The government and ruling coalition parties are making last-ditch efforts to reach a consensus over whether to link a major income tax cut to a future hike in the consumption tax. Hosokawa was accompanied by Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Takemura. Kono attended the meeting along with Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. Hosokawa and Kono concurred they will hold informal talks in the future, as the need arises, Takemura said. The premier said he would like to meet again with Kono after returning from the United States to discuss the results of the meeting with Clinton, according to the chief cabinet secretary. Kono gave no clear response, Takemura said. The LDP leader told reporters he will hold talks with the premier if he thinks it will be "meaningful," adding he has no plan to meet with Hosokawa on a regular basis. Whether he will meet again with the premier, Kono said, depends on how much the LDP's economic stimulus program is reflected in the government's package.
