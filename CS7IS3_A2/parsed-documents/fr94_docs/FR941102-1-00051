FR941102-1-00051 FR941102-1-00014 FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION 46 CFR Part 540 [Docket No. 94&hyph;06; Docket No. 94&hyph;21 ] Financial Responsibility Requirements for Nonperformance of Transportation; Inquiry Into Alternative Forms of Financial Responsibility for Nonperformance of Transportation AGENCY: Federal Maritime Commission. ACTION: Clarification. SUMMARY: The language of the Notice of Inquiry published in this matter is revised to clarify that we are seeking comment on accepting, as evidence of financial responsibility, liens, mortgages or other security instruments. DATES: Comments due on or before November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments (original and 20 copies) to: Joseph C. Polking, Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol St., NW., Washington, DC 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5725. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bryant L. VanBrakle, Director, Bureau of Tariffs, Certification and Licensing, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol St., NW., Washington, DC 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5796. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'' or ``FMC'') published a Notice of Inquiry into alternative forms of financial responsibility for nonperformance of transportation in the October 14, 1994 Federal Register (59 FR 52133). Subsequent review after publication disclosed that the Notice of Inquiry failed to include language to make clear that we are seeking comment on accepting, as evidence of financial responsibility, liens, mortgages or other security instruments. Accordingly, the Notice is being revised in the following respects: 1. The second sentence of Part B (``Reinforced Self-Insurance'') is revised to read: The Commission is concerned that its present self-insurance standards may be inadequate, but it will consider an approach whereby it would restore its former ((net worth = 100% UPR) + (working capital = 100% UPR)) standard,17 but require prospective self-insurers to provide alternative coverage for a percentage ( e.g. , 50% or 25%) of their uncovered UPR, through either a traditional guaranty, surety, escrow agreement, lien or mortgage or other security instrument, or through participation in a coverage association along the above-described lines. 2. The last sentence of Part C (``Coverage Requirements'') is revised to read as follows: We also solicit comments on liens or mortgages or any other form of security or proposal that would provide adequate coverage for the travelling public. By the Commission. Joseph C. Polking, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27087 Filed 11&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6730&hyph;01&hyph;M
