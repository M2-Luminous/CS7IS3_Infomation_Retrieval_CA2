She cast her ballot in Wellington, New Zealand, several hours ahead of the people in South Africa, as a result of New Zealand's time zone. New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, a friend of Mrs. Paintin, watched her vote. People in foreign countries can cast their ballots at about 200 polling stations in 80 countries. An IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] commissioner, Mrs. Helen Suzman, said there was unprecedented enthusiasm in foreign countries for the election. Another commissioner, Mr. Zack Yacoob, said the IEC estimated that between 25 and 30 percent of the total percentage poll would comprise special votes. Special votes close at 7:00 PM tonight. The election in South Africa itself began a short while ago when people began casting special votes. Local special votes include patients in hospitals and maternity homes, residents at homes for the elderly and infirm, and members of the security forces who'll be on duty on the two official voting days. Prisoners who are entitled to vote will also cast special votes. Criminals who have been found guilty of serious crimes will not be permitted to vote in the election. This applies to prisoners convicted of murder, rape, and robbery with aggravating circumstances, and who have been sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine. Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte said after a cabinet meeting in Cape Town that the government was not prepared to depart from the principle contained in the existing Electoral Act. He said the negotiating council had been a party to the act, and accordingly had been agreed to by all the parties at the time. Mr. Schutte pointed out that such a restriction on voting rights to prisoners was in accordance with internationally accepted norms.
