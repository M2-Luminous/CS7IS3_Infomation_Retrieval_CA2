I. Introduction On September 9, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of regular and long-term index options on the S&P/Barra Growth Index (``Growth Index'') and the S&P/Barra Value Index (``Value Index'') (each individually an ``Index,'' and collectively the ``Indexes''). The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on November 19, 1993. 3 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On May 25, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 4 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33192 (November 12, 1993), 58 FR 61117 (November 19, 1993). 4 In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE proposes to: (1) Establish position limits for options on the Growth and Value Indexes of 125,000 contracts on the same side of the market, with no more than 75,000 contracts in the series with the nearest expiration month; (2) establish 225,000 contracts on the same side of the market as the maximum position size that will be eligible for treatment under the Exchange's hedge exemption rule provisions; and (3) aggregate positions in Growth Index options and Value Index options for purposes of position and exercise limits, including applicable hedge exemptions. Additionally, Amendment No. 1 amends proposed Interpretation .01(a)(v) and (vi) to Rule 24.9 to provide that the strike intervals between Growth Index and Value Index options will be no less than $2.50 only if the strike prices are less than $200. See Letter from Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, Research Department, CBOE, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Oversight, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated May 25, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). II. Description of Proposal A. General The CBOE proposes to trade options on the Growth and Value Indexes, stock indexes calculated by Standard & Poor's (``S&P'') (or its designee) and maintained by Barra, Inc. (``Barra'') pursuant to a license agreement between Barra and S&P. The CBOE also proposes to list long-term options (``Index LEAPS'') on either the full-value of each Index or reduced-value Growth and Value Indexes that will be computed at one-tenth of the value of the respective Indexes. Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes will trade independent of and in additional to regular options on the Indexes traded on the Exchange, however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular options on the Indexes will be aggregated.
