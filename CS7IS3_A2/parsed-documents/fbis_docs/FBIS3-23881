The bloc was founded early in 1992 and was registered at the Tatarstan Ministry of Justice on 27 January 1994. At the conference three candidate deputies from the RIZ bloc presented their programs: V. Belyayev, leader of the multinational movement "Accord," from Moskovskiy Okrug No. 24; V. Mikhaylov, Tatarstan Supreme Soviet people's deputy, from Privolzhskiy Okrug No. 27; and Yu. Rostovshchikov, deputy chairman of the Vakhitovskiy rayon soviet and leader of the Tatarstan social democrats, from Naberezhno-Chelninskiy Okrug No. 25. The participants at the conference were greatly concerned by the fact that there are several prodemocratic candidates running for election in the okrugs. The general opinion was that this situation could lead to the scattering of the votes of democratically inclined voters and to the defeat of the democrats in the elections, particularly in the Privolzhskiy Okrug. Therefore, a resolution was passed recommending that parties and movements belonging to the "Equality and Legality" bloc refrain from supporting candidates not nominated by the bloc. After the resolution was passed a press conference was held by Russian State Duma Deputy I. Grachev and candidate deputies V. Belyayev, V. Mikhaylov, and Yu. Rostovshchikov.
