After seven years of negotiations, new rules have been established to govern world trade. The agreement sets up rules for establishing tariffs, financial services, and the overall trade spectrum that range from agriculture to intellectual property. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who is in Marrakesh, said the agreement will result in an average reduction of 40 percent in the tariffs of developed countries. In his opinion, the agreement will benefit Brazilian exports. The agreement also will benefit areas that had been outside the GATT framework, such as agriculture and textiles. [Begin Amorim recording] In the case of agriculture, this agreement will be very important for Brazil because our exports of some agricultural products and even agroindustrial products such as soybean, oil soybean, and chicken were competing with subsidized products that came primarily from the EC and the United States. Subsidies will not be eliminated, but instead of continuing to grow, this trend will now be reversed and subsidies will have to decline. [end recording] Amorim noted that the World Trade Organization, which will be created by the GATT member countries, will be charged with supervising the agreement. Today Amorim addressed the GATT general assembly and emphasized the agreement's positive aspects and Brazil's hope that developed countries would discontinue protectionist and arbitrary measures.
