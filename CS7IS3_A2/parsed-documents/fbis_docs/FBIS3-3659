How on earth should we handle this situation that emerges from the process of advancement and development? The deputies of the people's congress and the members of the provincial committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], who were attending the current sessions, frankly and sincerely aired their views and suggestions. According to the information dispatched by reporters (Fan Shijun) and (Zhang Guoxing) from the sessions, Hebei Province effected a relatively big increase in financial revenues in 1993 to make a new breakthrough of historical significance. According to statistics, the province's financial revenue totaled 14.39 billion yuan, an increase of 44.4 percent over the previous year, exceeding the average national increase level by 4.5 percentage points. In 1993, governments and financial and tax departments at all levels in the province kept the idea of invigorating the economy firmly in mind, and tried all possible means to realize the program on invigorating Hebei's economy as well as various other objectives. Major indicators were that various fields raised and circulated funds to accelerate the construction of key projects, continued to increase input in agriculture, continued to support the technological renovation of large and medium-sized enterprises, and continued to launch the activities of creating high-revenue counties and eliminating subsidy receiving counties, yielding remarkable results. Fengnan and Huanghua counties's realization of 100 million yuan in financial revenue in 1992, was followed by Qian, Fengning, Zunhua, Wuan, Fengrun, Yutian, and Hengshui so that they joined 1993's list of counties with 100 million yuan in financial revenue. [passage omitted] In 1993, the province made a breakthrough of historical significance in financial revenues that was fully affirmed by the deputies of the provincial people's congress and the members of the provincial CPPCC committee who were attending the current sessions. However, the deputies and the members also worried about the tight financial circumstances in some localities. In particular, some localities were unable to issue wages on schedule, that caused great concern among deputies and members. Chen Hui, vice chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee and deputy director of the provincial committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, revealed in her speech to the session that according to the statistics compiled early this year, the province as a whole owed teachers of primary and middle schools a large amount of wages, thus not only affecting teachers' enthusiasm but also forcing some key teachers to change jobs frequently. Director of the province's financial department, Zhang Xianpu, analyzes the reasons for the large increase of financial revenue in some parts of the province, and the tight financial situation in others, in his report on the implementation of the 1993 provincial budget and the 1994 draft budget: The first reason was that although the province as a whole effected a relatively big increase in financial revenues last year, the increase was mainly brought about by localities at or above the city and prefectural levels, and the increase in localities at or below the county level was not as great. Only 28 counties and county-level cities surpassed the national revenue average. Some counties and county-level cities did not effect an increase in their revenues, and some even experienced a decline. The second reason was that factors for revenue increases due to policy increased, and, in particular, appropriations used as wages increased. The third reason was the low quality of many products of the province, and the difficulties in production and management that was experienced by some enterprises. The fourth reason was the indulgence in serious extravagance and waste by some localities and units which incurred huge losses of state property. [passage omitted]
