It says it is difficult for an Arab to see brothers shed each other's blood in the same country, destroying everything that the one Yemeni people have both in the north and south. In today's editorial, the paper notes that since it began a few months ago the Yemeni crisis has portended grave consequences and that it entails grave dangers, especially since the exchange of air bombardments in Aden and Sanaa and resolutions declaring the vice president illegitimate and dismissing the defense minister. The paper says the Arabs have not learned much from the hard lessons they have suffered in their modern history. What is happening in Yemen is the best proof of this, as the Declaration of Unity through harmony and peace is retracted and replaced by war and conflict. The newspaper notes Egypt's efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis before it worsens. President Mubarak, it says, has sent an envoy who has almost become a resident there. So far he has addressed two appeals to the Yemeni brothers to stop subjecting their country to destruction, but all this has been in vain.
