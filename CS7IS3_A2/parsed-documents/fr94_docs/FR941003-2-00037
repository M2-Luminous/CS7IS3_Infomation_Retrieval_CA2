FR941003-2-00037 FR941003-2-00031 Health Care Financing Administration [MB&hyph;84&hyph;NC] RIN 0938&hyph;AG77 Medicaid Program; Charges for Vaccine Administration Under the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Notice with comment period. SUMMARY: This notice with comment period lists, by State, the interim regional maximum charges that providers may impose for the administration of pediatric vaccines to Federally vaccine-eligible children under the Pediatric Immunization Distribution Program, more commonly known as the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. This notice also specifies the methodology that HCFA used to establish the maximum administration charges. In addition, the notice provides States that purchase vaccines for all children the option to use these maximum charges or devise their own, and clarifies that State Medicaid agencies may establish lower fees than these maximums if they can provide assurances of access to immunizations for Medicaid eligible children to the same extent as the general population. The publication of these administration charges is essential to implementation of the VFC program, which is mandated by law to become operational on October 1, 1994. We intend that this list be used on an interim basis until we issue a separate Federal Register document that will finalize these maximum regional charges and respond to any relevant public comments. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marge Sciulli, (410) 966&hyph;0691. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93), Public Law 103&hyph;66, created the Pediatric Vaccine Distribution Program (more commonly known and hereafter referred to as the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program), which takes effect on October 1, 1994. Section 13631 of OBRA '93 added section 1902(a)(62) to the Social Security Act (the Act) to require that States provide for a program for the purchase and distribution of pediatric vaccines to program-registered providers for the immunization of vaccine eligible children in accordance with section 1928 of the Act. Section 13631 redesignated the existing section 1928 as section 1931 and inserted a new section 1928. The new section 1928 requires each State to establish a VFC Program (which may be administered by the State department of health) under which certain specified groups of children are entitled to receive qualified pediatric immunizations without charge for the cost of the vaccine.
