During the meeting, the Albanian delegation stressed that the Albanian democratic government considers Albanian-Greek relations to be very important not only at the bilateral level, but also for the whole region. It has shown goodwill for the normal and useful development of these relations on the basis of the principle of reciprocity and noninterference in each other's internal affairs. Nevertheless, the Albanian delegation pointed out that unfortunately, we determine that we have recently been confronted with a series of incidents and provocations, but there is no precedence for the 10 April act of terrorism. The furious reactivation and conspicuous and uninhibited aggressiveness of the Vorio-Epirus chauvinist circles, the irresponsible anti-Albanian statements issued by several high-level Greek state personalities, the exploitation of certain elements of the Greek minority in Albania to achieve expansionist ambitions, the provocative interference -- contrary to every diplomatic ethic -- of Greek diplomats in the internal affairs of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Albanian state, the absence of a serious commitment by the Greek Government to throw light on the tragic event in Peshkepi and make criminals legally responsible underscore these incidents. The Albanian side asked the Greek Government to immediately take measures to prevent the frenzied warmongering propaganda of radio stations installed in southern Greece, Corfu, and Konjice, and publications by the Institute of Vorio-Epirus Studies in Ioanniana, which call for making territorial claims so far as to include armed intervention against Albania, as well as the measures necessary so that the terroristic acts are not repeated in the future. Its public stance should be clearly dissociated from the absurd chauvinistic claims directed toward the south of Albania. For his part, after assessing Albanian-Greek relations to be very important, the Greek foreign minister reiterated his willingness to cooperate for a rapid normalization of bilateral relations and assented that the Greek Government will fulfill the aforementioned demand. Concerning the investigation of the event, the Albanian side insisted that the Greek side agree to an investigation from an international unbiased commission, assessing that both sides should be interested in an objective and impartial assessment of evidence. For his part, Mr. Papoulias objected to the Albanian side's opinion and, referring to the Ioannina meeting between the Public Order Ministries of both countries, proposed the activation of a joint commission between the relevant Public Order Ministries. The Albanian side explained that the freeze on the execution of the decision to reduce Greek Embassy staff does not mean its non- execution and stressed that, within a reasonable deadline and in conformity with the Vienna Convention provisions, the staff of the representations of both countries will be reduced to the extent necessary for their normal functioning at the present level of relations. During the meeting, they also discussed other aspects of Albanian-Greek relations, such as Albanian economic emigration in Greece, border administration between both countries, the presence of Albanians since earlier times, and the Cam issue in all its aspects. The Greek foreign minister laid stress on the reactivation of the joint Albanian-Greek commission and the need to open a branch of the Greek National Bank in Tirana, and also referred to the draft agreement on seasonal employment that the Greek side has furnished to the Albanian side. The Albanian delegation stressed that the Albanian side is studying the aforementioned issues and pointed put that the draft agreement on seasonal employment does not solve the question of legalizing the Albanian present economic emigration in Greece. For its part, the Greek side confirmed that this draft agreement will provide the legal framework for the future, but it will also be a basis for future emigration. In conclusion, both sides expressed the sentiment that the climate of Albanian-Greek relations has been aggravated, and all efforts should be made to create an atmosphere of bilateral confidence. The Albanian side stressed that it does not acknowledge responsibility for the situation created in these relations and that, as always, it will be ready and willing to render, through dialogue, constructive assistance to normalize relations between Albania and Greece, which are in the interest of relations between both countries and the entire Balkan region.
