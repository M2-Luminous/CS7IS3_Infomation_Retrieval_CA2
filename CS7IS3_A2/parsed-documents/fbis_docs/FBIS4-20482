All of them were toxoproteins being composed of 122 amino acid residues. The three toxoproteins' LD[.sub]50[/] to mice were 0.075, 0.51 and 6.6 mg/kg respectively. Toxicological analysis conducted on chicken neck muscle indicated that AgTx-1 and AgTx-2 were presynaptic neurotoxins which only blocked transmission between neurosynapsis, and both AgTx-1 and AgTx-2 had the same N-terminal 32-peptide sequence. The AgTx-3 was identified as a newly discovered cytotoxin that paralyzed the muscle cells only.
