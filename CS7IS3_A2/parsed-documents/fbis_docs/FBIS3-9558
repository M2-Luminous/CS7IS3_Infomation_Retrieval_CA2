All three were associated with the former government of Vladimir Meciar, which fell in a no confidence vote earlier this month. Despite protests from the erstwhile opposition, which is today's government, Vanko was named to the top NKU post as a deputy of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The vote was preceded by a stormy debate full of accusations that the NKU was misused under Meciar's government for political purposes and was "indirectly" run by the government office, headed by Meciar colleague Ivan Lexa. Others accused the new government of intending to do basically the same thing. During the evening, members of the HZDS and its former coalition partner, the Slovak National Party (SNS), demonstrated in front of the parliament building.
