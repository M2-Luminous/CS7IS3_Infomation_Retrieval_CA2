[passage omitted]. O brothers, O my kinfolk, O masses of our struggling people, O revolutionaries, strugglers, and mujahidin of our struggling people. I am addressing you to express my pride, and that of your brothers in the Palestinian leadership, at this splendid steadfastness and this courageous attitude that shows the great nature of our people, especially at times of trial and difficulties. After the hideous slaughter perpetrated by the killer settlers and the occupying army, our entire people rose to defend its existence, sanctities, dignity, and its hope while waiting for the moment to end the hateful Israeli occupation, the imposing of the national authority stage, and then the forming of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. I am addressing you in the sincere and clear words of those who have borne the trust and, at the same, have stood ready to sacrifice their lives for our people to secure its future, dignity, freedom, and independence. I tell you with all brotherhood and frankness -- given the importance of persistence and steadfastness in these difficult days in which we must always ignore the attempts by some to spread programmed rumors and a climate of frustration and despair -- I tell you with all frankness that we are facing one of the fiercest battles at a time when our people, under the PLO leadership, is forcefully knocking at the doors of independence and freedom, and at a time when the international community is looking forward to seeing the Palestinian rights realized with the rhythm of successive events. This is one of a series of our battles that we have been continuously fighting since the first bullet was fired on 1 January 1965, a fact that was crowned with the outbreak of the great national Intifadah that is continuing and escalating, and which will continue and will further escalate until the objectives of our people are realized, i.e. to end the occupation and realize the independence and freedom for our people, land, and sanctities. The settlements were, and still are, one of the obstacles that faced us and still faces us in our talks with the Israelis. The international community and decisions stand beside us in connection with these settlements that are an obstacle on the road to peace, therefore, our faith was never shaken for a moment that it would be the fate of these settlement to disappear, and the fate of the settlers would be to depart from our land because what was based on a myth was void in origin. Events have proven the truth of our stance and international public opinion realized the enormity of this matter, and the issue of disarming the settlers became the prelude for the dismantlement of the settlement and its removal from our land. This cooperation between units from the Israeli Army and armed settlers that we are now facing is the same as the one that our Algerian brothers faced during the first and second Evian talks. We confronted this ordeal in the same way as we have previously faced numerous ordeals. It had only strengthened our faith and belief in the strength of our right and the justice of our aims. In the past, we have suffered a great deal. This suffering consolidated our belief and conviction in the strength of our right and the legitimacy of our goals. Consequently, we stressed this stance, as dictated by national responsibility, regarding the need to provide international protection for our people; and to bring the international community face to face with its responsibilities and confront this terrible plan. While we were engaged in a diplomatic battle inside the UNSC [UN Security Council] to arm ourselves with an international resolution; and while we were discussing it within the Palestinian leadership, and debating the ways to deal with this battle; some people, who are professional in sowing chaos, were pronouncing unjust verdicts and writing false statements. We did not pay attention to their fabricated lies because we have been, and still are, refusing to be dragged into marginal battles. We have, and still consider that the battle against the occupying enemy forms the basis for the confrontation against the occupiers; rather than the deliberate sowing of confusion by all the enemies of the Palestinian dream, the Palestinian homeland, and the Palestinian existence [Koranic verse]. Brothers, I would like to say that we have remained loyal to the trust, promise and pledge; the pledge and promise of the pure innocent martyrs. The honor of responsibility warrants us to stand steadfast against all trials and incidents whose impacts can only strengthen our faith, might, and resolve. At times of suffering and challenges, we should all stand united, with a united heart, we should think in a responsible way and search for all methods of confrontation, including resorting to help from international public opinion and the international legitimate institutions, foremost of which is the United Nations, international and Arab institutions such as the Arab League, the Nonaligned Movement, the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization], the OAU [Organization of African Unity], and all our friends around the world. This is a savage battle brought about by the Hebron massacre, the Jerusalem massacre, the 'Ayn Garah massacre, the massacre of Sabra and Shatila, Dir Yasin, and also the difficult confrontations in Jinin Rafah, the Triangle [as heard], al-Nasiraha, and al-Naqab. We have suspended negotiations with the Israelis, and we have clearly stated that these negotiations will not resume until our people receive all guarantees for international protection, the dismantling of settlements that threaten to sabotage the peace negotiations, and to punish the perpetrators of the crime. The battle will not stop at that level because we have a lot of details that lie ahead of us, and on our agenda are fateful issues that require fair solutions in order to consolidate the just peace. At the fore of these issues is the issue of Jerusalem that America refuses to mention in the Security Council's resolution, the issue of the refugees, the dismantling of the settlements, the borders, the gaining of total national independence, and the creation of our independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. [passage omitted] Among the urgent issues is the issue of our brothers who are detained in the occupation prisons. We will not rest easy nor will we close our eyes to sleep before we ensure the freedom of all of them so they can contribute to the battle of building our national authority and our independent state. We had strongly rejected all enemy attempts to divide them or to classify them. We had also rejected the freeing of Fatah detainees alone, although they were the majority of the detainees and insisted on the same treatment for all of them as they are all sons of Palestine and the beloved of Palestine. I address you at these difficult moments and ask you to stand in one [solid] rank to face up to this new situation resulting from the attack of the herds of settlers, with the collusion and planning of some enemy army units, on the unarmed civilians while performing their holy prayers at the holy al-Ibrahimi mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan. I appeal to the sons of our people everywhere to close ranks and to realize the national unity and to be as the heart of one man at time of difficulty and trial, for we are the people of martyrs, the people of the revolutionaries, the people of Mujahidin, and to cast out of their ranks all those who incite sedition and division. For despite this dark night the light of dawn is sure to come. Dawn and victory is certainly coming. [passage omitted] The Israeli soldiers are still escalating their oppression, aggression, and crimes that include opening fire on women, children, and old people. Israel continues to violate the Declaration of Principles, and it is our right to resort to all legitimate methods, to retaliate, and to seek favorable prospects. (It is our right) to quell the plots by circles against peace in the Israeli military establishment, by the armed settlers whose hands have been let loose more than at any previous time, to cause destruction, and to spread chaos in an attempt to stop the wheel of history. We truly want peace but we refuse to surrender. We want just peace and we reject surrender and subjugation, just as we refuse to transform the peace agreement into an submission agreement. I tell you that Palestinian blood will not be cheap. It is the blood that lights the flame of our struggle [Jihad] and our fight that has not died down and, with God's help, will not die down. Because of our loyalty to that blood, we will take all measures and stances made necessary by the higher national interests for our people. Greetings to all our steadfast sons in Hebron and in every corner of our beloved homeland. [passage omitted] In these days, during which humanity celebrated International Woman's Day, on 8 March, the heroic Palestinian woman was standing with steadfastness under the ceiling of fire [as heard], bidding farewell to the martyrs with ululations and confronting the occupiers, their bullets, and their oppression with rage and sacrifice. Salutations to the great Palestinian woman, and we pledge that she will, in the coming years, celebrate her festival in the comfort of a free, independent, and democratic homeland for a free and revolutionary people. Brothers and sisters, I renew to you the pledge, and I renew to you the promise, and I tell you that tragedies will only increase our strength, faith, and firmness; the hammer breaks the glass, but forms iron [into something useful]. We have made quick strides and offered thousands of martyrs, and we will not stop the struggle in all its forms before our people receive all their rights. Let the victorious march continue; the road to an independent state still requires sacrifice, struggle, and suffering from us, but it is our will, which cannot be defeated, and our determination, which cannot be dented, to do so. Blessed be you, O our people; blessed be you, O our people, O people of generosity and sacrifice; blessed be you, O people of martyrs. [passage omitted] It is revolution until victory.
