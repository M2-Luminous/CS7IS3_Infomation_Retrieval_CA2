"We are delighted with the result," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in announcing that Washington has decided to drop retaliatory moves against Japan. The cellular phone trade agreement, announced in Tokyo on Saturday, came five days before Kantor was set to unveil a list of Japanese products that would be subject to punitive import tariffs. Kantor hailed the accord, which commits the Japanese Government to underwrite a commitment from Motorola's Japanese partner to expand the American cellular system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area, as the sort "results-oriented" trade pacts Washington wants from Japan in the future. "That is what portends for the future in our efforts to open (the Japanese) markets," Kantor said at a news conference. The agreement, which Motorola and its Japanese partner Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) concluded under prodding from U.S. and Japanese Governments, has set specific terms the Japanese firm must meet by December 1995. Top among them includes a commitment by IDO, which operates both a Motorola and a rival Japanese cellular system, to build 159 relay stations over an 18-month period. That infrastructure facility would enable the Motorola system to cover 95 percent of the cellular market in a heavily populated corridor extending from Tokyo to Nagoya. At present, the Motorola cellular system can be used only in 40 percent of the localities in the Tokyo-Nagoya market. The Motorola-IDO accord also commits the Japanese cellular operator to freeze the development of the rival cellular system developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and launch a sales campaign to promote the Motorola system. Under a separate government-to-government accord, the Japanese Government has also pledged to "monitor and oversee" the completion of IDO commitments and review progress with the U.S. Government every three months. "This agreement validates our results-oriented approach," Kantor said. President Bill Clinton also hailed the cellular phone accord in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday as "a big win for everyone." "Workers in the United States will gain because the agreement means more demand for cellular telephones and related equipment made in America. Japanese consumers win because they'll have access to better service and better technology at better prices," the president said. Motorola President Christopher Galvin, who spoke to reporters after Kantor's press conference, said the infrastructure facilities IDO has undertaken to build will give his firm 300 million dollars in extra business and create "hundreds of jobs" in the U.S.
