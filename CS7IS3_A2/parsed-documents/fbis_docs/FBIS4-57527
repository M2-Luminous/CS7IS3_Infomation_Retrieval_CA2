If they choose to return to the areas where armed clashes are taking place, the Army must be there, and that is why it is impossible to accept their petitions to withdraw the Army. In addition, this is not contained within the agreement. If they do not heed the established legal order, the return of refugees will be suspended, De Leon categorically stated. De Leon noted that he is not willing to accept responsibility for the refugees' security despite his obligation as representative of national unity and the state to seek to maintain the security and peace of Guatemalans. It so happens, however, that they are coming with improprieties, demands, and lies because they begin doing this once they reach Guatemala, in addition to manipulating the people. Two or three leaders are manipulating the rest of the refugees, who only want to come and work their lands, and this is why we must be firm. Either they comply or we suspend their return, De Leon pointed out. De Leon said that on the afternoon of 15 May, Mauricio Rodriguez, dirctor of the Special Commission for Assistance to Repatriated People, asked him for authorization to suspend the return, which he agreed to do in light of the official's judgment and devotion. He went on to explain that the intransigence displayed by the CCPP leaders is regrettable and disappointing because behind it all there is an entire process by the mediating group, of which he was a member. The mediation and the support groups established the mechanisms and stages. De Leon argued that attitudes like those of the said leaders, who even risk the lives of the refugees, show that this manipulation exists and those who have been close and know in advance the movements and the elements involved in the return operation find it undeniable. De Leon reiterated that all Guatemalans abroad, in accordance with the Constitution and government guarantee, are entitled to return any time. This is also true in light of the agreements signed in August 1992 and January 1993. The government is willing to continue with mass and voluntary returns, but only if the conditions set are respected. They cannot claim they will organize their own civilian authority, De Leon concluded.
