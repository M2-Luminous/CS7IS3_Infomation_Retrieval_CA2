The Department of the Navy co-scheduled the scoping meeting with the regular meeting of the Building Economic Solutions Together Team (BEST), who is preparing a Re-Use plan.

The proposed action to be evaluated in the EIS involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of Naval Base Charleston for subsequent reuse. The public scoping meeting's purpose is to determine the scope of issues addressed by the EIS and to identify the significant issues related to this action. The Department of the Navy will hold public scoping meetings for this EIS at four different locations: Wednesday, May 11, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Chicora Neighborhood Center at 2012 Success Street, North Charleston, South Carolina; Wednesday, May 11, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the North Charleston City Hall, 4900 LaCross Road, North Charleston, South Carolina; Thursday, May 12, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Berkeley County Office Building, 223 North Live Oak Drive, Moncks Corner, South Carolina; and Thursday, May 12, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the District 2 Administrative Office Building at 102 Greenwave Boulevard, Summerville, South Carolina.
