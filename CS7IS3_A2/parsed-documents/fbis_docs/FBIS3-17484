Nazarbayev had serious grounds to change the time of departure: the joint working group in charge of preparations for Kazakhstan-Russia summit talks failed to reach complete understanding on all items put on the agenda of the forthcoming talks. Most likely, Nazarbayev wants to get acquainted with the sides' viewpoints on the spot to be ready to make appropriate political decisions and, possibly, even introduce appropriate adjustments to the position of his country's experts. Local analysts believe that similar steps are now being taken by the Russian side as well. The two states attach paramount importance to maintaining and developing the historically established close mutual relations. Therefore, it is highly probable that the positions of Kazakhstan and Russia will draw closer together even before the two leaders hold an official meeting. As far as differences are concerned, sources close to the leadership of the republic name several of them, including problems connected with the future of Baykonur cosmodrome, the conclusion of a customs union between the two countries, the elimination of the aftermath of the tests of nuclear weapons on the territory of Kazakhstan, a prolongation of the agreement to maintain the specialisation of defence-industry enterprises, and the repayment of mutual debts for the rendered services and the earlier supplied products.
