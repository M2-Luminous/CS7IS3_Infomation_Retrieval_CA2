Kravchuk is more popular in West Ukraine. In Ternopol 82 pct [percent] of votes were cast for him, in Rovno 70. Kuchma was supported by the majority in the East and in Crimea. A preliminary report of the Central Electoral Commission says 82.6 pct of the voters that came to polling stations in Crimea cast their ballots for Kuchma and only 7.4 for Kravchuk. Vote-counting continues, however, observers feel that Kravchuk and Kuchma are the most likely candidates to continue the presidential race. The overall turnout was 68 pct of the electorate. After voting on Sunday [26 June] Kravchuk answered questions from the press at a polling station in Kiev. He declared that the parliament cannot legally restrict the powers of the president. According to him, "The president is elected as the head of state and the head of the executive branch of power." IF Note: At the moment the Ukrainian parliament is discussing amendments to the law on presidency under which the president would only have the powers of the head of state. Kravchuk believes that the powers of the president can be altered only through a referendum declared by parliament. "But if such a referendum is announced, the powers of the parliament might end with it," he stressed. If the parliament tries to restrict presidential powers without a referendum, confrontation is going to begin, the president thinks. This should be realized by both sides. Kravchuk spoke of the priority of relations with Russia for his country. Whoever is elected president must understand that, he said. Kravchuk said he continues to insist on Ukraine's membership in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. He said he submitted an appropriate suggestion to parliament. Meanwhile, Kuchma intends to refrain from submitting the matter to parliament in the event of being elected. "Ukraine has not received a cent in Western aid for scrapping nuclear weapons," he explained his stance to the press on Sunday in Kiev. "If the parliament restricts presidential powers and I am elected, either of the two will have to step down," Kuchma said adding that no one runs for presidency in order to resign. Speaking of his economic policy Kuchma said he favored a civilized market controlled by the state. As for foreign policy he said: "We have many tasks inside the CIS." According to him, Ukraine should contact countries that want to have relations with it. Kuchma spoke for revising the Ukrainian tax policy and fixing the exchange rate of the karbovanets with regard to key foreign currencies. He said he does not see any tension in Crimea. In his opinion there are certain circles that find tension in Crimea advantageous. In his opinion the problem of the Black Sea Fleet was resolved by the present cabinet a long time ago.
