Initially it will be published every two months with a total size of 32 pages. It is anticipated that each issue will contain four or five main articles, as well as a collection of information notes on science news and advertising materials. Prof. Gerhart Friedlender, a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, has agreed to become the editor in chief of the journal. He works at Brookhaven Laboratory and is well known for his works in the field of nuclear physics and chemistry. The list of its basic sections: physics and astronomy, chemistry, biology, the earth sciences, materials science, technology, applied mathematics and computers, power engineering and ecology, and medicine, testifies to the versatile nature of the future journal. Scientists from various countries will be the editors of these sections. Desiring to ensure the broadest possible coverage in the journal of the news of Russian science and striving to enlist our scientists in the description and analysis of their own achievements and the achievements of their foreign colleagues, the initiators of the publication of THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE additionally intend to include among the editors a representative of Russia--Academician Vitaliy Goldanskiy will be him. A Japanese scientist, apparently, will be another editor who represents a specific region. In regard to the content, style, and format, among the closest analogs of the future publication it is probably possible to name the British journal THE NEW SCIENTIST. In the words of Prof. G. Friedlender, the goal of THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE will be ``the description of the most important scientific and technical research, discoveries and ideas in such a form that their significance and content could be understood and appreciated by scientists of the most different specialties. In other words, the news of biology should be described in such a way that its importance and fascination would be clear to a specialist in solid-state physics, an anthropologist should read with interest about a new approach to the problem of stellar evolution, and so forth.'' Russian scientists will probably find something to tell the readers of THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE about, and the world scientific community will find for itself in the new journal many interesting notices about the achievements of science in our country and assessments by our scientists of foreign science news.
