Her second term which began three months ago is more than likely to be different altogether. What is under way currently is in fact her creeping metamorphosis into the stereotyped Pakistani leader obsessed with enhancing Pakistan's military might. The virtual rejection by Islamabad of the very idea of keeping up a serious dialogue with India after the recent talks between the two Foreign Secretaries is thus not accidental. It seems to be a part of a strategy hardly distinguishable from that of all the past military rulers of that country. Its main emphasis is on war-like talk most of the time and war-like preparations all the time. Benazir has already said much to convince Pakistan's military elite that both of them are on the same wavelength. Her belligerence on Kashmir and her bid to deflate the notion of a dialogue with India have amply served this purpose. Benazir Bhutto is now unfolding the second part of her policy, viz, to appease the military top brass in more concrete terms. This paper's correspondent in Davos in Switzerland has shed light on the Pakistan Prime Minister's shopping mission in the European arms bazaar. Apparently, a deal for the acquisition of one or more submarines from the Swedish shipbuilding company, Kockums, is on the cards. She has taken care to keep up an anti-Indian tirade even as she participates in the World Economic Forum in Davos, and keeps herself busier with less publicised arms negotiations. Such activities become significant especially in the background of an increasing pressure on Benazir Bhutto's government for a sharp hike in the defence budget. Air Marshal (Retd) Ayaz Ahmad Khan has just called for raising the defence expenditure from 90 billion to 150 billion rupees "to achieve numerical and qualitatively military balance with Pakistan's foremost enemy." He wants that Pakistan must have more infantry, armoured artillery and air defence formations "to correct the two-to-one Indian advantage in troop strength." The so-called imbalance to Pakistan's disadvantage can be easily seen to be a myth when it is remembered that the percentage of its military spending relative to its gross domestic product is far higher than that of India and any Western democracy. But it is not just tell-tale figures of expenditure that are involved here. Pakistan's political system, some democratic trappings notwithstanding, is essentially a military-dominated one. Time was when Benazir Bhutto wanted a full-fledged democracy with the generals having no political role to play. Of late, she seems to have found it expedient not to insist on the soldiers going back to the barracks. What seems to be going on is militarisation under civilian aegis. The military-civilian confrontation is yielding place to collusion. Another "historic compromise?"
