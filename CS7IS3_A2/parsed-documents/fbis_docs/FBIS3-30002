While acknowledging foreign concerns about an overheating of the Chinese economy given its breath-taking double-digit growth, Zhu said he does not think the 13 percent growth of the past two years is too rapid, although prolonging such growth could prove difficult. Zhu, seen as the main architect of China's ambitious economic reforms, said macroeconomic measures introduced last summer to rein in money supply and restore order to an inflation-wracked economy have stabilized prices and created an environment for stable growth. "We haven't seen big economic ups and downs," Zhu said, dismissing allegations that macroeconomic controls are failing. Addressing Japanese business leaders at a Tokyo hotel, Zhu denounced foreign press reports of growing social unrest due to soaring prices as distorting reality. Although inflation in big cities has reached 18.6 percent, the urban population actually enjoyed better living standards as salaries increased by some 25 percent last year, he said. Beijing is well aware of inflationary risks but does not consider the current level of 13.4 percent as cause for concern, Zhu said, adding the increase in money supply has been successfully stabilized at about 20 percent. The implementation of a comprehensive economic reform program, including the introduction of new taxes and a single, market-oriented foreign exchange rate system since January 1, has been "going smoothly and without creating major problems." Beijing will do away with its special foreign currency swap centers from April 1, from which time foreign exchange will be handled solely through banks, said Zhu, who also heads China's Central Bank. The planned transformation of China's banks into commercial banks will have to go hand in hand with the restructuring of unprofitable state enterprises which have depended on cheap loans while adjusting to market transition. Zhu predicted "big progress," however, in the privatization of the state-run sector this year. Beijing hopes that a total overhaul of the tax system will help gradually increase the central government's revenue share from the present 30 percent to about 60 percent by the year 2000. Zhu dismissed as "groundless" rumors that foreign companies will soon be listed on the Shanghai stock exchange. Beijing is taking a very cautious stance toward the country's fledgling stock exchanges, closely monitoring Chinese firms to prevent an "economic bubble" like that which occurred in Japan. Japan-China trade, which soared by 54 percent to 39 billion dollars last year, is nevertheless "still small," considering the potential of China's huge market, he said. Increased investment and trade with China could help Japan overcome its prolonged recession and boost the competitiveness of Japanese products, Zhu pointed out, adding he hopes trade relations between the two countries would "reach a new level." Zhu arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for a nine-day trip focusing on increasing economic ties. Besides visiting a number of prefectures to study Japan's economic and corporate structures, the vice premier will also meet present and former political leaders.
