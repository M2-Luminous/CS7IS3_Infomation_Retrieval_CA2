The Agricultural Administration Council wound up the hearings Thursday with a session in Miyazaki, southern Japan. The hearings were intended to solicit views of farmers and consumers to help the council work out plans for agricultural reforms, following Japan's agreement last December at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks to partially open its rice market. Most participating farmers supported in principle the continuation of the nation's food control system, under which the government controls production and distribution of rice, the officials said. But farmers sought greater freedom in allotting their rice stocks for free distribution. Currently, the government allows 40 percent of the nation's rice harvest to be freely marketed outside government channels by farmers' groups and rice dealers. Most rice farmers and consumers also said rice should be stockpiled to deal with a poor rice crop, like the 1993 crop failure that forced Japan to resort to emergency rice imports. Some said 1.5 million to 2 million tons of rice should be stockpiled, the officials said.
