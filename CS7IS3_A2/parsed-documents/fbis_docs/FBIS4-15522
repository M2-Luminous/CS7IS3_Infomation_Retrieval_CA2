FBIS4-15522 "drsov069_h_94010" FBIS-SOV-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 Moldova Dniester's Shevtsov Views Relations, 14th Army Dniester's Shevtsov Views Relations, 14th Army AU0904170594 Chisinau BASAPRESS in English 1300 GMT 9 Apr 94 AU0904170594 Chisinau BASAPRESS English BFN [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/4/1994 -- "We made a big mistake to believe in the summer of 1992 that the new 14th [Russian] Army commander [General Aleksandr Lebed] is a man who realizes the situation in the Republic," stated to magazine KOMMERSANT MOLDOVIY (BUSINESSMAN OF MOLDOVA) Vadim Shevtsov, chairman of the Dniester Republic's Security Committee. According to Shevtsov, Lebed is carrying out a task assigned to him by certain Russian political groups. He mentioned that Lebed did not stop the military conflict, but rather kept the 14th Army in barracks in a moment when he was most likely to take the Dniester side. "At first we had good relations with Lebed," stated Shevtsov, "but I gave them up when he proposed to me to take part in the dismissal of the [Dniester] government." He did not consider the Lebed-Bergman opposition to be a serious threat, but he called it destructive. In connection with the 14th Army's withdrawal Shevtsov said that if it takes place then "merely the army's general staff will leave the Dniester region taking its flag." Shevtsov also stated that after the PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- ruling party] won the elections "the reunification of the [Dniester River] right and left banks" is likely to occur. "The proclamation of our Republic was not a goal in itself, but rather a strong need. In case it loses its actuality there will be no longer need for it. Life itself will make us be together." Moldova should provide strong guarantees established by the Constitution, said Shevtsov.
