Prayers and peace be upon the most noble of messengers. Citizens-- men and women: The country is going through a decisive stage in its history, amid international changes and developments on the national scene which place the country in a multifaceted crisis. We have talked a great deal about this crisis, and an exact diagnosis of it has been made. The time has come for us to look forward to the future with all of our strength and to face the situation with courage. This is the challenge facing all Algerians, men and women alike. Algeria has capabilities, and its sons have sufficient ability, will, and determination to confront this challenge. We have to remove the spirit of despair and failure from our hearts, and regain creative initiative. Fortunately, the force that is motivating our society is the will of a vital people who aspire to self-realization and to prove itself as an active and effective force. We understand well and in depth the will of change, and we understand the aspirations of our people, particularly our youth, for development, justice, and progress. We work for the embodiment of this will and push the process of change to its aspired end. The political crisis in Algeria is in fact a crisis of a society that aspires for radical change and for the building of a developed Algeria, capable of taking its position in the modern world: an Algeria that realizes democracy and believes in the ethical and human values. An Algeria that rejects backwardness and marginalization, an Algeria deeply rooted in its religion, its identity, and its history and confidently looking forward to the future. We stand for this ambitious Algeria which is able to win the challenges and which should launch all of its capabilities and resources in the battle of change. This change, which is a true break from the past, could only be comprehensive and all of the effective forces in society have to take part in the change, including political, economic, social, and cultural forces and honourable citizens. This Algeria, deeply rooted in its countryside, villages, and towns, with its youth, cadres, workers, farmers and women, exists in the fields, factories, universities, and institutions. We will work to provide conditions and suitable frameworks to bring about a break with the past and a change. Youth ought to understand that the current transformations, which must be completed in an atmosphere of security and stability, are aiming, in essence, at giving an opportunity to the new generations to play their role in the administration and the management of the country. And this is one of the main aims of the new national system. We will provide all available resources and the necessary facilities for our youth to shoulder their responsibilities in order to shape their fate with confidence. Citizens: I salute all of the national forces and the security forces and members of the People's National Army as well as our cadres, workers, and youth who have been attending to the country's safety and security, to the state's continuity, and to the normal work of the institutions. I salute our community abroad, which will receive special attention in our work. We will take the necessary measures leading to the consolidation of its solidarity and the defense of its interests and allow it to take part in the national action and the country's economic development. Citizens: In the political sphere we have chosen the path of dialogue to deal with the country's current situations, and as a basis for political practice. Despite the difficulties and hesitation by some sides, we are determined to continue serious dialogue according to the aims listed in the national consensus platform to which we are committed throughout the transitional period. These goals are to ensure the availability of political and security conditions and to revert to the path of democratic election, thus enabling the people to choose its representatives with total freedom and without any form of pressure and falsification. We realize that the political crisis can be solved only through dialogue and with the participation of the national political and social forces--without exception. Algeria has a defined program and a clear plan for dealing with the political crisis. We are in control of this path and firm in applying this program. We would like to draw the attention of the foreign partners to the fact that we need calm, and we ask them to be reserved in their evaluations of our country's situation. In order to consolidate this path the National People Army--the offshoot of the Liberation Army--will always remain at the level of challenges and wagerings, and will make every effort to help the country to a suitable political and permanent solution through dialogue within the framework of the principles of the republic and by respecting the people's choice. Citizens: We are convinced that the security solution alone is not enough to take the country out of the crisis, and that radical solutions to the political, economic, social, and cultural issues are inevitable. Furthermore, the return of security and stability in the country as well as tranquility to the citizen will undoubtedly secure a quick solution to these problems. We will use all resources to contain violence and end the bloodletting. The blood that is being shed is Algerian blood--the blood of our sons and daughters. Therefore, it is imperative that we stop the blooldshed and free the country from violence once and for all. Violence as a way to political change and as a way to seize power is totally unacceptable. Although we have been trying to free political action and organize it within the framework of law and away from all forms of violence and political manipulation, we will never tolerate those who are trying to sow the seeds of sedition and chaos, to destroy the country's material and human resources, and to tarnish its reputation. No religious, political, or cultural reason can explain or justify the crimes that have been committee against people and property. The abnormal phenomenon in our country reflects nihilism and belongs to organized crime, whose main goal is to deal a blow to the nation's dynamic and real forces. The law will be applied fully and strictly to the perpetrators of these acts. Those who have gone wrong and have not committed crimes against the nation can return to reason, sense, and adherence to the law. In this context, I would like to express my sympathy and support to the families of the victims of the crimes. Citizens, everyone must be aware that political pluralism and democratic practice do not mean the weakening of the state or an undermining of its institutions. The new national order, devoid of political, ideological, economic, and cultural monopolies, can only be achieved in a state with strong institutions. This state must belong to all the Algerians, whatever their political affiliation. In this context, the national media has a sensitive role to play in building the new national order. It has to rise to the level of responsibility to enlighten the public opinion and educate and promote it; promote its civil tendency; report the truth objectively, without distortion or falsification; inform it of what takes place around it; and raise it in a way that would serve the homeland. Citizens: In order to get out of the current situation it is imperative for us to find solutions to the economic situation. This requires making decisions and taking practical measures that will effectively implement the economic reforms aimed at liberating the national economy from monopoly and centralization and providing the opportunity for creative initiatives to bring forth public and private economic and financial resources, as well as to build an advanced economy that complies with market laws and competition. All of this needs state protection for the more deprived social groups. Appropriate solutions will be found for foreign debts, which are a heavy burden on the country, through negotiations with international financial institutions. Dealing with the economy will lead to temporary negative complications, which are the nature of any qualitative structural change. We will resolutely ensure that Algerians will share these complications within the framework of an effective national solidarity. Citizens: Confronting the internal problems does not distract us from paying attention to the changes taking place around us in the world. Algeria, which is conscious of the new challenges, will do its best to determine its position in the new world order and play a vital role in the international cooperation and world peace. In this respect, the need to build the Arab Maghreb Union appears to be a necessity imposed upon it. Algeria will use all its influence to achieve this noble goal. We will work sincerely to clarify the atmosphere for guaranteeing the interests of the peoples of the region and respect their will. This makes us give our complete support to the UN peace plan to settle the Western Saharan issue. We emphasize the policy of good neighborliness and noninterference in internal affairs, and we are enthusiastic about consolidating the stability of the region and eliminating the causes of tension, conflicts, and extremism. Algeria will continue to be committed to its solidarity with African peoples and the region's fateful causes. Algeria will work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East and in the Arab region; it will welcome any initiative aimed at cleansing the atmosphere in the Arab world. Algeria will also continue to play its role in the Mediterranean in order to make it a region of peace, cooperation, and stability; it will be committed to bolstering relations with the countries of the North and developing them on bases of common interests and mutual respect. Citizens: In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to salute the Algerian people, who in this difficult situation have shown awareness, vigilance, and compassion, and have rejected violence and adventurism. I would like to appeal to all Algerians to mobilize in order to regain our country's glory, pride, and might. Citizens: I hope on the occasion of the advent of the blessed month of Ramadan, the month of atonement and forgiveness, that tranquility will return to the people, peace to the country, and love between the people. Surmounting crises can be achieved only through compassion and work. May God's guidance make our work successful and Algeria a peaceful country. Long live Algeria. Eternal glory to our martyrs. May God's peace and benediction be upon you.
