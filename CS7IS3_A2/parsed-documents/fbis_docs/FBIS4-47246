FBIS4-47246 "jpusr069___94061" FBIS-USR-94-069 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 7 May 1994 BALTIC STATES LATVIA Officials View Disposition of Facilities Left by Russian Army Officials View Disposition of Facilities Left by Russian Army 944K1319A Riga NEATKARIGA CINA in Latvian 7 May 94 p 5 944K1319A Riga NEATKARIGA CINA Latvian CSO [Interview with Ilgonis Upmalis, Chief of the Bureau to Control the Withdrawal of the Army of the Federation of Russia, and Ludis Pavilonis, his deputy, by Viktors Berzins: "They leave. Facilities remain; The Russian army is leaving so briskly that the Latvian state cannot keep up with resolutions on the former army facilities."] [Text] In summary, the number of resolutions by the government, which would determine the future ownership of the facilities, is unable to keep up with the number of acceptance and committal acts. [Pavilonis] During its time, the Supreme Council passed a resolution stating that the Council of Ministers must review the case of each such facility and adopt a resolution on awarding it to either the municipality or some other party, all within a ten day period. In practice, this cannot be done because the process takes too long. Before the Cabinet of Ministers adopts the resolution, the resolution bill must be written, in conjunction with the judicial division and other institutions. In total, about 10 to 15 signatures must be collected. When these and the archival reports are gathered, the case is reviewed by the appropriate committee of the Cabinet of Ministers, and if the latter finds that all of the documentation is in order, only then is it presented to the administration. In a meeting of the administration, the final resolution is adopted on the disposition of the facility. [Berzins] Then a whole month would go by ... [Pavilonis] Ye-es (drawing out the word)... You said one month? Now let's take a look at the list of facilities returned. For example, Cesis rayon, Sarkani, medical warehouses. Committal act -- April 27, 1993. Administrative resolution -- March 5, 1994. Almost one entire year! Naturally, it doesn't take this long for everything. Now, here is another entry: committal act -- June 8, 1993, resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers -- January 4, 1994. Half of a year. And there are more and more. [Berzins] At such a rate, we will never get rid of the Russian army! [Pavilonis] We are getting rid of the Russian army, because they are no longer in these facilities. The army says "so long" to those areas as soon as there is an acceptance and committal act. [Berzins] What happens to the vacated facility during the time between the committal act and the adoption of the administrative resolution? [Pavilonis] The municipality must provide protection to make sure that nothing happens, but it is not allowed to take over ownership. It cannot allow in a private organization, nor do anything else. And what happens if the municipality has agreed to be the owner, but then some interested ministry turns up, which decides something as follows: Why should the municipality have it? We need it! We will turn it over to the municipality, then prepare a resolution to have it turned over to us. And they prepare and receive the resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers. Now the occupant selected by the municipality must be evicted. Can the municipality feel secure and confident: Although the Cabinet of Ministers is preparing these resolutions very slowly, they will be finished someday, and then -- who will be the legal owner of the facility? There have been numerous precedents where the facility has been taken away from the municipality. Now about protection. The municipalities are not paid for providing protection, and they must find the money from internal reserves. But, when the municipality is turned out of some facility, it says: -- We are removing our protection, but pay us for the period during which we provided protection. -- But the ministries, in turn, have no money, and so they just don't pay. [Berzins] What should be done to speed up the disposition of the former military facilities? [Pavilonis] At the least, we should increase the number of members in the Ministry of Finances group that prepares the administrative resolution bills, so that we can catch up with the acceptance and committal acts. Naturally, this is impossible to do in ten days, since signatures cannot be obtained at such a rate, but let them attempt to do it in twenty days. Don't prolong it to a year. [Upmalis] The next meeting of the commission led by Mr. Kosisis will be dedicated to a discussion on how to speed up production of these administrative resolutions. In order to adopt a resolution, which will have a completely singular significance for the commission, and the administration, and so that there will be no basis for an argument by any entity, there must be clarity on what is under each facility; who owned the land? Has the owner submitted a claim? Who owned the facility built before 1940? All of this archival information is essential. Plus, we need the plans of the building or facility. In the beginning, while the military unit was still in there, they were impossible to obtain. Now, we have made an agreement with North West Military Group Commander Mayorov, and there are no longer any refusals. We even received them for the Maiznicas Street facility, which contains the counter-intelligence unit. It is a complicated matter to gather all of the archival information, to obtain the necessary documents from the Land and Property Reclamation commissions. If it is absolutely certain that the land under a facility belongs to the municipality, then, naturally, the facility belongs to the municipality. If a mistake is made at the meeting of the administration, then this could lead to the curious event that the administration, by its resolution, gives the municipality's land to some ministry. Mistakes happen, many mistakes -- because incomplete documentation is submitted. Commercial organizations are very quick in using this to their advantage when they are interested in a certain facility. As you could say, they climb over corpses, with the help of false information, with various incomplete reports, to attempt and sometimes even succeed to establish the grounds for their claim. Municipalities are also guilty. And there are cases where all of the interested parties do not want to settle their claims in accordance with the law, and then the only way to clear up the confusion is by the prosecutor and the court. There will be a "mad dash", there will. [Berzins] Let us assume that the Russian army will leave by August 31. The majority of military units will probably prolong the turnover of the facilities as long as they can. The "mad dash", presumably, will occur in July and August... [Pavilonis] Maybe there will be much more of a "mad dash" towards the end, but I can say that at present they are turning over their facilities on a somewhat regular basis. As soon as an area is empty, they draw up the acceptance and committal act: please, take it and do what you will. It is no longer the way it was at one time, -- major discord: Mayorov was not signing the acts, Moscow was simply not allowing him to sign -- the military unit area was empty, but it was not turned over. Now these matters are being handled promptly. [Berzins] There is probably still a great deal left to settle. [Pavilonis] Yes. There are still 191 Russian army units in 247 facilities in Latvia. [Berzins] How many have been turned over this year? [Pavilonis] Twenty-one units with 86 facilities. [Berzins] Twenty-one units in four months. For the remaining four months -- 191. How can this be accomplished without a "mad dash"? [Pavilonis] There will be a "mad dash", there will... [Berzins] They will make a "mad dash", but they are most likely prepared for it. But are we, likewise, prepared to handle such a mountain of returned property? The facilities should at least be protected. And it will also be necessary to make determinations... [Pavilonis] Up until now, if there was an owner, the take over and protection did not create any major problems. [Berzins] But there can be no owner until the Cabinet of Ministers confirms one. But that grindstone is turning very slowly. [Pavilonis] The Cabinet of Ministers is issuing resolutions out of turn for certain facilities that may be needed more quickly. But even so, the number of resolutions has not managed to keep up with the number of committal acts. [Berzins] So, we already couldn't keep up when there were relatively few facilities turned over. What will happen when the "mad dash" starts and there are many facilities to take over and decide on? How can these be protected to avoid their destruction and demolition? [Pavilonis] It is possible that illegal activities will occur. If some official wants to "screw" someone, he could say: -- You are managing this property illegally, and I am suing you and throwing you out. [Upmalis] The only positive thing is that for those facilities where the army unit is still present, likely owners have already appeared. As for what remains -- I don't think there will be a problem with taking over facilities located in Riga. The major facilities -- training grounds, airfields -- have already been taken over. There is still the matter of Adazi and Dobele, where the 25th brigade is situated. There is still the matter of "Strautini" in the Aluksne rayon, where a few complications will most certainly arise. There is also the 32 meter high radio-telescopic antenna in the Ventspils rayon, which has not been awarded to anyone, yet. In turning over this facility, we are looking for possibilities of better utilization and preservation, because it is so specialized and so far into the forest that it will be impossible for the municipality to preserve it. Discussions about this facility are being held with the Russian Scientific Academy about cooperation among scientists from Latvia, Russia and other nations, all united under of the "Kvazar" program. Although the problems are monstrous -- this facility takes up 209 hectares of the forest, Latvian scientists do not have the strength to manage it, and the Russian side does not have the strength to organize and finance it, because, in order to prepare this facility for scientific purposes, the equipment must be changed. There are also high ranking officials in Latvia who would like to see this unique antenna turned into ashes and dust, because this is what some foreign services have supposedly recommended. However, delays can be foreseen in the preparation of the administrative resolution bills. It will be a major job, and, in my opinion, after just one year, it is doubtful whether we will have all of the administrative resolutions in order for a property to be legally registered, etc. Insatiable ministries are swallowing up plans and priorities. [Berzins] Four years have already elapsed since Latvia declared independence. Soon, it will be three years since Latvia was recognized as independent. After half of a century, the foreign army is finally leaving, but only now, at the last minute, we are starting to worry about what to do with the Latvian land and the buildings constructed on this land for military purposes. We are looking for owners. Haven't we composed any sort of comprehensive program? [Pavilonis] There are no comprehensive programs. When the commission on the takeover of military facilities has examined the case agreed upon, the question may be raised: what do you intend to do in this facility? And this does not happen every time. [Berzins] This question doesn't have to be raised? If no one else wants it, then just take it away? [Pavilonis] Yes. But, if there is more than one contender, then each is asked what he intends to do there. [Berzins] Is it possible that there are some good facilities that no one wants? [Pavilonis] There are some. Then basically the Supreme Council's resolution is in effect that the municipality must provide protection. [Berzins] Even if that means from now until eternity? [Pavilonis] Let the municipality decide how to manage it. [Berzins] But then it would manage everything which happened to be in its territory, as, for example, the cooperative and state cooperative farms, which appear to be unnecessary at present. [Pavilonis] If no one wants to take over a facility, then the Russians could be requested to take down the facility and plant grass. A green meadow would be left behind. [Berzins] Of course you can ask, but will they do it? And even if they would take it down, who will have the nerve to ask them, when everyone is celebrating that "Thank God! They're finally gone!" Let's keep them here, so they can dawdle with the demolition?... [Pavilonis] In some cases, it was headed in that direction. The Ventspils military unit vacated the territory, but the Ventspils municipal government did not want to receive this territory, if it was not included as a property owner. However, this land belongs to the state. [Berzins] It seems as though we have not had enough time to resolve these and other sticky questions. But then, while all details may not be worked out, we could at least form a general conceptual program... [Upmalis] Such a program has been very difficult, if not impossible, to set up because the ministries and municipalities have been so greedy. In the beginning, when these facilities were still very far from being turned over, all of the ministries presented their proposals and requested so many facilities that, when they reached the stage of actual takeover and examined them with their own eyes, they understood: the territory is enormously large, and they would have to pay taxes on it, and so, at the very last moment, they started to refuse these facilities. And all of our plans -- we had beautiful plans! -- were gone with the wind. For example, the Ministry of Defense was given absolute priority, and some others were also given priority. But now, the Ministry of Defense has refused, on more than one occasion, to accept facilities, which have been turned over already, and now, we don't know what to do with these facilities. Like the Daugavpils fortress, for example, and that is not the only one. In the Naujene rural district, close to Daugavpils, there is also a miliary facility that was requested by the Ministry of Defense, but then refused. After that, the Ministry of Internal Affairs refused it. In the end, after this facility was already ransacked, when there was no longer anything there, it was graciously offered to the municipality. But Mr. Geiba said: "Nothing can be done there anymore, so we are also refusing to take it". The point is reached that a facility literally goes to ruin because of irresponsibility. That is what happened with Vainode airport, as well. If they had not granted the request by the Ministry of Transportation to be assigned this facility, without asking the Ministry of Transportation what it wanted to do with the Vainode airport, then, in my opinion, it may have been possible to save this facility. Now it has been totally ransacked, and a large number of residential buildings stand empty and destroyed. It all looks very sad. That is what happens when a ministry agrees to accept something, but when it is necessary to start managing the property, it is unable to do so. [Pavilonis] The saddest aspect is that the residential buildings remain uninhabited. We see and hear in Riga that many have no place to live. But, there, they have large five story buildings remaining empty and going to ruin. [Berzins] The misfortune lies in that the Russians could not take them along, and we cannot take them to Riga. Nor to some city closer. [Pavilonis] And why not. Vietumis does that: the construction company can take apart a large five story panel building, bring it closer to the city and "set" it up. I am not sure what this accomplishes, but at least the materials don't have to be assembled from scratch. In Paplaka, already quite some time ago, the municipality inherited large residential buildings that were unwanted by everyone. They said: -- We don't have anyone to put in them, because, for the majority, we have our own private homes. Private firms, fighting for a place in the sun, have a propensity for buying former military facilities from the Russian army. [Berzins] But you are saying that all types of illegal actions are occurring, court hearings, one company, wanting to get in, chases out another one, which happens to be there already... [Upmalis] Some of the returned facilities have been bought up by firms, which none of the Latvian institutions have been unable to determine what type of company they are. For example, what is Lat-West-East, which has purchased a petroleum base still containing an army unit from Russia, and the sales contract states that this army unit can remain in Latvia and on the firm's territory, until such time that Russia decides to remove its army from there. In such a case, who decides whether the Russian army can be present here in Latvia? The administration of Latvia, Russia, or the firm? And, unfortunately, we are unable to do anything concrete. The only thing was when members of this military unit, which is located in the Viesturs Prospect petroleum base, and is owned by Lat-West-East, came to me and asked if I would please issue them driving permits for their automobiles, so that they could perform their routine activities, and I replied: -- You sold your territory, and you no longer have any here. There are very many similar occurrences. Furthermore. It is still possible for firms to purchase a facility from the army, and backdate the sale. This is because it is still not down in writing that firms must register and notarize the contracts for the sale of these facilities. If you are a military unit commander and you have a seal, and I am a firm representative and I have a seal, and we perform the sales transaction using sales checks, then we would have no problem concluding a document dated, for example, August 1, 1991. If everything has been performed to the letter of the law, plus, if the firm at that time was registered in the Latvian Registry of Businesses, then, in my opinion, no Latvian legal institution will be able to prove that this was an illegal action. There is another painful matter that I would like to focus attention on: various firms that manufacture firearms have turned up in Latvia. I am still uncertain about the licensing of such firms. One has moved in to an army manufacturing plant, which remains un-returned. It has made the purchase from Russia, and in quite an unusual manner. As we know, all manufacturing plants in Russia are part of the State Property Fund (SPF). That is not a military structure. Thus, the firm has made its purchase not from the army, but from Russia's SPF. Thus, it would seem that SPF has property in Latvia, since it is able to make the sale. With respect to the firm La Con, in the Daugavgriva fortress territory, which, according to our views, is not operating in conformity with the laws of Latvia, we have submitted materials to the prosecutor's office for review. Our bureau does not have the right to review -- legally or illegally. We have not yet received the findings from the prosecutor, although we have in our possession agreements concluded between the firm and the Latvian naval forces on the use of the facility for 15 years. The facility is assigned to the Ministry of Defense, but the naval forces have already managed to conclude an agreement with the firm, without organizing any competitions, which they should have done. Many firms have signed up for this Daugavgriva port territory. [Berzins] What is the major attraction there? [Upmalis] Undoubtedly, the port. Agreements have been concluded with the blessings of the commander of the naval forces without, as far as I can tell, coordination with the Ministry of Defense. We can "thank" Mr.Zeibots, Mr. Zingis and the rest of the leading workers for this. This is no surprise, because the firm has a high ranking "benefactor", who is in the practice of lobbying. He is Mr. Kaza, who is attempting to support this firm with all sorts of means. I have a list of its founders. It was founded by the tradition principle: at the forefront is a person of Latvian nationality, who is a citizen, and all the rest -- people of Russian nationality. That is the traditional manner for companies. They say that the list of founders was later amplified with the name of Mr. Kaza. I am most concerned in these cases, because they are not holding competitions on the basis of the business plan, as defined by the law. This company, unfortunately, has taken down many major buildings which are still in unassigned territory. I could mention many, many facilities for which the concluded actions will have to be reviewed by the prosecutor's office in time. This is because the documents concerning these actions, which we have available to us on the respective facility takeover, and those -- most interestingly! -- which the firms have not submitted, are, in our opinion, not too clean. At one time, we had the plenary powers of the entire Council of Ministers, now we have only one -- the plenary power of the Ministry of Defense, and that is too little for us to be able to control the conclusion of all these actions. We also do not have to right to use sanctions against firms that pursue illegal actions. Often with the help of a high ranking person, they go around the bureau, and have various ministries do the resolving, in accordance with their own views. The bureau is not involved with the takeover of facilities. The bureau is concerned with the control of facility takeovers -- how they are turned over. The commission led by Mr. Kosisis, -- the commission on the takeover of military facilities from the military forces of the Russian Federation, can also only make recommendations, and on the basis of such, the Cabinet of Ministers adopts resolutions on the utilization of such a facility. Only they understand [Berzins] Can we assume that the bureau has a complete picture of the Russian military units and military facilities still remaining in Latvia? [Pavilonis] Yes. All have been accounted for and entered in the records. Nevertheless, there are times when some military unit shows up which is not in our records. Either it had been very well hidden, or was newly formed. That happened when the 15th Air Army Headquarters at 55 Brivibas Street was eliminated. The military personnel remaining in Latvia relocated to Skulte airfield, where a new military unit was formed. Such a trick had not been anticipated in our documents. [Berzins] Do they come to you for driving permits? [Pavilonis] Not only that. If, for example, officers need to cross the border, drive somewhere on official business, they come to us for a permit. Permits to relocate automobiles. To bring out property. In this manner, we learn that a new unit has formed. This has been a rare occurrence recently. Thus, we have to assume that all of the military units present in Latvia have been accounted for. [Berzins] When did it become clear that everything was included? [Pavilonis] Two years ago, when the bureau started its work, two thirds of the military forces were known. The remaining third was accounted for in six months time. When we started working, all units present in Latvia were considered to be secret. The Russian army would not give any lists. When we could say: here you have such a military unit, there -- that type, when we brought all ends together, only then did the veil of secrecy fall away. Recently they released a formerly highly secret document -- a summary of how many military units have been in Latvia since 1940. And not only military units, but also equivalent units -- institutions with various names which did not have a military unit number, but were simply issued a number. However, they have not admitted that the secret units with box office box numbers are theirs. [Berzins] Then who do they belong to? [Pavilonis] We are now trying to find out who started issuing post office box numbers for secret workshops and secret factories. Our bureau does not have extensive materials on the post office box factories. [Berzins] But don't the factories exist? And what about their products? [Pavilonis] The factories exist, but the products, which required the "post office boxes", have not been manufactured for a long time. There were secret workshops in VEF, Komutators, the Liepaja agriculture machinery factory, and many other places. As soon as ownership of the All-Union factories was tuned over to the Republic of Latvia, the manufacture of military products was discontinued. [Berzins] Minor battles are being waged over the special military factories. [Pavilonis] We have to find a compromise. If both sides refuse to budge from their positions, then the factory will be ransacked. The Russian army is secretly bringing out the major machinery. If they cannot manage to get it across the border, they sell it to some commercial concern, and the factory is left unable to function. [Berzins] But maybe there is nothing wrong with bringing the machinery out. Let them do it in full force -- there won't be anything for the followers of Interfront to rally behind. The Latvian army, most likely, will never have that many tanks to keep a factory busy doing repairs at full capacity for a whole growing season. [Pavilonis] The factories that were not needed by Latvia were all low level and have already been eliminated. But there are also those, which can be utilized expediently, and which have relatively modern equipment. It is economically more practical to save them, instead of eliminating them. [Berzins] But we already have factories standing, which cannot produce anything substantial. What good will it do to have additional factories? [Pavilonis] While the products of Latvia's industries have remained in warehouses until now, none of the military factories have full warehouses. Everything was sold. Their products were not only for the needs of the military units, but also goods for their personal consumption. And, likewise, these did not remain in warehouses. They were either of better quality, or the management was more exacting in production, and issued only as many products as needed. Worthy, worthless. [Berzins] And nothing worthless will remain behind after the Russian army leaves? [Upmalis] There are at least three bunkers, which we don't know how to utilize. One in Adazi, in Muceniekos -- two. The 15th Military Air Army Force Command Point in Muceniekos and the North Western Military Group Commander's Command Point in Adazi. They are two to three story underground buildings, containing equipment which consumes a great amount of energy to maintain suitability for occupancy -- pumping out underground water, etc. There is very high electrical consumption. [Berzins] Let Mr. Mayorov take them along. [Upmalis] We could allow him to do that. The demolition involves major problems. Likewise, with the bunker in Muceniekos -- it contains enormous amounts of reinforced concrete, all covered by soil. Should we allow it fill up with water? That is dangerous -- it could cause accidents. Blow it up and then bury it? Or maybe keep it as a historical monument and turn it into a tourist attraction. Mr. Pavilonis, however, is very economically minded -- these bunkers would be suitable for mushroom cultivation, because a constant temperature and humidity can be maintained in them. The problem is that there are many bunkers and only one vegetable farming company, Riga, which would not be able to manage everything. If only there were funds to install an appropriate boiler system -- the one built by the army is too large to use for such purposes. [Berzins] Aren't there also doubts about utilizing the formerly Baltic Military District, now North Western Military Group's Pentagon (read -- headquarters -- V.B.) building for Latvian army purposes -- even though a huge quantity of all types of listening devices remain planted there? [Upmalis] We will have a great deal of problems with it. But how can you compare listening devices with live KGB agents, who are employed by our leading firms?! [Berzins] Our Saeima, with amazing sincerity and for a long time, has been occupied with the KGB sacks and the five deputies suspected of collaboration, while several hundred KGB staff members are living high off the hog. [Upmalis] I personally know a person who admits that he worked for the KGB. Looking at the list of a certain firm's founders, he showed me names of people he had worked with. And this is a very famous firm's founders list. Thus, if these gentlemen have healthy, very powerful firms, then why talk about five Saeima deputies, who probably don't have the financial means to influence anything today. Such firms have much greater possibilities. Everyone knows that, but nothing is done about it. That is why we need a law on these KGB agents, which, I believe, we will have soon. I like the position taken by Mr. Bojars from the very beginning: yes, I don't deny I was such, but now I work for the good of Latvia, and so, accept me for what I am. If everyone who worked there would come forward to confess, and regret his sins... Patriotism is not dependent on where a person worked, but, rather, on how he did his job, what he did in his place of work, and how he is acting at present. [Berzins] The Pentagon on Elizabetes Street will probably leave at the very end of the withdrawal term. [Pavilonis] The 15th Air Army Headquarters left, even though some of its military units were still here. We assume that the North Western Military Group Headquarters will do the same. In private conversations, they are saying that they won't be the last to leave their premises.
