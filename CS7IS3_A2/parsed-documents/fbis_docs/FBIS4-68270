It is an objective necessity, a response to changes which occurred in Europe and the former Soviet Union over the last 5-6 years. Back during 1989-1990, when sharp debates were going on about professionalization of the Army, when former heads of the Ministry of Defense flatly denied the need for conducting military reform, it essentially already had begun... Its beginning was marked by the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Warsaw Pact member countries. Events were accelerated further by the dissolution of this military-political organization, reaching their culmination in 1991, when the Soviet Union itself disintegrated and the Russian Armed Forces were deprived of a strategic second echelon (the Baltic, Belarus, Ukraine). Thus, Russia's strategic troop grouping had to be created anew, and this, strictly speaking, is one of the main components of military reform. Attempts to defend unified Union Armed Forces and then create unified CIS forces proved fruitless, and so establishment of a Russian Army and simultaneously the planned reform of existing military structures began in May 1992. The basic goal of military reform is a quality improvement in the Army under new geostrategic conditions, with consideration of Russia's new military doctrine and the reduction in troop numerical strength to optimum size. Its realization (difficult in itself) is taking place against the background of a sequence of problems, each of which also is rather complicated. It is the scheduled (and sometimes also unscheduled, but in any case massive) withdrawal of troops from abroad, the significant reduction in authorized personnel strength, the great personnel shortage in the troops, destruction of excessive combat equipment under the Paris Agreements, and conversion of military industry. The principal difficulties of Armed Forces reform lie in this interlacing of problems being resolved simultaneously in a country experiencing political and economic crisis. They are exacerbated by the situation in countries of the near abroad--military conflicts in the Caucasus, Central Asia and Moldova, into which Russian troops have been drawn in one way or another. The military reform plan was designed for 8-9 years and broken into three stages. We now are in the second stage (1993-1995). Its task of creating a new strategic grouping of troops should be completed next year. The next military reform task is to upgrade the intrabranch structure of troops in connection with the change in their stationing and the reduction in overall numerical strength of the Armed Forces to the level of two million persons, and to upgrade weapon and command and control systems (in particular, this means a transition from the "army-division" system to a "corps-brigade" system). A reduction in troop numerical strength requires improved professional training of personnel. A serious problem arose over troop manpower acquisition, which can be solved only by combining a conventional call-up with acceptance of soldiers on a volunteer, contract basis. This problem is difficult to resolve. There are difficulties with the call-up because of the great indulgences established at one time by the former Supreme Soviet (essentially only one-fifth of the overall number of potential draftees enter the Army). Not everything is simple with acceptance under contract as well. The numerical strength of NCO's and contract privates was supposed to be 30 percent in 1993, but this is only half fulfilled. On the one hand, there is a clear lack of funds. On the other hand, contract personnel want both to receive a decent salary and to have easier service--basically logistic and maintenance positions are being filled. Considerably fewer are willing to take combat positions. Creation of mobile forces is an important element of military reform. At first the thought was to create two large groupings of mobile forces--Immediate Reaction Forces as a first echelon ready to act in a matter of hours, and Rapid Deployment Forces as a second echelon consisting of formations with heavier equipment (the numerical strength of each grouping is up to 100,000-150,000 persons). It was planned to establish these forces in two military districts, Volga and Ural. The idea of creating such large mobile forces was connected with the fact that Russia now is incapable of keeping large troop groupings along all its immense borders. They began creating the mobile forces in 1993, but the initial plan now is being transformed. It is possible that the central mobile forces will be of lesser makeup, but on the other hand small mobile forces will be established in all military districts, above all Moscow, North Caucasus and others. Of course, there were mobile forces in the makeup of the Soviet Armed Forces previously as well--above all these were the Airborne Troops and units of the Naval Infantry. The novelty of the present mobile forces concept lies in the fact that they must be interbranch in nature, have a wider range of weapons and have the capability of performing major operational-strategic missions independently. One other element of military reform is a reform of troops on a territorial basis. By 1995 it is planned to establish the Joint Territorial Command headed by a commander-in-chief (in the rank of deputy minister of defense) in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The goal is more effective command and control of all forces and assets in the Far East, including not only the Ground Troops, but also the Pacific Fleet, Air Force, Air Defense, and if necessary the Border Troops and Internal Security Forces. Then it is planned to set up such a command in Ulan-Ude for centralizing command and control in the Transbaykal and in Siberia. Reform of military structures in the North Caucasus was announced even earlier. This means that territorial commands operating within limits of certain territories of Russia and heading up the reform of Russian troops are being established in place of previous commanders-in-chief of axes, which in terms of operational purpose basically were aimed at the West. (They supported the command element of border military districts and groups of forces abroad). One can see in this the beginning of reorganization of branch structures of the Armed Forces. But a reform of branch structures is a very complicated matter. For example, an attempt to create unified Air Defense Forces based on Air Defense Troops and the Air Force in Ukraine ended in failure. The new command and control entity which had been established, numbering 250 generals, officers and warrant officers, was disbanded and everything returned to square one. Finally, one of the most important tasks of military reform is to elevate the professional level of Armed Forces personnel. But as we already said, there are considerable difficulties here which cannot be overcome in a year or two. Draftees must come into the Army better trained and more mature. The viewpoint of a number of authoritative military persons who insist on raising the draft age to 19-21 is quite correct. Eighteen years is too "green" an age for military service. A draftee should begin service no earlier than age 19 and a volunteer from age 21, while also having all other qualities of a professional soldier (appropriate physical development, necessary level of education and so on). There is a mass of objective and subjective difficulties in the path of military reform in Russia. I will risk declaring that not one major military power of modern time, nor Russia itself in the past, conducted military reforms under such difficult conditions in which the present Russian Federation now finds itself. Reform unquestionably is under way, however, although not as fast or as vigorously as one would like. But the important thing still lies ahead: With a favorable development of events, a qualitative renewal of Russian Federation Armed Forces will materialize no earlier than 1996.
