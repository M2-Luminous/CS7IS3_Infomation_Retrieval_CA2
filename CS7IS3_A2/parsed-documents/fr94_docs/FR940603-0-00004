FR940603-0-00004 FR940603-0-00002 1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz. a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe shielding. b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis. 2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated. ␣ 1Frequency 1Peak (V/M) 1Average (V/M) 10 KHz&hyph;100 KHz 50 50 100 KHz&hyph;500 KHz 60 60 500 KHz&hyph;2000 KHz 70 70 2 MHz&hyph;30 MHz 200 200 30 MHz&hyph;70 MHz 30 30 70 MHz&hyph;100 MHz 30 30 100 MHz&hyph;200 MHz 150 33 200 MHz&hyph;400 MHz 70 70 400 MHz&hyph;700 MHz 4,020 935 700 MHz&hyph;1000 MHz 1,700 170 1 GHz&hyph;2 GHz 5,000 990 2 GHz&hyph;4 GHz 6,680 840 4 GHz&hyph;6 GHz 6,850 310 6 GHz&hyph;8 GHz 3,600 670 8 GHz&hyph;12 GHz 3,500 1,270 12 GHz&hyph;18 GHz 3,500 360 18 GHz&hyph;40 GHz 2,100 750 The envelope given in paragraph 2 above is a revision to the envelope used in previously issued special conditions in other certification projects. It is based on new data and SAE AE4R subcommittee recommendations. This revised envelope includes data from Western Europe and the U.S. As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes, modified by Duncan Aviation. Should Duncan Aviation apply at a later date for a supplemental type certificate to modify any other model included on Type Certificate No. A46EU to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would apply to that model as well, under the provisions of §21.101(a)(1). Conclusion This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the applicant who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane. The substance of the special conditions for these airplanes has been subjected to the notice and comment procedure in several prior instances and has been derived without substantive change from those previously issued. It is unlikely that prior public comment would result in a significant change from the substance contained herein. For this reason, and because a delay would significantly affect the certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined that prior public notice and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these special conditions immediately. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon issuance. The FAA is requesting comments to allow interested persons to submit views that may not have been submitted in response to the prior opportunities for comment described above. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 Aircraft, Aviation safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1344, 1348(c), 1352, 1354(a), 1355, 1421 through 1431, 1502, 1651(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1857f&hyph;10, 4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g). The Special Conditions Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the following special conditions are issued as part of the supplemental type certification basis for the modified AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes: 1. Protection from Unwanted Effects of High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF). Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the airplane is exposed to high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane. 2. The following definition applies with respect to this special condition: Critical Function. Functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. Issued in Renton, Washington, on May 24, 1994.
