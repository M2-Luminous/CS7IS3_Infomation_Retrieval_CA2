The sources said the government has informed the Nairobi-based secretariat of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer that it will seek the exemptions in three areas, including coolants in refrigerated and frozen food display cases. The exemptions, if permitted, would allow the limited use of CFC's beyond the late 1995 international deadline for the suspension of their production and use. Such exemptions are permitted under the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. Given an international trend toward minimizing exemptions, though, the Japanese request is likely to be the main issue to be discussed at an autumn meeting in Nairobi of countries which are signatories to the protocol. The Japanese list of proposed exceptions is likely to come under severe criticism from European countries and environmental conservation organizations because it includes substances for which substitutes have already been developed. The government is arguing that the exceptions are necessary because Japan has many small businesses which rely on CFC's and industry has not made sufficient advances in the recovery of CFC's. It is requesting that Japan be allowed 1997-98 reserves of about 80 tons of CFC-115 used in refrigerator display cases and freezers and an additional 240 tons or so of four types of CFC's used as jet agents for sprays in medical equipment because there is no suitable substitute. The government is also arguing that Japan will need additional reserves of several substances for use as solvents and standard reference material for use in analysis and research into CFC's. These include about 150 tons of carbon tetrachloride used in fire extinguishers, about 6 tons of CFC's, and about 3 tons of 1,1,1- trichloroethane normally used in the production of insecticides. All of the substances cause damage to the ozone layer. Under the convention, their production and consumption is due to be suspended by the end of 1994. Exceptions to the Montreal Protocol are permitted under an "essential use" clause, but only apply where they are necessary to health and safety and where a substitute is not economically or technologically practical. The international environmental and conservationist organization Greenpeace says the United States has submitted requests for exceptions for its space shuttle program and for local anesthetics which far exceed Japan's requests. But Greenpeace says the U.S. requests do not include refrigerator coolants for which substitutes have already been developed. European Union countries have indicated they will submit requests for exceptions of only small amounts, while Switzerland, the Netherlands and Australia have all indicated they will reduce amounts to zero by the deadline.
