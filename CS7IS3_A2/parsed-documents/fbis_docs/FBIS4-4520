"We cannot confirm this," Shigeru Hatakeyama told a news conference referring to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's remarks in a Sunday NBC program that North Korea has already built two nuclear weapons. Asked whether he believes that Pyongyang's new mid-range missile capable of reaching most of Japan can be used with nuclear warheads, Hatakeyama said he would not rule out such a possibility "in the future." "At the present stage, however, all we can say is that this would be rather difficult," the vice minister said.
