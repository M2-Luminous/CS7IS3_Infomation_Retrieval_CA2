FR940607-2-00015 FR940607-2-00012 Revocation of Antidumping Duty Orders AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of revocation of antidumping duty orders. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping duty orders on staple machines and staples from Sweden because they are no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lisa Raisner or Michael Panfeld, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, telephone (202) 482&hyph;5253. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 27, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register (58 FR 68392) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty orders on staple machines and staples from Sweden (December 20, 1983). Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke these antidumping duty orders to each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who might object to these revocations were provided 30 days to submit their comments. Scope of the Orders Imports covered by these revocations are shipments of staple machines and staples from Sweden. This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 8305.20.00 and 8422.30.90. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no interested party has requested an administrative review for four consecutive review periods (19 CFR 352.25(d)(4)(i)) and when no domestic interested party objects to revocation. In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested party has expressed opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty orders on staple machines and staples from Sweden are no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking these antidumping duty orders in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii). These revocations apply to all unliquidated entries of staple machines and staples from Sweden entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993. Entries made during the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d). Dated: May 27, 1994. Roland L. MacDonald, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
