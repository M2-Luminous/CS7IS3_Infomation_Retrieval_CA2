Although in principle the Foodstuff Control Law bans rice imports, it makes an exception by allowing a person to import up to 100 kg of rice a year through the international postal service. Businesses have been importing rice from the United States, China, and Australia. The rice has nearly the same taste as Japanese-grown rice. Japanese consumers are increasingly showing their interest in the rice because they can legally buy the rice at low prices. For this reason, a growing number of Japanese consumers have been buying the rice. The Food Agency has become increasingly wary of the personal importation of rice through the international postal service, saying, the systemic agency business for personal rice imports is problematic. The Akita Citizen Consumer Cooperative (headed by Nobuo Takayama with its head office located in Akita City) embarked on the business of importing rice from China on 20 April. The imported Chinese rice will be sold to its members at the head office and at cooperative run retail stores. The cooperative intends to import the Chinese rice grown and harvested in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Lianoning Provinces. The cooperative plans to receive orders from its members by 8 May and will then import the Chinese rice when the orders reach 30 tons. The imported Chinese rice will be shipped to members by mail. The imported Chinese rice will sell for 3,500 yen per 10 kg, which includes postal charges and consumption tax. The cooperative intends to import the Chinese rice in cooperation with the volunteer group non-governmental organization (NGO) and the Japan Technology Development Assistance Organization's Dailian office, which is in charge of making business contacts with Chinese rice suppliers and of shipping the rice to Japan by air. For this reason, each member hoping to buy the Chinese rice is required to pay a 500 yen NGO membership fee. Universal Export's Japan branch office (in Kuroishi City, Aomori Prefecture), an American trading firm in Seattle, Washington, has imported Australian rice to Japan since late last year. The Australian rice is grown in New South Wales and the office places orders upon receiving purchase requests from Japanese consumers. The Australian rice has been sold for 9,900 yen per 18 kg and 10,450 yen per 19 kg. The Australian rice is transported by ship to Hong Kong and then shipped to Japan by air because of high international postal rates. According to the American branch office, it has received orders for 50 tons. Imos Corporation [name as published], a Japanese trading firm based in California, supplies Californian rice to Japanese consumers via Hong Kong. President Hiroshi Ishikawa originally planned to import the Californian rice by air to sell to Japanese consumers, but later shelved the plan and decided to set up his company in California out of fear that the systematic importation of foreign rice through the international postal service might violate the Foodstuff Control Law. His company has sold the California rice upon receiving customer orders for $75 per 18 kg. Rice importation through the international postal service has been allowed as an exceptional measure for personal consumption. Toshihiko Tsuruoka, Food Agency director general, told a House of Representative's Committee on Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries session last May that the Food Agency would allow a person to import 100 kg of rice a year. His statement drew attention at the time. The Food Agency takes the position of not allowing any systematic rice importation through the international postal service. But the rice imported through the international postal service is popular among Japanese consumers because it is cheaper than the domestic rice and taste almost the same. On many occasions, public organizations have not checked whether the rice imported through the international postal service carries pesticides or mold. Therefore, importing foreign rice is likely to raise sanitary safety questions.
