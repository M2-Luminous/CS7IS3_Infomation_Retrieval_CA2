This view was expressed both by Chinese and Japanese officials in charge of foreign trade in an interview with XINHUA before the Japanese premier's visit, which starts tomorrow. Takashi Koezuka, Japanese economic counsellor in Beijing, said that the prime minister's visit, following the recent visit to Japan by Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, is another important event in the two countries' bilateral relations. During the coming visit, the leaders of the two countries will exchange views on bilateral relations, especially economic and trade cooperation, and the international situation, he said. An agreement on expanding bilateral environmental cooperation is to be signed. "Although no agreement on economic and trade ties will be reached this time, deep and careful discussion on the long-term bilateral economic and trade ties will definitely promote the existing good ties," the counsellor said. An official from the Chinese Ministry of Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that since the economies of the two countries were complementary, and a historic opportunity to further bilateral trade ties was appearing, the high-level exchanges will promote bilateral economic and trade ties to a new stage on the basis of last year's high record. In 1993, Japan for the first time became China's biggest trade partner, with a trade volume of 39 billion U.S. dollars, a jump of 53.8 percent over the previous year. Japan's direct investment in China increased greatly during the same period, and its exports of technology and equipment to China accounted for 28 percent of China's total imports, ranking highest among China's trade partners. The official pointed out that in China's exports to Japan, the percentage of finished products has been increasing, but their added value was not high enough. "If more high-value added products are shipped over with the efforts of both sides, the potential of expanding China's exports will be very big," she said. She said she hoped that China's large trade deficit in this bilateral trade would be reduced soon by more varied means. With China becoming more open, more Sino-Japanese joint-ventures and cooperative enterprises will be established, she said. These companies will bring in a large amount of equipment from Japan, and export their finished products to Japan, as one way to increase bilateral trade. She added that in order to revive its economy, Japan will regulate its industrial structure and expand its overseas markets. To cooperate with China, whose economy is growing rapidly, is one of Japan's ideal solutions. Takashi Koezuka said that China, the second biggest trade partner of Japan, plays an important role in his country's foreign trade. The two-way trade developed tremendously last year though Japan's economy was in recession, so he believed that the prospect of bilateral trade this year was bright since Japan's economy will improve this year. He also said that more Japanese companies are interested in investing in China. According to a survey by the Japanese federation of economic organizations of its member companies, many of which are economic giants, the investment focus of most of them is on China for the next five years, rather than on South-East Asia, as it was in the past five years.
