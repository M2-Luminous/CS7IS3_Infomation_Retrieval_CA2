Chen Junsheng and his party came to Zhengguocheng and Gujinlou Townships in Nanle County to have cordial discussions with local cadres and the masses on the farms and the edges of the fields. He asked them in detail about local cotton production over the past two years, the acreage under cotton this year, and also the situation regarding preparatory work for sowing. Chen Junsheng and his party also visited peasant households, asking peasants what they needed from the government with regard to cotton production. In the county's cotton and linen company, Chen Junsheng inquired in detail about the preparation and supplies of chemical fertilizer, farm chemicals, and so on. On the morning of 9 April, Chen Junsheng, responsible comrades from the relevant departments directly under the provincial authorities, and relevant leaders of Puyang City and Nanle County listened to a report on our province's agricultural and rural economic work. Chen fully affirmed the efforts made by the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the whole province to promote cotton production. Chen Junsheng pointed out: The situation in Henan Province this year is favorable as a whole. The production output of cotton and tobacco has fallen but that of grain and oil crops has risen. Peasant incomes have also increased by a fairly big margin. However, we must not be too optimistic about the situation in cotton and grain production this year. Chen Junsheng stressed: Agriculture is the foundation of our national economy. People's livelihoods must be protected and we must provide them with food and clothing. Both of these are very important. The main problems in grain production are that large areas of the grain farms have been affected by drought and rice seedlings are not growing well [words indistinct]. The problem with cotton is the most serious this year. Provincial, city, and county governments have done a lot of work and made great efforts to deal with this problem. At present, what is most important is that we must ensure sufficient acreage under cotton. This year Henan must plant 14 million mu of cotton and strive for 15 million mu. We must firmly grasp preparatory work for sowing cotton and ensure sufficient supply of improved varieties of cotton and various kinds of agricultural means of production. We must not miss the farming season. We must do well various kinds of farm management work well and, in particular, we must properly grasp the work of preventing plant diseases and insects to strive for a good cotton harvest this year.
