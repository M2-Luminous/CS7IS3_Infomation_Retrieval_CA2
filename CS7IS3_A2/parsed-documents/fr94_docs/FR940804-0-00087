FR940804-0-00087 FR940804-0-00023 Section XX .6 Processing of Complaints of Employment Discrimination Filed With an Agency Other Than the EEOC Section XX .6 describes the basic procedures that section 504 agencies and the agencies designated to process complaints under the Department's title II regulation will follow in determining whether to process an employment complaint or to refer it to another agency. The primary purpose of the rule is to establish procedures for coordinating the processing of complaints or charges of employment discrimination arising under section 504 and title I of the ADA. However, the procedures for coordinating the processing of complaints or charges of employment discrimination against public entities: (i) that fall under the jurisdiction of title II and title I (but not section 504); and (ii) that fall under the jurisdiction of title II, but not title I (whether or not covered by section 504) established by §35.171 of the Department's title II regulation, have been restated here and integrated with the section 504 processing procedures for clarity and ease in processing by the affected agencies. Section XX .6 has been revised to eliminate the requirement that the initial receiving agency, or the Civil Rights Division, when a complaint is forwarded to it for a determination of jurisdiction, provide notice to the affected parties. As previously written, the regulation required notification by any agency that came into contact with a complaint or charge even if the complaint or charge was immediately forwarded to another agency. Instead of multiple notifications, the final rule now provides for a more efficient single notification at such time as the appropriate processing agency receives the complaint or charge, in accordance with agency policy and applicable law. Paragraph (b) of § XX .6 has been revised to provide that, if an agency determines pursuant to paragraph (a) that it does not have jurisdiction under section 504 or title II, and that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction under title I, the agency shall promptly refer the complaint to the Civil Rights Division. This is a change from the procedure set forth in the NPRM, which required a section 504 agency to refer all title II complaints to the Civil Rights Division. The revision was made in response to various comments pointing out that this was an inefficient procedure when the section 504 agency was certain that it was the designated agency under title II, and that the complaint would be referred back to it by the Civil Rights Division. Upon receipt of a referred complaint, the Civil Rights Division will determine whether another Federal agency may have jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 (that is, a Federal agency may be providing financial assistance to the respondent) or under title II (that is, the entity that is the subject of the complaint may be a public entity). When the Civil Rights Division finds such jurisdiction, it shall promptly refer the complaint to the appropriate agency. Paragraph (c) of § XX .6 sets forth the circumstances under which an agency that is a section 504 agency, a designated agency, or both, will promptly refer a complaint to the EEOC for investigation and processing. In addition to: (i) revising the regulation to reflect the procedures of the title VI/title VII regulation (which generally results in individual complaints being referred for processing to the EEOC); and (ii) incorporating the procedures already established by the title II regulation, paragraph (c) and the balance of § XX .6 more specifically set forth the requirements for either referral or retention applicable to each type of agency. Unlike the procedural scheme set forth in the NPRM, under which a complaint or charge could only be dual filed if it were actually filed with both a section 504 agency and the EEOC, a complaint or charge filed with one agency will now be deemed to be dual filed under both title I and section 504 under certain circumstances, as set forth in this section and in § XX .7. Paragraph (c)(1) of § XX .6 describes the rule applicable to an agency that receives a complaint of employment discrimination under section 504 or title II and determines that it does not have jurisdiction over the complaint. If the agency determines that the EEOC may have jurisdiction, the agency is required to promptly forward the complaint to the EEOC for processing. In certain instances this may require consultation with the EEOC. This paragraph establishes the requirements for section 504 and other agencies and includes the requirements established by §35.171(b)(2) of the title II regulation with respect to designated agencies. Paragraph (c)(2) establishes the referral requirements applicable to section 504 agencies and requires a section 504 agency that otherwise has jurisdiction over a complaint of employment discrimination to refer the complaint to the EEOC when the complaint solely alleges discrimination against an individual, unless the EEOC lacks jurisdiction over the complaint under title I, or the complainant requests that the section 504 agency retain jurisdiction, either independently, or following receipt of the notice letter described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (c)(2)(ii)(B). The referral to the EEOC of complaints solely alleging employment discrimination against individuals is a significant change in procedure from the NPRM. The revision was made in response to numerous comments urging this approach, which is consistent with the title VI/title VII regulation. This approach will serve to minimize duplicative efforts because the EEOC, in general, will be the primary agency investigating individual complaints of disability discrimination in employment. An individual's private right of action under title I of the ADA will also be preserved under this approach, since these section 504 complaints also will be deemed to be dual filed under title I. However, in order to preserve an individual's right to have his or her complaint processed by the section 504 agency, paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) requires the section 504 agency to retain the complaint for investigation if the complainant so requests. Paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (c)(2)(ii)(B) describe the notice letter a section 504 agency is required to send promptly to each complainant before the agency refers a complaint solely alleging employment discrimination against an individual to the EEOC. The purpose of the letter is to inform an individual who has initially filed his or her complaint with the appropriate section 504 agency of the basic implications of a referral of that complaint to the EEOC. It is anticipated that the vast majority of individual complaints will be referred to the EEOC, with the section 504 agency deferring its review and processing until the conclusion of the EEOC's processing. However, because an automatic referral to the EEOC of a complaint filed with a section 504 agency may be contrary to the complainant's expectations, complainants will be given the choice of having the EEOC or the section 504 agency investigate the complaint.
