FBIS4-15967 "drsov071_u_94010" FBIS-SOV-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Latvia Phone-Tapping Facility Found in Newspaper Office Phone-Tapping Facility Found in Newspaper Office WS1204172794 Tallinn BNS in English 1307 GMT 12 Apr 94 WS1204172794 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, Apr 12, BNS -- A tapping facility was found Monday [11 April] in the premises of the DIENAS BIZNESS (Daily Business) newspaper in the Press House, Chief Editor Juris Paiders said. Paiders had suspicion already earlier that conversations in his office were being overheard: facts discussed in a narrow circle became known to others before publication or without publication. Independent experts, invited by Paiders to search the rooms, found phone-tapping equipment in a telephone switchbox. The experts also showed how conversations in the room can be heard out in the street. One of the group told Paiders that the equipment was installed unprofessionally. But he did not rule out that more facilities were hidden in the editorial office. Paiders submitted an application to security service chief Juris Vectirans and asked to clear out the incident. Paiders claims that the problem is of great importance to the Latvian security because conversations of journalists often contain information that can be used to blackmail or indict someone mentioned.
