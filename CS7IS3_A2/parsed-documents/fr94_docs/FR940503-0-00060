ADDRESSES: Copies of the request for the delegation of authority and EPA's letter of delegation are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency Region IV, Air Programs Branch, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365.
