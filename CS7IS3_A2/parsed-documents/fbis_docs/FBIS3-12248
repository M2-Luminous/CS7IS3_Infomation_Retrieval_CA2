He meant that the killing of innocent people -- as was the case in Hebron today -- must stop. [Zelinger] What is the chairman's mood? Did you meet him this morning? [Al-Rajub] I was the first one who received the information about the Hebron incident, and I was the one who called and woke 'Arafat up. As you know, he was sleeping at the time. I gave him details about the incident. He was indeed very agitated. [Zelinger] One of the leaders of the rejectionist front organizations -- those who oppose 'Arafat and the peace process -- suggested that 'Arafat use his personal revolver and commit suicide. He said that 'Arafat and his peace process are a failure. [Al-Rajub] Look, nobody will teach us how to behave in such situations. I think that the lunatic and insane person who perpetrated the murder in Hebron today killed all the possibilities of pursuing the peace process. [Zelinger] Is it that bad? [Al-Rajub] Yes, this is what I believe. But those who oppose us can say whatever they want. They won't teach 'Arafat and Fatah how to behave in such situations. [Amir] Jibril al-Rajub, you are 'Arafat's adviser for West Bank affairs and are familiar with the Hebron events. You know that only one individual was responsible for this criminal attack. Do you believe that this tragic and criminal incident was the last nail in the Oslo agreement's coffin, and is this what you advised 'Arafat? [Al-Rajub] This is my personal opinion. I do not believe this was the work of one person. I do not think he could have perpetrated the attack without the support of somebody from the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] or the Israeli security services. [Zelinger] I want to understand, Mr. al-Rajub, are you recommending that 'Arafat terminate -- or at least freeze -- the peace process? [Al-Rajub] I am expressing my opinion as a fighter and a Palestinian. This is my personal opinion. [Zelinger] So you are speaking to us as a fighter and not as a man of peace? [Al-Rajub] I am a Palestinian citizen and fighter, as you know. I think that the man who shot the worshipers today killed all the possibilities for continuing the peace process in the region. [Zelinger] I want to understand you better; do you believe that the current peace process, based on the Oslo understandings, has no chances of success? [Al-Rajub] I do not think that any progress has been made. There was talk of progress, but the agreement should have been implemented months ago, but nothing was done yet. [Zelinger] Is this your personal opinion? We heard a similar opinion expressed by several opposition members in the territories. What does 'Arafat think? [Al-Rajub] The PLO leadership is currently meeting. I believe 'Arafat is under great stress. I think that it is still impossible to understand or speak about what happened in Hebron today. [Zelinger] One thing is certain, though. The position you are expressing is playing into the hands of all those who oppose the peace process, whether Jews or Arabs. [Al-Rajub] Look, I also cannot understand how after this incident people were still killed by the IDF....[several words indistinct] Our blood is also sacred. [Zelinger] Will you resign if 'Arafat pursues the peace process? [Al-Rajub] I will draw my own conclusions. [Amir] Jibril al-Rajub, you have heard the torrent of denunciations coming from the direction of the Israeli president, prime minister, and ministers. All of them referred to it as a tragic and despicable act perpetrated by one person. The Israeli supporters of the peace process are anxiously following this process and we are greatly interested in what the Palestinians think. You -- 'Arafat's aide -- are saying that this act terminated the entire peace process. Will Yasir 'Arafat pursue the peace process? [Al-Rajub] I am not the chairman's spokesman. You must realize, however, that there is a difference between denouncing such attacks and between taking steps to prevent their recurrence. I do not think this was the first such incident, but it is extremely grave and I believe we must draw the appropriate conclusions as a nation and an organization. Two months ago we started talking about peace and coexistence, but so far nothing has moved in that direction. [Zelinger] You presented yourself both as 'Arafat's aide and a fighter. What do you have to say today to your fighters in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank -- the Fatah Hawks? Will they receive new instructions now? [Al-Rajub] It is possible that they will receive new instructions. If real means to protect the Palestinian citizens are not implemented I think we will have to issue new orders. I say this with regret. [Amir] Does this mean breaking the agreement on a cessation to Fatah hostile acts and resuming the attacks? [Al-Rajub] I am afraid that unless real measures are not taken to protect the Palestinian citizens there will be new orders. [Zelinger] Is it possible that you are speaking now in a state of extreme agitation and that you will change your mind in the next few days? [Al-Rajub] I cannot say so now, but let's wait and see. [Zelinger] I want to thank you, Jibril al-Rajub -- one of the most senior aides of 'Arafat in Tunis. I understand you want to add something before we take our leave of you. [Al-Rajub] I only wanted to tell you that for us war is not an end, but only a means of achieving peace and security for our people. In this case I do not think it is the right way [sentence as heard].
