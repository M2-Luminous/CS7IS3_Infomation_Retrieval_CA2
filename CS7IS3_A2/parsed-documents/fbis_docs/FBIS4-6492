Svoik, co-chairman of the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan, told KCNA that the concrete wall artificially blocking the travel of fellow countrymen and bisecting the country must be pulled down at once. Saying he had seen the West Sea barrage and the concrete wall during his visit to Korea, he noted: "The wonderful West Sea barrage is a peaceful structure while the concrete wall built in the area south of the military demarcation line is a military setup for division. They represent a sharp contrast. "The gigantic barrage was built by the Korean people with their own design, technology and labour. This shows how powerful the economic potential of Korea is. The successful completion of this vast nature-harnessing project is a result of the wise guidance of Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean people, and Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader. "While seeing the West Sea barrage built under the far-reaching plan to completely free the people from the fetters of nature and the concrete wall, a military setup bisecting the territory and the nation, we could know clearly who truly wants peace and reunification."
