Continuous Incidents (Part Three of Four) -- The Xu Haining Incident A number of incidents between China and Britain also occurred at the time, one being the Xu Haining [1776 3189 1337] incident, and another the Yang Yang [2799 3152] affair. As stated above, Xu Haining played a frequent role in Hong Kong's public activities during the 4 June period, holding up a banner with the words "NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY Branch" at the million-person demonstration rally on 21 April 1989, as well as giving a speech in his capacity as an employee of a NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY [NCNA] branch at a race track mass rally, which was reported widely in the media, making him for a time the man of the hour in Hong Kong. After these incidents occurred, while I kept Zheng Hua [6774 5478] [deputy director of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA] from investigating them, Xu Haining was very nervous about them, so left the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA and went into hiding. As we were concerned that he might flee abroad, we sent someone to find him. The one who found him reported that he was staying at a friend's home, being somewhat panic-stricken and distraught. While our messenger told him that he would have no problems if he returned to the NCNA, he did not believe this and was not ready to return. But before long, he returned on his own, after which not only did we not reproach him, but, in an attempt to calm him down, I even sent the leader of the concerned department to console him. But after a few days, he again ran away on the sly. We very quickly heard that he had been taken to London by the British Hong Kong government. We immediately reported this to Beijing, which immediately told us to negotiate with the British Hong Kong government for Xu Haining's return. But as the British Hong Kong government claimed to have no knowledge of him, the matter was "suspended" (shelved). At the time, a concerned NCNA branch department discovered that many employees of Chinese agencies were lined up at certain foreign consulates to apply for emigration. And certain other employees of Chinese agencies were saying privately that they would not be transferred back to China and, if they were, they certainly would not go, being ready when necessary to go abroad. As we were already somewhat prepared psychologically for this, having guessed that Hong Kong's Chinese agencies might lose some people, we did not treat the the Xu Haining matter as a crucial one, so that we took it up with the British Hong Kong government only to make them think twice. Before long, the Chinese Embassy in London telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee that Xu Haining had fled on his own to the Chinese Embassy in Britain, and was asking to be returned home. Xu Haining claimed that it was the British Hong government that had sent someone to escort him to London, after which he was settled by a refugee agency, which gave him 70 pounds sterling a day. While there was also someone to accompany him on a tour of London for the first few days, no one paid him any attention later, leaving him feeling helpless, so that he fled to the embassy to ask to be returned home. So the embassy telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee for instructions on how to handle the matter. After exchanging views with the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we telegraphed our embassy in London that we wanted Xu Haining returned to China. But the embassy then telegraphed us that Xu Haining had fled again, and could not be found. It turned out that the British had learned of Xu Haining's contacts with the Chinese Embassy, so had moved him elsewhere. A few days later, Xu Haining again ran to our embassy, which retained him this time, negotiating with the British Government for his return home, and buying him a plane ticket. But the British Government asked to send someone to talk with Xu Haining, which request was refused by the Chinese Embassy, which agreed only to allow the British to send someone to question him at the airport in the company of [Chinese] Embassy personnel. It was learned that the British asked Xu Haining only if returning home was his own wish, to which he replied that it was. Which was how he left Britain and was returned to China. Beijing's view was that the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee should handle the matter. So we decided to let him return first to Guangzhou to recuperate at our Guangzhou #8 Office Guest House, where we assigned someone to give him some work to do to calm him down. But as the Hong Kong media was looking for him everywhere, and Xu Haining was from Hangzhou, we contacted the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, sent him to Hangzhou, and asked Zhejiang Province to arrange for a place to let him recuperate. We considered Xu Haining in his state no longer suitable for return to work in Hong Kong, so asked the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee to let him stay in Zhejiang and to find other work for him.
