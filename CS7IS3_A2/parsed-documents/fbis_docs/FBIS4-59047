This clique aims at destroying the homeland and wasting its resources. The separatist gang -- which is rebelling against constitutional legitimacy, led by the butcher, who is immersed in the blood of conspiracies against our people, the so-called 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and his clique -- is retaliating against Yemeni unity, your greatest achievement in the contemporary age. It is firing its missiles and shells on your historical and political capital, Sanaa, in order to annihilate its peaceful people. It is not strange to see this gang, which killed and displaced thousands of Yemeni people in the black events of January 1986, seeking alliance with all devils and losing all sense of nationalism. The sons of your brave Armed Forces are now waging the most honorable battle to purge the country of their filth. We will soon announce to you the crushing of the forces of apostasy, which reneged faith in God while raising the slogan of Communist ideology.
