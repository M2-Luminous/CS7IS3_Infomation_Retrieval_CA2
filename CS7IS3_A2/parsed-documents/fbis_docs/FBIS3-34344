We will have two short sermons today, with an eye on the time and current needs. The first sermon will include mostly issues relating to the revolution and its anniversary and some current issues. [passage omitted] In my view one of the most effective factors in this important event should be sought in the people's awareness and vigilance. We have clearly felt, and feel, with all our being, that the strongest factor which made us victorious in the revolution and has foiled -- and still foils -- plots and acts of mischief and also safeguarded us and made us triumphant in the war, and gives us the opportunity to plan and carry out important infrastructural work, is that same awareness of the people and their vigilance and presence on the scene. The reason why the people have become like that and why that awareness came about and why this phenomenon occurred in Iran, and why other places are not yet ripe for this divine phenomenon, cannot be overlooked easily. They raise fresh questions which lead to other questions when answered. [passage omitted] The most fundamental thing that has happened during the last 20 years of struggle and the Islamic struggles of the previous decades is that the awareness of the people has increased. [passage omitted] Competent leadership is the next thing. Very well, people are aware and vigilant and ready for self-sacrifice. If the masses are vigilant but have no leader to lead them they will face problems. We have seen such problems in many areas. But such appropriate grounds, people's awareness, make the leadership a great deal easier. We have many interesting examples of that. We did not have any political parties or party training before the revolution, we had no party network to bring people together and discipline them. We had masses of the self-initiating people. If you look at the moves made during the last year of the revolution you see that all of them were guided and well calculated. If the people wanted to go on strike, they had leadership. If the headquarters in charge of the strikes issued an order that this sector should go on strike and the other sector should not, the people accepted that, even though it was difficult for them not to go on strike. When we said that the oil workers should go on strike, because at that time oil revenue was the main source of income for the Pahlavi regime and the world and the supporters of the regime would also have been greatly damaged by the loss of four or five million barrels of Iranian oil, the workers went on strike. Later, we discovered that there were difficulties in our domestic consumption, the people were faced with difficulties in their domestic use, then a delegation which went to the oil producing regions on behalf of the imam -- and I was a member of that delegation -- we witnessed an amazing degree of obedience among all these diverse but aware and vigilant groups. [passage omitted] The other issue that I wish to refer to now -- and it is an issue of great importance in the science of sociology and the movement of masses and history --is the trust which existed between the masses of the people and the leaders of the masses. This trust is very effective. If such a degree of trust existed in Afghanistan today, there would not be these wars there. If there was a person who was accepted by the people and who instructed the people not to fight and told them what to do, the people would have accepted it. If such a degree of trust is created in any society between the leaders and the masses of the people and if this trust can be consolidated and can continue, this will provide the basis for movement, it will provide the means for eliminating difficulties and fighting against disruptions. At the beginning of the Islamic revolutionary movement the enemies of Islam became aware of this secret. We see that from the first days of the revolution, the first weeks of the revolution, there were many efforts to create a rift between the leadership and the people, between the officials and the people. All the propaganda means of news imperialism and their domestic agents were used to weaken the trust of the people in their leaders and officials and to eliminate the love and affection which existed between the leadership and officials and the people. This was one of the things they never succeeded in achieving. They carried out repeated attacks on that fortress, they exerted a great deal of pressure on that rampart, they subjected that popular trench to repeated bombardments, but they never produced any results. The bombs boomeranged back to themselves and targeted themselves. Of course they have also used other means, they created internal unrest -- which they described as street clashes -- they staged a coup d'etat, they imposed the war with Iraq against us, they staged economic sanctions against us and did whatever they could; but what is still continuing is their molestation and satanic moves which started since the outset of the revolution. These things were ad hoc. Street unrest, revolts and insecurity did not last long and we saw that it was the people who repelled such plots. [passage omitted] You see that they have pursued a continuous chain of action, which is still going on, to create a rift between the officials and the people. They have a number of ad hoc means to which they resort such as war, revolt, and other such things. We feel that the revolution is victorious in all arenas and it enjoys better support than it did 15 years ago and it is developing further. If it used to be easy for the enemy to create a shock, now it is no longer so. A better way of saying that is that the revolution has reached certain maturity. [passage omitted] Today I see the foundations of the revolution to be so strong, its roots so deep in the heart of this community, the branches of the holy tree of the revolution so tall throughout the space of our country and other environments, and I see the people so much more aware, sincere and more in the arena, in line and in one with the revolution, that I think that those dangers that our enemies traditionally plot have passed by the revolution and our 15-year-old revolution has traversed a 100-year course. Those sentiments, those sympathies, that strange scene that we saw at the immaculate tomb of his eminence the imam [Khomeyni] on 1 February, and the sentiments that came from the people after that -- and still does -- are all proof to our claim. Now the march on 22 Bahman this year [11 February] will show those who had plotted to pale the hue of the revolution this year that their arrows have hit granite, those tricks have become old hat for our nation, the people have been vaccinated against those germs and will no longer be influenced. It is truly a wonderful event in the world. [passage omitted] This incident to which your attention has now been drawn -- the assassination attempt -- to my mind this is a very minor issue which can always happen. A few people can always give rise to a small incident. However, these things are no longer of any importance to the revolution. You should feel quite reassured about that. The revolution has now become quite separated from individuals. I said that the revolution has reached the stage of maturity; it is no longer a child which needs suckling. It provides its own sustenance. A lofty figure like the imam of the ummah departed from among these people. At that time we shuddered to think about what would happen when the imam would no longer be among us. Then we witnessed this calm movement of an ocean of people, and this Islamic revolution continues forever on its path. Through divine guidance, this ship correctly continues its voyage toward its destination in this tumultuous ocean. How effective can individuals be any longer in this revolution that others should put themselves in trouble, should put themselves in danger so that a certain individial may or may not be there; and that a person like me who is one of the most minor soldiers of this revolution! I say that world arrogance, America and others should really know that in Iran they should give up the hope that by the physical or psychological elimination of individuals they can overcome the revolution. May God protect you, your revolution and the leader of the revolution. We are very weak soldiers. There are many people like me who can be in the service of the people. Nothing important will take place through this route of assassination attempts. Those who planned this act of mischief had something else in mind, something more than me. As I said, I am only an individual. Their aim was to weaken the revolution, to weaken the presence of the people upon the stage. If one day they can achieve that goal, they believe that they have achieved something major. Therefore, this is what they had in mind. They thought that in the presence of foreign reporters and the guests of the Ten Days of Dawn, in the first official meeting of the celebrations, a minor action which would have given rise to a great deal of publicity would have achieved those goals. This would have disrupted the very first meeting and would have created insecurity, and this would be the first defeat of the regime during the Ten Days of Dawn. This would have taken the luster away from the subsequent meetings, people would have felt insecure and would not have attended them. This would have been a sign to the world that the revolution had lost its luster. Of course, if they had achieved greater success and had been able to get rid of someone this would have provided them with greater success. However, this is the sign of their stupidity. They should have looked a little to the past and to the events around them. Did not a bomb explode right here in the Friday prayers a few years ago, and did it not scatter parts of some people's bodies around the trees? Was the meeting disrupted? Did the Friday imam that day take one step back? Were the subsequent Friday prayers deserted? This should have been an example. This was just the sound of a few shots, of a bomb. Have we forgotten that during the Friday prayers, in marches Iraqi bombers flew overhead and the roaring of the aircraft drowned the sound of the loudspeakers; but these people with their clenched fists and with the shouts of God is Great remained steadfast. How foolish it is to imagine that with such actions they can weaken the morale of the people. It is a futile hope that the morale of the people could be weakened. The new strategy of world arrogance which I also referred to in a previous sermon, and the new official policy of colonialism regarding us is to weaken the morale of the people. Everything can be summed up in this one sentence. Such actions, and the efforts to minimize the achievements of the revolution or to exaggerate the difficulties of the revolution are their constant policies. Those policies may occasionally be intensified or occasionally be abated, but our people are vigilant. Our people understand. Our people see the countries around them. They see their neighboring countries. They see other revolutions. They see their own lives and they compare them. First of all, the people see that what they staged the revolution for is getting stronger. Those who sacrifice their children are not after a more luxurious living. One sells all that one possesses and spends it on one's sick child. Here, they offer their young men, one or two or three, to be martyred in the fronts. It is clear that these people are after somethig different. You cannot deal with these people through material means. Second, do not the people notice material issues? Even if for a hundred times they say that there are difficulties in Iran, there is such and such, when the people see that during the Ten Days of Dawn a factory, for instance a petrochemical plant, started production and it was officially announced that 1,000, I mean, that 700 factories have severed their links with foreign countries and are now providing their raw material from inside and by the hands of their own workers; when people see these tangible things, when they see that during the Ten Days of Dawn thousands of projects in villages and cities and everywhere have starting production, let someone moan or say something. Even in these issues the people will not be deceived and will not be misled. The people are not so illiterate and uninformed. If the people were uninformed they would have been misled and would have left the stage as the result of the propaganda during the satanic shah's period. In any case, thanks be to God, they have missed their target. Regarding myself, I said that it was not important. The sentiments which I witness toward myself are really too much for me, I feel ashamed for so much kindness, for so many messages, for so many expressions of support. I ask all the dear ones, my brothers, and the nation to regard all this expression of kindness as sufficient. If there is a hearing ear, this much is sufficient to make them understand the situation inside our society. They should not waste their time on these messages and such like. I express my sincere thanks. It is not that I do not attach importance to these, but I believe that the issue is not worthy for you to spend your time and efforts on it. I am grateful. Let all the messages and expressions of support be for these 10 Days of Dawn and for the programs and ceremonies of the 10 Days of Dawn. [passage omitted]
