NATO military commanders must also closely study the situation in the UN-declared safe zones under Bosnian Serb siege before replying to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who asked NATO Monday [18 April] for airstrike authorisation. Bosnian Serbs are on the point of taking the Moslem town of Gorazde, one of the six so-called safe areas.
