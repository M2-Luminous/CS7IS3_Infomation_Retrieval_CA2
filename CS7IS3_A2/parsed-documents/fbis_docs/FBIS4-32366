So far, over 1.3 million applications have been accepted, and further 600,000 additional claims were submitted at the beginning of this year. The state allocated compensation coupons exceeding a nominal value of 100 billion forints [HUF] (approx. $1 billion), and experts expect 1.5 times as many to be distributed in the future. The new government intends to speed up the process. Compensation began three years ago. The parties of the 1990 government coalition (Hungarian Democratic Forum, Independent Smallholders' Party, Christian Democratic People's Party) focussed on compensating people who lost their porperties in the late 1940's or early 1950's. They believed that citizens kept in custody or deported for political reasons should be similarly treated. Later the government included the victims of fascism and their relatives. The economic condition of Hungary not allowing to pay total damages, the government only initiated partial compensation. The opposition parties fully agreed to settling grievances on moral levels, but excluded financial means foreseeing this would further saddle the economy. Being in majority, government parties could get their will through in parliament. Over 900,000 people have been compensated for lost properties, and over 300,000 for having been politically persecuted. In case of nationalized properties, the entitled ones have received compensation coupons in proportion to their losses. These coupons can be sold, as well as used for purchasing state assets or land. They could be also exchanged for annuities. Nearly half a million people acquired land through compensation. Compensation coupons have also been introduced on the stock exchange, their rate of exchange depending on the shares in state companies available for them. Their rate of exchange reached a peak at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, when prospering state firms that have been introduced on the stock market regularly offered their shares for coupons. Those who were patient enough bought shares and later could sell them on the stock market well above the nominal value of the compensation coupons. Many people, especially the elderly, decided not to wait for the issuance of shares, but sold their coupons at the daily exchange rate or below, thus obtaining a much smaller amount than possible. Some individuals and brokers who bought coupons at low prices managed to accumulate significant fortunes. If spent on state properties, the interest rates of compensation coupons are included in their exchange rate. The Compensation Office and its auxiliary offices, employing a staff of 1,200, have already judged 1.5 million applications, most of them favorably. According to general opinion, they have successfully overcome bureaucratic delays. After four decades, many found it difficult to certify their once-owned properties. In cases like that, the officials only required two witnesses for testifying the genuineness of a claim. Yet the number and value of shares fell far behind the quantity and nominal value of compensation coupons. Therefore, banks were flooded by huge crowds at issuing times. The former opposition parties that won the May 1994 elections promised they would continue compensation as prescribed by law. There is some uncertainty, however, over the extent of the possible realization of their intentions. According to their recent statements, one of the first moves of the Socialists will be to cut central spending, and implement a tight monetary policy. They wish to continue privatization with more efficiency and with simultaneous efforts to reduce unemployment. The question is how the allocation of over HUF200 billion private investment can be fitted into this programme, knowing there has been only HUF30 million coverage used for the open-ended compensation coupons issued so far.
