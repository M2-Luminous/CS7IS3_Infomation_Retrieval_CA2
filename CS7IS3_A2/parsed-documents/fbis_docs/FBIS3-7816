That permanent determination of ours can not be threatened by various blockades, political and economic pressures, like the recent decision of the Greek Government to close its border and its Thessalonike port for our goods. Just like before, we firmly stand up to all pressures and will not allow any one to deny us the name we have had with centuries. Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] survives and will go on surviving. We have no territorial aspirations towards any of our neighbors, and therefore not towards our southern one, either. That is why we propose, with a clear conscience, to sit down and discuss all the differences between our two countries, on an equal basis."
