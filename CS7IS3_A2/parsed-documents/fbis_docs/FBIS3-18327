"I hope that the return of the prime minister's post to an elected member of parliament, considering the Italian tradition, will be seen as a positive sign for Italy, a signal that Italy is returning to normalcy and ending a critical phase," Ciampi said. Ciampi, a former central bank governor, has been in a caretaker position ever since he tendered his resignation on January 13. He is not running in the March 27-28 elections and intends to withdraw from politics after his present government is sent home, presumably after the new parliament takes office on April 15. "I was personally involved in this government because this transition was seen as best carried out by a non-parliament member," he said, referring to the decision by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to give Ciampi a mandate in April of last year. Italy over the last two years has been caught up in burgeoning corruption scandals, which decimated the traditional parties, discredited many members of parliament and initiated widespread calls for voting and institutional reforms. A spate of car bombings in the spring and early summer of last year, combined with two rounds of local elections, deepening recession and the birth or mutation of many political parties, all added to growing political uncertainty.
