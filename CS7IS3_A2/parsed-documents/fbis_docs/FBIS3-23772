Pyvovarov: "Do We Have a Chance To Stop our Fall Into the Economic Abyss?"] [Text] I asked Volodymyr Hrynyov, leader of the "New Ukraine" coalition, and Viktor Pynzenyk, chairman of the Ukrainian Fund for Supporting Reforms, to answer the following three questions: 1. Do you see a way to resolve the current critical situation? 2. Under simultaneous inflation and stagnation, is it expedient to regulate the monetary-financial system without reanimating industries and agriculture? 3. Is it expedient to introduce the hryvna [national currency] under the current economic circumstances? Volodymyr Hrynyov: "People Cannot Stay Long in an Abyss of Despair" 1. Before answering this question, I want to ask another one: What kind of reform did Gaydar carry out in Russia? People call it shock therapy or monetarism, but it is the pace of reform that matters. Gaydar's reforms were rapid from his point of view but slow from the perspective of their objective necessity. In my opinion, reform in post-communist countries can only survive if it is carried out expeditiously, because people cannot stay in the abyss of despair too long. Of course, society is not a column of soldiers where everyone can be put in one line and told to move in one direction. Well-being of all its members cannot grow simultaneously. Some people are bound to get rich quicker, while others will get more and more poor; inefficient enterprises will be closed down, and unemployment swell. Unfortunately, nobody ever invented a way to realign the economy to market tracks avoiding social cataclysms. Analyzing the situation in Russia where reform, unlike in Ukraine, was finally launched, one comes to the conclusion that it did not start there on time either. Financial stabilization was carried out in fits and starts, and was accompanied by cases of credit emission. I am referring to the mistakes in Russian reform to avoid similar ones in Ukraine. The first conclusion is -- reform must be carried out promptly. However, how rapidly should this be done to avoid social flare-ups? Being a technocrat, I know that sound travels at different speeds in different media and attempts to accelerate this process may ruin the latter. The same can be said about reform: It should be carried out as rapidly as the social situation and people's mentality allow it. As I said, there always will be people dissatisfied with the heavy burden of reform. Thus, economic reform should be carried out on the "threshold" of people's patience and readiness to carry its weight. If reform slows down, this may lead to the accumulation of discontent and thus, disrupt the process. At the same time, excessive speed of reform may result in the people's failure to understand the cause of the former. I understand that your question is: What should we do in Ukraine to prevent this? In the first place, privatization must be carried out expeditiously. Ukraine is mature enough for mass privatization. One might say that in the West this process lasted decades. However, there is a big difference between us and them. Private property in the West has long existed and a normal process of economic development is under way. Thus, the Western variant of privatization involves the selling of facilities that have not been privatized by now. They have nowhere to hurry, while we want this process to be carried out rapidly. Why? Because we need a stratum of owners for alleviating social tension. Owners are quite different from beggars who have nothing to lose other than their chains. The second important aspect is the creation of a land market. This market should not be limited to rural areas; land should also be sold in urban areas, where enterprises should be sold along with land to private owners, including foreigners. Today, we have the potential to inject financial means in the economy by using the real resources that we possess, including land, enterprises, and real estate. These are noninflationary means facilitating structural reshaping of which much is being said and little done. I understand that we cannot embrace the entire economy with these stabilizing measures, and I have always advocated the forming of "stability islands" as the first step. Hopes that the economic giant malformed and destabilized for 70 years can be brought back to its feet in one rush, are futile. At the same time, we can initiate this process in special economic zones and territories where market mechanisms will be launched, including the functioning of securities, shares, bonds, and other components of a normal economy. Yet, sticking to the ideology, we have been stubbornly trying to revive our economy by macroeconomic means. This is doomed to failure. Whether we want it or not, we will have to begin with reform in regions and stabilize the economy "bit by bit." This should be done on the basis of the entire system of markets -- those of land, capital, real estate, labor, and products. 2. We have always been told that priority should be given to production. This has become a part of our socialist mentality. Proceeding from this postulate, we have tried to expand production and now, we are as ardently attempting to save the latter. Yet, let us answer this question: Why save it? What advantages is this going to bring? Only those enterprises should be preserved that meet peoples' demands. We have no way to maintain production, other than subsidizing priority enterprises and branches vital for the economy. All others must take care of themselves. Our "care" for production results in destroying the economy. In market economies the main goal is to sell a product not just manufacture it. The rapid formation of a class of owners is not sufficient for enhancing the efficiency of production; on the contrary, this might have the opposite effect. However, this is a precondition for the optimal use of privatization money. This money can be spent on modernizing the capital stock and introducing new technologies. Enterprises will begin manufacturing products for which there is a demand, which can be rapidly sold and yield high profits. This means that privatization is a priority in the creation of a market economy that would be stable and efficient. A land market is a necessary prerequisite for financial stabilization. An intensive flow of capital will create noninflationary sources for the structural reshaping of the production sector. Finally, we should constantly explain to the people the meaning of all measures taken to reform the economy. Only then, can reform be carried out firmly and rapidly, supported by a majority of people. 3. The exhaustion of the coupon has become evident. This is why the demands to urgently introduce the hryvna are becoming louder and louder. Hopes that the new monetary unit will resolve our financial problems are very naive. The power of national currencies does not depend on what name is printed on a piece of paper, but what material wealth backs it. Russia's raw materials, although sold at dumping prices, serve as the basis for the ruble. What basis do we have for stabilizing the hryvna? Our products might become such a source of stability, but only after they become competitive on foreign markets. Viktor Pynzenyk: "Not Until We Stop the Printing Press...." 1. The opinion that we do not know how to overcome the acute crisis appeared not due to a lack of programs or their erroneous nature, but due to a stalemate in implementing them. Thus, the question is not how to exit the situation but how to persevere in reshaping the economy. There can be disputes over the sequence of reforms, but stopping the money-printing press is undoubtedly the first thing that must be done. Without this, fighting inflation is out of question. Trillions of karbovanetses are being printed every month. Production is not expanding, while the volume of money in circulation is increasing on a daily basis. This results in skyrocketing prices. The postulate that the more money is printed the larger the purchasing power, is false. We cannot consume more products than we manufacture. No matter how often the price of bread is increased, the number of loaves will not double. The budget deficit is one of the main causes of the increased printing of money. Our state's money supply is represented by two components: 20 percent of it is cash, and 80 percent noncash money. Suppose, the National Bank declares that they are putting an additional two trillion into circulation. In fact, this money is not printed; it is only added to bank accounts. Thus, by stopping the printing presses we will deliver a heavy blow to the budget deficit. This cannot be done instantaneously, just as it is impossible to stop a speeding car at a moment's notice. In the economy, we need time to gradually slow down the process of printing money and thus, curb inflation. Financial stability will limit credit emission and reduce budget expenditures. On the other hand, bureaucrats will be devoid of the possibility to abuse authority and embezzle state property. Having stopped the printing of money we will eliminate profiteering on inflation processes. Take this example: A state-run store purchases a shipment of recorders costing 100,000 karbovanetses each and then holds off on selling them. Due to inflation, the price hits 300,000 by the end of the month. Will the store sell the recorders at the new price? This will bring no profit. They make a deal with a private store owner and sell him the recorders for 300,000 a piece. In this case, the state and private storekeepers will each receive 100,000. Such redistribution of profits has become a commonplace phenomenon. The larger the difference between the purchase and selling price, the larger the "shadow" redistribution. In this case, administrative control is helpless. The solution lies in privatization and the appearance of private owners. The latter will not let anyone profit at his expense. He will officially conduct the revaluation of his products, being interested in earning more money. He will also pay a higher tax to the state. Ukraine also needs major changes in the sphere of foreign economic activities. We are in need of so many different products, especially power resources! However, we need larger exports to have money to buy more products abroad. Our exports are tied up with quotas, licenses, and taxes. Today, when prices on domestic and international markets are commensurate, there is no economic justification for preserving quotas. The only way to regulate exports is by increasing export duties. Returning convertible currency to the state is an important problem. When people know for sure that their hard currency assets are not devaluating, bringing money back [to Ukraine] will be advantageous. Otherwise, the mass flow of capital out of the state will continue. Only economic stabilization can bring the money back. Due to ill-suited foreign economic policies, exporting products becomes unprofitable. Buying hard currency from producers at a fixed price, the state has in fact imposed an additional export tax. Who will trade with foreign countries under such conditions? This brings us to the idea of a deregulated exchange rate for hard currencies, which is a normal measure throughout the civilized world. Now, the question is how to make imports advantageous for the state. Suppose I have received money for purchasing oil, but buy cigarettes and chewing gum instead, claiming that my counterpart abroad has no oil. In this case, economic mechanisms should be enacted, including high customs duties of 100 or even 200 percent. This is the way to protect native producers. A lot of economic notions meet with uncivilized perverted interpretation in our state. Accompanied by credit emission, the deregulating of prices is lethal for society in the current situation. When we manage to avoid emission, the situation will normalize. How? If I have 40,000 karbovanetses in my pocket, no matter how hard you try you cannot take more out of it. Setting prices free and limiting emission will reduce demand and curb prices. However, so far, we have been limiting cash payments by limiting wages, while noncash emission has been at the same level. Thus, wholesale prices have been increasing bringing about increases in retail prices. Neither should we be afraid of bankruptcy. Thousands of enterprises go bankrupt in the United States every year. Bankruptcy in market economies merely amounts to a change of owners. A new owner comes, injects new funds, reorganizes and modernizes the enterprise and technologies, and the enterprise becomes profitable again. 2. Regulating the monetary-financial system without reanimating industries and the agriculture is impossible. What are the advantageous spheres of activity these days? Production is not one of them, because it entails huge expenditures and does not rapidly yield profits. This explains the recent dramatic decline in investments. Given our high inflation that exceeds interest rates on credits, it has become very profitable to buy products and keep them. First, measures must be taken to make subsequent selling of the same product unprofitable. To achieve this, the interest rates on credits should exceed inflation. This will resolve the problem of people's savings. People will find it advantageous to deposit money in banks aware that in a year they will be able to buy more for the same sum. If inflation is reduced, so will interest rates. Then, investing in production may become profitable again unlike middleman operations. Thus, we can revive production only by stabilizing the financial system. 3. Ukraine has its currency called the coupon, while its noncash equivalent is called the Ukrainian karbovanets. Calling it dollar or hryvna will not change the situation. The power of money does not depend on its name; it depends on the state's policy toward it. What will the introduction of the hryvna change if the printing press is not stopped? Thus, it is a delusion to believe that a change in the name of Ukraine's national currency will improve the economic situation. I am afraid that this populist step will be made. The hryvna's introduction has been so much talked about that people started to pin their hopes on it. However, no such experiments should be conducted with people. First, we must halt inflation. Italians, Poles, or the Japanese are not worried over the exchange rates of their national currencies because these rates are stable. Neither would we worry had the price of the U.S. dollar in Ukraine been stable. What ails me however, is that the printing of money is devaluating the coupon more and more. Under these conditions, the fate of the hryvna will be the same. Our experts have lately been moving toward confiscation-like monetary reform. The claims that this alone can stabilize the national currency are ridiculous. They believe that 9 trillion karbovanetses are "wandering" in Ukraine. On the one hand this is not a huge sum, taking into account current inflation rates and prices. On the other hand, this money is not "wandering," because people prefer to buy a couple of dollars to save their money from inflation. There is no technical justification for this kind of fiscal reform. This would be a merely technical act: 10,000 coupons will be exchanged for one hryvna and the latter will be declared hard currency. However, over one month inflation will "soften" this currency so much that the hryvna will have the same "battered look" as the unliked coupon. Money printing is a continuous process -- once you do it you cannot stop. The hryvna can only be introduced after inflation is curbed.
