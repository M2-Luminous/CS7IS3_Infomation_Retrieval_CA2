As Before, the President Is for a Referendum"] [Text] It can be said that the president's phrase about the fact that "a compromise on this question is impossible" has become paramount. One way or another the participants in the debate returned to it, and I must admit that I continued to expect that someone from the opposition would say something like: "If the president will not compromise even on this question, then what can be expected when his powers are broadened?! This is in reference to a very sore subject--the form of statehood: parliamentary or presidential. But although such an acute extreme was not heard, the extreme wing of the opposition in the person of Gagik Oganesyan (ARFD) [Armenian Revolutionary Federation Dashnak] noted that contrary to the thesis on the unacceptability of a compromise, it is exactly what is needed, and exactly now. And that the instability is exactly the result of the absence of a constitution. And, consequently, to avoid it, and for the sake of preserving stability; that is, in the interests of the people, a quicker adoption of the constitution is necessary exactly at the price of compromise. In his opinion, to submit all of the variants of the constitution to the judgment of the people is inadvisable, and it is necessary to arrive at a final draft through a constitutional assembly, which will then submit it to a referendum. This is really a compromise, judging by the fact that Gagik Oganesyan emphasized that he agrees with this, although he himself was always a supporter of parliamentary rule. His comment on why the communists were laboring on the creation of their own draft, when we have been living under their constitution up until now, evoked an appropriate reaction in the hall. Moreover, for the sake of fairness, it is necessary to note that this was not simply a dig. "We had a very democratic constitution and a very totalitarian regime." This statement was a key to the future--the issue was not so much and not only about how democratic and perfect the law is on paper as about how it is being put into effect. That is, if the president will be a dictator by nature, nothing will prevent him from "crushing" the basic law as well, for which there are examples in history. It is impossible to refute this conclusion either logically or with reason, the role of personality in history--contrary to what was taught in Soviet schools--is unquestionable. Moreover, to some degree it is the personality of the present leader that lies at the basis of conceptual disagreements about the role of the president in the future republic. Although it is obvious that the maximum perfection of the law is in its "paper execution," nevertheless, there is a guarantee of avoiding extremes, just as there is of putting the laws into effect. Incidentally, the latter is so important that it is difficult not to be amazed sometimes why there is all of this strife mainly around the role of the president, and not around the accuracy and clarity of other also significant circumstances. In this connection, it is difficult to disregard the speech of Tigran Sarkisyan (NDU) [National Democratic Union]. Especially from the standpoint of the notorious parliamentary professionalism. He noted the political aspect casually: Not one of the submitted variants was perfect; therefore, it would be more sensible to settle on a draft for a transition period, but it will last for no less than 10 years, and it will be very painful. As yet, the social strata and mechanisms have not been formed--both economic and political--as a result of which there is no clear expression of their interests, their defense, and representation. Mr. Sarkisyan placed the main emphasis on the economic block of drafts, which it was generally feasible to expect from the leader of the finance-budgetary commission, and it demonstrated a professional approach. Mr. Sarkisyan said that the main flaw that was basic and common to all of the variants of the constitution in the block that he subjected to analysis was the sloganizing and the lack of accurate mechanisms. How does a budget come up for examination, who approves it, and who is responsible for it? It would seem that the government submits it, but what it is--the government--is not clear in even one variant. There is no list of its powers. What is more, as it becomes clear, it is not parliament that determines its structure. It turns out that both the structure and the formation of the Cabinet of Ministers is the prerogative of the government of this "something" that, nevertheless, possesses the powers to prolong the adoption of a vitally important decision for 30 days. Can the Supreme Soviet introduce changes to the budget that is submitted by the government? But, after all, this is an important point, as the last word--ratification--rests with parliament. But this is not specified in the drafts. But if, for example, the Supreme Soviet does not ratify the budget, and the government works in the old way, then maybe this is advantageous to it and it is what inspires or provokes hostility. But where are the stipulated mechanisms of mutual relations, the rights and duties, and the conditions of ratification or no ratification? Mr. Sarkisyan's summary about the need for a clear law on the government will hardly seem unimportant to anyone. It is more likely that it is precisely one of the elements for the "paper implementation" to be absolutely correct, just as is the element of another also--when the mechanisms are clearly designated, the probability of "starting them up", that is, putting them into effect, is increased significantly. Rafik Mkhitaryan (KP) [Communist Party] in his speech turned attention to a bone of contention. He admitted that, formally, the draft, which was presented by the constitutional commission of the Supreme Soviet (the so-called presidential draft) meets the requirements of the standards. But the powers relegated to the president, nonetheless, are increased to such an extent that it will be necessary to rely on the personality, on the "specific executor." If he turns out to be a reasonable person, there will be no problems; otherwise, the specter of a dictatorship will assume a very real outline. As for the draft of the "six", then although it also proposes a "mixed" government, the importance of the president is so formal that one is at a loss as to why it should be kept in general, plus maintain a necessary and large staff? Comrade Mkhitaryan is confident: The "compromising" synthesis of the submitted variants is unreasonable, and they should all be submitted to the judgment of the people. In light of the recent political "shocks" outside the walls of the Supreme Soviet (the letter of the seven, which proposes a split in the AOD [Armenian Pan National Movement], the work of the commission on abuses in the upper echelons of authority, etc.), one could launch into an analysis of why the representative of the ruling party, contrary to the attitude of the president on not compromising, called for the opposite? However, although interesting this would deviate from the subject. Nevertheless, Ter-Iusik Lazaryan noted that it would be advisable to expand the constitutional commission by adding representatives of the parties, factions, authors of all five drafts, and once again to examine everything, and to synthesize everything and submit a final variant for a decision by the people. The speech of Shavarsha Kocharyan (NDU)--for both emotionality and, perhaps, for substance can be categorized as extreme. It is true that at the beginning he noted that even the variant of the "six" and also the presidential variant are democratic in form, and the question, nevertheless, is which one is preferable for us. As for the compromising "synthesized" variant, it can lead to instability. The history of Turkey and France are an example of this: According to the words of Mr. Kocharyan, except for perhaps the United States, there is no other model of a presidential government that would lead to positive results. Consequently, there is no doubt, in fact, that a definite struggle for power is concealed behind the debate on the form of authority. In making the concluding remarks, Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan said that the four-day debate convinced him of the correctness of the propositions expressed by him on the first day of the discussions. The president once again emphasized that he rules out compromise in ideology. The Communist Party cannot reject communism, the ARF [Armenian Revolutionary Federation] cannot reject the Ay Dat [constitution], and the AOD and the Liberal Democrats cannot reject the idea of private property. Levon Ter-Petrosyan said: "If you want to make a salad out of this version of the constitution, then we will perish. The claim that allegedly the people cannot accept the constitution is cheap demagogy. Collectively, the people are much more intelligent than everyone sitting here separately and taken together." In the opinion of the president, the only way to adopt the constitution is through a referendum. Today, the Supreme Soviet can also make a determination on this question, but if it does not cope with it, there are other legal avenues. The president can gather 200,000 votes in favor of supporting a referendum. However, L. Ter-Petrosyan called this an "extreme means." He will be satisfied if the four-day meeting leads to some definite result. One of the five variants should be approved as a basis. In the event that the variant of the constitutional commission is adopted, the president will agree to an expansion of its staff, as was proposed by a number of deputies. If there will be no approved variant, the constitutional commission will have to yield its powers, and the work will be continued by a new commission. In the opinion of the head of the state, the variant of the basic law developed by the constitutional commission can be improved--he personally has reservations about this draft. L. Ter-Petrosyan emphasized that out of the three proposals submitted by Deputy Yuriy Sarkisyan, a member of the commission, he accepts two--on the dissolution of parliament and on the appointment of the prime minister. The question on the appointment of the Supreme Court, which in this draft is appointed for life, can be reconsidered. The Armenian president emphasized that he has established the condition: After the adoption of the constitution, elections of the new Supreme Soviet and president will be scheduled. One way or another, if it is possible to put it this way, the strategy of the uncompromising compromise was victorious. According to the results of the voting, it was decided to expand the staff of the commission by adding political organizations that have representatives in the Supreme Soviet, but that are not represented on the constitutional commission. Simultaneously, the speaker--B. Ararktsyan--was elected its cochairman. A decision was also made to continue the work of the special session to 27 June. The arena of battles seems to have narrowed, but it is difficult to determine whether they will become less uncompromising even after the compromising nature of the adopted decision.
