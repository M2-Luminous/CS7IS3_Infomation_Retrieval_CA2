The lecture, to be held June 14-24 in Ho Chi Minh city and Hanoi, is designed to help Vietnam smoothly shift to a market economy under its "doi moi" reform policy. The economic reform has engendered a number of problems, such as a widening gap in the living standards between big cities and other areas and deteriorating health of state-run enterprises. The planned lecture will focus on ways to nurture and strengthen managerially weak small firms and breathe new life into economically backward local areas.
