But Europe is about to witness the end of the "Delors decade" -- a period which has already acquired legendary status within the Brussels institutions; a period which many factors suggest is coming to an end too soon, and which is referred to as some kind of "golden age" in the offices of Europe's capital. This era has come to an end mainly because today's Europe seems to reject the values of Jacques Delors. [Papitto] Mr. President, you are about to leave a Europe very different from the one you found 10 years ago. A swing to the right is occurring in almost every country, and a party that has always declared itself to be heir to fascism, at least until a few months ago, is joining the Italian Government. Is this a good thing or a bad thing for Europe? Could it set an example for other countries? [Delors] The president of the European Commission must be careful not to intervene in a Community member country's internal affairs. For my part, I will judge the Italian Government's action on the basis of what it does and without any mental reservations. As far as I am concerned, it is only deeds that count. [Papitto] Mr. President, Italy's affairs are also Europe's affairs. We could regard Italy as a portion of Europe. [Delors] There are two disturbing factors in Europe today. On the one hand, the vigor of our democracies is growing weaker. The Europeans are drawing in on themselves, in a crazy individualism that ignores the real situation, namely, that the future of each one of us depends partly on the future of the group to which we belong. And, on the other hand, there is the return of false prophets -- and not only in the East. Yugoslavia is the tragic expression of all this, with the monstrous ideology of ethnic cleansing. Furthermore, we are witnessing everywhere the advance of populism, the spread of an attitude of rejection of others, of those who are different by virtue of their religion, their ethnicity, or the color of their skin. Irrespective of individual elections, this is the real danger that threatens to poison our democracies. [Papitto] How should we respond to this? [Delors] It is more necessary than ever to return to the fundamental values that led to the formation of the European Community: respect for others, the awareness that in the world of today and tomorrow none of our countries -- even the strongest -- can defend its interests on its own and disseminate its own values. We are at a crucial moment in Europe's evolution, which is more vulnerable precisely because it is stronger. [Papitto] Mr. President, why is it stronger and more vulnerable? [Delors] A doctor too will tell you that a virus makes swifter progress in a strong and healthy body than in an aged body. As it progresses, Europe becomes more vulnerable because it becomes more and more part of everyone's life. Then citizens rightly begin to wonder about the nature of this Europe that is influencing their lives. Until Maastricht Europe was something to be taken for granted; not any more. And I do not say this with regret. In fact it is a good thing, because the citizens' involvement will be more aware. [Papitto] Are the Euroskeptics among the false prophets who are returning? [Delors] Until a few years ago, our cooperation developed within the context of the historical necessity of a Europe split in two. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall other problems have arisen, and we must not be surprised if there are hesitations with regard to their scale. The priority now is to heed the countries of the East in order to understand their demands, hopes, and expectations. I have visited them, and it seems to me that their main concern is security. Some of them have been received into the WEU [Western European Union] as associate members; and we are working on the stability pact proposed by France and taken up by the European Council. [Papitto] Meanwhile the European Union [EU] is extending to include four more countries -- Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden -- while another two, Poland and Hungary, have officially applied for membership. As of next year we will be 16, and later 20 or 24. How will such a huge EU function? [Delors] There are plans for a meeting in two years of an intergovernmental conference that will broach these very issues. It is obvious to everyone that a Europe of 20 or 24 members cannot function with the existing institutions. But permit me to say that this is a matter that the next Commission will broach, insofar as it is its responsibility to do so, and I will not be free to express myself as an ordinary citizen until next 1 January. I will do so, because my battle for Europe will continue. But I do not own any television channels or newspapers, nor do I lead any large political party. I will continue thinking about and working for Europe; whether I will be heeded, I do not know. [Papitto] Will these issues be broached at the coming European Council meeting in Corfu? [Delors] The Corfu meeting will mainly discuss the economy and how to improve cooperation within the context of the second phase of Economic and Monetary Union that we are building. It will also make up a balance of the first implementation phase of the Maastricht Treaty which created the EU. There will also be a discussion of the implementation of the White Paper on competitiveness, growth, and employment approved by the European Council in Brussels. Judging from what I was told by the Greek presidency, there will not be much discussion of Europe's future. [Papitto] What about unemployment? [Delors] This was the subject of the European Council in Brussels, which approved the White Paper whose implementation will be discussed in Corfu. Its analysis of the situation can be summed up in three points: 1. We are emerging from the most serious recession since the thirties; 2. we are doing so without any instances of overheating of the economy, partly because the great European market and the policy of competitiveness have proved to be important resources in combating inflation; 3. despite the recovery of growth, unemployment will remain large and Europe's chief problem. The White Paper already contains some ideas and proposals, but we must develop them, move forward. We cannot find solutions without considering such fundamental issues as the role of work in tomorrow's society, and the overall organization of society. At the European Council in Essen in December, the Commission will submit some new ideas for considerably reducing unemployment. We are already working on this, and it will be my "vacation homework." [Papitto] With "Europe's chief problem" so highly developed, is it really possible to build Economic and Monetary Union? [Delors] Our countries could resign themselves and exclude 7-8 percent of the population; or they will realize that societies with strong exclusions are generally socially and politically unstable. If the latter happens, the evil of unemployment will be tackled vigorously. The voters will say: A single currency is all very well, but what do you propose in order to build a more homogeneous society that displays more solidarity? This will be the main subject of political debate before the end of the century. [Papitto] What do you think you could say to the voters in this election campaign, when almost everywhere national issues are stifling European issues? [Delors] This campaign takes place every five years and is a valuable opportunity to take stock after the very busy years that Europe has experienced. It is necessary to vote, not to yield to the temptation to abstain, because through their votes citizens express their interest in their own collective future. Basically the choice is simple: There are those who want a political Europe -- in which the member countries will agree to exercise their sovereignty together whenever their interests are shared, and which for this purpose provides itself with the necessary capacity for decisionmaking and action -- and there are those who advocate a soulless and spineless trading area. [Papitto] What is the European Parliament's role? [Delors] It has been crucial in boosting our cooperation. My efforts to gain approval of the Single Act -- the first reform of the Community -- would have been in vain without the support of what was called the "Spinelli report." The Parliament that I have known, during my 10 years as president of the Commission, has played its part in strengthening European building. The next one will have a more important role because it will have greater powers, granted to us by the Maastricht Treaty, and because in 1996 there will be the institutional reform that will decide on Europe's future. [Papitto] What is your greatest regret, looking back over these years? [Delors] Not to have been heeded when I said that Germany's unification would place a heavy recessionary burden on everyone. I did not stress this sufficiently, because I risked appearing like the Frenchman hindering unification, whereas I was the first to support it. [Papitto] What is your overall assessment of the "Delors decade?" [Delors] I think I am leaving a more compact European Community, with almost irreversible bases. But in the meantime the world has changed, and new challenges have therefore emerged. They must be taken up. Even as a youngster, I did not believe that a man could become God or Prometheus. I know that often the obstacle lies at the end of the road, that failure always lies in wait, and that it is necessary to start over without a break. But this is mankind's adventure.
