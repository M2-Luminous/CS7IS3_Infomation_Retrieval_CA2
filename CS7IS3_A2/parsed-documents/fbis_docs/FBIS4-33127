There is uneasiness because these elections are preventing the Coalition from giving more effective support to President Eduardo Frei and his government. The situation was different under former President Patricio Aylwin, who received ongoing support from the alliance, especially from his own party, the DC. More specifically, however, the internal struggle for the presidency of Christian Democracy, a struggle that has sharpened, has been compounded in recent days by the battle in the PPD, which is beset by a serious problem of internal leadership. Much sharp criticism is being leveled at the leadership, including the long-time leaders of the party. The most widespread complaint in the PPD is that the congressional election and the appointment of the cabinet has been followed by paralysis in the party, which has done nothing about it. The charges are being leveled directly at its current president, Sergio Bitar. Although he is acknowledged as the party's undisputed leader, the objection is that after he was elected senator from the First Region, he has been unable to devote the time to the party leadership that it requires. Concern in the PPD is even greater because despite the results of the congressional elections (in which it doubled its representation to 15 deputies and two senators), the party's profile is becoming blurred today. The situation facing this group is marked not only by the departure of Bitar but also by the unmistakable absence of Victor Manuel Rebolledo and Jorge Schaulsohn. Now that the former has joined the cabinet and the latter has taken over as president of the Chamber, the PPD has been left even more leaderless. Although the efforts that Vice Presidents Jorge Molina and Erich Schnake are making are appreciated, a large majority agrees that the leadership crisis that has developed makes the election of new officers urgent. But the elections are, in principle, scheduled for September, a fact that upsets those who want to hasten internal decision-making so that the vigorous PPD does not yield the entire progressive sector of the Coalition to the Socialist Party, which they acknowledge has done a good job of keeping a high profile. For the time being, only Deputy Victor Barrueto and electoral expert Jose Auth have entered the race for party posts, running for president and secretary general, respectively. No others have yet joined the race, as they are waiting for the current president, Sergio Bitar, to decide whether or not to run again. While they are waiting patiently for this PPD leader to make up his mind, the rumor is that he will not run for reelection because his goal is to make his name as a national senator by devoting all of his time and effort to voters in the strategic First Region, which he has done ever since he was elected. Should Bitar run again, though, he would face competition for the first time. This development would in itself be a change, inasmuch as one of the main criticisms of this party is that its leaders have always been chosen by the top echelon without an election in which the rank and file could select the people they wanted to lead them. In the event that Bitar runs for reelection, he would probably face off against Deputy Victor Barrueto, who has the support of former Vice President Victor Manuel Rebolledo; as long as he remains a minister, however, he says that he will stay out of his party's internal elections. While Bitar thinks things over, PPD spokesmen are not ruling out the possibility that the party's former secretary general, Deputy Jorge Schaulsohn, might decide to seek its presidency. In fact, he himself has said that he has not yet made up his mind in this regard. Many have their doubts, however, because this legislator is determined to be the finest president of the Chamber of Deputies in recent times. The leadership crisis in the PPD has created strife among its various factions, and because of the existing problems no one yet knows which candidates will ultimately face off against each other to head up the party. The new officers that party members elect, whoever they may be, will have to solve some serious problems facing the PPD, because paradoxically its growth has severely weakened its internal organization at the national level. One of the most visible difficulties stemming from its lack of organization is that very few of its offices are operating in communities and regions, just eight of the existing 12. The PPD has major operational problems in Valparaiso, and it is thought to have idle assets in the second, third, sixth, and other regions. Therefore, the challenge facing the new officers is to institutionalize the party and renew and expand its roster of leaders. A broad cross-section of the party agrees that collective leaderships need to be established since until now it has been a party of well known figures, which was initially a source of strength and representation. It wants to take advantage of this asset during the current process of change and renewal. Although the work done during the initial stage by well-known figures such as Sergio Bitar, Jorge Schaulsohn, Victor Manuel Rebolledo, Erich Schnake, and Ricardo Lagos is acknowledged, the regions and the metropolitan area are pressing for a renewal so that there is competition in the internal elections to end the "reign of celebrities." As with its ally the DC, the pace of meetings and talks within the party is picking up. On Saturday 23 April, the economy minister, Alvaro Garcia, called a meeting to test the internal electoral environment. It was attended by, among others, Eugenio Tironi, Guillermo del Valle, Maria Antonieta Saa, and Erich Schnake. Reportedly, some did not know what it was about, while others thought that Sergio Bitar was going to announce his candidacy. Instead, Bitar showed up to clarify that as president of the PPD he could not belong to an internal faction. It was noteworthy and annoying to some in the party that several people attending the meeting described themselves as leftists, not progressives as the party calls them. A senior spokesman for the PPD remarked that it was a serious mistake for the group to describe itself as leftist; it did so because of a desire to distance itself from other, more moderate factions, such as Jorge Schaulsohn's. Spokesmen for another faction were also surprised by the greeting that Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos sent to the meeting; some leaders, however, commented that it was significant that the leader of the Socialist Party and the PPD did not attend the meeting and merely sent his greetings. In any event, the involvement of the two Frei cabinet ministers in party politics elicited serious objections from leaders and members. "Lagos ought to remain above factional strife because he is a national figure in the coalition left," said a high-level party leader. After Lagos sent his letter of greetings to the faction, the feeling in the PPD was that he has to clarify his party membership inasmuch as his dual status (Socialist and PPD member) is untenable. The uneasiness over Lagos's and Garcia's involvement presumably prompted a group of deputies to look into the possibility of sending a letter to the government saying that it is improper for cabinet ministers to create factions in coalition parties and be actively involved in the internal struggle instead of devoting all of their time to their ministries. The internal contest for the presidency seems more personal than anything else. It does involve some substantive issues, however, as there have been mutual accusations about neoliberal influence in the party. Such influence has been roundly denied, although the culture of classical liberalism is acknowledged to be broadly represented. The progressive philosophy is predominant in the PPD, however, as it seeks to distance itself from the Socialist Party, especially after the selection of mayors, governors, and Regional Ministry Secretariats, in which the Socialists were winners. Although the election of its officers is still months away, the debate and struggle has already begun in the party, and the pace will pick up once the current president, Senator Sergio Bitar, makes up his mind about what to do.
