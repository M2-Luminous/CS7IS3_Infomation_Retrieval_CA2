After the meeting Konstantin Trenchev told reporters about this position. The meeting was requested by Ahmed Dogan. Probably at its next Federative Council Podkrepa will review its relations with the DPS, because it appears that the movement is cooperating with the Communists in its decision to support the cabinet, Dr. Trenchev said.
