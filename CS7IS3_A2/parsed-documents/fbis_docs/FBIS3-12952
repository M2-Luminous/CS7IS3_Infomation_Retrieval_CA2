He charged that, for the last 45 years, the group has failed to develop from the domination of individuals, differing from one leader to another, to collective institutional action based on established plans, bylaws, and restrictions that are not influenced by changes in posts or the officials in charge. Abu-Ghanimah criticized the Muslim Brotherhood leadership, of which he used to be a member, because of their recent decision to exclude him from the organization and because of their refusal to hold a frank dialogue with him in order to serve the march of the group itself. In a lecture at the Shuman Foundation entitled "Views and Experience in the Islamic Movement," he said: I had hoped that the brotherhood leaders would consider me the devil himself and come to hold talks with me, especially since they know that even Almighty God talked to the condemned Satan. How can they refrain from having a dialogue with someone who was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood before some of them were even born? He said: I still invite them for an open dialogue anywhere and at any time they decide in order that the whirlpool of secret instructions and statements that, in most cases, lack truth and objectivity will end. Following this, Abu-Ghanimah began to review his experience in the Muslim Brotherhood since late 1940's, when Jordan was -- like all eastern Arab states -- full of nationalist feelings against colonialism and Zionist ambitions and when parties drew the masses into these parties by transferring their nationalist feelings. He said he first joined the Arab Muslim Youths Party, which combined the principles of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Ba'th Party. That experience did not last for long, and he then joined the Muslim Brotherhood due to his religious leanings and his admiration for the convoys of Muslim Brotherhood mujahidin who were participating in jihad against Jews in Palestine. Abu-Ghanimah noted that, after more than 45 years of experience, he feels that he is dutybound and that it is in the interest of the Islamic movement, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood, to make this review, through which he will present the fruit of his personal experience within the group. He stressed that, before this review, we should be aware of the following: - We, as Muslims, have no doubt that the great Islam and its commendable teachings are infallible and everything else is fallible. In other words, no Muslim or Islamic movement -- leaders or members -- can claim they are infallible. - Consequently, the Muslims -- movements and individuals -- may be right or may be wrong. Therefore, there is no harm if an Islamic movement admits its mistakes when it is wrong. This will raise its position among the masses and reinforce their confidence in it. However, the leadership who lacks confidence in its cadres and masses is the one that fears to reveal its mistakes. - Addressing the negative points of, or the mistakes committed by, the Islamic Movement -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- does not at all imply vengeance or slander, as some claim. It is not aimed at inciting its enemies against it. Addressing the negative points is geared primarily toward the interest of the group and does not go beyond the self-criticism known in Islam during the era of Prophet Muhammad and his companions. Abu-Ghanimah noted that it is fair to acknowledge that his experiences within the Muslim Brotherhood contain a great many positive points as well, thanks to God first; to his adherence to the teachings of Islam; to teaching thousands of youths, men, and women on the path of Islam; to reviving the call for Islam at the beginning of the century; and to enlightening the Muslims on their decisive issues. Abu-Ghanimah then touched on the negative points he registered throughout his time as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. We should be brave and admit that the Brotherhood's experience in Jordan has not been perfect and we should admit the mistakes. We should not hide behind the argument that every movement keeps secrets to conceal its negative aspects and mistakes. These negative aspects, which I recorded though my experience with the Muslim Brotherhood, can be summed up in the following points: - One of the most complicated problems facing the Muslim Brotherhood is the fact that it lacks an authoritative reference to record the history of the group from the time it was founded in 1944 until now. - The group lacks a system to assess its march in the various phases. Throughout the 45 years of its life, not a single study to appraise its progress has been conducted for any of the phases through which the group in Jordan had passed. This is a major shortcoming because an appraisal every now and then will reveal the positive and negative aspects and serve the group's march. - Members of the group will not accept any criticism of them or their group, whether that criticism comes from a friend or a foe, to the extent that they consider any criticism against their group to be directed against Islam itself. - The group deals with other people working in the field of Islamic action in a patronizing and arrogant manner. It wants them to be subordinates and not comrades in the march to serve Islam. This negative aspect, which the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan is still facing, explains the gap between the group and their Muslim brothers in other groups. - Throughout the 45 years of its life, the group has failed to institutionalize its action. This means it failed to transform group actions from an individualistic basis, which may differ from one leadership to another, into institutionalized actions that are based on mission-oriented institutions that do not change with the change in leadership positions or the persons responsible for the Brotherhood's work. All attempts to change the Brotherhood's work from individual efforts into institutionalized ones have failed. - Despite the importance of the media in the missionary, intellectual, political, and social work of the group, the Muslim Brotherhood failed to follow a clear media policy with a practical mechanism that depends on an institutional media organ to cover the requirements of the group in the media field. - In addition to the weak performance of the Muslim Brotherhood in the field of education and the increasing daring in slandering one another, the phenomenon of loyalty to individuals, rather than to the Islamic call or to the group, has prevailed. It is important to note as well the group's tendency to make decisions that please the decisionmakers. Many decisions made by the group leadership proceeded from personal whims and were not in the interest of the group. Abu-Ghanimah concluded his lecture by saying that his frankness will anger some and please others, noting that he will not be swayed by angry responses since he believes that he is telling the truth. He said: I advise the small clique in the leadership, who will not appreciated my words, to react to what I said by thinking long and hard about these negative aspects, to study them, to discuss their causes, and to rectify them. If they fail to correct matters they should leave their jobs before the problems increase and the situation worsens. At the end of the lecture, Dr. As'ad 'Abd-al-Rahman, moderator of the symposium, opened a dialogue between the lecturer and the audience. Abu-Ghanimah said the negative points he mentioned are the ones that he can address publicly, adding that the members of the group themselves are talking about many other things. This frank talk will not please many members of the group. He added that there are many things that must be kept within the group. Asked if this public criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood will develop the performance of the group and help it continue its march, Abu-Ghanimah said: This should render the group a great service of which it has been in need for the last 45 years.
