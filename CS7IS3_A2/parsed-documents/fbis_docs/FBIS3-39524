These threats relate mainly to the financial situation of the country, which they warn will be hurt by certain moves that their countries will make. According to our information, beyond the threat for gradual recognition of the pseudostate in the occupied areas which--as they say--will not be prevented, they also talk about the withdrawal of UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus]. They stress that such a development would cause a climate of insecurity in Cyprus, which could easily hurt the country's main financial source, tourism! Let us recall that clear reference to UNFICYP's withdrawal was repeatedly made by the UN secretary general in his reports. Officials from our side who talked with foreign diplomats confirm that especially the United States and Britain indicate everytime their determination to impose the confidence-building measures. And this is the meaning of their indirect but clear threats.
