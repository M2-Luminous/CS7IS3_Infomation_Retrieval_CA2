This general agreement provides a framework for extending U.S. aid to the whole world, including Croatia, Galbraith said. He added that bilateral relations between the United States and Croatia will develop on the basis of genuine partnership and consultation. This agreement will place U.S. know-how and experience at the disposal of Croatian public and nongovernmental organizations, Galbraith said. [passage omitted]
