Basically, the construction of a diesel engine factory, together with the First Automotive Corporation, in Changchun in northern China is involved. The construction of buses is also under discussion. In southern China, Mercedes-Benz wants to build large limousines in two production facilities. The concern is competing with the U.S. Chrysler Corporation here. This was announced in an interview for HANDELSBLATT by Eberhard Herzog, former member and adviser of the Mercedes-Benz board of directors. Herzog accompanied Baden-Wuerttemberg Minister President Erwin Teufel on his tour of China. The diesel engine factory is to produce four- and six-cylinder engines of medium weight. A Japanese company (Hino) is also competing for this project. The construction of at least 100,000 diesel engines for trucks and busses is under consideration. The engine represents an ultramodern new development. It is also to be installed in Mercedes commercial vehicles in Germany and worldwide. The project involves over 500 million German marks. At two production facilities in Guangdong Province in southern China and in Hainan Island (a special economic province), a large limousine is to be produced together with the Nanfang Corporation. The Chrysler Corporation is likely to receive the order if U.S. President Clinton in June should extend China's most-favored-nation status by another year. Clinton and Chancellor Kohl have asked the Chinese leadership to place orders with the companies of their countries. As a result of regional vanities, however, production is to be split between two sites, which will not make the manufacture easier. Negotiations with the Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corporation on the construction of Mercedes-Benz luxury busses on the basis of the mechanical assembly technique with low Chinese participation in the manufacture at the beginning are also under way. The production of 1,000 luxury busses is planned. Two more bus producers are negotiating the development of a simpler long-distance intercity bus with Mercedes-Benz. Numerous state-owned concerns from other towns and provinces that specialize in the construction of commercial vehicles and cars are offering the Stuttgart company their cooperation. One such concern is the delivery truck factory in Shenyang in northern China where production takes place in old Toyota manufacturing plants. The governor of the province has submitted cooperation proposals to Mercedes-Benz. Through cooperation with the provinces, Japanese auto producers have practically avoided the State Council and are in this way trying to obtain production facilities in China. In northern China, Mercedes-Benz is producing commercial vehicles together with a company that belongs to the Defense Ministry. According to Herzog, Mercedes-Benz will be forced to concentrate on a few major projects in China. The production of passenger cars is not under consideration. Currently, the Machine-Building Ministry does not grant any permits for such projects, with the exception of the Nanfang project.
