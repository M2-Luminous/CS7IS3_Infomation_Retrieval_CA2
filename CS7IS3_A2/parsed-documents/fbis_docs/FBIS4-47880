Unveiling its agricultural policy at a Johannesburg press briefing on Wednesday [4 May], the ANC said the legislation should be considered in the first sitting of Parliament because of the urgency and emotions attached to land claims. The proposed land rights restitution act is intended to deal with claims arising from the dispossession of landowners caused by, among other things, forced removals. The proposed act will require claims to be lodged within three years of the establishment of a Government of National Unity. The ANC proposes claims be lodged with a land claims commission, which will investigate them and try to negotiate and mediate settlements. Settlements agreed to will be subject to scrutiny by the commission to determine their fairness. A land claims court will be asked to ratify any settlements reached and also to judge disputed or complex cases. Some landowners in the Eastern Transvaal were already negotiating settlements with dispossessed communities and labourer tenants, the ANC said. It said the proposed act would promote the reasonable and constructive settlement of claims by all the parties involved, in the hope of discouraging landowners from thwarting claims by evicting claimants and selling the land. In the event of pre-emptive action by landowners the dispute would be referred to the land claims court, it said. As for people who had claims based on their exclusion from land rights, they would be subject to a policy of land redistribution backed by a financing mechanism.
