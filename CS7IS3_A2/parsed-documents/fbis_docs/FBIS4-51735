A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: Very ill-boding is the situation today when the Japanese reactionaries are intensifying crackdown on and persecution of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. Koreans in Japan are those who were forcibly taken to Japan by the Japanese imperialists during their colonial rule, and their descendents, and Chongnyon is a patriotic and democratic organization of citizens overseas of the DPRK. It is a legal and moral obligation of the Japanese authorities to guarantee legitimate activities of Chongnyon and the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan. Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities forcibly searched Chongnyon organizations by invoking government power on charges of "forcible obstruction of business" which had nothing to do with Chongnyon and goaded a rightwing gangsters' group on to undisguised suppression and provocations against Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. This is an unjustifiable, rude behavior. We who regard the dignity of our country and nation as our life and soul will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon and its affiliated organizations and Koreans in Japan an encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and decisively counter it. The Japanese authorities should ponder over unpredictable grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless behavior and immediately renounce their policy hostile to the DPRK and anti-Chongnyon moves.
