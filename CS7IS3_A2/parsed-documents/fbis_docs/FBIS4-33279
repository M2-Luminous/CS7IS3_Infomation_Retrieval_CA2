He said his organization hopes to increase its aid to the Caribbean island. The foundation began through a French initiative to send an oil tanker to Cuba, and its purpose is to discuss the situation on the island, especially the U.S. blockade, but not internal issues which, Barkeviser said is a Cuban problem. Barkeviser said his foundation is trying to increase European cooperation with Cuba. Over the past two years, the foundation has sent approximately 30 tons of potato seeds and powdered milk to Cuba and plans to help increase the 10,000 Netherlanders who visit Cuba every year.
