The Indian Government will dispatch seven cultural delegations to China at that time, and Indian performances, exhibitions and a movie festival will be hosted by these cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and Guangzhou. This is the first time for China to sponsor such a large-scale foreign culture festival since the founding of the country in 1949, Vice-Minister of Culture Liu Deyou told a press conference here today. The premiers of the two countries decided to exchange culture festivals when Chinese Premier Li Peng visited India in 1991, Liu said, adding that the decision was contained in the Sino-Indian joint communique issued at that time. A 45-day Chinese culture festival was successfully held in 11 Indian cities in late 1992, Liu said. "The culture festivals will help to improve the bilateral good- neighborly ties, and provide the two sides with opportunities to learn from each other," Liu said.
