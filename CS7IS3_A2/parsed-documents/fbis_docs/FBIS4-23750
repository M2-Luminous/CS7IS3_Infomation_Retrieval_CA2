Speaking in Switzerland, Dr. Stals said the new government would find it difficult to reduce expenditure while seeking to deal with poverty and helping low-income groups. Excessive government debt would also exert upward pressure on long-term interest rates. Dr. Stals disclosed, however, that the outflow of short-term capital in the run-up to the elections has reversed itself. Since the elections the Reserve Bank had become a net buyer of American dollars.
