It's the continuing fighting between Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the Liberia Peace Council [LPC] in the east of the country. Much of the fighting had been around the River Cess in the Grand Bassa County, but now it seems like the battle is concentrated further north towards the Cote d'Ivoire border, around the town of Zwedru, with thousands of refugees fleeing the clashes towards the town of Tapeta. From Monrovia, our correspondent, Nii Nartey Allison, sent this telex: More than 2,000 refugees have so far arrived in Tapeta. And, according to United Nations officials, they are fleeing fighting between the NPFL and the Peace Council in Zwedru. Zwedru has twice changed hands and it is not yet clear which group is in control of the town. Fierce fighting is said to be continuing around the border village of To and the United Nations Observer Mission today declared the region a no-go zone. According to United Nations officials, atrocities in southeastern Liberia by both the LPC and the NPFL have extended into Zwedru, and hundreds of residents have fled into the surrounding forests. The UN said that local officials in Tapeta were physically preventing some of the escapees from entering the town. Some 300 people are on the move, trying to escape fighting, said a senior UN official, but they are being prevented by local authorities from entering Tapeta because of congestion. Journalists, who attempted at the weekend to go into the area, were stopped in Gbarnga by the NPFL. The United Nations said that there is a dire need to move in with food, medicines, temporary accommodation. They said that 500 malnourished children aged between one to 12 are in desperate need of food, medicines, and clothing. The United Nations said that panic-stricken Zwedru residents arrived in Tapeta and the village of Diala, 10 miles southeast of Tapeta, with bullet wounds. The French charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres, the only aid agency operating in the area, moved in last week with measles vaccine from mobile clinics. Meanwhile, the United Nations today said that a fresh influx of 700 displaced people arrived in the port city of Buchanan on Saturday [2 April], fleeing continued skirmishes between the NPFL and the LPC in River Cess County.
