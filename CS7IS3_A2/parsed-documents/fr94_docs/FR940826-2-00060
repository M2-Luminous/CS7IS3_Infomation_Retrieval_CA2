ACTION: Notice of prefiling notification and request for comments. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 49 CFR 1180.4(b), applicants have notified the Commission of their intent to file an application seeking approval for Illinois Central Corporation's (IC) acquisition of control of and merger with Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., and the resulting common control of Illinois Central Railroad Company and The Kansas City Southern Railway Company by IC. The Commission finds this to be a major transaction as defined in 49 CFR part 1180. Applicants have proposed an accelerated procedural schedule, and the Commission invites interested persons to comment on it. DATES: Written comments must be filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission no later than September 12, 1994. Applicants' reply is due by September 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: An original and 20 copies of all documents must refer to Finance Docket No. 32556 and be sent to: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Attn: Finance Docket No. 32556, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph Dettmar, (202) 927&hyph;5660. [TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] In addition, one copy of all documents in this proceeding must be sent to applicants' representative: Robert P. vom Eigen, Hopkins & Sutter, 888 Sixteenth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20006. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 29, 1994, Illinois Central Corporation (IC), Illinois Central Railroad Company (ICRR), Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. (KCSI), and The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCSR) (collectively applicants) filed a notice of intent indicating that IC will file an application seeking Commission approval and authorization under 49 U.S.C. 11343&hyph;47 for: (1) IC's acquisition of control of and merger with KCSI; and (2) the resulting common control of ICRR and KCSR by IC. In this transaction, IC will acquire 100% of the stock of KCSI. The acquisition will occur as part of a transaction in which (1) KCSI will effect a reorganization in which it distributes complete ownership of its financial services and information processing operations to the holders of KCSI's common stock; and (2) IC will place its stock in ICRR into an independent voting trust. 1 Applicants state that, while awaiting approval of the transaction by the Commission, ICRR and KCSR will be operated independently. The parties anticipate that the independent voting trust will terminate upon approval of the transaction by this Commission. 1Â§On August 16, 1994, IC requested, under 49 CFR 1013.3(a), an informal opinion from the Secretary of the Commission that the proposed voting trust arrangement will insulate IC from any violation of the Interstate Commerce Act pending approval of the application. Applicants state that, after the reorganization has occurred, IC and KCSI intend to consummate the merger in which KCSI will be merged with IC and the separate existence of KCSI will cease. Applicants will use the year July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994, for purposes of the impact analyses to be filed in their application. Applicants anticipate filing their application on or about November 1, 1994. The Commission finds that this is a major transaction, as defined at 49 CFR 1180.2(a), as it is a control transaction involving two or more class I railroads. The application must conform to the regulations set forth at 49 CFR part 1180 and must contain all information required there for major transactions, except as modified by any advance waiver. Applicants are also required to submit maps with overlays that show the existing routes of both carriers and their competitors.
