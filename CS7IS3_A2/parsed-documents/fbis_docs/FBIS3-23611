And at times the attention to this possessor of the "naval spirit" is somewhat greater than to those whose knitted shirts were later saturated with salt but did not lose their natural color. The "winged" infantry, by way of illustration, is always being heard from: Airborne troops "are mandatorily dropped" for honored guests and journalists at demonstration field training exercises and UN blue helmets are issued only in "exchange" for blue berets, yes and simply at a difficult moment, the first appeal is -- to the Airborne Troops. While not detracting from the Airborne Troops' accomplishments and only for the sake of fairness, I must point out that the naval infantry surpasses the "winged" infantry, both in age of service to the Fatherland and based upon the intransigence of traditions and, finally, based upon the number and variety of missions being carried out. The 289th year of service with small breaks, from the time of Peter the Great's Edict on the formation of the first naval infantry brigade -- that is a great deal of time! All the more so that in its official history alone, the Russian naval infantry is seven decades older than the famous American Marines. And we don't intend to award only the age laurels. A similar "imperceptibility" of the "black devils", as they still quite recently called naval infantrymen, probably lies in a different structure of subordination than the American structure and in the variability of the names. After a number of organic changes, the Naval Infantry became a part of the Navy's Coastal Troops which are led by Lieutenant-General Ivan Sidorovich Skuratov, incidentally, as far as I know the only doctor of military sciences among servicemen of his rank. "We don't need to make the country poor with the ideal variant of Armed Forces organizational development," Ivan Sidorovich thinks out loud on the problems of reforming the army and navy and the troops entrusted to him. -- "We need the optimal variant." The Coastal Troops can also serve precisely as a model for that optimal variant. The three components of the Coastal Troops -- the coastal missile -artillery troops, the coastal defense troops and the naval infantry -- naturally do not cover all of Russia's sea coasts like a fence. However, due to maneuverability and the capability to concentrate on a threatened axis in a very short period of time, including through reinforcements from another naval theater, the Coastal Troops accomplish the missions of combating surface combatants and assault landing detachments in the nearby maritime zone, defending naval bases and other important facilities on the coast, and landing amphibious and air assault forces. In the latter case, the Russian Naval Infantry has a great deal of experience from the period of the last war (3 amphibious assault operations and more than 100 amphibious assault landings) and the experience of prolonged performance of combat duty in remote areas -- the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and off the Western coast of Africa. And a Black Sea Fleet reinforced naval infantry battalion has acquired the experience of peacekeeping forces operations -- in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict area. In general, in the context of combat accomplishments, coastal defense divisions and naval infantry brigades on the scale of the Russian Federation Armed Forces are hardly unique. As, for example, the Northern Fleet Red Banner Moskovsko-Chernigov Guards Division, in which at one time were a battalion of cavaliers of Soldiers' Glory and a company of Heroes. Today, reforms are occurring in the Coastal Troops, just like in the other services and types of troops. Troops are being reduced numerically, some portions of them are completing their infrastructure in new locations after their withdrawal from the near abroad -- Lithuania, Latvia, Georgia, and Turkmenistan. We need to create a training facility all over again and, first of all, for training the Coastal Troops officer corps. The fact is that, with the current outward commonality of specialties in the Coastal Troops, there is a multitude of distinctions and nuances that, if they are not taken into account, a BRAV [Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops] or MP [Naval Infantry] officer can be a good missileer, tank officer, and even an airborne troop but... he cannot in the process be a representative of the Coastal Troops. They have taught this specific feature or spark, if we can say it that way, at the special departments of schools that have now turned out to be outside Russia's borders (in Odessa, Sumy, and Sevastopol). "Experience has shown," Lieutenant-General I. Skuratov told me, "that even the best graduates of `ground forces' military schools were lost for a minimum of two years as commanders and specialists in our units due to the lack of knowledge of our specific features, the navy and, finally, the terms that are customary for us." The American experience, to which we have become accustomed to citing on any grounds in recent years, also convinces us of that. There, across the ocean, they have long understood that each person who has arrived to serve in the marines must have first of all the spirit of a marine. This spirit is nurtured and is sometimes "driven into" a young warrior with something resembling our course. You were not broken, you did not succumb to weakness at the first obstacle -- therefore you will be a marine, is the advertisement of the advantages of service which in the United States is no less aggressive than the advertising for chewing gum or Camel cigarettes. And only later do they train the "prepared" marine as a specialist, be he a reconnaissance platoon commander or a regimental cook. The Russian Naval Infantry and other Coastal Troops units were always strong in a similar kind of elitism. This specific feature is being lost when vacant positions are filled with random people from disbanded units and that's too bad. It is due to that loss of "elite" qualities in a Pacific Ocean Fleet Naval Infantry division subunit that recently practically all of the officers had to be replaced. Last year, the problem of cadres for the Coastal Troops, which extended to the statewide level, finally found its solution. St. Petersburg Combined Arms and Kolomna Artillery schools were added to the two schools that remained in Russia that trained officers for the Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops and Naval Infantry -- Blagoveshchensk Tank and Far East Combined Arms Schools. This year, a coastal department will open at Pacific Ocean Higher Naval School imeni S.O. Makarov, although the first enrollment, only two classes for the time being, had already been conducted in 1993. And what an enrollment! The competition -- 7-8 people for each place! The batteries at Kolomna Artillery School, where the first but unofficial enrollment was carried out already in 1992, were recruited with no less competition. Aren't these the prospects for the creation of really elite units? It's no accident that when, in the context of military reform, the conversation turns to the creation of mobile forces in Russia, the naval infantry and Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops units were first among the candidates for their foundation. The Coastal Troops will live up to the confidence that has been placed in it if the question on mobile forces is brought to its logical conclusion. But what we in the Coastal Troops disagree with is the resubordination -- the "closing" of individual units only to the command authorities of the mobile forces. And here once again everything depends on the specific nature of the Coastal Troops: The training system will change with a change of the structure of subordination. Therefore, a naval infantryman will become an ordinary motorized rifleman or airborne troop after 2-3 years of service in the mobile forces, maybe a high-class one but, not a naval infantryman. And they essentially conceived the mobile troops to be made up of units that are capable of accomplishing those specific missions which the Coastal Troops, and only them, are capable of handling. To drive a tank or a BMP [armored infantry vehicle], by way of illustration, along rugged terrain is one thing. But it is altogether something else to negotiate a strip of surf and to seize a beachhead on a sea coast in that same vehicle. They do not in the least oversimplify such missions in the Coastal Troops. On the contrary, for example, they can be deployed only in Kaliningard Oblast on the Baltic but a threatened axis can emerge there where no Russian units are left on the Baltic seashore. In this matter, "Bereg", the latest self-propelled artillery system which KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already discussed under the "Arsenal" rubric, could become the support for coastal missile-artillery units. But with the economy's current disastrous situation, years could pass until its acceptance into the inventory. That is why the Coastal Troops commander-in-chief frequently reminds his subordinates of late: There's no point in hoping and the center will give everything in a saucer with a blue border. Old equipment will also serve in the hands of masters of their profession. Hence Ivan Sidorovich's ideas on the optimal, but not ideal, variant of troop reform. Yes, it is difficult for unit commanders to accomplish the entire complex of missions facing them under conditions of the shortage of personnel and the infrastructure at the new location along with maintaining the prescribed combat readiness. But no one else will do that for them. Therefore, people are not taught to complain about everyday difficulties in the Coastal Troops (maybe, that is why they write so little about them?). If they say anything about them, it is in jest but they seriously talk about the absence of a holiday. There is a tank crewmen's day. There is also a border troops day -- but there is no naval infantry day in Russia. Unofficially, the Coastal Troops celebrate their professional holiday on 16 November. Peter the Great issued his edict on the formation of the naval infantry on that day in 1705. According to the big picture, the Coastal Troops need not a only holiday and the national recognition and respect which they quite deservedly enjoyed. Publicity in the good sense of the word is needed to attract people for active duty service on contract. We need centers like those in the Airborne Troops to train those same contract personnel, sergeants and warrant officers. During the course of reform, we need to renew the arsenal, especially of the Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops. And we also need incentives in the service. In the Coastal Troops, these words are understood to be not so much money and certificates of award as... real work. This especially concerns the naval infantry which previously regularly performed combat service on ships at sea and currently can get dirty in housekeeping duties. It is one thing to train for the sake of training, it is quite another thing to breathe in a chest full of salty sea air on an actual cruise, even if it is a peacekeeping or humanitarian cruise. That's how it was at the very beginning of the revival of the Navy's naval infantry during the postwar period. For example, at that time, in 1976, it was our naval infantry that was the first to come to the aid of the starving population of the Island of Sokotra. And the naval amphibious landing troops had quite a few similar operations, right up to last year's landing under a smokescreen at Poti. And if there is a need -- the Coastal Troops will be the first to meet a threat to the Fatherland. Incidentally, not only with the current incomplete contingent but also with that reserve that underwent training here, in the navy. And that won't be a problem for the heroic large units -- if the Fatherland just doesn't forget its defenders in peacetime.
