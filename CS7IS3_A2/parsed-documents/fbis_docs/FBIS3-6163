Mr Rummelhardt said after meeting Commerce Deputy Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap his government's decision did not set any new conditions on seafood imports. "The decision was based on the restrictions to which both seafood imports and exports are subject. We must first secure guarantees on these restrictions and the condition to get a guarantee from Thailand must be observed," he said. Thai fishery imports to the French market were banned as of February 9 due to uncertainties over a competent inspection authority. Mr Chaiyot said the confusion resulted from the fact that Thailand has several agencies involved in the inspection process. He said the foremost inspection authority for Thailand was the Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative Ministry's Fisheries Department. The Deputy Minister expressed reservations concerning Paris's decision, citing the perception of a selective practice toward Thailand because Bangkok had submitted the required documents indicating the Fisheries Department was the foremost authority concerned with export inspection. It appears Thai exports have been singled out by French authorities, he said. Foreign Trade Department Director General Oranut Osathanan said the French had allowed seven countries to import fishery products after the February 9 decision. They are the United States, Morocco, El Salvador, Brazil, Colombia, Senegal and the Ivory Coast. Ms Oranut said Thailand had submitted a memorandum similar to the Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry letter with trade information for the French ambassador on Wednesday for forwarding to his government informing them of the Thai position. The French ambassador assured Mr Chaiyot he would inform his government as soon as possible of the problems facing Thailand to salvage the relationship between the two countries. The Thai Government will await the decision of the French before taking any measures. "Future action may take place in a very short period," said Mr Chaiyot when asked for a deadline on future measures, declining to elaborate. Mr Rummelhardt acknowledged that French fishermen and the fishing industry was experiencing economic hardship and had pressed the government for help, yet he denied the request was a factor in his government's decision to ban Thai imports.
