And these days, when facing his hardest hour as a national leader, he needs support. Overnight, his fortune changed dramatically. Only a year ago, he was considered by many the right man, in the right place, at the right time, and now he is slowly becoming the national doormat. He is being attacked by politicians on the right and left for conflicting traits: He is too fast, he is too slow, he is too stubborn, he is too lenient, he is too strong, he is too weak. With the friends he has he does not need enemies. Shulamit Aloni says that he "radiates weakness." Hayim Ramon stabs him in the back by creating a split in Labor, Rabin's only fort. Yosi Sarid, who bends over backward to act as Rabin's spokesman, convinces MAPAM [United Workers Party] to help smash Labor's rule of the Histadrut. "My dear friend" Arye Der'i prevents SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] from joining the coalition. There are ministers whispering about their prime minister's "hesitancy and inability to make decisions." And there are those among them who confide about his "loss of control" and "conceding too much" to 'Arafat. There has been a no less dramatic change in the attitude of the man in the street. Wherever he goes, Rabin faces heckling and calls of "cheater," "traitor," or "death to Rabin." For the first time since he became prime minister, public opinion polls show that almost 60 percent are dissatisfied with Rabin's performance. For the first time since he came to power, the polls show that Netanyahu, and even Peres, would beat him at the polls. The procrastination in the negotiations angers what is called the "Peace Now" camp -- as though the PLO, where disorder reigns, has no part in it and it is also Rabin's fault. The latest terrorist attacks have been exploited by the "national camp" as proof of his weakness -- as though no Jewish blood was shed under the Likud. That is how a developing unwritten, and definitely unholy, pact between the opposition and those who are supposed to be Rabin's supporters and allies in eroding his leadership. While Rabin is struggling with the peace front, the right wing is becoming more popular, just as his allies are stealing the political base on which he depends. I have not come to praise Rabin, but to express concern about the trend to bury him. Rabin is currently the only politician with the experience, and perhaps the ability, to take the big leap into the peace era. It is true that he is no Churchill, and a thick book listing his mistakes and faults can be written. Sometimes he is his own worst enemy, often he shows disdain for others, acting like a Johnny-know-it-all, and he justifiably gets whacked over the head from time to time for his arrogance and mistakes. Nevertheless, he is still the right man, at the right place, at the right time for two reasons with which it is hard to argue: First, because he has a mixture of personal traits which serve well the path he is taking: On the one hand, political ripeness, which apparently comes with age, and which led him to understand that there is no future to the policy of pure might and breaking bones. He chose the path of peace arrangements in return for concessions on territories. On the other hand, he was and remains "Mr. Defense," which is expressed in his insistence that concessions must not harm Israel's security and the IDF's preparations for the battlefield of the future, which might be fought against far off countries like Iraq and Iran. Whoever claims that giving up territories endangers Israel's security will find in Rabin a rare combination of a readiness to make concessions and concern for security. To my great regret, when we look around we find either those willing to concede all -- for whom time is short -- or those who preach security for its own sake. And both types are no alternative to Rabin. Second, it is hard to find at present political alternatives to the path Rabin has taken. The opposition based on the Likud has still not come up with an alternative policy and has not cultivated a leader prepared to continue the path of peace. No immediate successor to Rabin has emerged inside Labor. It is doubtful whether Shim'on Peres, somebody with an outstanding political vision, could have brought Labor to power, received approval for the Oslo agreement, or talked with 'Arafat, had he been prime minister. There is nothing to be done, this nation, whether justifiably or not, does not trust Peres. Beyond these two "old timers," many political babes can be seen on the horizon, but not a single leader who can out perform Rabin right now. He is easily miffed, he is indecisive, he is too arrogant, he is too indulgent, he is too stubborn -- but in the political vacuum we are facing, there is no alternative to Yitzhaq Rabin. We must nurture him so that nothing happens to him.
