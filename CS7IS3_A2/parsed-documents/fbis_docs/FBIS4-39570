In the last three years, in his words, the number of such crimes has risen from 4,000 to 22,500. One in every nine murders is committed involving firearms. Last year, 1,366 handguns and revolvers, 1,946 automatic rifles, 140 machine guns, six missile launchers, and 33 grenade launchers were seized from criminals. Participants in the news briefing noted that there are several avenues through which weapons reach the "black market." The first, and the most massive, is the smuggling of weapons from "hot spots" in the CIS states. The second avenue is the stealing of weapons from factories producing firearms. Recently 14 groups of criminals who were stealing the main product have been discovered at the Tula firearms plant alone. In Izhevsk, the activity of a group of "Izhmash" production association employees, who carried out thefts of automatic weapons which they later sold, was cut short. Thefts are committed also at Defense Ministry installations located on the territory of Russia. As in the case of the plants, the reason for arms "leaks" consists in unsatisfactory arrangements for storing them and unreliable guards.
