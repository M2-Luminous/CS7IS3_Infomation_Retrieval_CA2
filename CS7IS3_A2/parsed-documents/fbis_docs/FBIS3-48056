Izetbegovic said: We believe that convening a new international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina on a larger basis and including a larger number of participants would be useful, especially if it will reaffirm the principles passed at the London (peace) conference last year. It was obvious that the last round of talks convened in Geneva a few days ago had exhausted all possibilities, he told a press conference here Monday to mark the end of his four-day working visit to Malaysia. Earlier, Izetbegovic held a four-eyed meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim. The meeting lasted for an hour. The idea to convene the new peace conference was mooted by Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed in his address when opening the two-day international conference of parliamentarians on Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday. The 10 parliamentarians from more than 30 countries, who attended the international conference of parliamentarians on Bosnia-Herzegovina, also called for fresh peace initiatives, including the convening of a new international conference, citing the non-accountability of the present mediators in the on-going peace negotiations to the United Nations. Asked if the other two warring factions -- Serbs and Croats -- would agree to such a conference, Izetbegovic said: I cannot be sure about the attitude of the other sides. He reiterated, however, that the conflict and violence in the former Yugoslav republic could not be solved through resolutions and appeals. There is no case in history in which any violence and force was stopped by resolutions or an appeal no matter how good the resolution was, he said through his daughter, Sabina, who acted as interpreter. Izetbegovic said he would attend the next round of peace talks in Geneva scheduled for Feb. 10.
