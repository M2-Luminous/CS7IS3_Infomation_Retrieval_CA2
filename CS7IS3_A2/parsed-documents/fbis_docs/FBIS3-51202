He thus ended the conflict over the law on the Council for Magistrates. After the ceremony, the head of state noted that this agreement has "a deep meaning that far exceeds the importance of its own objectives." He stated that "disagreements should always be surmounted through dialogue in order to set an example for our society, which has entrusted the different branches of government with the responsibility of ruling the country." Wasmosy said he hoped "this would be the starting point for the much sought-after national unity -- to the exclusion of no one -- so as to build a better Paraguay." The president urged all levels of society -- businessmen, workers, trade unionists -- "to find this path of dialogue." He termed the agreement "a symbol of maturity." "Today is 13 January, a controversial date in our history [on 13 January 1947 the Colorado Party dismissed all ministers belonging to other parties in the ruling coalition, becoming the sole ruler of the country]. Well, let this 13 January be the date on which we embark upon the path to lift our country out of underdevelopment," he stressed. After the president's speech, Justice Minister Juan Manuel Morales, a signatory to the document as well, read the decree whereby the executive partially vetoed the law on the Council for Magistrates. By virtue of the agreement, the executive branch pledged to veto only Articles 42 and 47 of the law enacted by Congress, and congressmen committed themselves to accepting this veto so that the law might come into force as soon as possible. Article 42 pertains to the controversial issue about the required consent by the executive to the nomination of Supreme Court justices and Higher Electoral Court members. Article 47 deals with the procedure for the appointment of the prosecutor general. On behalf of all congressmen, [Senator] Miguel Abdon Saguier [Authentic Radical Liberal Party] pointed out that he wanted to "reassure" Paraguayans that this agreement would not entail the manipulation of justice or its subordination to political interests.
