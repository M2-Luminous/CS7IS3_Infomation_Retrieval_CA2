Fear of Politicized Count"] [Text] By the end of the year, the Macedonian Assembly should present the law on the census. It is a very desirable deadline so that there will be time left over to be used for finishing all the preparations for carrying out the census planned for April 1994. The text of the law has been prepared, and after its approval by the government, it will be submitted to the Assembly; two phases for this procedure are anticipated. As everyone knows, only two years after the last census--the data from which are official--the government is introducing a new census. The reason for this is that the previous census, taken in 1991, does not reflect the entire statistical picture of the country because it was boycotted by the Albanians and also because of organizational weaknesses in the way the census was carried out. Not much time had elapsed before a number of Assembly representatives, mainly from the Albanian parties, began to inflate their figures for the Albanian population in Macedonia--their data differed considerably from the official statistics--and their missionaries strolled through various European associations. In a similar fashion, various parties of the other ethnic groups in the country had reservations and doubts about the data with respect to the breakdown by ethnic groups. As a result of all this, the Republic Institute for Statistics came up with the idea of introducing a new census with international observers and international financing, and this idea has been accepted. At the Republic Institute for Statistics, the law has been treated as an entirely new project, developed on the basis of a number of scientific and expert consultations. When it was being drafted, the recommendations of the United Nations for population censuses, the suggestions of the expert group from the Committee of Deputy Ministers from the Council of Europe, as well as the experience of various countries were taken into account. Taking the Census In contrast to the earlier law in which citizens of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, foreign citizens, and people without citizenship who resided in Yugoslavia were included, in this census, it is proposed to register people who have an official, legal residence in Macedonia regardless of whether they are physically in the official place of residence or somewhere else in the Republic at the time of the census. Also to be included are those who have permission to be in Macedonia and who have been temporarily in Macedonia for at least one year, but who have a permanent place of residence outside Macedonia, with the exception of the refugees who have been staying here. On the list are also those individuals who have an official-legal place of residence in Macedonia, and at the time of the census, but for no more than one year before the census is taken, are engaged in work outside the country. The census will include those who have an official place of residence in the country at the time of the census but work in diplomatic or consular posts for Macedonia or for various United Nations organizations and military personnel or business representatives stationed abroad.... The census also takes into account refugees who, at the time of the census, find themselves on Macedonian territory and individuals who, at the time of the census, find themselves on Macedonian territory, irrespective of the reasons; citizens of the Republic who have been outside Macedonia for more than a year at the time of the census will be listed separately. It is interesting to note that the expert group from the Council of Europe has a different attitude, according to the proposed resolution in the law with respect to which population should be counted. This group thinks that the census should include the entire population which habitually resides [here], those people who stay in a habitual place of residence in Macedonia, individuals who are residing anywhere in Macedonia at the time of the census, those who have been abroad less than one year, as well as those who have been staying here temporarily for less than one year but who have a permanent place of residence outside the country. Despite such suggestions, the Republic Insitute for Statistics opted for a different solution and countered the other one from the expert group by citing the experience of numerous European countries where the census was made of the population which had legally lived in the country for one year. They explained that the habitual population--as conceived by the expert group--was only applicable to certain countries, and those have had a means to document and legally regulate entry and exit to and from their countries for many years. Bilingual Before the census of 1991 was begun, the use of languages in taking the census was an issue that broke many a lance. Two variations were proposed to handle it for this census. The first of these is for the census to be conducted in the official Macedonian language with Cyrillic letters, but a person who belongs to a different ethnic group can be enrolled using his own language if he so chooses. In such a case, the form should also be filled out in the language of the person being questioned. The forms would be printed in the Macedonian language and in the Cyrillic alphabet and in the languages and alphabets of the ethnic groups. The alternative is for the census to be taken in the official Macedonian language with Cyrillic letters, but in the local administrative areas, where a majority or a significant number of members of an ethnic group live, the census would also be done in the language of the ethnic groups. In this case, the forms would be printed in Macedonian and in the language of the ethnic groups which are a majority or a significant number. The expert group thought that the alternative should be dropped, but the Republic Institute for Statistics believed that both variations should be presented to the government. A new way of constituting the opstina [township] census commission was also proposed. In the past they had from seven to 13 members, along with a chairman. A commission had to have three experts and one member each from the Macedonian nationality and from any ethnic group, whose members residing in the opstina totaled more than 1 percent of the population according to the 1991 census. The remaining members of the commission were selected in accordance with the proportion of the population belonging to an ethnic group compared to the total population of the opstina. At the same time, for each 20 percent of a nationality or ethnic group, one member was elected; but a definite limit is proposed: Where the representation exceeds 80 percent, only two members could be chosen. In the draft text of the law, which has 58 articles, all other aspects connected with the introduction of the census are being elaborated. At the Republic Institute for Statistics, they expect that it will not be necessary to have meetings to adapt the laws as far as technical aspects are concerned. The procedure could be complicated only to the extent that it is politicized, or if we have to re-enact the debate over the one in 1991. But, believing that the prevailing attitude of the politicians is in favor of having a census following international standards, the Institute hopes that such complications can be avoided. However, how smooth the law will find its way cannot be predicted by anyone, given the legislature's structure and the influences within it. [Box, p 9] According to the calculations of the Republic Institute for Statistics, a total of $1,515,454.00 will be required to carry out the census. These funds must be underwritten by international organizations and associations. They are irrevocable and will be channeled regularly to the bank account for the census, but the law must first be passed. [Box, p 9] In addition to verifying the exact data, the credentials of the census taker, and the control over the people being counted, the following documents are required: an entry from the birth certificates of the parents, marriage certificates, certification of residency, citizenship papers, certificates providing the civil registration number or personal identification card or travel document.... And, there is a difference of opinion about the law, in the case of the expert group. That is, the European experts think that a decision should be made to the effect that a person being enumerated only submits documents when it is necessary. The Republic Institute for Statistics, however, has disagreed, retaining a proviso that not all of these documents would be required, only the essential ones.
