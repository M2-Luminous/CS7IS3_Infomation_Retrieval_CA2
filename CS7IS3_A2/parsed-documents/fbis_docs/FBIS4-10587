He said that the decision will be announced on a national network on 18 April at 2000. In a statement to reporters aboard the National Air Service (SAN) aircraft, Panama Governor Daphne Clement said Endara will announce a leave of absence, but she did not specify the reasons.

In the presence of Vice President Guillermo Ford; ministers of state; directors of autonomous and semi-autonomous institutions; provincial, municipal, and religious authorities; businessmen; merchants; and Colon Free Zone tenants; Endara said he could not give any further details on his "decision," although he admitted it was "tough and controversial." Endara also said that the decree-law requiring that amounts exceeding $10,000 be declared when brought into the country is intended to keep money obtained from drug trafficking or money laundering from entering the country. Endara noted that the decree-law was the result of numerous consultations with the banking sector and the Free Zone and that its economic impact on both sectors has been analyzed. Endara did not deny that Finance Ministry officials could be involved in mishandling funds while carrying out the decree-law, but he said that this possibility has been reviewed and control measures implemented.
