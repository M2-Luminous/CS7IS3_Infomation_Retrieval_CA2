Answering a question by a CNN reporter on China's stand if the issue is submitted to the Security Council of the United Nations, the premier said that if the method of pressure is used, it will only make things more complicated, and make the situation on the Korean penninsula tense, and that will not be good for the peace and stability of the region. "The issue of nuclear inspection in DPRK has lasted for a long time, from disagreeing with inspection to agreeing, which well domonstrates that anything can be resolved through negotiations and dialogues," the premier said. Li said that China is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and it will never encourage nulcear proliferation. The premier told Chinese and foreign reporters attending a reception sponsored by the just-concluded National People's Congress that if the issue of nuclear inspection in DPRK should be submitted to the Security Council of the United Nations, Chinese representative to the UN will put forward a comprehensive explanation on China's position. "I hope other member countries of the U.N. Security Council will accept China's position," the premier concluded.
