He notes that the 1993 "bitter harvest" in Algeria is full of "precious lessons that we must examine one after the other" to learn the "lessons and examples that are of interest to us all, without exception." The first lesson to be learned from the Algerian crisis, the writer notes, is that "violence generates violence and blind repression serves as a fuel for terrorism." After reviewing the events that triggered the crisis in Algeria, Huwaydi adds: "When the authority realized rather belatedly--20 months after the start of the bloody confrontations--that it was necessary to reopen the door of dialogue with the moderates in the Islamic Salvation Front, the front's leaders detained in prisons since the beginning of 1992 had almost lost control of their elements abroad, who were scattered and distributed among various groups. Worse still, the armed group rejected the dialogue and vowed to continue the fighting until the end." Now, he adds, secret contacts are under way to find moderates within the Islamic Front to find a way out of the crisis. The second lesson, he adds, is that "Arabism and Islam are the core of the conflict." He points out that the Algerian government crackdown on the Islamic Front was not in defense of democracy but rather against the front's affiliation with Arabism, Islam, and independence from French hegemony. He notes that "in the name of defending the republic and a secular society, a motley of intellectuals and politicians has given their full backing to the policy of repression and elimination by depicting whoever is affiliated with Islam as a terrorist." Continuing his article, Huwaydi points out that the third lesson is that the "blackout has unleashed the forces of evil and provided a chance for penetration." He notes that the ban on political activity has made "clandestine activity" the only alternative, thus giving various elements the chance to move in the dark knowing for certain that the fingers of accusation will point to the obvious "defendant, in this case the Salvation Front. He refers to a theory in Algeria arguing that "suspicious quarters" are working hard to create chaos in the country. The fourth lesson advanced by Huwaydi is that the "crisis has weakened the state and forced it to bow." Noting that the crisis has paralyzed the Algerian economy and forced the prime minister to announce that the country is unable to service its foreign debts, the government had no alternative but to sign an "unfavorable" agreement to reschedule its debts and acquiesce to the "harsh" terms imposed by the IMF to finalize the rescheduling. The fifth lesson to be learned from the crisis, Huwaydi adds, is that it has resulted in a "decline in Western support." He cites a French paper as saying that the Western governments backed the current regime in Algeria as the "lesser of two evils" compared to the fundamentalists, but now the West is wondering if its policy was correct.
