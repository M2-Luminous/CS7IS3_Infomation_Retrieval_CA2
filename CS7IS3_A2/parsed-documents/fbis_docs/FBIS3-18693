The prime ministers are, however, allaying the fears of the EU, denying that a Nordic bloc is being created within the community. Kimmo Henriksson reports from Stockholm on the prime ministers' meeting: [Henriksson] The future of Nordic cooperation in the EU has aroused concern at the session of the Nordic Council that has opened here in Stockholm, both at the level of parliamentary deputies and governments. For instance, the main Swedish paper DAGENS NYHETER thought today that the entire Nordic Council would become unnecessary following possible EU membership. It could concentrate merely on distributing cultural prizes. Indeed, the role of the Council has for many years been insignificant in sectors other than culture. The Nordic prime ministers, who were also holding their meeting here, do, however, give assurances that cooperation will continue. Carl Bildt of Sweden pointed to the cooperation during the EU membership negotiations and thought that it would continue better than ever also during membership. Esko Aho of Finland was of the same opinion, but at the same time he reassured the EC, which fears internal blocs, that the Nordic countries have no intention to organize themselves within the Union as a pressure group of their own. It is a different matter how convincing the talking seems at the EU end. As is known, the Nordic countries have intergovernmental cooperation that has developed more and more in the last few years and where the role of host circulates annually from one prime minister to the other. Whether this is described as bloc building is one of the sensitive matters that will be heaped upon the Nordic countries as a result of eventual EU membership. As for Nordic cooperation on the level of parliamentary deputies, the prime ministers promise that there will be room still for that. For instance, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen of Denmark found at least two specific issues in addition to culture on which cooperation between parliamentarians could be concentrated in the future, namely employment and environmental problems. The Nordic prime ministers again urgently call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia. At their joint meeting with the Baltic prime ministers in Stockholm, the Nordic prime ministers pointed out that Russia has undertaken to withdraw its troops by the end of August.
