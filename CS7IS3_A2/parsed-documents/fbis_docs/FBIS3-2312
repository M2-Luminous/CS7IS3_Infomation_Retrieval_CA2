Deputies said the move was another indication of the tense political atmosphere in Beijing. Sources said the 2,000 deputies of the CPPCC had been warned not to divulge the contents of reports marked "confidential". These include the Government Work Report to be submitted by the premier, Li Peng, to the second plenum of the Eighth National People's Congress session. "It appears that the atmosphere is a bit more tense this year," a CPPCC delegate said. "Of course, there's nothing really sensitive in the work reports." But how the Chinese leadership saw the political situation was different, he said. The communist regime tightened control over the media following the leaking of a work report by the Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, at a party plenum in 1992 -- days before it was scheduled to be delivered by Mr Jiang.
