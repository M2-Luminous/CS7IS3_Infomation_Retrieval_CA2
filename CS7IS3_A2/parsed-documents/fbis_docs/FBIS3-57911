The early recall -- at his request -- of General Francis Briquemont, head of the "Blue Helmets" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is one of the clearest signs of a state of mind which is rapidly spreading: Discouragement at the glaring failure of any international initiative. Shortly before the announcement of the Belgian general's departure, Jean Cot, his immediate superior, had given in to a display of revolt against the "humiliations" his men constantly have to endure. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], the "armed wing" of an international community that has never been dazzling in its coherence in the two years and six months the war in the former Yugoslavia has lasted, has been tossed about by the contradictory stances and false threats for which it suffers the terrible consequences on the ground. People like General Cot or General Briquemont can, with some legitimacy, wonder what they are doing in the Yugoslav mess when they are deprived of the means of ensuring respect for any Security Council resolution and when all their requests for reinforcements are rejected. The disquiet felt among the "Blue Helmets" can only increase, given the many admissions of failure by diplomats and the statements referring more and more specifically to a forthcoming withdrawal of the UNPROFOR if no progress is made in the negotiations over the next two months -- as European mediator David Owen has just stressed. And although the French political officials have demonstrated splendid ambiguity on this subject, the Canadians have been very clear in announcing that they "would reexamine" their presence in Bosnia in April. It is difficult to see how the western countries will succeed in extricating themselves from the deadlock in which they have been caught. The alternative now facing them has no encouraging aspect when every prospect of peace is receding: Either they withdraw the "Blue Helmets" and henceforth take no interest in the conflict and its victims, or they decide to provide themselves with the means of a real intervention and run the risk of a daunting ensnarement. In both cases, moreover, Europe is likely to pay very dearly for the political impotence it has shown since June 1991: by extending the conflict in a region that has always been explosive.
