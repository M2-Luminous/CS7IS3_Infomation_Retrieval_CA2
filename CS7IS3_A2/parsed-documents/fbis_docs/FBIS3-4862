FBIS3-4862 "dreas041_a_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-041 Document Type:Daily Report 2 March 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan SDPJ Head on Hosokawa Cabinet Reshuffle Plan OW0203011994 OW0203011994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese at 0028 GMT on 27 February in its weekly 75-minute "Discussion" program, which begins at 0000 GMT, carries a 25-minute live interview with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], on current political issues, including the cabinet reshuffle and political reform. The interview is conducted by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and Tsukuba University Professor Ikuo Kawashima. Asked to give his view on why Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa wants to reshuffle the cabinet, Murayama says he does not know the prime minister's true intention. Murayama notes he is against the idea of a cabinet reshuffle, saying the coalition government has many other important things to do now. He adds: "The prime minister never personally told me he would reshuffle the cabinet." Asked what he thinks of the view that the prime minister has a vested right to reshuffle his cabinet whenever he deems it necessary, Murayama says: "Legally speaking, it is indeed a vested right of the prime minister. According to political practice in the past, however, even when the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] was in power, prime ministers consulted with faction leaders before deciding on cabinet reshuffles. I think this is not a matter which the price minister should decide by dint of his vested right only. Besides, what we have now is a coalition government. I think it is a matter of course for the prime minister to have thorough discussions with other coalition party leaders and to seek a consensus, while maintaining harmony among the coalition parties." Yamamoto asks Murayama if the SDPJ will ask cabinet ministers from its party to resign should the prime minister decide to reshuffle the cabinet. Murayama replies: "No, I do not think it will be necessary. I am sure we can talk." Asked if Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, although there is discord between them, can remain as a team and smoothly steer the political situation, Murayama says: "I think stories on the discord are exaggerated. The coalition government was formed with Sakigake as an integral part." He also says: "I think it is natural that the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary sometimes have slightly different opinions. The coalition administration will not last long if we have to do everything as the prime minister says. I think the chief cabinet secretary is responsible for keeping the coalition intact. He has done well in the job of giving consideration to other parties. I am sure the issue can be settled if the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary have heart-to-heart discussions. Therefore, I am not taking the issue so seriously." Noting there are reports that Hosokawa has asked Murayama to join the cabinet, Yamamoto asks if he would accept such an offer. Murayama replies: "Judging from the SDPJ's circumstances, it is not easy for me to accept such an offer." At 0041 GMT, the topic turns to the question of general political matters. Asked how the SDPJ will face elections under the single- seat electoral system, Murayama says: "We no longer can do in the same manner as we did before under the medium-size electoral system. Therefore, we will cooperate with other coalition parties as much as possible in areas where we can cooperate." He adds: "We have to do our best to prevent the LDP from regaining power." Kawashima then points out that the LDP may regain power if the SDPJ fails to cooperate with other coalition parties in elections. Murayama says he understands it very well and says: "We need to be flexible in dealing with the situation. As I said earlier, it is impossible for the SDPJ to win elections single-handedly."
