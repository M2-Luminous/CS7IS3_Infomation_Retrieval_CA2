This criminal rebelling gang, which has abandoned all noble values and honorable manners, has been spitting out the venom of its hidden grudge into the body of the one Yemen for over two and a half decades. Today, and at this decisive moment in the history of our people, it is pouring the fire of its grudge onto the populated cities, thinking that it will frighten the people and scare the army of unity and constitutional legitimacy, which is advancing toward it like a surging sea. O honorable compatriots in the southern and eastern governorates: Your sons and brothers in the army of unity and democracy and constitutional legitimacy are scoring one victory after another. They are continuing their march toward the dens of this renegade gang. Help them achieve the missions you entrusted to them--the mission of cutting off the fingers that seek to disrupt the unity of Yemen, both land and man. It is for the sake of this unity that fathers and forefathers have struggled and sacrificed. It is the unity for which pure blood was spilled and chaste souls were offered. It is unity which restored the smile to all on 22 May 1990 and over which all hearts rejoiced. It is unity which we will protect with our souls and the pupils of our eyes. The forces of evil and apostasy will not be able to undermine the sacredness of our cherished unity for they are too weak to even harm the hair on a camel's back.
