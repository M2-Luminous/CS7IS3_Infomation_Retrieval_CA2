The director of the Volgograd Shipyard is worried about his collective, and is seeking like-minded people throughout the USSR (not once did he call it the "former"), in order to save the people from below, in an enterprising way, to save the state from ... the state. "You know what a terrible sign it is: this year we accepted no young specialists into production!" he noted. [Nikiforova] So what is it, is this a managerial mutiny? [Maksyut] Indeed, what nerves one must have to endure something like this?! In the three years of reform, the yard has lost 3,500 people. And what kind of people! Skillful hands. Production is being cut back. Whereas in 1990 we produced 20 units, last year we turned over 3! The government is not granting long-term loans, and short-term ones are no support for serious production. [Nikiforova] How is the enterprise getting by? [Maksyut] It's a good thing that they need a fleet abroad, we are surviving by means of real currency. Last year we concluded a contract to build ten dry cargo ships, we are turning over four this year, and the rest over the next two years. Note this: we are selling to foreign firms. The Germans and the Dutch need ships, but Russia, it turns out, does not need them. [Nikiforova] The yard has become a joint-stock company. In the logical course of events, shipbuilding should get financial replenishment. [Maksyut] At first we too believed this. We took the second variant of privatization, and bought up 51 percent of the shares through the privatization fund. Because of the fact that Chubays had to buy 80 percent of the shares for vouchers alone, though, we got very little. [Nikiforova] It turns out that ownership brings only trouble. What is the workers' attitude toward this? [Maksyut] They are not in a very good mood. The average wage is 71,000 rubles [R]. By general agreement, we decided not to pay dividends so far -- nothing to pay them with. True, we found the "thirteenth-month wage," we are subsidizing half the cost of dinners in the dining hall. The exorbitant rise in prices is forcing people to get themselves out of the mess, it is pushing them to crime: it is a paradox, but people, owners of the enterprise, have begun to steal more. From themselves! Laziness is increasing. You have a top specialist getting 4-5-fold less than, for example, an operator at a thermal power station. Unless the government makes a sensible decision, the yard's reserves are enough for two to three months. We, the members of the rayon council of directors, warned the authorities of this. They answered us: "Do not dramatize!" After all, though, the people can go out on the streets without any notice. The directors are restraining this today. But tomorrow? [Nikiforova] Are there political forces -- parties, movements -- which would help the people to understand the situation? Perhaps the trade unions will support the workers? [Maksyut] Serious work must be done at the enterprises right now -- to help rescue production and to preserve the work places. But who will do it? The communist party knows how to do this, but, unfortunately, it has removed itself from the working people. The trade unions? Yes, perhaps. But they, in my opinion, are the same everywhere -- they seek agreements rather with the government than with the working people. Unless the trade unions, together with the government, come out against industry's landslide in the near future, there will soon no longer be any need for them. [Nikiforova] All the same, what is the way out? [Maksyut] Let us ask the people. * * * I did ask them. At one of the shops, the way out was designated in few precise words: re-election of the president and a change of government. "I used to live like a king on R132 pension, but now I live like a beggar on R80,000," concluded a worker at the very large shipyard.
