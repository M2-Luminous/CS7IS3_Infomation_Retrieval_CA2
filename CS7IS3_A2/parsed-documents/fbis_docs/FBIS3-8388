FBIS3-8388 "dreeu046__a94003" FBIS-EEU-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Press Speculation Reported AU0903095894 Sofia BTA in English 0920 GMT 9 Mar 94 AU0903095894 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [From BTA's 9 March "Press Review"] [Excerpt] Sofia, March 9 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's heart attack yesterday and his hospitalization is in the highlights of today's press. Along with reports on his sickness, the papers run comments and forecasts on the turn of political events in this country. According to NOVINAR, the prime minister felt bad as early as Monday [7 March]; the initial diagnosis was acute heart insufficiency; a cardiac infarction followed. 24 CHASA says Prof. Milan Petrov, boss of the Military Medical Academy, denied this report. According to him, the premier had only a minor heart attack, yet he declined to specify if Berov's life was out of danger. According to KONTINENT, Prof. Petrov did not deny "the rumour spreading in Sofia of an infarction". Recent exhaustion and pressure are seen as a cause of the heart failure, says DUMA. KONTINENT and NOVINAR link Berov's heart attack to a stormy cabinet meeting Monday, and more specifically to a quarrel between Deputy Prime Ministers Matinchev and Karabashev on privatization of the tourist industry. 24 CHASA says the Prime Minister's sickness had nothing to do with "emotional pressure" as a result of that meeting, observing that Berov had had heart problems earlier. DUMA and TRUD specify the premier has already had two heart attacks. According to unofficial forecasts, the prime minister will be away on sick leave for at least two months, says 24 CHASA. "Berov Sick, Matinchev at Helm", says the headline of the leader in "TRUD. [sentence as received] The paper cites a prime minister order authorizing deputy prime minister to stand in for him. Evgeni Matinchev is a representative of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) which had a decisive role in voting in the Berov government. This would force Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev into resigning, predicts NOVINAR, adding the cabinet row on privatization would lead to its downfall. In a brief statement on national radio this morning, Karabashev denied rumours of his upcoming resignation, saying the prime minister did nothing out of the way by asking one of his deputies to stand in for him during his sick leave. Small wonder if the long and forcibly forestalled cabinet crisis sets in, says a signed comment in STANDART NEWS. Leaders of DPS and the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) are alarmed about a likely complication of the political situation in case of inability by Berov to lead the cabinet, says DUMA. DEMOKRATSIYA says leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) yesterday met with Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev. They, however, said they did not discuss implications of the premier's illness. The paper quotes Yanaki Stoilov MP of BSP as saying it was accidental that Socialists yesterday discussed the pre-election situation and the need for passing a new election law and a regional and urban planning law. KONTINENT writes that DPS will take a final stand on the Berov cabinet at an extraordinary meeting on March 18. In the days to March 18, it will try to find a solution to the tobacco harvest purchasing issue, hand in hand with the cabinet. [passage omitted]
