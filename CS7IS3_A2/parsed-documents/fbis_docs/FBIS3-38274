Mikhailidhis also repeated the government's position that the confidence-building measures do not constitute a solution nor are they an aspect of a solution to the Cyprus issue. That it why, he said, no arrangement arising during implementation of the confidence-building measures should prejudge or influence the form of solution. Mikhailidhis made the above statement following a meeting today in London with British Deputy Foreign Secretary David Amory. Mikhailidhis described his meeting with the British official as useful and constructive and added that his talks covered not only the confidence-building measures, but also the substance of the Cyprus issue.
