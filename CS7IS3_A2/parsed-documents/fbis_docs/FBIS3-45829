The four-lane bridge, which will be 12 km long -- 8.5 km across open sea -- will connect Nanao County, 160 nautical miles from Taiwan, with the continental part of Shantou, one of the earliest opened-up areas in China. The bridge is part of the effort of Shantou to catch up with the four "little dragons" in Asia -- Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Republic of Korea -- within 20 years. The bridge and underwater pipes which will carry fresh water to the island county will cost 1.2 billion yuan.
