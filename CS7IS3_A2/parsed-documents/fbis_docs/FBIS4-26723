"We chose to invest in this place because of its advantages in regional location and its improving investment environment," said Miyajima Yuko, chairman of the board of the Doumen Meifu Textile Co. Ltd. in southern China's Zhuhai Special Economic Zone (Zhuhai SEZ) near Macao. Yuko and Arai Koji, vice-chairman of the company, from the Mee Loong Trading Co. in Hong Kong, have spent 28 million yuan on 18,000-square-meter workshops. The company, in Wushan town of Doumen county, will produce woolen and cashmere products, camel hair and rabbit hair products to be exported to Japan, the United States, Britain and Canada. The small county of Doumen, under the administration of the Zhuhai SEZ, has become an area popular with overseas investors. In Wushan town alone, six projects based on overseas investments have been started this year, involving a total investment of 520 million yuan. The town is about 2 km off the expressway linking Zhuhai airport and Zhuhai port, both under construction. "It is not very convenient now, but that will change after the airport and sea port are put into operation the coming October," said Yuko, adding: "We are sure that our investment will have good economic returns." Officials from the county government said that they have signed contracts involving 505 overseas-owned or cooperative projects. The overseas investment contractual volume topped 369 million U.S. dollars and actual investment reached 153 million U.S. dollars. The hometown of 152,000 overseas Chinese living around the world, the county accounts for more than 50 percent of the Zhuhai SEZ in terms of area and population. It has become one of the most important areas open to the outside world in Guangdong Province. Infrastructure facilities have been improved to a large degree. In the past, major means of transport were small boats and ferries, as the county is composed of 22 islands. The completion of the Zhuhai bridge and five other minor bridges made the county more accessible from the SEZ and helped bring an economic boom to the county. Annual total output value in the past 14 years grew at an average of 25 percent, reaching 3.084 billion yuan last year. Besides the Zhuhai airport and the Zhuhai sea port, the planned quasi-express railway from Guangzhou to Macao via Zhuhai will run across the county. Several other projects, including an electric power plant and a water-works, are under construction.
