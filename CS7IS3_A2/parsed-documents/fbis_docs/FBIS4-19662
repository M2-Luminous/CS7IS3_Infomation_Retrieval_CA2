But that is about all you can say. At the worst possible time -- just as the EU [European Union] election campaign is beginning to get under way -- the movement which more than any other ought to be the ideological counterpart to all the Euroskeptics finds itself in a bitter conflict over style, methods, and -- not least -- personalities. The story so far after a stormy meeting last Saturday [16 April]: - Laue Traberg Smidt, hitherto the chairman of the movement's business committee, has just been thrown out of the movement in a coup while he was abroad. - Because of this, by far the most prominent personality in the movement has resigned with immediate effect. Her name is Ritt Bjerregaard. - And today -- two months before the elections to the European Parliament -- the movement finds itself with a temporary chairman who has only one declared aim: To find someone to replace him as soon as possible. - Today the Europe Movement is being led by a group of idealistic, but politically very inexperienced grass roots figures. A year ago there was a different spirit in the movement. After several decades as an ailing popular offshoot of the Council of Europe, the movement was injected with new life in connection with the two referendums on the European Union. Membership rose to its present level of 2,500 and people's involvement reached new heights. After the Danes had said "no" in the first vote in 1992, there were no disagreements last year when aims and style were debated: The second referendum on union was just around the corner, and the Danes must be persuaded at all costs that the "mistake" of the first referendum should not be repeated. It was at this time that Ritt Bjerregaard traveled round the country in her campaign bus as the Europe Movement's standard bearer -- with much media attention. Everyone knows the outcome of the campaigns of the Europe Movement and the other "yes" groups: The Danes did what they were asked to do. The Europe Movement could not, of course, be anything other than satisfied. But the movement nevertheless did have a problem on its hands: Now there had to be a change of gear. From being a out-and-out campaigning organization for a few hectic and stirring months, the organization had to make the transition to a quieter existence with longer-term goals. And this is where things gradually began to go wrong. Roughly speaking it was possible to experience inside the organization a clash between two fundamentally different approaches to running an organization, a movement: Should the movement set up the huge formal apparatus typical of associations and societies -- with the summoning of countless central board, business committee, and subcommittee meetings? Or should it simply -- totally without bureaucracy -- try to work for the European cause? The young and the less politically experienced in the organization inclined toward the first view. Led by the newly elected chairman of the business committee, Carl Thaarup-Hansen, the foot soldiers tried to pull the movement in the direction of more popular involvement for the European cause. Even though everyone in the Europe Movement has always respected Ritt Bjerregaard's political flair and knowledge, she did nevertheless begin to cause irritation around her. In quiet corners more and more people were saying that Ritt Bjerregaard -- supported by Laue Traberg Smidt -- was simply using the Europe Movement as a platform for her own attempt to go it alone politically. It could be this discontent which -- somewhat irrationally, perhaps -- cost Laue Traberg Smidt his post in the Europe Movement last Saturday. Social Democrat Ritt Bjerregaard and Liberal Party Traberg Smidt -- who despite their different party political affiliations want the same for Europe -- preferred a very different way of running the movement than the more earthbound Euro-idealists. The two of them gave pride of place to a management-oriented style -- the sort of style which gives priority to highly paid guest speakers over popular parades on the country's pedestrian streets. And to the great annoyance of the grass roots, who felt that things were going over their heads, the politically much more experienced duo of Bjerregaard and Traberg Smidt were pushing through their style and methods -- despite all the bureaucratic rules: Ritt Bjerregaard and Laue Traberg Smidt saw to it that they pulled all the right political strings round about. And, by eating their way through an endless number of lunches with representatives of Danish industry and commerce, the unusual duo made sure that a tidy sum of money -- sources mention a figure of 3 million kroner -- was collected for the fight for a more united Europe. After the weekend both Ritt Bjerregaard and Laue Traberg Smidt are both out. Probably for ever. Among those who remain in the Europe Movement it is time for the hangover and the soul-searching. And among the Euroskeptics there is, naturally enough, general satisfaction at the movement's extraordinarily badly timed own goal. They had not even dared dream of such a start to the upcoming elections.
