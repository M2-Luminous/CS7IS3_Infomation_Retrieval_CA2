FR940725-0-00028 FR940725-0-00007 §1.985&hyph;1 Functional currency. (a) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* Section 1.985&hyph;3 sets forth the dollar approximate separate transactions method that certain QBUs must use to compute their income or loss or earnings and profits. *␣*␣* Section 1.985&hyph;5 provides adjustments that are required to be made upon a change in functional currency. Finally, §1.985&hyph;6 provides transition rules for a QBU that uses the dollar approximate separate transactions method for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986. * * * * * (b) Dollar functional currency _(1) In general. The dollar shall be the functional currency of a taxpayer or QBU described in paragraph (b)(1) (i) through (v) of this section regardless of the currency used in keeping its books and records (as defined in §1.989(a)&hyph;1(d)). The dollar shall be the functional currency of_ (i) A taxpayer that is not a QBU (e.g., an individual); (ii) A QBU that conducts its activities primarily in dollars. A QBU conducts its activities primarily in dollars if the currency of the economic environment in which the QBU conducts its activities is primarily the dollar. The facts and circumstances test set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall apply in making this determination; (iii) Except as otherwise provided by ruling or administrative pronouncement, a QBU that has the United States, or any possession or territory of the United States where the dollar is the standard currency, as its residence (as defined in section 988(a)(3)(B)); (iv) A QBU that does not keep books and records in the currency of any economic environment in which a significant part of its activities is conducted. Whether a QBU keeps such books and records is determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or (v) A QBU that produces income or loss that is, or is treated as, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. (2) QBUs operating in a hyperinflationary environment _(i) Taxable years beginning on or before August 24, 1994. For taxable years beginning on or before August 24, 1994, see §1.985&hyph;2 with respect to a QBU that elects to use, or is otherwise required to use, the dollar as its functional currency. (ii) Taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994. _(A) In general. For taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, any QBU that otherwise would be required to use a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency must use the dollar as its functional currency and compute income or loss or earnings and profits under the rules of §1.985&hyph;3. (B) Exceptions _( 1 ) Certain QBU branches. The functional currency of a QBU that otherwise would be required to use a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency and that is a branch of a foreign corporation having a non-dollar functional currency that is not hyperinflationary shall be the functional currency of the foreign corporation. Such QBU's income or loss or earnings and profits shall be determined under §1.985&hyph;3 by substituting the functional currency of the foreign corporation for the dollar. ( 2 ) Corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation. A foreign corporation (or its QBU branch) operating in a hyperinflationary environment is not required to use the dollar as its functional currency pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section if that foreign corporation is not a controlled foreign corporation as defined in section 957 or 953(c)(1)(B). However, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E), may elect to use the dollar (or, if appropriate, the currency specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)( 1 ) of this section) as its (or its QBU branch's) functional currency under the procedures set forth in §1.985&hyph;2(c)(3). (C) Change in functional currency. If a QBU is required to change its functional currency to the dollar under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, or chooses or is required to change its functional currency to the dollar for any open taxable year (and all subsequent taxable years) under §1.985&hyph;3(a)(2)(ii), the change is considered to be made with the consent of the Commissioner for purposes of §1.985&hyph;4. A QBU changing functional currency must make the adjustments described in §1.985&hyph;5 if the year of change (as defined in §1.481&hyph;1(a)(1)) begins after 1987, or the adjustments described in §1.985&hyph;6 if the year of change begins in 1987. The adjustments described in §1.985&hyph;5 must be included in income in the taxable year prior to the year of change unless that prior taxable year is closed. In that case, the adjustments must be included in income in the year of change. No adjustments under section 481 are required solely because of a change in functional currency described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C).
