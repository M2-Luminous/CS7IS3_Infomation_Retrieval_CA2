The list of delegation members reads almost like a "Who's Who in the U.S. Business World": presidents and chairmen of major corporations like Westinghouse Electric, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Dresser Industries, Texaco, and so forth. In his parting address to the delegation -- which is to visit St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg in addition to Moscow -- the U.S. President stressed that "a Russian economy moving toward the market is vitally necessary for the economic security of the United States and the world as a whole." There have already been similar visits to Russia, albeit not on such a scale. But they proved virtually fruitless: Neither an active influx of capital, nor impressive joint projects, nor qualitative development in bilateral trade ensued. It is perfectly obviously that, even if accords are achieved also on this occasion, it cannot be ruled out that many of them will be left hanging -- if only because of the numerous restrictions which are still being maintained in trade and business relations between our countries to this day, and which Washington is not in any particular hurry to revoke, thereby blocking our products' access to U.S. markets. Ultimately, the lifting of these restrictions depends less on U.S. businessmen than on the U.S. Government. Well, the main thing of course, is investments: A tough decision is required from the Americans on whether they are prepared to invest money -- and considerable sums at that -- in our economy, or whether they prefer to continue waiting for something. Sometimes the impression arises that the spirit of pioneering and risk -- which, in point of fact, paved the path to the prosperity and success of America itself -- has now seemingly been lost. U.S. businessmen, it seems, are waiting for almost ideal, hothouse conditions to be created for them in Russia.
