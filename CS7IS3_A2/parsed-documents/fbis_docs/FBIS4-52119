Mrs. Rafidah: When we have our structured meeting every year, the agenda is already set. We don't have enough time to discuss in- depth the long-term vision for Asean. So when we met last year in Singapore, we agreed that we should have one informal meeting, minus the rigmarole of formality, even without officers. Because Asean economic ministers have achieved a very high degree of personalised relationships, I am very happy to note the frankness and forthrightness of our discussions. Q: And what are the instances of this frankness? A: For example, why some countries are not able to offer some products for tariff cuts. Explanations were given as to why some countries took action to raise tariffs for some products, like Malaysia did. We gave our reasons, so there would be greater understanding. And there were many things that we agreed to do to solve some of the irritations among Asean members in the area of trade. Most importantly, this sort of meeting provides the ministers with the possibility to filter down to officers certain policy decisions for the future. In the past, it was down-up. Officers make a suggestion and the ministers take it up. In this case, the ministers look at it, decide what is best for Asean, and ask the officers to fine-tune. Q: We notice some countries are not as ready as others to cut tariffs in some areas. A: This is where the reasons are discussed. We all agreed that while we understand (why some are not ready to cut tariffs), we must now go back and look closer at the reasons. Some of the reasons are not very valid; they just simply are the lobby tactics of industries which want long-term protection. For those that have no valid economic reasons, we told our counterparts: "Please see to it that you review this." Q: Within Asean, the bigger countries have different speeds of development such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Being bigger, they need more time to adjust to the demands of the new World Trade Organisation (WTO). Did this fact create any problems in reaching a consensus on how to improve Afta [ASEAN Free Trade Area] at the Awana meeting? A: Not really. It's just that, in the past, each Asean country volunteered to offer tariff cuts in certain products. Now we have fine-tuned that. We say, let's determine the common products. Let's say product A, B, C are available in all countries. We take those products, see if we can harmonise tariffs on them, see if we can reduce these tariffs together so that there is no inequitable treatment of domestic industries. Previously, you offered what you could. And then we haggled. Q: Is it true that Afta has been slow, to the extent that there is a need to quicken the Afta process? A: No, Afta is not slow. The Afta schedule has been such that it is not due to begin until now because we announced it last November, and we chose it to be such. But now we say, harmonise our tariffs, bring them down at the same time -- within a shorter period. If we can do this for products in the fast track of Afta, we can do the same for products in the normal track. Eventually the net effect is that Afta will be realised in less than 15 years (as originally scheduled). The fast track is eight years now; the old normal track is 15. If we can make both categories go faster, naturally the net effect will be a faster rate. So we have deliberately not set any dates and time frame. We want business to look at our products first and let it (the process) evolve so that in a year or two, you will see that there are no more products that will go beyond 10 or 11 years. Q: So there will be no specific time frame now? A: At the moment, no. We've asked them (the officials) to look into it. But eventually when the officers have fine-tuned the products list, we may be able to come up with a schedule that reflects a rapid actualisation of Afta. Q: And that rapid pace will have to be consistent with the WTO's programme? A: No, not necessarily. What we want to do is to make our Afta tariff cuts better than our tariff cuts that were committed under the Uruguay Round. How can it be better? If we multilaterally (at GATT) offered 10 percent cuts in our tariffs, we should offer 5 percent (more) to ourselves. That means the Asean Free Trade Area has got better tariffs than with the rest of the world. That's the target. Q: But, at the moment, we do not see any consensus on a shortening of the Afta process or a "strengthening" of it. A: We all agreed that, after the joint press conference (at Awana, Genting Highlands on April 23), individual ministers will make their announcements. So, wait for a few more days. Q: What are the problems faced in the implementation of Afta? A: One basic problem is the harmonisation of customs codes, which is a strengthening of the Afta process. Then you have preshipment problems. And the problem of standards. But what we face is an administrative problem. Most of them have to do with (the inconsistency in) customs nomenclatures. Q: So the fundamental problem is an administrative one, and that is holding back Afta? A: Not holding back, but constraining the free flow of trade using the CEPT (Afta's Common Effective Preferential Tariffs scheme). Trade can still happen, but if you use the CEPT, there are concessions. You enjoy tariff cuts. Q: So if the proposal at Awana is adopted, there will be no more need for any CEPT fast track in Afta? A: No. The fast track will still continue. What we can do is to include more items on the fast track, increase the items on the normal track, and shorten the time for the normal track and the fast track to be brought down to the lowest possible tariff levels. That's all we need to do. The fast track will be there, except that it will be faster. The normal track will also be faster. That's the net effect that we hope to see eventually after the study by the SEOM (Senior Economic Officials Meeting). Q: Except that there will be no specific time frame for the faster Afta? A: Well, if the SEOM suggests a time frame, why not? But at Awana, we did not set that. Unless within the next few days you hear something else, it will be safe to say that all of us are agreed that Afta will have to be made more real. Q: The CEPT will now be expanded to include new elements such as raw agricultural products and services? A: Yes. Raw agriculture is a very new element. It is a very important decision. Many of us are agriculture-based. If we can find common agricultural products that can be subjected to one harmonised tariff, and at the second stage, to tariff cuts to zero or to the lowest level -- at the same time -- then we should do it first. Q: What's the significance of the proposed framework of cooperation in the services sector, which the ministers agreed to introduce? A: The services sector is being looked at now because services have become important in global trading. The significance of the proposed framework is that in the past, we've had suggestions mooted by the various (Asean) committees. Many of these were not followed up. Yet there is room and potential for cooperation in transportation, tourism, professional services, and also in financial services. Q: So, basically, the idea is to open up the area of services to each other? A: Selected ones. Those which will not cause dislocation for domestic services and industries. We haven't identified them. The senior officials will look at it in greater detail. Q: Do you anticipate some problems here, resistance from some industries? A: Yes, that's why the senior officials have been asked to study it. So, we have to identify areas of least difficulty and move them first. Q: What is the likelihood of this frame work being adopted? A: Very likely. The framework will be discussed in greater detail in September. What we hope to do is to have this framework, if it is feasible, ready for the (Asean) leaders meeting next year. Q: Was there any reservation on the part of the other countries? A: What we have announced was based on consensus. We took note of reservations, but conceptually there was a consensus to have this studied. The formal decisions, one way or the other, will be made at the structured meetings. The next one is in September.
