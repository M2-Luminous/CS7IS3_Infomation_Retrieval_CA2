This time, according to Manucharyan, the problem is that Karabakh will most probably be able to halt the enemy's massive offensive and achieve a breakthrough in the war's progress in the coming days and that it is very important that we achieve peace and not lose the favorable moment for a second time. During a press conference at the Armenian Republican Party's headquarters yesterday, Manucharyan called on parties, public and political organizations and others to work together and "to turn the wheel in the direction that is essential for us." He expressed the hope that the next 2 to 3 months will have a determining role in the achievement of peace. Commenting on anticipated provocations, the former presidential advisor stated that a dignified solution must be found to the Karabakh problem and that one the requirements is that the people of Karabakh must have guarantees for its secure development and it must not be under anyone's rule. Mr Manucharyan said that this is the minimum requirement and did not rule out any situation which may be agreeable to Karabakh but which may not satisfy Armenia. Mr Manucharyan also commented on the CSCE and Russian peace efforts and stated that the latter incorporates mechanisms which make the resumption of military activities impossible but that it has many flaws. As for the well known proposal made by [Yeltsin adviser] Andranik Mihranyan, Mr Manucharyan said that that proposal is very close to Russia's general posture. Having been deprived of the opportunity to ask questions to the mysterious politician for a long time, the reporters naturally tried to learn about his views on the government, the president and the Ministry of the Interior. It turns out that the former presidential adviser has a very low opinion of the government's work, that, in his opinion, the present government cannot rectify the situation and that it must be replaced by a new one. The Ministry of the Interior was the target of more severe criticisms: Mr Manucharyan said that that ministry "is out of control and not subject to authority." According to Mr Manucharyan, if this situation continues there will be nothing in the republic except the Ministry of the Interior. He criticized the Ministry of the Interior for contributing to the economic crisis and said that business people are fleeing the republic today because of the shadow taxes that ministry has imposed. With an expression of boyish amazement, Mr Manucharyan cited a few examples of how those shadow taxes operate. Mr Manucharyan also criticized certain episodes of the president's foreign policy but declined to identify them because, in his words, they are related to state secrets and cannot be publicized.
