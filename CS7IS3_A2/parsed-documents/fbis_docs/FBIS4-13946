How do you see it? [Al-Iryani] Yes. A crisis of this kind can only bring something new. Let me say first that the Pledge and Accord Document did not introduce new ideas regarding the principles of the state structure. Much of what was contained in it was derived from the proposed constitutional amendments that were agreed upon between the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the General People's Congress [GPC] and then among the government coalition parties. The amendments we agreed upon, particularly regarding local government, went further than what we had agreed upon in the Pledge and Accord Document. The concerns that the parties had regarding laying the foundations for the single Yemeni state were considered during the interim period. Therefore, they were not the result of the crisis itself. The purpose of initiating the crisis was not to achieve what was contained in the document, because it was clear that the Pledge and Accord Document does not mean the end for the YSP. It had other designs, particularly regarding the issue of the single Yemeni state. During the dialogue, the federalism balloon was released, and the party began exercising the powers of a separate government in what was known as the south. It became clear that federalism meant clearly the federalism of the (former) north and south. It is certain that the YSP was not thinking about anything that applies to the new unified Yemen. Its views were based on the old division. Therefore, the Pledge and Accord Document did not fulfill the purpose of the party. As far as it was concerned, the document was not the end. Had the party viewed it as its ultimate objective, it would have ended the crisis. Therefore, I think that the party wants to impose its way of managing this crisis on the Yemeni people in order to achieve a result satisfactory to the party first and foremost. [Al-Daqqaq] Is the focus of the discussion now the return of the army to the positions that it held before 22 May 1990? [Al-Iryani] Yes. What we are actually seeing is an attempt for a total split. [Al-Daqqaq] Therefore, are we about to witness an imminent extensive clash? [Al-Iryani] The brothers in the YSP have clearly declared that they will not submit to the numerical majority, and constitutional legitimacy is based on the numerical majority. That was the rocket with which they destroyed all the legislative and executive institutions on the pretext that the party will not accept submission to majority rule. In that case, there was nothing we could do but to treat the party as a rebellious group that does not accept constitutional rules. This, of course, would lead to conflict. The YPC's strategy has always been to avoid involving the Yemenis in fighting. We have assumed, rightly or wrongly, that the imposition of constitutional legitimacy is bound to involve the use of force. Therefore, we waived the right to impose constitutional legitimacy in order not to resort to force. The YSP exploited this emotional weakness of the YPC and its leaders and their lack of desire to shed Yemeni blood. In my opinion, had the executive and legislative authorities used their constitutional right, the party would have been the first to use force. [Al-Daqqaq] How long will that situation continue? Do you not agree with me that the whole of Yemen is in a real predicament? [Al-Iryani] Let us go back to the Pledge and Accord Document which--despite what the YSP says about it is the criterion by which we should be bound, now that the people's control over their constitutional institutions is held up by the YSP's will. The document has become binding for the party at the local, Arab, and world levels. The party could have ruined everything before the document was signed. It is hard for it now to discredit the document. The document has a provision to prevent the use of force in case of a political dispute. It also has a provision that prevents the introduction of any change in the military setup as well as on building a simple, rather than complex, Yemeni state, as the party puts it. If this military aspect of the document is implemented, I believe that we can start to emerge from the crisis, not by coercing the YSP, but by knowing where its road ends. Personally, I cannot know the end of the party's road. That is unless it ends up "drawing power from the military" rather than from the majority. The party imposes that kind of power, because it draws power from the military rather than from the majority, which is the modern and civilized democratic principle. [Al-Daqqaq] Have Arab mediation efforts succeeded in steering the crisis toward a solution? [Al-Iryani] Mediators talk about ways out of the crisis. Serious mediation was based on a united Yemeni state. No mediator has requested anything different. [Al-Daqqaq] It was said that some mediators have raised the idea of withdrawing troops to the positions they held before unity. [Al-Iryani] I think that this request seeks to impose partition. [Al-Daqqaq] What was the GPC response to that request? [Al-Iryani] Absolute rejection of the principle. I have the honor to announce that I was one of the reasons behind stalling the "Salalah" meeting, because I rejected the request for withdrawing troops. We disagreed on what we would tell the people after the president's and vice president's meeting. President Salih had told the vice president ('Ali Salim al-Bid) that the withdrawal of the northern troops from the south and the southern troops from the north was rejected and that if we wanted to reassure the people about the military situation we would have to implement the provisions of the Pledge and Accord Document. When we got together to phrase the statement, Brother Yasin Sa'id Nu'man presented the picture indirectly to give the impression that we had consented to the principle of withdrawing the troops. I refused to issue an unclear statement. The GPC' position is to reject the troops' return to the pre-22 May situation. Unity was established upon a certain agreement and withdrawing the troops is a violation of that agreement, which approved the retention of northern troops in the south and southern troops in the north as a safety valve for this unity. Withdrawing the troops would be an annulment of unity. [Al-Daqqad] Does the YSP insist on that request? [Al-Iryani] Yes. We view this as completely backing down on the unity agreement. It is the first true backing down on that agreement. [Al-Daqqaq] How true are reports that the GPC has reservations on the Egyptian-United Arab Emirates [USE] mediation and holding a Yemeni meeting in Cairo? [Al-Iryani] This is totally untrue. I attended the meeting between President Salih, Egyptian Minister Safwat al-Sharif, and UAE Minister al-Nu'aymi. I believe that mediation is proceeding along a good course based on the implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document, particularly its military aspects. The Congress cannot have any reservations about a mediation that pursues that course. As for the tour of Ambassador Badr Hammam [Mubarak's special envoy to Yemen], he has received the demands of the YSP, basically the withdrawal of troops. We rejected that request. Therefore, it was wise of Egypt to quit discussing such requests. The new joint mediation is suitable and pursues a different course. It did not put forward specific ideas. The main question and all efforts revolve around finding a way out of the crisis. [Al-Daqqaq] Could there be a peaceful way out of the crisis? [Al-Iryani] Yes. It starts with taking the teeth out of the militarized people in the YSP. The YSP accuses the north and the GPC of being a militarized society. I can confirm that the YSP is handling the crisis through the military and views it from a purely military perspective, not from a comprehensive awareness of the interests of the Yemeni people. [Al-Daqqaq] Why does the YSP insist on the withdrawal of the troops? [Al-Iryani] I have already stated that withdrawing the troops means a return to partition. I do not like or intend to analyze ill will. It is enough for me to see ill will, and the YSP is handling the crisis with ill will. [Al-Daqqaq] Do you believe that the crisis has become too complicated for anybody to keep up with it and that calls for separation and partition have started to be heard here and there? [Al-Iryani] We now hear calls within the YSP that are totally alien to the concept of the "oneness" of the Yemeni society. Within the YSP, you hear people saying that the Yemeni society is made up of a northern society and a southern society. If they talk about the absence of oneness within the Yemeni society, it naturally follows that the northerners will be northerners and the southerners will be southerners and this is a fact that the YSP must deal with and bear its consequences [sentence as published]. [Al-Daqqaq] You keep talking about the YSP in the south. What about the GPC in the north? [Al-Iryani] This is not the case at all in the south. The southerners in the GPC fully believe in the wholeness of Yemeni society. As for the YSP, the issue is no longer that of the unity of the homeland, which is something that the YSP has gone beyond. It now talks about the duality of the society, which is a serious matter. [Al-Daqqaq] Do you agree with me that there is Arab and international sympathy with the YSP's stands and views? [Al-Iryani] That was at the beginning, but things have become clearer now. Their sympathy was based on exterior signs without getting to know the ulterior motivations. When the exterior and ulterior motivations became one, the international community discovered that the YSP's goal is not dialogue or the Pledge and Agreement Document. The world community started to discover the YSP's real intentions. But I am afraid that exposing the YSP's ulterior motives will result in a bloody struggle equal to that of the al-Khawarij [early Islamic sect]. [Al-Daqqaq] What is the truth concerning reports about Sanaa's purchase of chemical weapons and cluster bombs? [Al-Iryani] These are false allegations that do not warrant a response. But let me tell you that our brothers in the YSP are newcomers to the world of capitalist brokers. They fell easy prey to these brokers. Someone came and said to them: We have sold cluster bombs to Sanaa and we are willing to sell them to you. They were so naive and shallow-minded that they believed the broker. I think that they bought, or were about to buy. They later said that the north had bought prohibited weapons. This is not true. Cluster bombs are not "children's toys" sold on the market. We know what they are, who produces them, and the restrictions imposed on selling and buying them. If anything, such talk reflects irresponsibility, not only at the national, but also at the international level. How can they talk so simply about a matter that serious? Let me ask; if the fighting is among the Yemenis, which Yemeni deserves a cluster bomb? If the fight is with the YSP and its military, it is unacceptable to think that they deserve a cluster bomb. Do our brothers in the YSP think that we alone deserve these bombs? [Al-Daqqaq] What about terrorism? [Al-Iryani] Let me explain things to you. At the last cabinet meeting in Ta'izz, it was agreed to develop a security plan covering all cases of terrorism. The interior minister put it forward; it was prepared with the YSP's full participation. We were surprised to find that the plan covered nine terrorist cases only, although the YSP had said that they lost 154 martyrs. I was the first to object to the report, which was incomplete. The party claims to have had 154 martyrs and accuses a partner in the ruling process (the Congress) of being behind the matter. How then could they approve the report and a security plan that covers nine cases only? The surprise was that the interior minister announced before everybody that the plan, the report, and the list of cases were worked out in coordination with the YSP. It became clear that many of the cases were criminally rather than politically motivated. How could the party claim that it was up against a terrorist campaign when all it cited were nine cases? [Al-Daqqaq] This is on the domestic level. But what about the existence of terrorist camps used by the Afghan Arabs? [Al-Iryani] The only camp that the YSP has mentioned is the one in the [al-Maraqishah] area. The party announced that it took control of this camp and arrested 85 terrorists. So far the YSP has not brought any one of them to trial. The talk about terrorism is designed to defame Yemen and to prove that there are international terrorist forces in Yemen working to cause harm to others. [Al-Daqqaq] The conflict is now taking an economic form. What do the military movements toward the oil and gas regions mean? [Al-Iryani] There are no economic interests. The YSP is seeking its own interest and trying to find justifications to maintain the crisis. [Al-Daqqaq] Have the differences between the YPC and the Reform Party [hizb al-islah], the third partner in the government, ended? [Al-Iryani] Differences of opinion usually take place, but they are not continuous. I wish the crisis with the YSP were like that--agree and disagree. But the YSP is managing the crisis on the basis of the principle of reaching disagreement and not agreement, particularly with us, the YPC. The party's plan in managing the crisis is to close the doors to agreement and carry the crisis to the end. [Al-Daqqaq] What can now be done to contain the crisis? [Al-Iryani] There is nothing that can be done except to implement the Pledge and Accord Document and deploy the forces in a way that would prevent secession and fighting. This is the only solution. The forces are deployed in a way that would not prevent fighting and could lead to secession. What is needed is to redeploy them to prevent fighting and prevent one party from seceding. This is what the YPC can offer. [Al-Daqqaq] And politically? [Al-Iryani] President 'Abdallah Salih has often told all mediators: "Ask the YSP what its demands are in a united Yemen and under a pluralistic system." We in the YPC think that we have made big political concessions to satisfy the YSP. But the YSP is not satisfied. It took the premiership and nine ministerial portfolios. It also has a seat in the presidential council. Even on the basis of population, the party has taken more seats in the House of Representatives than proportionally it deserves. We made all these concessions for the sake of unity. We accept them. But we refuse to make concessions for the sake of secession.
