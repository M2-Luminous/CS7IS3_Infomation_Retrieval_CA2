More than 40 out of a total of 124 observers in Rwanda will quit the capital city, the sources said. The overall UN mission in Rwanda comprises 495 personnel. French-speaking Senegal, Congo and Togo are seen as supporting Paris' plan to send 2,000 troops to Rwanda to halt ethnic slaughter raging since early April. UN military observers said Rwandan rebels fiercely opposed to the French intervention plan have agreed to escort the African observers to the Ugandan border. The rebels, mainly Tutsis, are wary of France because of its past support of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu whose death in an April 6 plane crash touched off the violence.
