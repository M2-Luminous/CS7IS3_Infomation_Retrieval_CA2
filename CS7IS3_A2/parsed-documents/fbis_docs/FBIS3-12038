According to the verdict issued by Judge Fernando Larrain, Videla did not intend to make his opinions public because they came in the context of a speech made at a dinner last year in front of some 50 retired military officers. The complaint had been filed last November by the government through the Human Rights Under-Secretary Alicia Pierini after Videla's statements were reproduced by Buenos Aires daily CLARIN. Government sources yesterday refused to comment on the verdict. [passage omitted]
