The accord makes possible the agreed cooperation between Lufthansa and the American airline United Airlines, which will give the German airline considerably more opportunities in the United States than previously. "With the new agreement, charter and air freight traffic will from today be almost totally liberalized," Wissmann stressed. The agreement guarantees fair and just competition between the companies themselves and with rivals from other countries, Wissmann explained. With the agreement, the German Government wants to assume a leading role in bringing about free-market conditions in international air traffic worldwide. Every effort will be made jointly to win over other states to the idea of a new air traffic "open sky" order without restrictions. The U.S. transportation secretary spoke of "general interest" in the agreement. The agreement is not only in the interests of the airlines, but it will also give the customer better services and scope for travel, Pena stressed. [passage omitted] According to Lufthansa, the most important part of the cooperation is the joint flights, which begin on 1 June and for which bookings have been taken under joint flight numbers since 9 May. These code-sharing rights allow Lufthansa, for example, to offer flights to all U.S. airports, even if the passengers change planes and have to complete the final part of the journey on an American airline. In return, as of June United Airlines can offer domestic German Lufthansa connections under their own flight number. [passage omitted]
