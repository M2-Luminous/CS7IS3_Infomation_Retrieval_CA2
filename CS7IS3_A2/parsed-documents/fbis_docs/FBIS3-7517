News media in the United States and Japan carried successive stories on issues related to the nuclear problem this week, including possible United Nations sanctions against North Korea, deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and growing tension on the peninsula, all of which have probably discouraged foreigners from wanting to visit. Many foreign tourists are voicing concerns to the overseas offices of the Korea National Tourism Corp. (KNTC), hotels and travel agents about their safety in Seoul. This is partly caused by exaggerated reports on the nuclear row carried by the American media, the sources said. The U.S. State Department has yet to designate South Korea as a danger area in its travel advisory, but if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions on the North or Patriot missiles are deployed in the South, the country is likely to earn this dubious distinction. The travel advisory is important since other nations' tourism industries regard it as a reliable recommendation: If South Korea is listed as a dangerous area, the number of foreign tourists is likely to decline sharply, the sources said. Some Japanese tourists, citing deep concerns about the nuclear problem, have canceled planned visits to Seoul in April and May. Japanese account for nearly half of the total foreign tourists, so their cancellation of tours to South Korea will weaken the tourism industry here. The director-general of the Tourism Bureau at the Transportation Ministry, Chong Chong-hwan, said, "it has not reached a point where tourists should worry much about the problem now. But we have ordered the overseas offices of the KNTC to ensure that foreigners know their security is guaranteed here."
