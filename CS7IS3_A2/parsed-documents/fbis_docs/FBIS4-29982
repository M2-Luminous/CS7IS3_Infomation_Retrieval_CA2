[passage omitted] On the possibility of Cambodia joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Ranariddh said that the issue is still being debated. He said that he has received strong support from some ASEAN member countries. When asked whether or not Cambodia will attend the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meeting in Thailand next year, the prime minister simply said that his country has clearly expressed its interest in attending the meeting. "We have support from Indonesia and Malaysia. I do not know about the other countries such as the Philippines," he said. "But, I should say that we have not yet received an answer from the host country (Thailand) about our attending the ARF," he added. The Cambodian co-prime ministers and their entourage are scheduled to visit the Indonesia Aircraft Industry (IPTN) and the Asia-Africa Museum in Bandung on Wednesday.
