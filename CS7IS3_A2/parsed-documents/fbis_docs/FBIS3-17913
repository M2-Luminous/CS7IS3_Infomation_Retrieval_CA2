Yuriy Meshkov and his administration and the newly-elected Supreme Council will not be able to work constructively at maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula, says a statement by the Ukrainian sociopolitical organizations of Crimea and the Crimean Tatar National Rukh. This document is devoted to the outcome of the elections of 27 March in Ukraine. The organization of the Crimean Tatar National Rukh will support the Ukrainian organizations in questions of maintenance of territorial integrity and affirmation of Ukrainian power on the territory of Crimea, the statement says. The authors of the document cite cases of a crude breach of legislation on the peninsula in the course of the election campaign and the elections themselves, but the greatest breach noted in the statement was the canvassing speech by the president on the eve of the elections on local TV.
