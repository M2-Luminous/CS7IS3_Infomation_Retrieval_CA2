FR940325-1-00054 FR940325-1-00008 Range Improvements and Water Rights The initial proposals pertaining to ownership of range improvements and water rights generated a great number of comments. Most of the comments were not opposed to the intent of the proposed changes to conform with the common practice of keeping title to permanent improvements in the name of the party holding title to the land. However, many respondents expressed concern that the wording suggested that the Federal government would take existing rights to range improvements and water. The text pertaining to range improvement ownership has been modified in this proposed rule and a new section has been added to clarify the provisions for water rights associated with livestock grazing on public lands. The proposed rule would require that title to all new grazing-related improvements constructed on public lands, or made to the vegetation resource of public lands, except temporary or removable improvements, would be in the United States. Since the proposed change would be prospective, valid existing rights to range improvements and compensation therefor under section 402(g) of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1752(g)) would not be affected. The permittee or lessee may hold title to removable range improvements authorized as livestock handling facilities such as corrals, creep feeders and loading chutes, and to temporary improvements such as troughs for hauled water. With respect to new permanent improvements, a permittee's, lessee's, or cooperator's interest for contributed funds, labor, and materials would be documented. This documentation is necessary to ensure proper credit pursuant to section 402(g) of FLPMA, which provides compensation for the permittee's or lessee's authorized permanent improvements whenever a permit or lease is canceled, in whole or in part, in order to devote the lands to another public purpose. New permanent water improvement projects such as spring developments, wells, reservoirs, stock tanks, and pipelines, would be authorized through cooperative range improvement agreements. The proposed rule would carry forward the proposals in the advance notice regarding the distribution and use of range improvement funds and add a requirement to consult with multiple resource advisory councils during the planning of range development and improvement programs. The proposed rule provides consistent direction for the BLM regarding water rights on public lands for livestock watering purposes. It is intended to generally make BLM's policy consistent with Forest Service practice, and with BLM policy prior to being changed in the early 1980's. Under the proposed rule, any new rights to water on public land for livestock watering on such land would be acquired, perfected, maintained, and administered under State law. In all cases involving the development and registration, pursuant to State law, of new rights to water on public land for livestock watering, cooperative agreements will be used to provide that such livestock water rights are to be used and maintained in conjunction with the grazing permit or leases and do not give rise to a claim for compensation in the event the permit or lease to which it is attached is canceled in whole or in part to devote the lands to another public purpose. The proposal would not create any new Federal reserved water rights, nor would it affect valid existing water rights. Any right or claim to water on public land for livestock watering on public land by or on behalf of the United States would remain subject to the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 666 (the McCarran Amendment) and section 701 of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1701 note; disclaimer on water rights). Finally, the proposal would not change existing BLM policy on water rights for uses other than public land grazing, such as irrigation, municipal, or industrial uses. With respect to new water rights, some comments have suggested that permittees and the United States file jointly for water rights on public lands associated with livestock watering on public lands. When permitted by State law or regulation, for ease of administration, co-application with the lessee could be authorized, as it is in Wyoming. The proposed rule does not contain such a provision, although if joint filing is permitted under State law, and filing exclusively in the name of the United States is not, then the proposed language would permit joint filing. Comments are specifically sought on whether the rule should mandate joint filing to the extent consistent with or even if not permitted under, State law or if the current language in the proposed rule is preferable. Comments are sought in particular on whether co-applications should be allowed where it would not change the underlying ownership of the water right.
