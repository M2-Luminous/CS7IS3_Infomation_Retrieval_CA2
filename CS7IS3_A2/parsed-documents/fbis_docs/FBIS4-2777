The central government has decided to add three billion yuan this year to its budget for capital construction, 650 million yuan of which will be put into farm production, accounting for 21.7 percent of the total increase. Also, loans offered by banks have risen by 19.8 billion yuan this year, 2.1 billion yuan destined for agriculture, accounting for 10.6 percent of the total added. An analysis shows that the shrinkage of investment in agricultural capital construction is mainly due to the change of investment resources and the expansion of investment scale and scope. To maintain a stable agricultural development, the central government has raised the budget and loans for farm production, 12.9 percentage points more than last year. In addition to the direct input into farming, forestry and water- conservancy works, the increased investment also covers the farm- support industries, including fertilizers, pesticides, plastic sheeting and farm machinery.
