Prime Minister Meksi brought up numerous reasons for the necessity of bilateral cooperation in all fields. He asked for an expeditious start to real work either through joint commissions or contacts at various levels by government officials and experts. Mr. Meksi stressed that Greece, as EC chairman, needs to directly engage itself in the direction of Albania, so as to include Albania in the projects of this development institution, especially in the big transportation program.

He brought a message of friendship to Albanian Prime Minister Meksi from Greek Prime Minister Papandreou, wishing a move from stationary climate into concrete results.
