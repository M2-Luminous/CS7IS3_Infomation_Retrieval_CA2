FR940504-0-00052 FR940504-0-00014 In the area south of Cape Falcon, the management measures in this rule are based primarily on concerns for Klamath River fall chinook, Sacramento River winter chinook, and OCN coho. The greatest constraint on the ocean management measures was the record low abundance of OCN coho as described above. The Council recommended measures that result in the harvest of Klamath River fall chinook being shifted predominantly southward off California, to maximize access to abundant Central Valley chinook stocks. Management constraints on Klamath River fall chinook resulted in restrictive fishing seasons in the area between Humbug Mountain, OR, and Horse Mountain, CA, termed the Klamath Management Zone (KMZ), as well as in the areas both north and south of the KMZ. The Secretary issued a final rule (58 FR 68063, December 23, 1993) recognizing the Federally-reserved fishing rights of the Yurok and Hoopa Valley Tribes, as acknowledged and quantified in an opinion issued by the Solicitor, Department of the Interior, as other applicable law for the purposes of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The 1994 management measures provide for an ocean exploitation rate on age-4 Klamath fall chinook of 9 percent. This restriction of ocean harvest is required to provide equal sharing of the harvest of Klamath River fall chinook between the Tribes and non-Indian fishermen, as set out in the Solicitor's opinion, as well as to meet the spawning escapement goal floor of 35,000 natural adult spawners. Winter-run chinook from the Sacramento River are listed under the ESA as an endangered species. In 1991, NMFS concluded a formal consultation with the Council regarding the impacts of the ocean salmon fishing regulations on the winter run. The biological opinion issued from that consultation determined that the 1990 level of impacts from the ocean fisheries would not jeopardize the continued existence of the winter run. NMFS also recommended shortening the recreational fishing season off central California and closure of an area at the mouth of San Francisco Bay during the time when the winter run fish are entering the Bay. These recommended conservation measures were implemented in 1991 and remain a part of the salmon management measures for 1994. The overall impact of the 1994 salmon management program on the winter run is expected to be significantly less than in 1990, the base year for the biological opinion. This expectation is based on the harvest rate model for the Central Valley Index stocks of fall chinook, which predicts a harvest rate of 53 percent in 1994, as compared to 79 percent in 1990. These rates are only indicators of the relative impact on the winter run, because these fish are less vulnerable to the ocean fisheries than fall-run chinook, due to the timing of the seasons, as well as growth and migration patterns. Under recently approved Amendment 11 to the FMP, the spawning escapement goal for OCN coho is 42 spawners per mile in the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's ``standard'' coastal index survey areas. This translates to a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) goal of 200,000 spawners. At lower abundance levels, only incidental impacts, rather than directed OCN coho fisheries, are allowed. When the predicted spawner escapement is less than or equal to 28 spawners per mile (which translates to 135,000 spawners), the FMP allows an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent, but only if it is the minimum incidental harvest necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and will not cause irreparable harm to the OCN stock (135,000 spawners was the spawning escapement floor under the FMP prior to approval of Amendment 11; 200,000 spawners is the spawning escapement floor established by Amendment 11). The 1994 abundance estimate for OCN coho is for a record low of 140,900 fish. At this abundance level, the FMP only allows a minimum incidental harvest that will not cause irreparable harm to the stock. The 1994 management measures result in a total OCN coho exploitation rate of only 11 percent, of which about 6.4 percent are impacts associated with prosecution of Council area fisheries and about 4.6 percent are impacts associated with non-Council-managed directed fisheries (Canadian, Alaskan, and inside fisheries). Based on these measures, OCN coho spawning escapement is estimated to be 125,500 adults. The Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, has determined that the recommended harvest rate will not cause irreparable harm to the OCN coho salmon stock for several reasons. First, the 1993 spawning escapement goal was achieved, although the geographic distribution of spawners was not optimal. As a result of achieving the spawning escapement goal in 1993, the resulting production of many individual stocks in 1996 should return to normal levels, if ocean survival conditions also return to normal. Second, under the 1994 fishing regime (no coho retention), spawning escapement is projected to be 125,500 fish. This level of escapement, although not optimal because it is less than the 200,000 MSY escapement goal, is not at such a low level that OCN coho stocks cannot recover when ocean survival conditions improve. Of greatest concern are specific individual stocks within the OCN complex, such as Tillamook Bay stocks, that have exhibited extremely poor spawning escapements in recent years. However, the predominantly southern distribution of the chinook harvest, the prohibition of coho retention in all chinook-only fisheries, and the extreme measures being imposed by the states in internal waters to protect coho salmon that return to individual watersheds, makes it unlikely that the ocean salmon fishing regime in 1994 will cause irreparable harm to any OCN coho salmon stock.
