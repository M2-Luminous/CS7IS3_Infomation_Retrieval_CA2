Replying to a question, Peres said the letter with portions of his Knesset address on the issue of Jerusalem, which had been sent to the Norwegian foreign minister, was not even marked as confidential, and it contained no new elements. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports: [Begin recording] [Sukenik] Mr. Peres, it was hoped that this visit would result in some kind of a formal link between the two countries. Why did it not happen? [Peres] I do not know whose hopes they were. Our only hope was to move the major multilateral convention, the one that was slated to be held in Amman, to Morocco. I finalized this point with the Americans; I finalized it with the king; a date has been set. Israel will participate in it, as will many Arab countries; it will be unprecedented. If you ask me, it matters to me more than having a consular official here and there. [Sukenik] Still, when do you expect a Moroccan representation to be inaugurated in Israel? [Peres] I know the date, but I will not divulge it. [Sukenik] This year? [Peres] Yes, possibly before the end of this year. [end recording] [Sukenik] While Mr. Peres was abroad, he was informed by the prime minister on the telephone of the appointment of Efrayim Sne, a Rabin camp member, to a ministerial position. Peres had been opposed to the appointment, and his camp members reported his harsh reaction after the fact. [Begin recording] [Peres] It is all absolute nonsense. I spoke with the prime minister. We reached an understanding, and I am positive the understanding will be adhered to. [Sukenik] What is that understanding? [Peres] When it is publicized, I will announce it even on television.
