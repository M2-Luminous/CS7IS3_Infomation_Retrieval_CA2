FR940505-1-00231 FR940505-1-00012 EPA is proposing to ensure that turnover is maintained by implementing a declining fleet average NO X emissions program. Under the proposed fleet average program, if a fleet's turnover rate falls behind the historical California fleet average turnover rate for heavy-duty vehicles, then an emissions surcharge will be assessed on the additional NO X emissions caused by the higher emitting engines. The fleet average NO X emissions level allowed is reduced each registration cycle to reflect the appropriate turnover rates. A fleet owner would determine the total NO X emissions from his or her fleet by adding up the annual amount of NO X emitted by each vehicle in the fleet and computing an average value for their heavy-duty vehicles between 19,500 and 33,000 pounds GVWR and their heavy-duty vehicles above 33,000 pounds GVWR. These average values would then be compared to the fleet average standards for those classes in that calendar year. If the actual emission rate exceeded the standard, an emissions surcharge would be applied to the excess amount. The table below shows the calculation of the fleet average emission rates for the two classes of heavy-duty vehicles covered by the program. Besides the two vehicle classes, entries are provided for model year groupings which have different applicable NO X emission standards. The factors represent annual emissions of NO X in tons for a vehicle in any given category. Adding each column and dividing by the number of vehicles in that class will yield the fleet's average per-vehicle NO X emissions for the fleet owner's heavy-duty vehicles.

The table below lists the average NO X emissions allowed for each calendar year. These numbers are derived from the expected model year makeup of the California fleet as older vehicles are retired and replaced with enhanced heavy-duty vehicles. 115 115 ``Calculation of Average Emission Rates for Heavy-duty Onhighway and Nonroad Fleet Averaging Programs,'' EPA memo from Chris Lieske to Joanne Goldhand, February 1994.
