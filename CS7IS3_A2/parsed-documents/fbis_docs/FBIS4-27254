I would like to inform you that the inter-Cambodian conference known as the roundtable in Pyongyang, the DPRK -- Cambodia's great friend -- has ended and has produced the following results: 1. His Excellency [H.E.] Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranaridddh, and myself -- the five of us responsible for solving problems for Cambodia -- agreed to always be true and always be loyal to the principle that we will do our best to create conditions for securing peace and security for our Cambodian people, nation, and motherland. Our people have suffered for more than 20 years now. They are in urgent need of a cease-fire, of peace. Therefore, we must do our best to restore peace and fully realize national reconciliation. Furthermore, we will always be loyal to the sacred principle that the country must be free from partition or secession; it must not be divided into three, four, or more parts. We must preserve the territorial unity and territorial integrity of Cambodia forever. We must preserve the land and maritime borders of an independent, neutral, and nonaligned Cambodia which existed from 1963 to 1969 and which were solemnly recognized by the international community. Therefore, we must defend these borders, this 1963-69 territorial integrity and must do all we can so that all countries in the world respect these land and maritime borders. In order to do that we must achieve national unity, we must regard one another as members of the same family and avoid polarization. For this reason, the Pyongyang roundtable unanimously agreed that although Cambodia's overall problems, such as the problem of war, are not yet settled to a satisfactory extent, we must carry on the talks between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the party of Democratic Kampuchea. Consequently, the Pyongyang roundtable decided that in June 1994 another roundtable will be held at Damnak Chan in the Phnom Penh Royal Palace. This roundtable will be a meeting of representatives of H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, HRH Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, and Norodom Sihanouk. The five representatives will come to the Royal Palace on 15 June, continue the work left over from Pyongyang, and see to it that there will be progress in the search for a solution to all problems, such as the problem of war. I would like to inform all of you, venerable monks and beloved compatriots, that I Norodom Sihanouk am affected with cancer of the bone marrow, an illness for which I did not receive any treatment during the two months that I was having the honor to serve my people, my country between our traditional new year and the day I left home in May. During this time that I was serving the people, the nation, and the motherland, I was very tired every day and I did not receive any thorough medical examination from my Chinese doctor to see whether the cancer had recurred. The Chinese doctor was worried that my overwork and lack of proper medical treatment -- as the one I received in Beijing -- would cause a relapse. The Cambodian and French doctors in Phnom Penh took three samples of my blood for examination. The results of my blood test were not good. It showed that I still had this cancer and a few other afflictions in my system. Therefore, I needed to return promptly to the Chinese hospital in Beijing. However, because we also needed to hold the roundtable to bring peace for our people and end their sufferings, I made the ultimate sacrifice. As a result, my future was not bright and I might become very sick and might even die. Although I was experiencing a health problem, I agreed to make the sacrifice and I did not recoil from personal discomfort when I had to work relentlessly in the past few days. Why did I agree to all of that? It was so that our nation can live in peace [words indistinct] because of war. It is most regrettable to me that the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea or Khmer Rouge headed by H.E. Khieu Samphan to the roundtable did not agree with the Royal Government and the National Assembly. Our Royal Government represented by HRH Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Samdech Hun Sen and our National Assembly represented by H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, as the chairman, fully accepted the king's proposal, that is, an immediate cease-fire or, failing that, a permanent cease-fire as of 15 June when the war, the fighting must end without any conditions. They also agreed to study with the Khmer Rouge ways to include them into our Royal Government. They agreed to see whether our Royal Government can accept the Khmer Rouge leaders as ministers, deputy ministers, or secretaries of state. A number of Khmer Rouge leaders are thus to be included into the Royal Government and the Khmer Rouge army known as the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea is to be integrated into the Khmer Royal Armed Forces. In this undertaking, I hoped that Pyongyang with its excellent atmosphere and calm would be a perfect venue for us to hold the discussion. I hoped that we would have sufficient time to solve the problem and stop the war. [remainder of speech unheard due to station going off the air]
