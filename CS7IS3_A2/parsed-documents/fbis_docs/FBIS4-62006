"I see no grounds for holding these referendums and see no reason why such acts should be made, all the more so that those suggesting such a step are guided by their narrow party and ambitious interests and are again craving for power," Brazauskas said on Wednesday [11 May] night, speaking on national television. Brazauskas said that the party, the Union of Lithuanian Tautinkov (STL) which has several mandates in parliament and numbers around 200-300 members, has been collecting signatures for holding a referendum on early elections to parliament. "The costly referendum will be to no avail, but saw discord among the people. This is exactly what the right-wing forces are aiming at," the Lithuanian president said. He described the idea of holding a second referendum demanded by the Union of the Motherland (Lithuanian conservators) led by Vitautas Landsbergis and Gyadiminas Vagnorius as "utopia." According to the Lithuanian president, this party demands suspending privatisation since it is being carried out in violation of law, and 100-fold indexation of the deposits in saving banks made by the Lithuanian population over the past years. "At present, 1 billion 30 million litas are in monetary circulation in Lithuania. If the proposals made by these "theoreticians" of this party are accepted, around eight billion litas more will appear on the financial market which will inevitably cause price increases, hyper-inflation and a multifold drop in the living standards of the population," the Lithuanian president said. "It is clear that Lithuanian conservators have set themselves populist, rather than real goals," he added.
