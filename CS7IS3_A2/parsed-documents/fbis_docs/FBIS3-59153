Here is a report from Rocco Tolfa: [Tolfa] Mario Segni tried to persuade Berlusconi not to enter the fray. Now that he has, Segni has said that his decision will not help the moderate grouping but make it more divided. The Democratic Party of the Left spokesman in the Chamber of Deputies, Massimo d'Alema was curt: Berlusconi incites the hatred of one part of the country against another, and he is only raising his voice because he wants to conceal privileges and personal interests. Spokesman for the Italian Popular Party Gerardo Bianco is also worried. He said: Berlusconi is the owner of a large news network. He ended by saying: There are risks for the proper functioning of democracy. He would have done better to continue in his role as a businessman. Italian Republican Party secretary Giorgio La Malfa, in contrast, is neither pleased nor worried about Berlusconi's decision. The Italian Social Democratic Party politician Ferri is pleased. He said: It is a positive thing and can help to build a liberal democratic grouping.
