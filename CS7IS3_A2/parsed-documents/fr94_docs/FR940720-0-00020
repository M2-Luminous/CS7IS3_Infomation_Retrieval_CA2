FR940720-0-00020 FR940720-0-00001 The licensing and inspection fees in this section are modified to recover the FY 1994 costs incurred by the Commission in providing licensing and inspection services to identifiable recipients. Those flat fees, which are based on the average time to review an application or conduct an inspection, are adjusted to reflect the very small increase in the professional hourly rate from $132 per hour in FY 1993 to $133 per hour in FY 1994. In many cases, the fees for FY 1994 are the same as those assessed in FY 1993. The amounts of the licensing and inspection flat fees were rounded by applying standard rules of arithmetic so that the amounts rounded would be de minimus and convenient to the user. Fees that are greater than $1,000 are rounded to the nearest $100. Fees under $1,000 are rounded to the nearest $10. The revised flat fees are applicable to fee categories 1.C and 1.D; 2.B and 2.C; 3.A through 3.P; 4.B through 9.D, 10.B, 15A through 15E and 16. The revised fees will be assessed for applications filed or inspections conducted on or after the effective date of this rule. Fee Category 2 is amended by establishing two additional fee categories 2.A.(2) and 2.A.(3) which cover licenses authorizing receipt and disposal of Section 11e.(2) byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. The current 2.A. category has been amended to read 2.A.(1). The current 4.D. fee category has been eliminated. This action recognizes that (1) source material licenses are issued to cover these licensed activities and they are more appropriately placed in the source material category and (2) that a further distinction should be made between those licenses whose primary purpose is to authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material requiring the establishment of a new tailings pile from those licenses authorizing the receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material incidental to tailings piles created by mill operations. Fee Category 16, reciprocity, is also amended to include a fee to recover the costs incurred by the NRC for the review of revisions to the information submitted on the initial NRC Form-241 filed by 10 CFR 150.20 general licensees during the remainder of the calendar year. Agreement State licensees requesting reciprocity for activities conducted in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters are subject to 10 CFR 150.20. The first time within a calendar year that an Agreement State licensee conducts activities in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters, it must file a completed NRC Form 241. Revisions to the initial NRC Form 241 are filed for review and authorization when persons using the 10 CFR Part 150.20 general license either add locations of work, use different radioactive material or perform additional work activities in a non-Agreement State. For those licensing, inspection, and review fees assessed that are based on full-cost recovery (cost for professional staff hours plus any contractual services), the revised hourly rate of $133, as shown in §170.20, applies to those professional staff hours expended on or after the effective date of this rule. Part 171 Section 171.11␣Exemptions Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is amended to exempt State-owned reactors used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes from annual fees. The NRC believes that this change is consistent with the legislative intent of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that government-owned research reactors be exempt from annual fees if they meet the technical design criteria of the exemption and are used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes. There is currently one research reactor, owned by the Rhode Island Atomic Energy Commission, that will be exempt under this amendment to §171.11. Section 171.15␣Annual Fee: Reactor Operating Licenses The annual fees in this section are revised to reflect FY 1994 budgeted costs. Paragraphs (a), (b)(3), (c)(2), (d), and (e) are revised to comply with the requirement of OBRA&hyph;90 to recover approximately 100 percent of the NRC budget for FY 1994. Table IV shows the budgeted costs that have been allocated directly to operating power reactors as part of the base fee. They have been expressed in terms of the NRC's FY 1994 programs and program elements. The resulting total base annual fee amount for power reactors is also shown.
