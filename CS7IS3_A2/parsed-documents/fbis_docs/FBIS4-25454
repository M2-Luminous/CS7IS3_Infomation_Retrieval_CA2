Now, as the major principles and concrete requirements have all been explicitly formulated, the key lies in the earnest work of putting them into effect. Putting what has been decided into effect is the key link of our work in all fields. The policy decisions and principles laid down by the Central Military Commission, which were formulated on the basis of the practical experience, incorporate the wisdom of the masses and give expression to the objective laws governing the work of troop building in the new period. They are derived from practice, and should be returned to practice and be implemented in our work in all fields. Only thus can they play a guiding role and eventually enable us to achieve the purpose of our work. If the policies, principles, and guidelines only exist at meetings, in documents, and people's remarks, then they may not play any guiding role as they should no matter how good they are. In general, the situation of ensuring effective implementation of policies and principles is good in various units; however, formalism and red tape still exist in a small number of units, where routine ideological work and troop management are not effective enough. One phenomenon is particularly noteworthy. That is, some comrades only pay lip service to the necessity of putting what has been decided into effect, but their deeds vary from their words. Actually putting what has been decided into effect is a pressing task of the moment in order to strengthen troop building in all aspects under the new situation. This is no easy matter, and requires painstaking efforts in many aspects. It is necessary, first of all, to adopt a correct guiding principle for our work. Is our work in troop building only aimed at showing something nice to upper leaders and thus seeking fame, or at actually enhancing the combat effectiveness of troops? The answer should be self-evident. However, some comrades did not adopt a correct approach to it in their practical work. The correct attitude is to work in a down-to-earth manner of being responsible to the party and the troops without evading problems and difficulties and without seeking fame for oneself and thus make painstaking efforts to achieve solid results every step of the way. It is necessary to actually transform the style of work. We should work in a down-to-earth manner and advance steadily step by step to achieve solid results. We should actually go among the troops, do earnest work, speak honestly, and achieve real results. The window-dressing practice must not be continued, and there should be no more lip-service. The activities of courtesy should be substantially reduced, and unnecessary paperwork and red tape should be resolutely removed. No unrealistic slogans should be created, no unfeasible targets should be formulated, and no meetings irrelevant to implementation of the set policies and measures should be held. It is necessary to keep a healthy state of mind. All cadres, especially leading cadres, should have a strong sense of responsibility for the cause of revolution and really concentrate their attention on troop building. They should be so absorbed in the work of troop building as to forget food and sleep while expected results are not achieved, and should be firmly resolved to achieve successful results and never give up halfway. They must seek no comfort and fear no hardships in their work, and must give no consideration to personal gains and losses while working perfunctorily. They must adhere to the high standards for troop building, and must bring their initiative and creativity into full play. It is necessary to improve working methods. Attention should be paid to coordination, and priority should be given to the settlement of the principal contradiction. It is inadvisable to deal with all problems at the same time, because this will just make the troops work in a rush and get into a muddle. It is necessary to explicitly affix responsibilities to each level from top to bottom so that all people may perform their duties in an orderly manner. Effective measures for troop management should be maintained. For example, superficial activities among leaders [shang ceng huo dong 0006 1461 3172 0520] should be reduced, guidance should be given to various units according to their specific conditions. The practice of assigning leading cadres to various responsible positions in subordinate units in order to acquire work experience should be continued, and concrete guidance and assistance should be given to grass-roots cadres so that they may continue to improve their ability to put what is decided into effect and create more favorable conditions for fulfilling the tasks. An important factor for putting what is decided into effect is the condition of grass-roots units. A good condition of the grass-roots units is the foundation for achieving good results in all aspects of troop building. At present, efforts should be made to ensure the implementation of the "Program for Building Grass-Roots Military Units." Since the promulgation of the revised program, all units have earnestly studied and implemented the document according to the spirit of the all-Army discussion meeting on political work at the grass-roots level, and the overall situation in this regard is quite good. However, this is just a beginning, and many issues have yet to be considered and solved. We must never think that we have almost completed everything in the implementation of the program after holding a meeting, issuing documents, and relaying the instructions of the upper leaders. We should be fully aware that in order to meet the general requirements of "measuring up to standard politically, mastering military skills proficiently, maintaining a fine style of work, enforcing discipline strictly, and guaranteeing effective logistics support" set forth by Chairman Jiang Zemin, the grass-roots party branches must be really "enhancing their quality and playing their role," and the leading organs should actually give guidance to the grass-roots units according to the requirements of the program while the grass-roots units are making self-enhancement. Thus, all people from top to bottom will have to do a great deal of work, and will have to make great efforts to put what has been decided into effect. According to instructions of the Central Military Commission leaders and the actual conditions of the troops, the leading comrade of the General Political Department reiterated the 10 requirements for the leading organs to serve grass-roots units. Leading organs at all levels must act in light of the 10 requirements and promote better implementation of all tasks in grass-roots units through their earnest and wholehearted work of serving them. When talking about the implementation of the program, Chairman Jiang Zemin pointed out: "All units must ensure the implementation and must make comprehensive progress in troop building at the grass-roots level." This is also the requirement for the implementation of the program and for troop work in all fields. We must positively respond to Chairman Jiang's call, take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the fundamental guideline, really create a healthy atmosphere for putting what has been decided into effect in the whole Army, actually guarantee implementation of the important policy decisions of the Central Military Commission, and continuously advance troop building in all aspects.
