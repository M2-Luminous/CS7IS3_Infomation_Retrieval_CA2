Thus, in Chapter 5 of the official list of the delegation, which contains the names of the businessmen accompanying the prime minister, one finds the name of Constantin Francu, director of the board of the Dunarea Ltd. company. We consider it strange that the same person, Constantin Francu, was once caught at the Varsand border crossing point, in Arad County, trying to take over 10 kg of red mercury. It is noteworthy that this was the largest red mercury seizure ever made on the territory of Romania and that the place of origin was the former Soviet Union.
