This was revealed in a statement by Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif following a meeting that lasted more than two hours. The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi; Dr Kamal al-Janzuri, deputy prime minister and planning minister; Dr. Yusuf Wali, deputy prime minister and agriculture minister; and the social affairs minister, the information minister, the minister of public business sector, the finance minister, the education minister, the local administration minister, minister of state for population and family affairs, minister of state for the People's Assembly and Consultative Council affairs, the economy minister, health minister, minister of state for international cooperation; and Dr. Isma'il Hasan, governor of the Central Bank; and Dr. Zakariya 'Azmi, director of the President's Office. Al-Sharif noted that President Mubarak heard a report on the GATT agreements that have so far been signed by 114 countries and represent 90 percent of the volume of international trade. He said that the economy minister pointed out that the GATT agreement involves three main areas: currencies, financing, and trade. Al-Sharif noted that the report touched on Egypt's membership in the agreements that were reached before the GATT agreement and the positive aspects that bolstered Egypt's national economy since these agreements were signed between 1970 and 1991. The report stressed that the agreements which Egypt joined between 1970 and 1991 were reviewed by the cabinet and the constitutional establishments. The report explained the conflict in interests between the advanced nations and the developing countries and the negative impact of the GATT agreement on the economies of these countries in the short term and the positive aspects that may be gained in the medium and long terms. Al-Sharif pointed out that President Mubarak discussed the export policy and the impact of the GATT agreement on Egypt's export policy and on the system of export shares and the effect of the gradual cancellation of the shares system, which the GATT agreement notes will be canceled over a 10-year period. The report notes the approval in the GATT agreement of Egypt's memorandum on protecting Egypt's clothing industry and stopping exports of ready-made clothing and textiles in the early stages of the implementation of the agreement. President Mubarak also discussed the impact of the gradual abrogation of subsidies on agricultural commodities over a six-year period and its effect on the prices of food and agricultural commodities. President Mubarak stressed that the economic policies must be based on enhancing the positive aspects and drawing up plans to confront the negative effects on the Egyptian economy in accordance with future economic policies in the short, medium, and long terms. He also called for assessing the effects of canceling subsidies on agricultural commodities during these six years by the producing and exporting countries and the effects of rising prices of the commodities that Egypt imports, such as wheat. He called for drawing up economic and financial policies to address these factors. Mubarak called for increasing Egyptian exports to the Arab and African markets by removing obstacles and facilitating procedures for exports, particularly textiles, cotton, ready-made clothing, and other commodities. Al-Sharif noted that President Mubarak also discussed a report on the performance of the public business sector. [passage omitted]
