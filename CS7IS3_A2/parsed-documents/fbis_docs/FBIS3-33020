Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 7 February reports that after two senior citizens were killed on 31 December in Centro Habana Municipality, rumors creating a distorted view of the events began to circulate. Foreign radio stations directed towards Cuba, discrediting the international image of the Revolution, claimed that in Cuba there is no security for citizens who receive dollars from relatives in the United States; they are vulnerable to attack and even murder by criminals trying to rob them. To clarify events, Radio Progreso interviews First Lieutenant Alberto Molina Perez of the homicide department of the provincial unit of police operations in Havana City who was in charge of the investigation. Molina Perez states that on the evening to 31 December, the Havana City homicide department received word that a double murder had been committed. The victims were Santiago Martinez Hernandez, 85 years old, and Eliodora Josefina Suarez Ramos, 83. Clues, including fingerprints, led to the identification of persons suspected of this crime which, according to the announcer, is uncommon and caused great consternation among the people. During the investigation, one of the suspects confessed. According to Molina Perez, the prompt response of the police allowed the case to be solved quickly. The two suspects, Elmis Barbaro Villaluz and Rolando Raul Diaz Vina, are unemployed and have criminal records. They are being held and in the near future will be tried for murder. Under the penal code, sentences can range from 15 to 20 years' imprisonment to the death penalty. Radio Progreso at 1200 on 9 February reports that Cuba plays an active role in the fight against drug trafficking. Several foreigners have been arrested transporting drugs within Cuban territorial waters attempting to smuggle drugs into U.S. territory, which were later incinerated under official supervision. An example of the efficiency of the National Revolutionary Police in its fight against drugs is the case of a man in Havana City who was arrested for growing marijuana in his back yard. According to Detective Pablo Ibarra Martinez, Alejandro Valdes Friel from Cerro Municipality was arrested for growing 62 marijuana plants in his back yard and for the possession of ten packages of the drug in his home. After being arrested, Valdes confessed that he had the plants for his own consumption. Investigators determined that he had been carrying out this activity for several years and had been previously arrested for the same crime. The suspect is currently in jail charged with the possession of toxic drugs. This crime can carry a sentence of from three to eight years in prison. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 16 February reports that police charged Cesar Carrerano Ramil, head of the wholesale food distribution department in Havana, and Angel Gustavo Landin Otero, a driver, with stealing 64 sacks of rice for resale at profitable prices. Carrerano Ramil and Landin Otero were sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, while their five accomplices were sentenced to five years' imprisonment. They will pay the Cuban state 1,280 pesos for the rice not recovered.
