In Byumba, they found many Kigali citizens. Between 4,000 and 5,000 people took refuge in the Amahoro Stadium in Kigali. Selfless RPF fighters did everything possible, despite a crossfire, to use their skills to take all these people to safety. These people are currently within an RPF-controlled zone outside of Kigali. As you may recall, government forces shelled the stadium where these people had taken refuge, killing more than 25 of them and injuring over 50. The RPF continues to come to the rescue of the population, as it has been doing all along, saving the lives of those people who were still breathing in the various parishes. This work is part of our country's war for liberation. [passage omitted]
