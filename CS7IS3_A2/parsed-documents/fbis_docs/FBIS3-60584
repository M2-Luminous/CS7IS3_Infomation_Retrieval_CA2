"As far as the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is concerned, in Brussels (we) succeeded to do what was not done in Rome. The final communique urges the ratification of the START-1 treaty and the joining of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by all countries," he told reporters on Friday. "In other words, there is no doubts that the decision of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet is not viewed as the ratification of the START-1 treaty and the task of eliminating the nuclear weapons still faces out southern neighbour", Kozyrev said. The North Altlantic Cooperation Council is working in a "more realistic manner" than the recent CSCE meeting in Rome, he added. He also welcomed the fact that the issue of an urgent admission of East European nations to NATO was postponed. "There is no talk about it now, the issue has been omitted from the agenda", the minister said and added that the council is now discussing the Russian initiative to develop partnership between East European states, Russia and NATO members in such concrete spheres as conversion and peace-keeping efforts. The intiative is viewed by Moscow as an alternative plan to NATO expansion.
