Suryanarayana: "Efforts To Continue To Resolve Kashmir Issue"] [Text] Islamabad, Jan. 3. India and Pakistan on Monday agreed to make "sincere efforts" to resolve "the Jammu and Kashmir problem" in "all aspects," although both sides "recognised that there are basic divergences," according to a joint statement, issued here at the conclusion of the latest round of talks between the Foreign Secretaries. The sentiments expressed implied a polite agreement to keep the current process of the bilateral parleys on course without actually setting a date for the next round of talks. India had offered to make specific new proposals on the Kashmir as well as other issues like Siachen, Wular barrage and the Sir Creek estuary. Pakistan expects to receive these new ideas from India in about two weeks' time. Not Linked Pakistan, it is understood, had not linked the Siachen question to the Kashmir issue. The Indian Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, said he held "a preliminary discussion on some suggestions" on the Kashmir issue which, according to him, "have to be considered by both sides." In his view, it now remains to be seen as to "how we can proceed on those suggestions" during future consultations. Mr. Dixit did not say what these Indian proposals were. Both Mr. Dixit and his Pakistani counterpart, Mr. Shahryar M. Khan, stood their ground during the talks here, to uphold the vital interests of their countries. But the two sides, in accordance with the joint statement, are expected to "consult each other on the question of further talks at the Foreign Secretary or other level." It was in this context that the two Foreign Secretaries in their statement, reiterated "the need to engage in a meaningful dialogue with a view to addressing all outstanding problems" in the bilateral relationship, including "all aspects of the Jammu and Kashmir problem. Mr. Dixit left for Delhi after addressing a press conference with Mr. Shahryar Khan, with whom he held four sessions of talks, two each on Sunday and Monday, besides protracted informal conversations. Answering a question regarding the apparent failure of the latest round of talks, Mr. Dixit said: "We (India and Pakistan) are (still) in the same position (on Kashmir as at the start of these talks). The joint statement says that there are divergences. We are dealing with a complex problem. It is not necessary that accomplishment should emerge immediately like Minerva out of the head of Jupiter." Mr. Dixit explained "the very fact that, after such a long gap of time, we met, and (also the fact that) we have addressed this specific question of Jammu and Kashmir...is progress enough." The two countries, which "have addressed this specific question" after a period of many years, now "agreed to find ways to move forward to resolve this problem...despite the very fundamental differences of opinion about the situation on the ground (on both sides of the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir)." Mr. Dixit said India's negotiating principle in regard to Kashmir and all other Indo-Pakistan issues was to "reason together with our friends in Pakistan in the hope and the confidence that we shall find some solution even if it takes some time." Mr. Shahryar Khan, too, insisted that the fact of India's participation in the latest round of talks and, more important, its entering into a dialogue with Pakistan over the basic Kashmir issue "in great seriousness" should be seen as "a step forward," albeit a "small one" in the direction of a new equation between the two countries. "In diplomacy, every small step counts." The Pakistan Foreign Secretary did not, however, seek to discount the "basic divergences" on the Kashmir issue. He said: "It is our belief that, at the appropriate time, it is better to engage in a dialogue to try and resolve differences than to resort to other means." It was in this spirit that Pakistan had resumed the Foreign Secretary level talks, he explained in an apparent bid to contain the vocal criticism in some quarters here that the Benazir administration might be unwittingly walking into a parleys trap set by India. Mr. Shahryar Khan also allayed the fears of a possible sell-out of the interests of the Kashmiris by asserting that "the Kashmiris are central to the resolution of the Kashmir issue." And, "at the appropriate time, the (Kashmiri) leadership, which has to be recognised (by India and Pakistan) should participate in their own destiny," he added. "In what manner and at what time" this could be done, he said "needs to be discussed in the future." Mr. Dixit intervened to say that he had now conveyed to Mr. Shahryar Khan a policy statement that was recently made by the Home Minister of India to affirm that Delhi would, "for (the purpose of) any political solution, take into confidence all the people of Jammu and Kashmir." He declined to give details. It was also evident at the joint process conference that noticeable differences over the relevance of the old United Nations resolutions on Kashmir came into sharp focus during the talks here. Mr. Dixit said the "irrelevance" of these resolutions had been repeatedly emphasised by India. Mr. Shahryar Khan, on the other hand, said the U.N. resolution could not, in any sense, be regarded as having "withered on vine." On the issue of human rights Mr. Khan said the resolution planned to be moved at a U.N. forum sometime ago had only been shelved and that Pakistan still reserved the right to revive it in some form or other. Asked about the pre-conditions for dialogue that the Pakistan Foreign Minister, Mr. Assef Ali, had reportedly set when the Indian High Commissioner, Mr. S.K. Lambah, supposedly met him, recently, Mr. Dixit said he was told of such conditions when he himself called on Mr. Assef Ali today. Mr. Dixit clarified that Mr. Lambah had not in fact met Mr. Assef Ali. Mr. Dixit outlined Delhi's stand that any talks aimed at settling "a really complex and an almost intractable problem" like that relating to Kashmir could only be held "without pre-conditions." Mr. Shahryar Khan, who spoke to the international media for a second time on Monday, soon after seeing Mr. Dixit off, said "the situation on the ground will be the determinant of our (Pakistani) attitude to the question of resuming talks" with India. Outlining a host of issues which would influence the thinking of Pakistan, Mr. Khan said Islamabad had already asked Delhi to release the political prisoners in Kashmir, to allow the international media as well as diplomats "a free and unfettered" movement across Jammu and Kashmir and to reduce the number of additional troops that India had recently deployed in the State. The Hazratbal issue, as also the continuing "repression" in that State, were causing unmitigated concern to Pakistan, he added. As for Pakistan's role in terrorist-subversive activities in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Khan said Islamabad would accept a mechanism of neutral international observers to monitor the alleged cross-border forays from Pakistan. In a related move, Pakistan would be willing to allow monitoring in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir too. These issues would not, however, cloud the fact that Pakistan "regards the talks as a precedent for the future discussions on Jammu and Kashmir," Mr. Shahryar Khan said. PTI reports: Mr. Dixit returned to New Delhi tonight. He is expected to brief the Prime Minister tomorrow.
