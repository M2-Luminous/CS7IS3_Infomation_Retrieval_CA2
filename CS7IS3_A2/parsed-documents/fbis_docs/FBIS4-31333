The Romanian Foreign Ministry said it had taken notice of the conclusion in Paragraph 35 of the rapporteurs' memorandum reading as follows: "The discussions with the representatives of the political parties and of the press showed us that Romania is a pluralistic democracy and that the basis for development in many respects is present." According to the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the Jansson-Koenig memorandum "contains a number of information already obsolete due to the recent developments in the Romanian society, as well as some other inaccurate or biased ones, the latter due at times to the unilateral sources of information on which the conclusions of the memorandum were based." The Romanian Foreign Ministry sought to bring some additional clarification through its memorandum. Following are excerpts of this memorandum: "On 17 May 1994, the president of Romania, Mr. Ion Iliescu, promulgated the Law on the Ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights and the additional protocols thereto" which "fully accounts for Romania's determination and readiness to honor the obligations deriving from the most relevant instrument of the Council of Europe." "The ratification procedures of the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe and the protocol thereto are high on the Parliament's agenda. Preliminaries for the signing of the European Charter on Local Self-Government and of the European Convention of Trans-Frontier Cooperation are well under way." "On 4 November 1993 Romania signed the Convention and the two protocols which are now at the parliament pending ratification." "The reference made to the prefect of Cluj, Mr. Grigore Zanc, is not sustained by facts. The prefect has taken no measure at all that may be considered as discriminatory towards Romanian citizens of Hungarian origin." "The specialized commissions of the parliament are examining two draft laws on minorities, one submitted by the UDMR (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania) and the other by the parliamentary group of the national minorities in the Chamber of Deputies." "The draft law on education is also included on the parliament's agenda for examination. This draft law was drawn up in keeping with the provisions in the Constitution guaranteeing the right of the persons belonging to national minorities to be taught in their mother tongue and the right to education in their maternal language." "This draft law goes well beyond the current standards of the Council of Europe in what regards education and training in the languages of national minorities." "The setting up and preserving of bilingual signs pertains solely to the competence of the local authorities." "The Government of Romania undertook no action whatsoever to remove bilingual signs across the country." "Medical and vocational training, as well as the teaching of history and geography have always been held in Romanian, the national language of the country. Therefore it is not a matter of imposing restrictions on the education for the minorities." ``Issues, such as the opening of new border crossings between Romania and Hungary, the potential inauguration of a Hungarian consulate in Cluj, or the elimination of taxes for border area inhabitants are considered within the normal context of bilateral Romanian-Hungarian relations. Such issues are in no way related to the commitments entered into by Romania on its accession to the Council of Europe. "All persons of Hungarian origin granted pardon by the president were released." "As concerns Mr. Pal Cseresnyes, he does not belong to the group of eight ethnic Hungarians pardoned by the president." "At the time the pardon decree was issued, none of the members of the former [Romanian Communist Party] Central Committee were imprisoned, all of them being released on medical grounds and the carrying out of their sentences temporarily halted." "The former president of the Bucharest Court of Justice [Cornel Turianu] was dismissed by the minister of justice from his administrative office as court president and not from his position as magistrate." "The minister of justice, in a letter addressed to the head of the Legal Affairs Division, has requested the expertise of the Council of Europe with reference to Article 19 of the law on the organization of the judiciary in Romania." "The draft law on the ombudsman was forwarded to the parliament, where it will be discussed soon." "The statement that, with the exception of the prosecutor general and his deputy, `all other prosecutors are army men,' is not based on truth. Actually, the overwhelming majority of prosecutors are civilians." "The Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Romanian Police adopted by the parliament during the month of April, the current year, comprises entirely new juridical standards as compared to the previous regulations, rules allowing for the transformation of this body into one of the basic institutions of the state of law." ``As to the previous law stipulating that the police personnel consists of military staff and civilian personnel, the recent law of the Romanian Police stipulates that 'the personnel of the police consists of policemen and civilian personnel.' Actually, the institutional-organizational structures of the police are entirely distinct from the typically military ones. "Concerning the allegations on 'telephone tapping,' the situations involving interception of communications concern strictly such actions infringing upon the national security of Romania. According to the law, it is the specially appointed prosecutor who is sole and only authority entitled to allow the interception of communications." "The activities of control of the Romanian Information [Intelligence] Service (SRI) exerted by the Romanian Parliament are ruled by a clearly specified and efficient frame aiming to protect the service against any political interference and to prevent any trespassing as to the prerogatives it was granted by law." "With reference to the subject of nationalized property (buildings,) a juridical solution is under study, by means of which, while postulating the rights of the former house owners and of their heirs, the effects of such a solution on the hundreds of thousands of persons affected by the restitution, should be taken care of." "As to land property, the matter is solved according to the Law on Land Property, which was passed by the parliament in 1991." "The draft law related to the profession of lawyer, passed by the Senate in 1993, is on the agenda of the Chamber of Deputies and will be discussed depending on the break-down of priorities faced by the chamber." "The process of revision of Article 200 in the Romanian Criminal Code related to homosexuality is practically completed, the Romanian legislation allowing thus the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in the matter." "The reason of the temporary suspension of the accreditation [to the presidential headquarters] of the journalists of the daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI is determined by the fact that they have repeatedly and blatantly spread misleading news concerning the activity of the presidential institution and have systematically avoided to publish the due denials when confronted with the proof of their bad faith." "Immediately after the conclusion of each press conference of the president or of his spokesman, all media have unrestricted access to the full transcription of the recording of the respective conference." "The decision according to which printed matter can be mailed abroad only from one post office has been revoked." "The rapporteurs of the [Council of Europe] Parliamentary Assembly were erroneously informed as to the so-called nationalization of the SOTI television channel. In order to be nationalized, the second channel of the Romanian television (on which SOTI is currently broadcasting) should have previously been a privately-owned channel. Channel 2 has never been private, it has always been a public service channel. SOTI station has obtained the frequency channel 57 by public bidding." ``Freedom of faith is fully granted in Romania. The issue of the restitution of the ecclesiastical property was constantly approached during talks between the different established religions in the country and also during talks with the government authorities. The scarcity of financial means with which the confessional education is confronted does not spare the education system in general during this difficult period of transition and economic restructuring. ``The memorandum includes the summary of a document directly handed over to the rapporteurs by the trade unions. The statements, which were not previously checked, such as the one according to which trade union members risk losing their jobs if there is evidence that they act as leaders in their trade union. [sentence as received] ``The statement that 'the parliamentary majority hinders the implementation of the reforms' should be reconsidered taking into account the fact that in a state based on the rule of law, such as Romania, the parliament itself is an essential source of the legitimacy of the reform, and it is precisely this majority [sentence as received].
