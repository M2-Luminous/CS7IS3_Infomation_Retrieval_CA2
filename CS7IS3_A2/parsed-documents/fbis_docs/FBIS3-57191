In spite of the proposal, Konstantin Platonov gave no official response. Here is what Deputy Aleksandr Lukashenko, who had a phone conversation with Konstantin Platonov, told a BELINFORM correspondent. The general said that he received an anonymous phone call on Thursday [20 January]. An identified person threatened to apply terrorist acts against people's deputies if Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov and KGB Chief Eduard Shirkovskiy did not resign. This is the reason Konstantin Platonov assumed responsibility and issued an order to put an Interior Ministry detachment on alert and move it, unarmed, closer to the Government House. When the call proved to be a hoax, the detachment was sent back to its permanent quarters. Thus, the presence of an Interior Ministry battalion near the Music Comedy Theater is a true fact. However, there is still no official version on the incident. There remain questions instead: Why was such an important decision adopted at the level of deputy minister? Why were Stanislav Shushkevich, head of the Security Council, and other decisionmaking officials, such as the interior minister and the KGB chief, not informed about the threat hanging over the deputies?
