In the talks, while highly assessing the results of the ROK side's efforts to crack down on violators of the intellectual property rights, the U.S. side not only called for the ROK side to conduct a stronger crackdown on violators, but also strongly urged it to revise its laws and regulations so as to match those of the intellectual property agreement of the Urguay Round and the level of those of advanced countries. Concerning the issue of opening the automobile market, the U.S. side, claiming that the ROK authorities have taken such an unfavorable measure as conducting a tax audit on those who purchase foreign cars, strongly urged the ROK side to stop taking such a measure and to further lower tariffs on imported cars from the current 10 percent. However, recalling the fact that the laws related to the intellectual property rights such as the copyright protection law, the computer program protection law, the tariff law, and the cabled television broadcasting law have already been revised last year through consultations with the United States, our side explained that the tariff on imported cars has been lowered from 15 percent last year to 10 percent this year and that it is difficult to further lower the tariff because the European Union also levies a 10 percent trariff on imported cars.
