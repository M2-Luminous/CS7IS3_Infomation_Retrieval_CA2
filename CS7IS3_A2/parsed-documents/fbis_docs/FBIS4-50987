Speaking at a recent conference on labor restructuring here, Zhu Jiazhen, vice-minister of labor, said that the labor reform and related reforms in distribution and social security have been carried out smoothly all over China. The labor reform involves all enterprises with different ownerships, while a number of labor-related laws will be formulated soon, he said. One result of the reform is that China now has 55 million contractual workers, he revealed. "I believe that the labor reform will facilitate the establishment of a modern enterprise system, the expansion of a market economy and improvement in productivity," he told the conference. On the other hand, businesses will also have more and more surplus workers, he said. It is, therefore, essential to the success of the labor reform to balance the relations between the labor reform and employment, he noted. China has 600 million laborers, more than any other country. So the Chinese Government has the responsibility to create as many jobs as possible for an increasing number of job seekers, he said. The solution to the unemployment problem requires concerted efforts of enterprises and society as a whole, the vice-minister said. Most importantly, the solution lies in expanding the country's economy, readjusting its industrial structure and boosting its service sector, he added. Laborers should be encouraged to renew their concepts of value and find jobs through markets, he said. "Why is it that so many farmers can find jobs in cities, while many urban residents cannot? Because many urban residents seek white-collar jobs only, which are limited in number," he said. The vice-minister also pointed out that the introduction of a social security system is crucial to social stability and the success of the labor reform. The reform of the medical service system has been carried out throughout China, he said. A province-wide health insurance scheme to which employers and the employees pay a proportion of salary has been launched in 13 provinces, he said.
