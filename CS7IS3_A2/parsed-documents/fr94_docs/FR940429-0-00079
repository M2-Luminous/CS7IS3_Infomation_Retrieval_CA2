FR940429-0-00079 FR940429-0-00010 With regard to the issue of public comment when an institution or program is being considered for accreditation, the Secretary believes there should be opportunity for such comment but that there need not be a public hearing to obtain it. The Secretary believes further that an agency should be free to determine both the manner in which it publicizes that an institution is scheduled for review and the method it uses to obtain public comment. With regard to the other public disclosure issues in this section, the Secretary believes that the more open an accrediting agency is with regard to its policies and practices, as well as the individuals involved in its accrediting activities, the better it is for the consumer. However, the Secretary believes it is best left up to the agency to determine its actual practice in this regard. Changes : The term ``branch campus'' has been redefined, and the phrase ``additional location'' has been deleted from this section. The public disclosure requirements have been modified to clarify that a public hearing is not required to obtain public comment on an institution's or program's application for accreditation. Section 602.28␣Due Process for Institutions and Programs Comments : One commenter expressed concern that the proposed regulations allowed an accrediting agency to deny an institution or program the right to appeal in person any adverse accrediting action. Another commenter noted that the regulations did not address the provision in section 496(e) of the HEA that prohibits the Secretary from recognizing the accreditation of an institution unless the institution agrees to submit any dispute involving the final denial, withdrawal, or termination of the institution's accreditation to initial arbitration prior to any other legal action. This same commenter felt that accrediting agencies should be required to adopt an initial arbitration procedure for handling disputes involving the loss of accreditation. Discussion: With regard to the commenter's concern that institutions have the right to appeal an adverse action in person, the Secretary believes it is best to give agencies the flexibility to determine the appropriate procedures for appealing adverse actions. As the cost to an agency when an institution or program appeals an adverse action is generally substantial, the Secretary believes this approach minimizes the cost without causing undue harm to institutions that are subject to an adverse action. With respect to the issue of arbitration, the Secretary recognizes that the statute does not specifically require an accrediting agency to agree to binding arbitration. However, the Secretary anticipates that many accrediting agencies will agree to arbitration since it significantly limits the cost and length of appeals of their final decisions. Moreover, if an accrediting agency does not agree to binding arbitration, an institution will be free to appeal a final adverse decision by the agency in the federal courts. Change: None.
