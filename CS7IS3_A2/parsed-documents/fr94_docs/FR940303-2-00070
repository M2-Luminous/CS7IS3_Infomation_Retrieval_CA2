FR940303-2-00070 FR940303-2-00054 Supporting Statement for Collection of Information Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Microenterprise Report Part A. Justification 1. Circumstances That Make the Collection of Information Necessary Section 807(c)(4) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of the use of CDBG funds in promoting development of microenterprises, including a review of any statutory or regulatory provision that impedes their development. A microenterprise is defined by the 1992 Act to be a commercial enterprise that has five or fewer employees, one or more of whom owns the enterprise. HUD does not require grantees to report on the size of the businesses receiving CDBG assistance and thus has only very limited information currently available on this issue. 2. Purpose and Use of the Information This survey is being undertaken in an effort to provide HUD with current, relevant information regarding the actual experiences of community and economic development practitioners in this area for the Department's consideration in the preparation of the required report to Congress. Such information will contribute to a more accurate appraisal of microenterprise activities. If the survey is not conducted, the report to Congress will clearly fail to fully address all relevant statutory or regulatory provisions that serve to impede the effective use of CDBG funds for microenterprise activities. 3. Use of Information Technology to Reduce Burden HUD computerized files of Grantee Performance Report (GPR) data had been used to determine a potential sampling frame of grantees for the survey. However, the information provided only limited facts that indicated a sampling frame of grantees would not provide adequate information for the report to Congress. In order to respond most effectively to the intent of the report, HUD needs information on grantees that fund microenterprises, those which do not and what, if any, impediments exist. The GPR data is not a reliable basis for providing this data. 4. Efforts to Identify Duplication Efforts have been made to identify possible duplication and avoid it by reviewing GPR data files and information available in reports by interest groups. 5. Availability of Similar Information There is no systematic and uniform source of information about the effectiveness of CDBG assistance in promoting the development of microenterprises, nor about any existing statutory or regulatory impediments. Information on type of grantee (state, urban county, unit of general local government) and size of 1993 entitlement grant can be obtained through HUD's existing data base. Other than that, however, and as stated above, GPR data files provide limited information. They are most useful in identifying grantees that are making small dollar-value CDBG loans or grants to for-profit businesses. Such information suggests that these activities are to assist microenterprises. The GPR files do not, however, provide much qualitative information regarding the nature of the activities or any statutory or regulatory impediments that the respective grantees had to overcome in designing such activities. Reports prepared by microenterprise interest groups provide some information of this type, but it is limited. Perceived statutory or regulatory impediments identified by some of these entities need to be corroborated by obtaining information from actual practitioners. 6. Effort To Minimize the Burden for Small Entities Most of the information collection does not involve small entities. Some of the nonprofit intermediary organizations responding to the survey, however, may have small staffs. Efforts have been made to minimize the burden for such entities in the following ways: a. By making this a one-time information-collection effort; b. By collecting the data through telephone interviews, rather than self-administered questionnaires. The survey is expected to take less than 30 minutes; c. By designing the survey in a manner that will not require retrieving detailed activity information from case files or performing extensive calculations or analysis of data. The overall purpose of the survey is to provide HUD with the most current, relevant information so that its required report to Congress may best address any impediments to using CDBG funds for the development of microenterprises. The input of small entities should serve to provide invaluable input as to any existing statutory and/or regulatory barriers that would serve to benefit all microenterprises. 7. Consequence of Less Frequent Information Collection This is a one-time collection of information. Therefore, less frequent collection of data is not an issue.
