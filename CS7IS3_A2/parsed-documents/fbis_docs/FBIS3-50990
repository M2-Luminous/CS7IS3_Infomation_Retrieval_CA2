Source is cited in parentheses following the item. Finance Minister Edwin Sagrera stated that the most important fiscal events of 1993 were the reduction in the number of taxes and the increase in tax collection. Segrera explained that the fiscal reform reduced from 25 to three the number of taxes paid by Salvadorans. "Currently, there is only the value-added tax (VAT), the income tax, and the tax on imports which is paid at the Customs Office," he said. He stressed that "despite the reduction, tax collection increased thanks to a drop in tax evasion." He added that the fiscal deficit, which is 1.8 percent of the gross national product and which amounts to 1.167 billion colones, qualifies El Salvador to become a candidate for IMF credits. He emphasized that "the deficit can be handled indefinitely as long as it is adequately financed." (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 5 Jan 94 p 12)
