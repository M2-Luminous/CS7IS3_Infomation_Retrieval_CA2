Instead, CONFINDUSTRIA called for spending cuts, public sector wage rise caps, and a push to the privatisation process by lining up more Treasury-controlled banks like San Paolo di Torino and Banco di Napoli. The report cited a string of encouraging pointers: moderate growth in output in February and March; domestic orders and sales rising since the end of last year; a slowdown in domestic turnover in November; a 6 percent rise in retail sales against November 1992; and warehouse stocks falling below normal levels. Investment and business confidence was therefore on the rise, it said, but warned that it would be a "serious mistake" to try to correct public finances by using the tax lever, in the light of the almost 2 percent rise in fiscal pressure as a proportion of GDP in 1993 alone. Immediate corrective action must come on the spending front, the employers say: a curb on current account spending by reining in intermediate consumption of public administrations as well as funding for private social and cultural institutions and publicly owned firms, where "cutbacks have been modest thus far." Then, "there can be no discussion" of the need to hold firm to ceilings for public sector wage rises, despite recent "worrying" declarations by the Agency for Wage Bargaining. Finally, the cash tap of privatisations must be opened still further, the report said. It said that the borrowing requirement target can be met by pressing ahead with sell-offs of Treasury activities, especially banks like San Paolo, corporate finance institute IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property] (a third of which has already been offered) and Banco di Napoli, the insurance concern INA [National Insurance Institute] (already lined up), industrial groups like electricity company ENEL [National Electric Power Board] (slated to go next year), and real estate agencies like Immobiliare Italia. In this last area, Immobiliare Italiana's convention with the state to manage public property and common land was "unfrozen" today after eight months of stalemate. The move was hailed by Immobiliare managing director Luigi Scimia as signalling a real will to exploit the agency in possible sell-offs.
