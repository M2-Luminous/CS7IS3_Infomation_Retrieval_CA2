Pienaar] [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Events in Bophuthatswana had been orchestrated by an "unholy" ANC [African National Congress]/SACP [South African Communist Party]/National Party [NP] alliance which should take responsibility for the loss of life in the strife, Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said on Saturday [12 March]. In a statement, Dr Hartzenberg expressed the CP's dismay at the past week's unrest in the homeland, whose embattled leader President Lucas Mangope was a partner with the CP in the election boycotting Freedom Alliance. According to the CP leader, the ANC/SACP/NP alliance had orchestrated a "communist revolution" in Bophuthatswana through various ways. These included ferrying busloads of ANC activists to the area, carefully planning strikes, instigating student and youth vandalism, selective Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] shooting actions and intimidation of the homeland's security forces as well as a "massive SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] and leftist media campaign of disinformation". "The killing of four Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] members was an indication of the ruthless manner in which the operation had been carried out", Dr Hartzenberg said. He reiterated that the CP would never contest the election. "To do so would make the CP guilty of complicity in the enslaving of the Afrikaner Boerevolk [Boere nation] by a communist government of national unity." He further contended that the proclamation of 52 magisterial districts as unrest areas was a ruse. "(Law and Order) Minister Hernus Kriel's proclamation...is a selective enforcing of his powers because he deliberately did not include areas where unrest was happening. In not doing so he gave the ANC the opportunity to continue their revolution unhindered." The CP leader concluded by calling on all "Boere Afrikaners" and those people who had become involved in the "struggle" to regroup and consolidate. "The four Afrikaners who offered their lives...should serve as an incentive to us to also pay the highest price in order to achieve our nation's freedom in our own fatherland. The struggle which our fathers started, will rage until we die or vanquish," Dr Hartzenberg said.
