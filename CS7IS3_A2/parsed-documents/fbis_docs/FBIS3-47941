The HANGYORE SHINMUN said Woolsey flew into Seoul in secrecy on Tuesday to discuss the Korean situation amid international efforts to persuade North Korea to "abandon its nuclear program." Woolsey had a breakfast meeting with the president on Wednesday and also met with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Defense Minister Yi, apparently focusing on North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons development program, according to the daily. The newspaper also said Woolsey conveyed to his South Korean counterpart Kim Tok the U.S. position that any imposition of sanctions on North Korea in regard to its nuclear program would be difficult at present. It quoted an "authoritative" source as saying that South Korean Government officials, including President Kim, have raised the possibility of imposing economic and diplomatic sanctions as a way to force Pyongyang to improve the transparency of its nuclear development program. The daily quoted a government official as saying that Woolsey also asked about South Korea's attitude to the possible normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations.
