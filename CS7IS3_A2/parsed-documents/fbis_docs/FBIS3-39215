Could this have negative consequences on Europe? [Paye] The rise in U.S. interest rates comes as no surprise, the FED president himself had intimated that it was coming. The U.S. recovery is vigorous, but the fourth quarter rhythm (5.9 percent on an annual basis) will not be maintained, and it is better this way, as it is important to avoid inflationary pressures. The mechanical effect on Europe of a recovery in the United States is relatively modest, whilst the psychological effect is substantial, and the rise in rates will probably have marginal repercussions. [Martinotti] In Europe, on the other hand, the situation remains difficult, though for varying reasons from one country to the next. Is there not the risk of a new tightening? [Paye] The European landscape is very diverse. We have a Britain which is experiencing respectable growth, and we have continental Europe, which is in a far from brilliant situation, for various reasons. In Germany we have small signs of a recovery, very limited fluctuations, but I believe what we have here is a major, in-depth task. A whole series of rigidities is being called into question, and Germany's industrial apparatus is growing tougher. Let us not forget the shock which the country has had to face. France passed through the trough of the economic cycle six months ago, and there is a beginning of recovery, but unemployment is still climbing. The French authorities have continued to make consistent choices, aimed at long term credibility and European integration. [Martinotti] And Italy? [Paye] Seen from the outside, Italy is typified, once again, by a kind of intrinsic vitality, an economic tissue, a capacity for individual initiative, and a remarkable and encouraging spirit of enterprise. The fact that the political difficulties are reflected on the economic situation certainly comes as no surprise. This applies everywhere. But the fact remains: the country's economic basis is full of vitality. [Martinotti] Many are asking, insistently, for a sharp cut in interest rates in order to relaunch Europe's economy. Do you not feel that the monetary authorities are being overly prudent? And that a large drop in the cost of money could genuinely prime the recovery? [Paye] In France and Germany, during the past 12 months, rates have come a long way in this direction; long-term rates are at historically low levels, which is a sign of markets' confidence. Rates have an influence on economic activity, but the time frame within which a decrease in the cost of money can manifest its positive effects is open to debate, and it may be that, because of the many changes which have occurred on the financial markets, the interest rate weapon is less important than it was 20 years ago. Nobody can say that a reduction in short-term rates has a rapid effect and that the monetary lever alone can give the desired results. [Martinotti] And yet, one has the impression that many countries are continuing to reason as in the past, rather than being concerned with the problems of the future. [Paye] In an open world, to be successful, economic policy depends increasingly on its credibility on international markets. A country's ability to manage its affairs autonomously has diminished, hence the fundamental nature of the search for credibility. [Martinotti] Is a country like Italy credible, which every time that it is no longer able to bide by the rules of the game which it has accepted, resolves its problems with a competitive devaluation? [Paye] This is not specifically Italian behavior. Many countries have devalued. But I repeat: In an open economy, every country has to offer economic operators sufficiently stable and secure reference points. [Martinotti] In a situation like the one Europe is in, with growing unemployment and a recovery which is slow in showing itself, is it still possible to maintain a welfare system like the one we have known so far? [Paye] We are living in a world economy which is opening up. In the long term, this is a positive phenomenon, on condition that one knows how to adapt. The wealthiest OECD countries believed that the growth of the 1950's and 1960's would be continuous and therefore continued to strengthen their social protection systems, and to multiply guarantees. This was the case in particular in Europe, where adaptability is lower than is really needed. It is true that this is a political and social problem. We have to ask people to move, to give up a little of their comfort. This creates fear, because people ask: "Change for what?" What is clear is that the solutions cannot be those which make for further rigidity; otherwise Europe will remain cut off from the rest of the world and from its development. We have to incite people to adapt. This is in itself salutary, but being salutary with the public deficits which we have means calling into question the social security system which in Europe is subject to abuse, and which protects and reimburses in an often excessive fashion. We need a formidable effort, which will not be done in a day. Governments must inform, explain, persuade, and pay attention to marginalized people. Salaries have to be linked to productivity, but for lowly qualified jobs the problem is to find a way to integrate an overly low salary so as to make it into a decent income. There are no miracle solutions. [Martinotti] What does reforming the welfare state mean? [Paye] The system has to be changed, there is no doubt. When it comes to health insurance: Do we need to reduce payments and control costs or else privatize and maintain a solidarity system only for those on low incomes? There is a wealth of debate and analyses, but the OECD is unable to make detailed recommendations. Every country has its traditions and each one must make choices based on its needs. The same language applies to the pensions system. [Martinotti] You say that you are convinced of the need for change, but governments appear to be thinking more of the immediate situation, and not of making changes. Their overriding concern is monetary stability or other equilibria. One could almost say that they are looking at the future with today's and yesterday's eyes, not tomorrow's. That is they are not planning the future? Does it not seem like this to you? [Paye] No. Your vision supports state interventionism. I am much more in favor of giving room for private initiative and inventiveness. Monetary stability policies set out to contribute to constructing a stable framework for business. Governments must provide clear and equitable ground rules: Inflation and protectionism distort the rules of the game. Otherwise they should play the role of arbiter. [Martinotti] Corporate interests and those of society are not always one and the same. Right now European companies are laying off people in order to guarantee their productivity in the face of competition, but does this approach not contrast with that of their countries, already afflicted with historically high levels of unemployment? [Paye] One must think not only of the destruction of jobs, but also of job creation. In an economy, 10 percent of jobs disappear during a year, but another 10 percent are created. This, of course, is not a crisis situation like we know it now. But there is no contradiction between the interests of individual corporations and those of society as a whole. [Martinotti] But for the last three years Europe has no longer been able to produce jobs, rather the opposite.... [Paye] Certainly, because it has become overly rigid. [Martinotti] And perhaps also because companies lay off people easily, in the knowledge that a safety net exists in the form of the welfare system? [Paye] The provident state, the welfare state, no longer has the financial resources to play the role of Santa Claus. It is now at the end of its possibilities. I believe that we are moving toward greater human creativity. I am fundamentally optimistic. Mentalities are already beginning to change, people are understanding the need for greater individual responsibility, that one needs to accept to take risks, that greater mobility is beneficial to us, and that a change in value systems is essential. [Martinotti] To sum up with an image: Europeans must stop thinking that, when they return home from work every day, they will find hot soup prepared by someone? [Paye] No, it is not like that. In order to be sure that every day there will be someone at home to prepare the soup, one has to be capable, in a world of rapid change, to demonstrate initiative, an ability to adapt and research. It is also necessary that society as a whole be able to demonstrate its desire to help those who have to make this adjustment, and to the weakest. We need to work more and differently, but this does not mean that we will move away from a system of social protection, conquered with much effort, to the law of the jungle.
