Waiting for a Flop"] [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was expected to address the Federation Council on Monday, indicated at yesterday's press conference that he is only going to address the parliamentarians after Boris Yeltsin has spoken in the Federal Assembly. The president is expected to attend the joint session of the chambers on 18 February. Relations between the president and the premier are analyzed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY observer Maksim Sokolov: The president's desire to distance himself from the prime minister's new economic course would have been surprising only if the talk about "humanization," "easing," and so forth of reforms corresponded to reality. If an "era of humanism" does arrive, Yeltsin's saying "It wasn't me who did it," would truly sound absurd -- who would voluntarily refuse to accept the title of a good ruler? But it is far simpler and more logical to suppose that far from being made humane, the economic policy is being made only different -- because gaining the upper hand at the present moment, to use the language of Marxism, is the detachment of the monopoly bourgeoisie (the raw material lobby) that is oriented to inflation. The politician cannot obviously ignore the present correlation of forces in the detachments of the monopoly bourgeoisie -- hence the presidential ratification of the new Chernomyrdin cabinet. He cannot, however, ignore the fact that the new economic policy has no way of being more popular than the previous one. The novel by Melnikov-Pecherskiy "On the Hills" has one fish merchant reproaching another for dumping: "Think about your neighbors." The rejoinder is: "Our neighbors are not all fish merchants." Realizing that our neighbors are not all directors, it would be strange to gamble on what remains of presidential prestige in a bid just to wet the appetites of that lobby. It is more advantageous by far to preserve those remnants and to demonstrate publicly his absolute readiness to dump Chernomyrdin at the first opportunity. In this sense, Yeltsin, Gaydar, Zhirinovskiy, and Yavlinskiy -- otherwise dissimilar in all respects -- are related by their rational or instinctive realization of the fact that given the rather weak Russian finances, the resource for jacking up inflation is very small, and the short-lived and small initial pleasure (if it comes at all) would rapidly deteriorate into the hard and prolonged Ukrainian morning after. Instead of having to suffer through no fault of your own, it is much wiser to step aside, later to reappear in spotless snow-white garb. Such a unanimous desire to let the agrarian-industrial gargantuans get roaring drunk has been dictated by the realization that a flop is inevitable, by the realization of the inability to stave it off, or by the desire at least to turn it to one's own political advantage. The situation would have been trivial, and Chernomyrdin's prospects totally hopeless, had the premier not realized how eagerly everyone is awaiting his looming debacle. In order to frustrate everyone's expectations of such a thing, a politician during his brief time at bat should try to make the situation irreversible. Either economically -- like Gaydar did in letting prices go, thinking that you cannot make them come back with a stick. Or politically -- like Premier Pavlov, who in summer 1991 sought for himself dictatorial powers that would, if realized, have shriveled President Gorbachev into a purely decorative figure. Striving for this irreversibility, it would be logical for Chernomyrdin to increase the scope of his powers sharply, pulling into his orbit of influence the "power ministers" so far subordinated to the president on the one hand, and on the other, to get the economy solidly on the needle of inflation injections. Correspondingly, Yeltsin's logic is to retain the "power men" at any price, and pray to God that hangover from the issuance of credits comes as soon as possible.
