That is, a market system achieves the optimal allocation of resources through competition among the various major players on the market. When government regulates the market, the foremost objective should be to protect competition, that is, preserving a level playing field for all participants in market competition. As far as the labor market is concerned, a level playing field means that the worker has the freedom to enter or leave the market and the freedom to participate in market competition on his own worth. When government intervenes in the market not to protect such freedom but to decide whether a worker has the right to enter the market based on government wishes and to use administrative power to determine market choices, the resultant labor market will not offer a level playing field and is therefore not a genuine market. In the current rural migration, rural workers spontaneously enter the labor market. At the same time, they also spontaneously create a labor market. Peasants entering the labor market and peasants creating a labor market are the two sides of one single process: the marketization of the employment mechanism. In this sense, rural migration may be described as an important engine of the marketization of the Chinese economy. Changes in the rural macroeconomic system have given peasants the freedom to operate and contract land on their own and the freedom to leave the soil and find work elsewhere. Through regional migration, such freedom has translated into the freedom to enter the labor market, which i a key source of the energy that has revitalized the rural economy, even the enter urban-rural economy. To consolidate and further the achievements of reform, we should protect this particular freedom for peasants. At a deeper level, this freedom is not yet whole, given the fact that peasants are still being hamstrung by a social personal management system truncated along urban-rural lines. It follows that to deepen reform, we must change the ID system that treats urban and rural areas differently. 1 A permit system for peasants who wish to work elsewhere has emerged in some areas in recent years. Under the permit system, a rural worker who wants to leave his village to find work in other places is required to apply to the county or township government for an "out-of-town work permit" (abbreviated hereafter as "work permit"). According to information from the agencies involved, if the examination and approval agency in the labor-exporting jurisdiction thinks the applicant has no well-defined job search objective, it may try to dissuade him from leaving and refuses to issue him a permit. Hiring units in importing jurisdictions hire workers on the basis of work permits; a person without a work permit would not be given a job. The system is most prevalent in several leading rural labor-importing and exporting provinces and regions in east China, south China, and southwestern China. Taking this practice one step further, some agencies have suggested that peasants be required to produce a work permit before they can buy a train ticket. These days the work permit system is being publicized by some in the mass media a major innovation in reform. Recently we went to the Zhu Jiang delta area in Guangdong, which has a heavy concentration of rural migrants from other provinces, to do a preliminary study. Estimates put the non-local work force in Guangdong at 6.5 million, 10 million if we include the floating population on the move between counties and municipalities in the province. Non-local workers are concentrated in the Zhu Jiang Delta area and large and medium-sized cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. Owing to the lack of statistical data, and because of the complex nature of the distribution of rural migrants, we do not as yet have a complete picture of the magnitude of the out-ogh[f-province work force in Guangdong consisting of workers with a work permit. Nor do we know how many enterprises in the province (including individual hiring units) require a worker to produce a work permit before hiring him. Our study mainly took the form of interview and focused on state enterprises, the three kinds of enterprises that are either wholly or partially foreign-funded, rural collective enterprises, individual private enterprises, as well as grass roots governments in such places as Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Shenzhen. In Zhongshan, according to people in charge of the municipal agricultural commission, township and town enterprises are required to demand that an outside worker produce a work permit as a condition for employment. However, township and town enterprises are themselves a complicated lot. It is hard to tell how many of them actually comply with this regulation. Comrades in Foshan told us the same story. We visited Foshan Electrical Lighting Company, Ltd., a large enterprise that has a rule explicitly requiring nonnative workers to produce a work permit. The enterprise has 5,000 workers, most of them from other provinces. In the workshop we interviewed several workers from Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangxi, all of whom found work here on the recommendation of fellow villagers, classmates, or relatives and all of whom had work permits. Workers from southern Jiangxi said they were charged 200 yuan each to get a work permit back home. The rate was 60 yuan in Guangxi and 40 yuan in Hubei. We also visited two enterprises in Foshan, one of them an aluminum plant. A Sino-Hong Kong joint venture, it hired almost 1,000 people, about one-third from outside Guangdong. The other was a Taiwan-funded knit sock factory with 500 employees, including more than 100 from outside Guangdong. According to a factory leader, no work permit was required. At the aluminum plant, a young fellow from Hengyang in Hunan Province told us it was possible to get a job there without a work permit. It would have cost him 60 yuan to get a work permit back home, so he simply decided not to get one. In Lishui township in Nanhai Shi, the township chief said there were 15,000 nonlocal workers in the township. To find a job in the township, a person must produce his ID card and a document certifying that he is unmarried (or a birth control card), but not a work permit. We also visited several individual private enterprises in the Zhu Jiang Delta. They required no work permit, not even an unmarried certificate (or birth control card). We checked out several large hotels, shopping centers, restaurants, clothing stores, and small shops in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. None of them required a work permit for hiring. For instance, neither Guangdong Guest-house in Guangzhou nor Jingdu Hotel in Shenzhen, three-star and four-star establishments, respectively, had a work permit requirement. Our preliminary impression is that among enterprises in the public sector, a portion, but only a small portion, have indeed adopted the work permit system, but it is impossible to estimate how many enterprises actually do so. Among nonpublic enterprises, particularly miscellaneous private enterprises, such as small eateries, restaurants, clothing stores, and small shops, a work permit is not a prerequisite. As to whether there are individual enterprises which make employment conditional upon a work permit, we don't know. In terms of geographical distribution, places like Foshan and Zhongshan in the delta region do require a work permit, while large- and medium-sized cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou do not. Nor do enterprises in the development zone in Guangzhou. In determining whether or not a practice or system is necessary or appropriate, we cannot just look at the initial results. A sound practice or system may not produce satisfactory results in the early days of implementation, but that does not make it any less sound. In fact it may become more and more vital over time. A bad practice or system may be very vibrant at the beginning, but it could still remain a bad system or practice. The people's commune, for instance, took the nation by storm in just a few months, but this is no proof that it was a historically correct choice. It owed its explosive expansion primarily to its coercive adoption by administrative forces. In evaluating the work permit system, therefore, we cannot use the number of enterprises and localities that have adopted the system as a yardstick. What is even more important is to analyze the actual impact of its operation on social economic development. Is it consistent with the direction of marketization? Does it facilitate the creation of a market economy, particularly the healthy maturation of a labor market? 2 The system of requiring peasants who wish to leave home to find work to secure a work permit has been endorsed by some sectors. At one point we too considered it a good way to reduce haphazard migration and promote orderly migration. Armed with the results of our study and after listening to the opinions of enterprises and peasants, we reexamined the system from the perspective of the inherent requirements of the market economy and realized that the system should not be endorsed. We can go even further and say it may be an artificial impediment to the entry of rural workers into the market. There was an objective background for the emergence of the work permit system. Rural migration that involves a massive number of peasants may cause extreme social stresses. To begin with, it has strained the rail and transport sectors to the breaking point. Migrants could not be successfully distributed and resulted in explosive concentrations. Secondly, importing areas were overwhelmed by the flood of migrants pouring in. Many workers could not find jobs right away, constituting an army of unemployed migrants and causing a string of problems. They are a source of concern for all society, particularly government. Some labor-exporting and importing areas got together to work out a solution. Hence the "work permit" system. A labor-exporting jurisdiction issues a permit at the end of an examination and approval process and lets a person go. The labor-importing jurisdiction hires people when they can produce a work permit. That way a basic balance is achieved between labor supply and demand, thus avoiding haphazard rural migration. Looking back now, we see that a lot of thought had gone into the system. Had a government plan been the principal mechanism for creating jobs for peasants, then such a system will invariably prove effective. However, the enterprise system has now changed. Just look at the hiring system alone. In the wake of the diversification of the organizational formats of enterprises, the employment practices of enterprises have also diversified. In a market economy, it is an enterprise's right to decide whom to hire. Suppose the person with no permit is the right person for the job in question while another person with a permit is the wrong man for the job. What should an enterprise do? On the other hand, rural migrants are not solely motivated to find a job in a particular enterprise. Many of them create their own employment opportunities. In effect what they do is to recommend themselves for a job, dispensing with the services of a recruiter. Under these circumstances, the work permit is bound to run into difficulties in practice. The very design of the work permit is fraught with limitations. It is a mere reaction to rural migration. Its objective was to slow the tidal wave of rural migrants by limiting the peasant's freedom of movement. Such a government act, which revolves around restriction, overlooks the personal freedom peasants have won since reform went under way and ignores the employment autonomy enjoyed by enterprises in the wake of reform. It may have some positive effects, but is essentially negative and runs counter to the marketization of employment. Although government agencies in some labor-exporting and importing localities work in concert to drum up support for the work permit system, things are largely beyond their control. Only very few employment areas fall within their sphere of influence. At the labor-exporting end, most rural workers about to join other rural migrants ignore the work permit system, leaving home as soon as they get hold of an ID card and applying for a work permit only as a last resort. At the labor-importing end, enterprises subject to extensive government intervention often have no choice but to go along with it reluctantly. As for enterprises beyond the reach of direct government intervention, they simply turn a blind eye to the system. Some governments at the grass root and autonomous organizations even consider it superfluous and refuse to cooperate with it. As a result, it is not surprising that the system has not been as effective as anticipated earlier in curbing haphazard migration. Judging from the situation in some township and town enterprises in the Zhu Jiang Delta, the decrease in the haphazard influx of rural migrants has more to do with self-regulation by peasants than with the functioning of the work permit system. While the system's potential for good may not have been fully tapped, its adverse effect -- its direct erosion of the peasants' rights and interests -- has been surprisingly striking. In some localities, therefore, most peasants do not just dislike the work permit system but are vehemently opposed to it. First of all, it has made the economic burden on peasants even heavier. The typical labor-exporting area is an economically underdeveloped province or region where peasants' earnings are low to begin with. They shoulder a heavy burden and some are still struggling to feed and clothe themselves. When these peasants hit the road to join the rural migration, their main objective is to make a living. Yet local governments charge an exorbitant fee for issuing a piece of paper, lining the pockets of a department in the name of "bringing about orderly migration." Peasants interviewed complained about the unreasonableness of having to part with anywhere from 80 to 100 yuan even before they could find out how much they could make by leaving home to look for work elsewhere. Some peasants said it really hurt to have to pay such a hefty sum for a document, considering that they could not even afford to send their children to school. Second, peasants' employment autonomy has been violated. In the past the people's commune controlled the peasant's personal freedom administratively. Since reform went under way, peasants have won the right to control their own labor autonomously. Should they stay on the soil and farm the land? Or should they go elsewhere to find work? This is a peasant's basic right as an independent commodity producer and operator. It is this right that has enabled peasants to utilize their talents in many fields and carve out a niche of the market economy for themselves ahead of others. Now government wants to reassert control over peasants through the work permit system. If they want to leave town, they need approval. If they want a permit, they need to pay a fee. This is tantamount to forcing peasants to buy their "migration right." Clearly this puts up a barrier to the development of a labor market. If we follow through with this logic, maybe peasants should also be required to obtain a permit before they can go to the city to buy food. What about urban workers? Should we demand that they obtain a permit too if they want to leave town to find work? Workers should enter the market like commodities--freely. The only difference is that the worker and his labor are inseparable, which is why the worker should have the necessary personal identification, namely the ID card. This is what is required under the universal law of the development of a capital goods market. If we mandatorily require a peasant to seek government approval before he can enter the labor market, we in effect reject the notion that the peasant is the master of his own labor. This would constitute a new discriminatory policy. Some peasant workers disclosed that getting a work permit back home requires no examination-and-approval process. The only condition is that they pay a fee. Cough up the money and you get a permit. It all boils down to money. The permit-issuing department does not have the slightest interest in where the peasant is going or what he is going to do. The practice of requiring a peasant to enter "work permit" market before entering the labor market effectively negates the very rationale put forward by government for instituting the work permit system. 3 Some jurisdictions have been trumpeting the advantages of the work permit system as follows. For one thing, they say, by requiring peasants to apply for permission from and register with the government, we get a better knowledge of the peasants who join rural migration. For another, control by examination and approval will decrease the number of peasants who leave town without careful thinking. In fact, both arguments are problematic. First of all, if we are interested in gathering information, we need not go into the business of examination and approval, just report-filing and registration, functions that need not involve a government agency since the village committee or villagers' group can take care of them. Secondly, on what do the examination and permit-issuing agencies base their decision whether or not a peasant is a haphazard rural migrant, thus granting or denying him a work permit as the case may be? You say a particular peasant is a thoughtless rural migrant. The peasant would say otherwise. Mind you, more than anybody else the peasant does not want to be a rural migrant willy-nilly because he is solely responsible for the consequences of such thoughtlessness. Besides, entering the labor market is inherently haphazard to a certain extent. There is no market economy without some measure of haphazardness. The market is haphazard in that it is risky. The vitality of the market mechanism is intrinsically linked to this haphazardness. Haphazardness implies exploration and innovation. The way to avoid any haphazardness is to have the government place you in a job. Since that is not an option, the only thing the peasant can do is to strike out on his own, not without a degree of haphazardness, to look for or create a new job opportunity. We can see that if we proceed to regulate rural migration in accordance with the work permit mentality, the right to enter the labor market will be at the mercy of the subjective assumptions of some government personnel, and the labor market will be malformed. The very act of peasants leaving their villages in search of work crates a labor market in itself. The labor market spontaneously created by peasants is the most dynamic and extensive labor market in China these days. Nationwide between 50 and 60 million rural migrants have found work today, in an overwhelming majority of cases thanks to the market created and opened up by the peasants themselves. China has so many peasants that there is little hope the government can solve the unemployment problem through planned allocation. This innovation on the part of peasants is a historic contribution. Needless to say, there is indeed an oversupply of labor in some areas, leading to certain economic and social contradictions. Be that as it may, we should not attempt to solve problems encountered in the development of the market economy by resorting to traditional managerial methods. In a market economy, the worker is master of his own labor. In realizing its use value through market exchange, the worker should only submit to the test and selection of the market, not that of a government agency. Mandatory prior selection by a government agency is actually a kind of selection that is baseless, or, shall we say, a kind of selection based on the wishes of government officials. To use administrative methods to decide outright who can enter the labor market and who cannot based on the wishes of government officials effectively deprives some workers of their right to enter the market. The resultant labor market is an unjust market, not conducive to bona fide market competition. The work-permit system would only succeed in preventing the formation of a unified open labor market and perhaps leads to corruption by government agencies. To solve the labor oversupply problem in some areas, the government should focus on developing and nurturing a market information system that will provide peasants with information services. First of all, where an individual worker goes is a macroeconomic decision on the labor market. The question can and should be answered by nobody but the worker himself. Only the worker is in a position to answer the question properly. This is because the worker knows his conditions and aspirations best and it is he himself who must ultimately assume responsibility for his decision and bear the full cost of any thoughtlessness on his part. He has the most interest in securing the best employment opportunity with the least cost. More than anybody else, therefore, he is a cautious decisionmaker. Second, regionally speaking the labor supply-demand situation is a macroeconomic issue on the labor market. Workers themselves are powerless to influence the situation. Even more important is government participation. The market system is huge, intricate, and ever-changing. Individual decision-making must be based on a certain amount of information. It is precisely government's role in a market economy to do the things that the market cannot or cannot do well. Now the foremost thing that rural migrants cannot do or cannot do well is information. Clearly it would be putting the cart before the horse if the government does not do what the workers themselves cannot do or cannot do well while getting involved in things the workers can do or can do well. Instead of doing information work, the government goes into the business of examination and approval and permit-issuing ostensibly to reduce haphazardness but actually making the haphazardness worse. Faced with the critical and practical issue of the inter-regional migration of rural workers, therefore, what the government should do is to provide information services. Specifically, this means the government capitalizing on its ability to regulate and control the entire economy, utilizing the modern mass media, and using comprehensive government and nongovernment organizations, even organizing special social forces, to monitor market movements, analyze market trends, and supply market information, thus providing favorable circumstances for decision-making by workers. Armed with more timely information, workers can make decisions on their own and worker migration will naturally become less haphazard. Note that government information work cannot be interpreted simplistically to mean the market disseminating information through government or peasants obtaining market information from government. Market activities per se are information activities. The market is disseminating information even as it operates. What the government should do is to create the conditions for the highly effective dissemination of market information, on the one hand, and directly gather and disseminate market information, on the other. 4 Rural migration has directly led to three major social problems: overburdening the railway system, losing control on family planning, and rising crime. Certainly we need to face up to these problems, but they must not become the rationale for resorting to administrative tools to limit rural migration. To ease the burden on the railroad system, we need to expand the system's carrying capacity to meet the transportation needs of a growing economy as a whole, not just rural migration. In the short haul, transport capacity will continue to fall behind the demand for transportation, so we need to impose suitable restrictions to relieve the pressure on the railroads. But such restrictions must be comprehensive instead of targeting the peasants alone. Everybody is free to use the huge transportation system... tourists, people who travel on business or to attend meetings. Only peasants on the move in search of a livelihood are barred. This does not make sense. Every time the economy picks up steam, the bottleneck effects of the railroads become more pronounced. But people do not point their fingers at an excess of cargo. Yet every time the number of peasants riding trains increases and the volume of passenger traffic exceeds the capacity, peasants get the blame. This too is unjustifiable. Rural migration has complicated population control. What we should do is to look into ways of improving family planning work even more closely, including reforming the present population control policy in conjunction with the reform of the permanent residency registration system. The idea is to make things convenient for peasants as well as controlling population growth. As part of its pregnancy testing program, a local family planning department insisted that an elderly woman in her 70's travel hundreds of li to bring home her daughter-in-law, who was working out of town. Furthermore, the locality publicized this incident as something worthy of emulation. This is blatant peasant harassment. Why couldn't they have been more flexible? Solving this string of problems involves an important ideological issue: Should rural migration be made to suit the management systems and work methods of yesteryear? Or should we reform the latter to accommodate the new reality of rural migration? The same principle applies to law and order. Rural migration is inherent in the development of a market economy. Migration leads to disorder on certain fronts, which we may consider the social cost of reform. The leading candidate for reform is not the peasantry, but the government management system. This too is part of government reform. (Writer's unit: rural section, Center for Development Studies, the State Council)
