Our legislators are busy fighting to retain their seats as deputies for another term, while our civil servants are taking advantage of the absence of controls to do as they please, leaving people to wonder whether they are really as incompetent with respect to the laws of economics as they appear or deliberately bent on utterly destroying the economy. This situation in Ukraine was the subject of our discussion with People's Deputy Viktor Pynzenyk. [Romaniv] Mr. Pynzenyk, what do you think the government's next decision will be? [Pynzenyk] When I was asked this question in Washington, I joked that it would be the nationalization of women. The point I was trying to make was that the present cabinet's actions are absolutely unpredictable. Take, for example, the telegram signed by Acting Deputy Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy and V. Yushchenko, the chairman of the board of directors of the National Bank of Ukraine, prohibiting banks from issuing credits. Imagine for a moment that the banks had actually carried out this directive--in reality, they had enough sense not to comply. Had they stopped issuing credits for even a week, production would have been completely paralyzed owing to a lack of working capital and the fact that it would have been impossible to obtain accounts receivable financing. Would the financial situation have improved as a result? There would have been a new jump in prices, an even greater shortage of goods, and a larger hole in the budget. This is not only the view from Lviv, the view of a professor and theoretician, as I am being called. In a recent speech in parliament, Mr. Melnyk, an industrialist who is the director of the Novomoskovsk pipe plant, described the government's actions as contributing to the collapse of the economy. But then every director and every worker will tell you the same thing. [Romaniv] Do you intend to return to the government? [Pynzenyk] Only if it works as a team. I have personal experience working in an ill-assorted cabinet. I had never imagined politics to be such a dirty business. I think that one of the government's problems is its poor relations with the deputies. Most deputies do not read the drafts of decisions; if these acts were explained to the deputies, they could be counted on to support them. Many matters in the Supreme Council are decided in the smoking room, but one has to be present there. Government officials need to come more often to the delegations and the parliamentarians to the government officials. Many good decisions were passed while I was a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, but we were not able to supplement them and put in place the necessary mechanisms. As a result, some decrees proved ineffective. [Romaniv] On the other hand, many of the government's other actions succeeded in doing their dirty work--they drove production into a blind alley. Given the authority, what would be the first things you would propose to improve the fundamental laws governing the economy? [Pynzenyk] As you can see, the first not to survive the torture was the financial system--it virtually died. Reviving the state's economic organism requires an infusion of new blood. In economic terms, this means money. But the existing credit policy is not capable of curing the situation. Here is why: the banks offer an interest rate of 300 percent to enterprises and individuals on their deposits and extend loans at 600 percent. But do not rush to condemn them for setting overly high interest rates on credit. To borrow money at this rate, you also have to give the bank a good bribe. Let us do some calculating: I borrowed one billion karbovantsi and bought goods, the price of which increased 65-fold in a year. Thus, without doing anything, I have 65 billion karbovantsi. I repay the bank 7 billion officially (the one billion I borrowed and six billion in interest) and of the remaining profit of 58 billion, I give the bank something unofficially, either because we had a gentleman's agreement to that effect, or because I understand that business has to stay on good terms with such a wealthy outfit. Given this situation, why spend money investing in production when one can prosper engaging in such middleman operations? Thus, the cheaper the price of credit from the National Bank, the greater the profits that sit in commercial banks and the faster the pace at which the business of speculation grows fat. What do we need to do to make such middleman operations less profitable? The interest rate on such credit must be the same as the rate of inflation. This will make it unprofitable for me to hold on to goods, because I will have to give back everything I make selling them in interest to the bank. This will also solve the financial problem, because funds will be saved and invested in the production sector. I would also recommend that credits be issued mainly through auctions. And only when secured by property. The flaw in the command-sectorial allocation of finances is best described by the army expression that any curved line is shorter than the straight line leading past a superior. You know, when I was demonstratively resigning from the government, one official said to me in a conciliatory fashion: "If you want, we'll divide up the currency together." That is not what I want. Because whenever the dividing up is being done by a civil servant, something always sticks to his hands. There is always someone who must be accomodated first, always someone who wants much more and is prepared to split a portion of what he gets. Currency should be divided up by those who can afford to buy it. But the market system of advancing credit will produce no results without free prices. There is no need to fear liberalizing them when credit flows are restricted. Why are people opposed to the liberalization of prices? Because they do not understand what this means. The prices of goods are rising because the flow of freshly printed money is not restricted in any way. Last year, for example, the money supply increased severalfold. When the printing of money is restricted, expenditures are also placed under control and prices stabilize as a result. If prices do not cover costs, bankruptcy ensues. This financial insolvency makes it necessary to change owners. This brings us to privatization. This should be started--by force, if necessary. But as part of a package involving the destatization of the distribution of circulation and trade. This is especially important in the current conditions of hyperinflation. After all, the revaluations of goods are not producing the expected results, because large sums of money are moving from state to private pockets. A seller, knowing that the price of cigarettes will double tomorrow, will pay for them today and sell them tomorrow, pocketing the difference. As long as there are two pockets--one belonging to the state and the other to private individuals--trade will remain in disarray. Such machinations make no sense in a private store. These are the problems on which I would like to work in parliament--I plan to run again in the coming election--as well as in the government, if it is a reformist and market-oriented government.
