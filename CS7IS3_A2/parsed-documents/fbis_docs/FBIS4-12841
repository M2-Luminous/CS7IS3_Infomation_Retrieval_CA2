Abd-al-Karim 'Abbas and Bashir Qadim, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Iraqi Parliament, are expected to present a summary of the impact of the sanctions against their country and argue that Baghdad has satisfactorily met with all demands of the United Nations Security council, diplomats said. One of the immediate Iraqi requests to be made formally and informally at the Strasbourg meetings is expected to be for an unfreezing of Iraqi assets that remain frozen in some of the European countries. [passage omitted]. At the outset of the Gulf crisis, Iraqi assets frozen abroad were estimated to be worth around $4 billion. Since then some of the governments have publicly released the funds while others have clandestinely entered agreements with the Iraqi government. Under the agreements, some of the governments agreed that part of the frozen assets be used to pay for Iraqi imports from their countries and part be used as collateral to guarantee Iraqi letters of credit. In the maze of a confusing array of arrangements that the Iraqi government has entered into with many sympathetic Western and Third World governments, the actual amount that remains in the frozen accounts is not known. "I don't think many senior Iraqi officials themselves know what is left and what has been appropriated in their inter-bank arrangements and agreements," said a source closely familiar with Iraqi moves in the international market. The two Iraqi members of Parliament are expected to issue a public appeal for the release of frozen Iraqi assets in the member countries of the European Union (EU) as well as for EU support for Baghdad's call for an end to the international sanctions. A diplomat said Iraq "will have a listening audience particularly from among French members of the European Parliament." The diplomat noted that France has stood out among the five permanent members of the Security Council to argue that Iraq deserved an easing of the crippling sanctions. (passage omitted] Meanwhile, an Italian business delegation is expected here Wednesday after a visit to Baghdad. Diplomatic sources said Iraqi officials who met with the delegation raised the issue of unfreezing Iraqi assets held in Italian banks. Some of the banks have already entered unpublicised arrangements with the Iraqi government, but others are believed to be holding back. The delegation includes businessmen and officials of the Arab-Italian Chamber of Commerce, but the team's trip to Baghdad was not arranged or organised by the Italian governments, the Italian Embassy in Amman said. During their stay in Amman, the delegation members will hold talks with their Jordanian counterparts on issues related to Jordanian-Italian trade.
