There will be further reductions in the personnel of the former Belarusian Military District, which had numbered 250,000 troops at the beginning of the reform process. Supporting such a force was beyond the capabilities of the Republic's budget. In addition, the country's new military doctrine stipulates the forming of a nonnuclear force sufficient to protect the national sovereignty of Belarus. By the end of 1994, troop strength in the Belarusian Army will have fallen to 100,000.
