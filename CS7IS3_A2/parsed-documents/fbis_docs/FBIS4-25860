The party Central Committee and the State Council are attaching great importance to it, and General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have made important speeches to give specific guidance to the conference.

Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on attaching importance to education, respecting knowledge, and respecting trained professionals, China has scored marked achievements in educational work. Leaders at all levels should follow the teaching of Comrade Xiaoping and grasp education as if they were doing economic work. Zhu Rongji said: The current economic situation in China is good. After the introduction of several major reform measures, such as the financial and tax reform and the banking reform, this year, the basic framework for a socialist market economic structure has taken shape in China, and work in this respect is progressing smoothly. Along with the development of the economy, we will certainly be able to advance China's education to a new level through this conference and under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. The afternoon the conference was presided over by Vice Premier Li Lanqing.
