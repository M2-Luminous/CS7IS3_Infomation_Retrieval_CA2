FBIS3-35439 "drnes037_s_94016" FBIS-NES-94-037 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Feb 1994 Iran * Nabavi Editorials on Aspects of New Budget 94LA0074A Tehran RESALAT in Persian 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24 Jan 94 94LA0074A Tehran RESALAT Language: Persian Article Type:CSO [By Seyyed Morteza Nabavi] [18 Jan pp 1, 3] [Text] Oil Revenues in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] and Foreign Debts [Part 1] The general revenues of the country for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], projected at 33,767 billion rials[Rls], indicate an increase of 42.5 percent compared to the general revenues for this year. Considering the substantial decrease in the price of oil and the inability to achieve the anticipated revenues this year, no clear, hopeful prospects exist regarding oil next year. The disagreement of the members of OPEC regarding the reduction in the production ceiling, the increase in North Sea oil production, the decrease in the cost of oil excavation by non-OPEC countries, and the probability of the entry of Iraq into the world market indicate an uncertain future in terms of the price of oil. In the United States, it has been projected that if small oil companies suffer losses due to the decrease in the price of oil, they should somehow receive subsidies. Also, the non-OPEC oil-producing countries do not need to raise the price of oil, as they apparently make more of a profit at low prices. In addition, the oppressive powers will likely force Saudi Arabia to increase production in order to keep prices down. In the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] proposed budget, the government has projected oil revenues at $12.45 billion, which for the above reasons seems unrealistic. This figure has been reduced to $9,444,000,000 in the joint meeting of the Economic and Finance and Planning and Budget Committees and to $10.5 billion in the joint meeting of the Petroleum Affairs and Planning and Budget Committees. The figure of $10.5 billion arrived at in the Petroleum Affairs and Planning and Budget Committees is based on the premise that OPEC will lower its production ceiling, and from this perspective the export of 2.1 million barrels per day has been calculated at $13 per barrel. Certainly, if the OPEC members come to this agreement, that is, to reduce the production ceiling, and act on it, the above-mentioned price will materialize. But, as was pointed out, this is doubtful. Such a determination does not exist at the present time, and other OPEC members do not support it. The projection of the joint meeting of the Economic and Finance and Planning and Budget Committees seems closer to reality. Based on a projected oil-demand model, which is dependent on growth in the industrial countries, the price of oil and the price of one fuel, such as coal, have been considered. With the anticipated growth of 1 percent in industrial countries, the OPEC base price next year is figured at $11. Given this figure, the price of Iranian oil on the average will be $2 less than this amount, and even $9,444,000,000 might not materialize. If the world oil market improves next year, steps can be taken to repay the deferred debts. Also, if in the first six months of 1373 [21 March-22 September 1994] oil revenues go beyond projections, the projects can be prioritized and the next projects implemented as well. New projects must not be started on the basis of the above revenues, because they will not achieve results on time. This year, there were $19.5 billion in outstanding debts, of which in the first nine months of this year about $6 billion were paid, about $3 billion have been credited, and we have about $8 billion in late payments. Considering that the late payments will reach $10 billion by the end of this year, it would seem that if the oil revenues are achieved, the repayment of these debts will be given priority. While there is no clear program for the repayment of debts, it cannot be determined what amount of the foreign currency that is gained can be converted into rials and deposited in the government treasury. The schedule of payment of foreign debts is the first and foremost issue that must be clarified before any decision concerning the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget is made. Next year, about $6 billion in debts will be due. The situation of the payment of these debts must be clarified. Because of the delay in the payment of debts, the country's foreign trade now faces problems, which must be resolved. At present, due to the lack of cooperation of foreign companies and banking networks, goods are purchased at a 20-30 percent higher rate. Government insurance has also stopped. If the situation with regard to the schedule of debt payments is not clarified, even on the minimum oil revenue accounts cannot be opened. Clarification must be made for next year concerning the amount of oil revenues that must be spent on making the late payments and outstanding obligations, what amount will be spent on set purchases, and what amount of foreign currency will be made available to the Central Bank with which to manage the market. If next year, like this year, we face problems with regard to creating new commitments, certainly these limited dollars cannot be converted into rials. The 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget law projected $13 billion in new commitments, whereas in actuality the amount will not be more than $5 billion. In its proposed 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the government has anticipated that $1 billion in oil revenues will be spent on reducing the ceiling of foreign obligations. In other words, out of $12.4 billion, $1 billion will be reduced and the remainder multiplied by Rls1,750 and calculated as part of the budget revenues. How much of the foreign currency can be converted to floating-rate foreign currency is questionable, because some of the installments of the debts are based on 70-Rls and 600-Rls dollars and must be paid from next year's revenues. As some experts believe, in the interests of the country, we must pay our debts as soon as possible, because, considering the recession in the world economy, interest rates are at their lowest level, and as soon as the economy improves, interest rates will rise, in which case, we will be forced to pay high interest on the late payments. [19 Jan pp 1, 16] [Text] Taxes and Tax Revenues in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Part 2 According to this year's budget law, the level of tax revenues is projected at about 5,409 billion rials. However, the likelihood is that, due to the inability to collect "important taxes," this figure will not be achieved. Tax revenues this year are anticipated at Rls440 billion. Considering the creation of a single foreign-currency rate, from the beginning of 1372 [21 March 1993], the rate of tariffs on imported goods was supposed to be amended. Unfortunately, during the first eight months of this year, such an amendment did not take place. In the past, the level of tariffs was on the average 2 percent of the value of imported goods, which is a very low figure. In the past years, in order to prevent price increases on goods and protect consumers, import tariffs were kept at a low level, and consequently domestic production was harmed. Following the initial reform of import tariffs, the Majles based the level of customs taxes and fees at zero but gave permission to the government to amend and implement the rates through commercial taxes. The government also set commercial taxes at an average of 8 percent. But, as was pointed out, in the first eight months of the year, the old tariffs (averaging 2 percent) continued to be imposed. This 8 percent was put into effect for the last four months of this year. The level of 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] tax revenues has been projected by the government at Rls6,400 billion, which seems achievable. But the requirement is that customs taxes and fees increase from the present 8 percent to 18 percent on average. An increase in taxes on imported goods, in addition to being in the interest of domestic products, will result in tax revenues being achieved. Considering the minimum of $7 billion in imports subject to customs tariffs and commercial taxes, it would not be unlikely for tax revenues to be procured from this sector next year. The government was supposed to present a bill to the Majles on the level of customs taxes and fees, in accordance with the authorization given by the Majles to the government. This has not been done yet. Considering that the legal deadline is Tir 1373 [22 June-22 July 1994], hopefully the government will devise the bill on tariffs as quickly as possible in order to enable the Majles to carry out an expert study and ratify it, thus enabling us to collect an average of 18 percent in tariffs on the value of imports from the start of 1373 [21 March 1994]. This is a practical step towards achieving the needed tax revenues. On the other hand, the level of taxes on companies, which was projected at Rls1,443 billion in the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget law, in practice will go beyond the ratification and will reach Rls1,700 billion, which marks a 17.8-percent increase. Hence, in terms of taxes on companies, the figures for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] are practical. The grand leader of the revolution spoke of "observing social justice" and "collecting taxes on the basis of income" as policies governing the Second Plan. These points must be implemented as soon as possible. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, by establishing and equipping a computerized system, is trying to make its information about the tax resources more accurate. At the present time, not all the tax resources are known. For this reason, some social classes are known to carry a heavier tax burden. Some of this problem will be eliminated with the issuance of tax cards on the basis of which actual and legal persons will receive a code. These cards have begun to be issued, and individuals must use them in any transaction. In this way, more precise information on tax sources will be obtained. Hopefully, codes will be given to taxpayers as soon as possible to prepare the grounds for creating an equitable tax system and observing social justice, as Ayatollah Khamene'i emphasized. In this way, tax revenues will increase. It is hoped that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance will make an effort to implement this plan as soon as possible on a widespread basis in order to ensure that persons with higher incomes pay more taxes. One of the problems with tax laws is excessive exemptions. According to an expert study, "50 percent of the [potential] tax sources are exempt from the payment of taxes." As a result, the tax burden is imposed on the remaining 50 percent. The issue is not that tax exemptions should be eliminated altogether, but that in some cases it is necessary. However, any kind of exemption must be determined on the basis of accurate, expert calculations. Exemptions must not cause an excessive burden to be imposed on one group of actual and legal persons. At the present, large government and public companies, foundations, and banks, some of which have major incomes, are exempt from the payment of taxes. The treatment of these companies must be revised. This action, on the one hand, will clarify the tax sources and enter them into the government treasury and, on the other, prevent harm to production. Government and public companies, organizations, establishments, foundations, and banks must deposit their taxes in the Treasury, and if there is need for assistance from a specific source, this amount must be returned to them at the required level. Because the above-mentioned units do not pay taxes, similar units in the nongovernmental and nonpublic sectors, which are required to pay taxes, are unable to compete with them. In addition to reducing costs in certain units compared to others (discrimination in protection), this situation eliminates sound competition. For this reason, in many areas with active government and government-affiliated companies and public establishments, essentially there is no inclination for people to engage in investment and production. Also, some banks, in order to avoid the payment of taxes, have moved towards buying buildings. Hence, the suggestion has been made that tax revenues be distributed justly, a new dynamism be created in production, and tax exemptions be revised. According to an expert estimate, the "GDP" [gross domestic product] ratio in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] is 22 percent, and if half of the taxpayers are exempt from tax payments, the result will be that tax pressure at a level of 44 percent will be placed on the other half. The examination of the budget bill this year will undergo two rounds of discussion, and in the first round of discussions, only the revenues will be examined. Most committees have new tax and fee suggestions for securing revenue resources, some of which are reasonable and some unreasonable. On the whole, this examination will be followed by an increase in the price of goods and services. For example, in order to improve cultural issues regarding education or health and treatment, which are very important, the collection of taxes within the framework of the Constitution may be desirable. But putting taxes on everything is certainly problematic. Will consumers agree to the increase in the price of gasoline from Rls50 to Rls120 per liter so that, for instance, the Bandar 'Abbas Refinery can be activated more quickly? Certain issues will be addressed in the following sections of this article in addition to a discussion of Note 25 of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill. [20 Jan pp 1, 16] [Text] Increase in the Price of Kerosene, Gasoline, and Other Oil Products Part 3 One of the most important characteristics of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill is Note 25. According to this note, if ratified by the Majles, the price of certain government goods and services will increase. The prices of kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, electricity, post, and telephone are among the goods and services, which will see increased prices. At present, the price of gasoline, which in Iran is 50 rials per liter, is Rls200 in Kuwait, Rls270 in the United Arab Emirates (Dubai), Rls1,090 in Turkey, and Rls260 in Qatar. Also, the prices per liter of kerosene are Rls200 in Kuwait, Rls980 in Turkey, and Rls43 in Dubai, all of which are significantly higher than the Rls15 RLS charged in Iran.[.sup]1.[/] The low rate of oil products in Iran has resulted, on the one hand, in the extraordinary growth in consumption of these products and, on the other, the smuggling of these goods into countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, Turkey, and Pakistan. The consumption of kerosene in Iran, with a population of about 60 million people, is equivalent to its consumption in China, with a population of 1.1 billion people. The level of fuel consumption in Iran at the present is $10 billion worth annually. Some experts believe that if the present trend of growth in the consumption of oil products continues, in a period of less than 10 years, all domestically produced oil will be consumed. Based on this reasoning, the government has proposed in Note 25 that the prices per liter of gasoline increase from 50 to Rls120, kerosene and airplane fuel from 15 to Rls30, diesel fuel from 10 to Rls20, and heating oil from 8 to Rls10, and the price of natural gas increase from 10.7 to Rls12.4 per cubic meter. According to this proposal, the difference between the above prices will be collected as taxes on the sale of oil products and spent on investments. But the decision on whether the collected taxes will be spent on investment in oil affairs or other areas has been left for the second round of discussions in the Majles. At the same time, the Ministry of Petroleum, on the basis of Rls1,600 per dollar, has estimated the costs per liter of kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil without calculating the transportation costs of Rls294, Rls275, Rls263, and Rls134, respectively. The amounts to be collected as taxes on oil products in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], based on the suggestion of the government, will be mainly invested in refining and transportation, according to the ratification of the Majles. The government has projected that 89 percent of investments will be in refining programs, 72.4 percent in transportation, and 7.3 percent production of oil products, through the imposition of the taxes in Note 25 [percentages as published]. The creation of the Arak and Bandar 'Abbas refineries; the building of platforms in the Caspian Sea; the building of fuel stations; the reconstruction and construction of Naftshahr; the building of pipelines; and the development of the Sarakhs natural gas fields, the Oil Industry University, Kangan Natural Gas, and several other projects are among those projects, of which the implementation has been suggested to the Majles by the government from the funds obtained from taxes. Even though the government has the authority and is able to make a decision in the Economic Council concerning the increase in the price of oil products, due to the social and economic pressures regarding the above-mentioned taxes, it has sent its proposals to the Majles. This is a commendable action worthy of gratitude. This year, as well, the government intended to increase the price per liter of gasoline to Rls80 through the Economic Council; however, due to the reaction of the Majles, no decision was made in this regard. Offering the proposals in the form of the budget will familiarize the Majles deputies more tangibly with the realities. Some deputies, on the one hand, expect the plans and projects to expand rapidly and, on the other hand, expect oil products to be offered to the people at a low rate. In making decisions, these two views are contradictory. If the deputies oppose the increase in prices, they must accept the fact that the speed of growth and development will decrease, and progress will be slower. Thus, pressuring the executive officials to implement the projects in their constituent regions is unreasonable. If the Majles is willing to accept an increase in prices at the intended level, it should also be accountable for its consequences. What facilitates decision making concerning oil products is the calculation of the effects of price increases, especially in regards to fuel. Majles deputies have asked the experts of the government, the Plan and Budget Organization, and the Central Bank to calculate and predict the effects of these increases on other goods and services in order to see whether or not the people can tolerate the inflationary pressures resulting from these increases. Undoubtedly, with the increase in the price of fuel, the cost of transportation will increase, and with the increase in cargo and passenger fares, many goods and services will be affected. The Majles welcomes expert plans by both government organizations and independent experts. These plans must firstly generate conservation with regard to the consumption of oil products. Second, they must prevent pressures being applied to the downtrodden and low-income classes. Third, they should not have unpleasant political, social, and economic effects. And, fourth, no subsidies must be given to the high-income strata. To subsidize the low-income and deprived classes, in selling natural gas, rates should be based on a sliding scale, and natural gas meters should be used to ensure that the low-income classes and those with low consumption do not face problems. This can force consumers to conserve. In order to subsidize kerosene, gasoline, and other products, to return to a coupon system, given its ill effects, is not proper. Therefore, a cash subsidy can be put into effect, provided identification is carefully handled and precise information on the income and occupation of individuals is available. In cities and villages, the public transportation system can be subsidized and prices increased in other areas. But in cities such as Tehran, where public transportation is insufficient and personal vehicles play a significant role, another solution must be found for the payment of subsidies. Otherwise, the above-mentioned factors will escalate the inflationary effects of the increase in the price of gasoline. Considering that high-income and well-to-do families consume more fuel, naturally they benefit more from general subsidies, and this is contrary to social justice. On the other hand, the elimination of general subsidies may also create unpleasant effects for the vulnerable classes. In this regard, it is necessary to make careful calculations before appropriate decisions can be made. Of course, to impose conservation in energy use, in addition to price increases, there are other methods that can be implemented. The development and dissemination of technical knowledge and the spread of a culture of conservation are among them. God willing, the discussion on Note 25 concerning the increase in the price of services, electricity, post, and telephone in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget will be continued in the next issue. Footnote [.sup]1.[/] Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar are all oil-producing countries and southern neighbors of Iran. Turkey also, as a neighboring nonoil country, has been used as evidence. If the price of oil products is compared to that of industrial countries, there is more of a gap. At the present time, a liter of gasoline is Rls1,591 in Germany, Rls571 in the United States, Rls1,528 in France, and Rls2,008 in Japan, and the price per liter of kerosene is Rls1,007 in Japan and Rls330 in the United States. The price per liter of diesel fuel is Rls1,190 in Germany, Rls297 in the United States, Rls1,067 in France, and Rls1,328 in Japan. The price per liter of heating fuel is Rls448 in Turkey, Rls171 in the United States, Rls242 in Germany, Rls313 in France, Rls497 in Japan, and Rls5 in Iran. It is noteworthy that these prices are based on the rate of Rls1,600 to the dollar. [22 Jan pp 1, 20] [Text] The Increase in the Price of Electricity, Telephone Communication, and Postal Services in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Part 4 In the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the government has proposed an increase in the average per kwh [kilowatt hour] price of electricity from 17 rials to Rls33.5. Since there is a relatively clear picture available of the various uses of electricity, making a decision in this regard is simpler than that concerning oil products. At the present time, 38 percent of all electricity consumption is domestic, 32 percent industrial, 18 percent public use (including schools, universities, offices, mosques, barracks, pharmacies, etc.), and 12 percent for other uses (commercial, agricultural, and mobile). Suitable policies can be devised appropriate to each of these. The electricity industry requires heavy investment. If we want to avoid blackouts, there is no other way but investment. If investments are calculated at the day's prices, for the production of every kwh of electricity (based on 4.4 cents in foreign currency use at the market rate and Rls10 in rial costs), Rls100 are necessary. Of course, at the present, the cost of electricity, due to the low-rate foreign currency received, is about Rls10. If fuel is calculated on the basis of present prices and the remaining production factors on the basis of the floating rate, the cost of every kwh of electricity will be reduced to Rls50. The level of electricity consumption at the present is uncontrolled, and the revenues of the country are insufficient for investment in this industry. In order to prevent blackouts and conserve electricity, the rates must necessarily be modified. Implementing a sliding rate in such a way that no pressure is placed on the lower classes and presenting a correct model to the consumer can solve problems. In this case, those clients who reduce consumption will face lower rates. The level of usual and reasonable consumption for a family is 250 kwh. This group of consumers, mostly deprived and low-income individuals, can be given cost discounts and pay at the present prices. (Of course, the minimum is different in regards to warm-climate regions that use natural gas air conditioning.) Families that use between 250 kwh and 500 kwh of electricity should pay half the cost (Rls50 per kwh). In addition, families that use 500 kwh and above should pay the total cost (based on Rls50 per kwh). With these measures, 38 percent of electricity consumption will be controlled. To conserve industrial use, which makes up 32 percent of the total consumption, at the peak hours (maximum use), such as early evening, the price of electricity can be increased in order to allow industrial units to regulate their work shifts so as not to put pressure on the national network. One of the existing problems at the present is that electricity production must increase a great deal in order to cover service for peak hours. If steps such as those mentioned are taken, there will be less need for large investment expenditures. A point that must be noted in connection with industry is that the level of electricity consumption, with some exceptions, such as aluminum production, does not effect the cost of industrial production very much. The highest level of electricity consumption is in aluminum production, which uses Rls750 worth of electricity per kg of aluminum production. The repair of factories can be done in summer, because the consumption load is very high in the summer months. Most factories make repairs once a year, during which time the consumption load is reduced. The level of demand can also be used in industry. That is, as consumer demand goes beyond a certain level, it should be followed by an increase in the price of electricity. Also, incentives should be implemented to reduce consumption in the production units, such that if a factory can do its work with 60 kwh of electricity, it will not increase it to 70 kwh. Public uses, such as schools, mosques, and pharmacies, can be exempt from price increases, and others, such as offices and barracks that have the most waste in public consumption, must be required to pay the costs. Unfortunately, the lights of some government offices are turned on during the daytime, and modifying the price can encourage conservation. In connection with commercial units, as well, the implementation of a progressive rate policy can change the consumption model from high-use to low-use lamps. In the area of agriculture, considering its essential nature, there should be no price increases, in order to encourage these activities. In any case, in connection with electricity, various scenarios exist, the best of which can be chosen and implemented in such a way that, in addition to creating conservation, pressure on deprived classes will be prevented and reasonable development will follow. The average price of a postal parcel is Rls65 at the present. With Rls35 in taxes for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], as proposed by the government and if ratified by the Majles, it will be Rls100. One of the problems with this proposal is that the rates are not divided according to urban, intercity, and foreign parcels. Even though the Postal Company, considering its present revenues, faces problems, the point should be taken into consideration that the least expensive method of communication throughout the world is the postal service. It is not clear why the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone monopolizes postal services and does not allow the people to establish parallel postal units (of course, under the supervision of this ministry). This can give people choices and create competition. Private and nongovernmental companies may be able to offer postal services at lower rates. The Constitution does not prohibit the government from issuing permits to the people to engage in postal activities while supervising them. One of the claims that has prevented people from taking charge of postal services is that "private companies charge excessively." The response is that people have a choice, and if this occurs, they will not use such companies. The increase in price of every pulse [words illegible] from Rls12 to Rls20 on the average in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] is another government proposal to the Majles. In other words, for every pulse, Rls8 in taxes will be added. [sentence as published] In many countries in the world, no money is collected to receive a telephone line, and fees are collected from clients based on the level of calls. However, in Iran, not only are Rls600,000 to Rls1 million collected for every telephone line received, but charges are also made in terms of the rate of pulse. [sentence as published] Any new change in this connection will depend on determining the actual cost of a telephone line. The Communication Management Organization of the Plan and Budget Organization has estimated the establishment of every telephone line on the basis of $600 foreign currency costs and 148,000-toman rial use at 270,000 tomans, whereas another estimate, based on Rls$521 in foreign currency expenditures and 30,000 tomans in rial expenditures, determines the cost of every telephone line to be 134,200 tomans. The prices of the Plan and Budget Organization seem less accurate. For this reason, investment on the basis of Rls20 RLS per pulse seems high. [sentence as published] The last point that can be discussed in connection with Note 25 of the budget law is that if in its first round of discussions the Majles ratifies the taxes on oil products, electricity, communications, and post, the answer to the question of whether the above-mentioned amounts, based on government proposals, will be placed at the disposal of the Ministries of Petroleum; Energy; and Post, Telephone and Telegraph for investment or whether another area will be suggested for their use will come in the second round of discussions in the Majles. In any case, the issue depends on the Majles deputies' determination to more carefully examine the areas for investment from the above-mentioned taxes in the second round of discussions. [23 Jan pp 1, 16] [Text] Government Companies and Banking Funds Part 5 The budget of government companies and the level of funds granted to them are issues that will be dealt with today, as the discussions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget continue. According to the proposed bill, next year, out of about Rls79,687 billion in the national budget, the government will allocate Rls50,023 billion to government companies, Rls5,216 billion to banks, and Rls1,043 billion to for-profit establishments affiliated with the government. In other words, the government has proposed to the Majles that in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], more than 70.3 percent of the national budget be allocated to government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with the government. Unfortunately, the outcome of billions of rials in government investments in government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with the government is only Rls1,296 billion in profits, taxes, etc., for the government. These units continue to fail to show a desirable return and efficiency, and the losses projected for them amount to Rls4,032 billion.[.sup]1.[/] Essentially, why must 34,000 discovered violations occur in government companies every year?[.sup]2.[/] Lack of care and sufficient supervision of the Majles over the budget of government companies in the past years has created such a situation. Essentially, the examination of the budget of these companies was conferred on their general assembly, which is comprised of a few ministers. In accordance with Article 53 of the Constitution,[.sup]3.[/] the budget of these companies was presented to the Majles a few years ago. Supervision over the budgets of government companies was more carefully accounted for in the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget law, but because there was insufficient time in this regard, the government was obliged to carry over the budget of government companies to Khordad 1372 [22 May-21 Jun 1993] and receive permission to spend based on the ratified budget through Shahrivar [23 August-22 September]. Unfortunately, the government did not present the report on the budget of these companies on time to the Majles. Another point in connection with the budget of government companies is their number. Some believe that instead of fewer than 500 units reflected in the bill, the number of these companies exceeds 1,000 or 1,500 units. Based on permission received earlier in their charters, these companies were permitted to establish subsidiary companies, which they did. But, unfortunately, the accounts of the subsidiary companies are not reflected anywhere. In addition, no reference is made in the budget laws to the names of all the companies in which the government has shares. Such problems have resulted in a large volume of the Muslim Treasury in the government units not being supervised by the Majles. Even the Auditing Organization and the Accounting Office have no supervision over these units. Government companies sometimes allow expenditures that are inappropriate to the initial goals of their establishment. The waste and extravagance of these companies require separate detailed discussion, and we will not give examples at this time. The vehicles and other equipment that these companies donate to the related ministries are examples of such extravagance. Some government companies show little profit. Some are exempt from taxes. It is not clear what amount of their reserve is spent on investment or used to eliminate their cash needs. In any case, an examination of government and government-affiliated companies is important from various dimensions. Many of these units can be transferred to the people, and thus both reduce the burden of the government and make their activities "economical." In the past, if government companies intended to make investments, the government would allocate certain amounts in the general budget for the development of these investments. Following the increase in the volume of government expenditures in the past few years, meeting the investment needs of the government companies has been shifted towards the use of banking funds. The funds that the government invests in government companies or the funds that these companies receive must somehow be paid. This has not occurred in many of these companies, and the remainder of the debts of the companies to the banks and the Central Bank are increasing regularly. Government companies will receive Rls7,314 billion in loans in accordance with the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill and in exchange will pay Rls2,949 billion of the loans received in the past years. As a result, in terms of next year's budget, Rls4,365 billion will be added to the government debt to the banking system. If the investment of government companies through the use of banking funds is economically justified, there is no argument, because these funds will be repaid within a reasonable period of time. But, unfortunately, this issue is postponed to the following year's budget, and ultimately, the repayment is placed on the shoulders of the government itself. What has become common in the budget bills is that through the budget, the Central Bank and other banks are obliged to place funds at the disposal of these companies, which is sometimes against the monetary policies. The 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] bill anticipates 12 notes for this purpose.[.sup]4.[/] For example, Note 17 obliges the Central Bank to allocate 100 billion RLS in funds to build a student dormitory, which is by no means economically justified, because when this dormitory is built, it will provide no income to help repay the debt. In fact, this is the kind of budget deficit, which has been transferred to the banking system. Certainly, no one opposes the building of a student dormitory; but this is a matter to which the government must allocate funds from the general budget. The result of such a decision is that it would make the banks economically unsound. The banks must be allowed to work economically if monitoring is to be precise.

Also, the emphasis was made that the obligation of the government to repay some of the funds that cannot be repaid to the banks and the Central Bank is, in fact, a sort of budget deficit, which has been transferred to the banking network. This issue will focus on the level of funds received in government companies and private units and their role in cash flow and inflation. Unfortunately, a great gap also exists at the level of granting funds to people and government sectors. In the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the government has obliged banks to pay Rls7,598 billion in funds to government and private organizations. Of this amount, Rls6,033 billion are allocated to government and government-affiliated units and Rls1,565 billion to the private sector. Among the government organizations, a large share of these resources will be placed at the disposal of oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, subways, steel, airlines, and sugar cane projects.[.sup]1.[/] Next year, if the banks are obliged to pay the funds at the above-mentioned level and the private sector also receives funds at the level of this year, the increased cash flow will exceed 25 percent,[.sup]2.[/], which is inappropriate with the average of 11.7 percent determined in the Second Developmental Plan of the government. Since the rate of inflation growth has advanced in step with the cash flow, inflation also can increase at the same ratio next year. This is while there is no budget deficit. Otherwise, the cash flow will grow more. The dear Majles deputies must note that increased cash flow escalates inflation and high prices, unless the ceiling of obligatory funds of the banks and the Central Bank is revised. Through the control of funds, inflation can be harnessed. Considering the limitation on general revenues, it is necessary to decrease the speed of the increase in cash flow in order to prevent the imposition of problematic inflation which mainly targets the deprived strata and low-income classes. As much as possible, the payment of funds for investments with no economic justification, and of which the repayment by government companies is impossible, must be avoided. This step is considered a kind of budget deficit and causes inflation. The most important point in connection with the banking network is that the structure of its organization must be reformed and revised. At present, the rate of administrative, organizational, and advertising expenditures of banks is high. Also, the banking network demands a great deal in terms of profit and service charges from loan applicants. These issues must be reviewed. At the present, the banks transfer many expenditures to loan recipients, including those for advertising, employment, the opening of new branches, expensive decorations, and the construction and purchasing of numerous buildings. The cost of money (equipping of resources) in the banks is higher than it should be, and the people are paying for it. One of the criticisms of the administration of banks is the composition of the Monetary and Credit Council, a significant number of the members of which are representatives of the ministries that use the funds. To reform the monetary system, the composition of the Monetary and Credit Council must change and mainly be composed of a headquarters, economic officials, and economic experts and not the consumers of the funds. In addition, in order to reform the system of economic decision making, the composition of the Economic Council must also change, because in this council, the consumer organizations make up the majority and promote the uneconomical decisions of the Economic Council. One criticism, which is true of the work of the banks, is that they have become company owners and entered directly into the administration of companies. Companies that have not been economically sound, which rely on the support of the banking network and suffer significantly from extravagance, must be transferred to the people and become profitable as quickly as possible. Direct investments amounting to 50 percent of the shares must also be transferred to the people. As monopoly is harmful in many economic activities, the banks must keep monopolies within the framework of Islamic laws and the Constitution. Nonbanking credit establishments must be allowed to engage in activities to provide the grounds for sound competition. With this action, government banks that at the present time consider themselves nongovernmental and public will no longer be able to impose any cost on the users of funds. Footnotes [.sup]1.[/] The level of loans to be received by some of the companies from the banking system in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] is as follows: National Oil Company, Rls1,643 billion; Falat-e Qarreh, Rls130 billion; National Oil Products Distribution Company, about Rls166 billion; National Natural Gas Company, Rls226 billion; Iranian Electrical Power Production and Transmission Company, Rls427 billion; National Iranian Steel Company, Rls280 billion; Steel Mill, Rls100 billion; Mobarakeh Steel, Rls120 billion; National Petrochemical Industries Company, Rls1,062 billion; Islamic Republic Airlines, Rls150 billion; the Iranian National Steel Industries Group, Rls100 billion; Metro Company, Rls100 billion; and Sugar Cane Development and Subsidiary Industries Company, Rls500 billion. [.sup]2.[/] Next year, from the notes of the budget alone, 16 percent will be added to the cash flow.
