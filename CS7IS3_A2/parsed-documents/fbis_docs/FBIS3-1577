However, following the mainland authorities' intervention, nearly 200 people who had taken part in the democratic movement in 1989 and who received invitations could not attend his birthday party. They were replaced by Wang Dan's former schoolmates, relatives, and family members who had nothing to do with the 4 June Incident. If this gathering had been realized, it was believed it would have been the largest meeting of democratic activists who have been banned by the Beijing authorities since the 4 June Incident. A democratic activist who was invited to Wang Dan's birthday party said: The authorities attached great importance to the "mass gathering of democratic activists" for fear that Wang Dan's birthday party would develop into a political rally. Departments concerned interrogated Wang Dan after learning that heavy-weight democracy activists who had been arrested by the CPC in the 4 June Incident -- such as Zhou Duo, Liu Xiaobo, and Bao Zunxin -- were included in the list of nearly 200 guests to whom invitations had been sent, as well as other people involved in the democratic movement in 1989. A friend of Wang Dan said: The day before yesterday, CPC departments concerned talked to Wang Dan for a whole day to try to persuade him to reset the guest list for his birthday party, otherwise Wang Dan would bear all the consequences. However, Wang Dan said the party was a form of celebrating his birthday, and as a citizen, he was entitled to make any choice. During the one-day talk, the departments concerned stressed that the mere gathering of these people was politically tinted and that he could not but acknowledge this fact. They told Wang Dan: You now have only two choices. The first is to change the list of your birthday party guests; none of the people involved in the 4 June Incident may attend. The second choice is to cancel the birthday party, and everything must be handled in a low-key manner. At last, Wang Dan said that he was willing to cancel the invitations to nearly 100 "sensitive figures." Instead, he celebrated his 24th birthday with about 30 former schoolmates, relatives, and good friends. It was understood that Wang Dan was very careful in setting the invitation list. For example, Wei Jingsheng, the democratic fighter who was released not long ago, and a number of even more sensitive figures were not included on the list. A Beijing scholar said: It is no surprise that the CPC has taken this move, and Wang Dan should have been psychologically prepared for it right from the beginning. For the CPC, this is the eve of the opening of the plenary sessions of the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese Political People's Consultative Conference, and so foreign reporters -- particularly those from Hong Kong and Macao -- have arrived in Beijing one after another. If this party had not been stopped promptly, similar gatherings might have been many times, and then the authorities might find them more difficult to control. Hence, this incident also helps test the extent to which the CPC can put up with democratic activists. Wang Dan's birthday party was held in a restaurant on the opposite side of Hotel (Merdia) in the western suburb of Beijing.
