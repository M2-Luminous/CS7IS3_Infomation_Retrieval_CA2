It was organized by the Russian Federation Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy, the relevant Federation Council committee, and the Novosibirsk Oblast Administration. None of the country's regions can get out of the economic crisis on their own today, but the immutable condition for getting the country out of the crisis lies precisely in a flexible and differentiated regional policy. In his report on the basic avenues of the state's regional policy, Nationalities Affairs Minister Sergey Shakhray spoke of the need to strengthen the state's regulating role in leading the country out of the crisis, backing federalism in conjunction with the development of local self-government. Developing this thesis, the minister said that a more clear-cut, strict and differentiated regional policy is needed today, geared to solving social problems, as well as economic and other problems connected with them. This concerns, in particular, the need for a certain redistribution of resources in favor of regions which do not have large reserves of natural raw materials, and which have found themselves in the most difficult economic and social position today. Sergey Shakhray also spoke of the fact that Russians have no alternative to economic integration with the CIS states, and that this task is urgent and at the same time requires civilized ways of being solved. An era of the revival of Russia, its statehood, its economy, and the dignity of Russians, and the revival of the country's cultural and national traditions is imminent... Sergey Glazyev, chairman of a State Duma committee [bureau records list Glazyev as head of Duma Economic Policy Committee], gave a report about the basic spheres of economic stabilization in Russia. Academic Valentin Koptyug analyzed the crisis processes in Siberia and possible stabilization models.
