The report suggests there will be an increased demand for services via "intelligent satellites" capable of high-level communication functions as a result of rapid expansion in the use of multimedia and cellular telephones. It recommendsefforts toward developing essential technology under an international cooperative effort between Japan, the United States, and Europe. The report predicts that the early 21st century will witness fixed stations on earth that are linked by high-volume communication optical fiber cable networks, and a much higher level of importance for communication satellites because of a rapid expansion of demand for cellular telephones, personal communication systems and multimedia. It also suggests the need to develop multifunctional satellites capable of handling image transmissions for multimedia and cellular phone services. The report analyzes that the key to development of "intelligent satellites" with such capabilities will involve 1) Technology to operate repeaters at a low voltage; 2) Technology to transmit and process image signals efficiently, and 3) Standardization and mass production of parts. The report also covers the importance of launching many low-orbiting satellites to build a network. The report also stresses the need for international coordination among advanced nations to promote standardization and the effective use of satellites, although that Japan, the United States, and Europe currently are developing next-generation communication satellites independently.
