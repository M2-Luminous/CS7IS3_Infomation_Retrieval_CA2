The stationing of the fleet and the questions connected with its supplies and social benefits for the military personnel are all problems which the Crimean Republic must solve, he announced in Moscow, where he arrived for the signing of an agreement between the Crimean and Russian Governments on trade, economic, and cultural cooperation. Meshkov said that Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's refusal to allow Crimean representatives to have equal representation at the Sevastopol negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet was "inadequate".
