A senior official at the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources said today that several ministries and commissions under the State Council are putting the final touches to plans for experimenting with paid development of mineral resources. According to He Xianjie, deputy director of the ministry's Department of Mineral Resources Management, the ministry will, on behalf of the State Council, exercise overall control over the prospecting, exploitation and utilization of mineral resources. All mineral reserves -- the 160 kinds already found throughout China and those to be discovered -- will be state-owned assets, and developers will have to pay for their use. This includes both government departments and private companies. Prospecting, exploitation and utilization of mineral resources will be opened to bidding. "Whoever offers terms for the lowest input and the best economic and social benefits will be allowed to develop the mineral resources in a specific area," he explained. The plans are meant to "rationalize the use of China's mineral resources, which, relative to the size of the population, are not abundant, and to better protect them from being wasted," the official added. Mineral resources are specified as state-owned in the constitution and laws. "In practice, however, their ownership in a specific area is ambiguous, and this is liable to cause waste and unnecessary losses," he conceded. To add value to mineral resources, he said, the State Council plans to allow the transfer of property rights on state-controlled markets. "After a company gains the right to develop the mineral resources in a given area, it may transfer it to another company on terms agreed upon by the two sides," the official explained. Prospectors will pay rent for the prospecting sites, and the right to develop the mineral reserves will be given to the company which is the first to find them," he said. "These measures are aimed at encouraging market competition," he concluded. To make the development of mineral resources truly market- oriented, the official disclosed, the state is to promulgate a mining law and a law on protecting mineral resources to replace the "law on mineral resources" currently in force.
