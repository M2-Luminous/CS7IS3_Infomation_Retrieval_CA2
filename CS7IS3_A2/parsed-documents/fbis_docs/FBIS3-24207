[Fomicheva] Vladimir Aleksandrovich, you have power today. Quite a lot! You manage the city. What is prompting you to run for the Kray Duma? [Gilgenberg] The law is being flouted here in the presence of all the branches of authority. Everyone has already sensed that it is bad living without deputies. Deputies are a restraining and controlling factor for the executive branch. They compel all the organs to work. [Fomicheva] That is, you are moved only by a desire to help the kray? [Gilgenberg] I decided several years ago that Moscow was not for me, I am a person of my own kray, my own city, [line missing in original] position, after all, it is a new one--city manager. The position has existed for a long time in world practice. And if we are aspiring to a market economy, this kind of position will also exist. It is possible that it has not yet achieved the necessary level with my performance. At the present time, it is necessary to expend a lot of effort on the attacks of the kray administration, which authorized the subordinate organs not to subordinate themselves to the city mayoralty. But in the meantime we received a letter from the Ministry of Justice yesterday which states that the mayoralty is right on all questions. But they frayed our nerves for three months, and inflicted damage on the city in a useless fight. Who will answer for this? [Fomicheva] What is authority to you? [Gilgenberg] I would not want that feeling--of authority. The work is difficult and thankless, but I will work until we get democracy going. [Fomicheva] Here is a question for you from a meticulous reader: Are you planning to go to the FRG? It is said that you agreed to this position because you want the same kind of position in another country. [Gilgenberg] I have relatives in the FRG. They asked me: Are you not insane to remain in Russia at such a time? I answered that I will only go there when everything is fine in Russia, and when it is necessary to help Germany. [Fomicheva] A question from many readers: Why has it become so dirty in the city? [Gilgenberg] It would be strange if it were clean, considering that the kray administration authorized the rayon authorities not to show up for four months at planning meetings and conferences in the mayor's office. So, under conditions of such anarchy, the city became swamped in garbage. But the administration for services and utilities was disbanded back during Yefremov's time. We are now restoring it. Relations with the sanitary inspection service have also become tense. The chief doctor, who did not punish those responsible for the dirty conditions, has compiled a protocol against me as the manager. But about 200 persons work in this system. I recall a case in the former USSR, in the city of Solikamsk: The chief doctor shut down plants with injurious wastes. She was summoned to the party bureau, a scandal broke out, and the whole country came to the defense of the chief doctor, letters were written, telegrams sent. You do not investigate such heroes here. No one is fined, no appeals are made to the mayor's office. There is no sanitary militia. Then at least let the district militia officer look after cleanliness together with the yardmen. I think that it will be said in any house now that, against the background of the fights between the two administrations, the yardmen are practically not working. I think that the residents should come out in spring and tidy up; after all, they also are littering. But I can imagine what the VLADIVOSTOK newspaper will write in this regard: "The mayor's office has acknowledged its impotence and has decided to summon everyone to volunteer weekend work. But, after all, not in one city of the world do residents conduct themselves so unwisely. As if it were not their yard, home, and street. They do not give a damn, they litter, they move on. [Fomicheva] You were the deputy of a kray soviet and enjoyed great authority among your voters. I remember that grateful letters addressed to you were sent to our newspaper. You have experience. What do you think? Will you succeed in leaving the old [illegible word] soviet? [Gilgenberg] A Duma of 40 persons also cannot solve all problems immediately. However, it is not a matter of the number of deputies. At the end of the 1970's I was in the state of Vancouver, where the parliament consisted of 200 persons, but they all wanted the best for their state. We have a different psychology and a habit of constantly living in a fight with one another. Beginning with the Pioneers, remember: "In the struggle for the cause, be prepared!" Now, everything depends on the voters. If they in all seriousness elect worthy people, the Duma will be able to change the situation. [Fomicheva] Did you easily collect the signatures for your registration as a candidate? [Gilgenberg] Yes. [Fomicheva] But how did you collect them? [Gilgenberg] I do not know, my supporters did this in the microrayons. [Fomicheva] Did you use your official position? We have a lot of letters that talk about such cases in other cities. [Gilgenberg] In no way! [Fomicheva] A commission headed by Nelli Yakimenko from the human rights committee came to Vladivostok to look into the dispute of the two administrations. Did you meet with it? [Gilgenberg] Of course. I have known Yakimenko for a long time: We worked together in the militia, and we joined the democratic movement together. But this time I met her as a person who was an official from Moscow. She has set herself up well in the capital, and the apartment question was resolved. But, after all, there have been a lot of commissions, and we hope that they will gain an understanding. [Fomicheva] What is it like in the mayor's office now? Quiet? [Gilgenberg] Those who came to work along with Cherepkov have mastered the situation and are working. We are accepting new people for a probationary period. [Fomicheva] I wrote once that when we were electing a mayor we had a poor idea of what it meant. Are you planning a trip abroad for training? [Gilgenberg] This is an interesting question. We are planning one. Cherepkov's trip to Japan has already fallen through. Now he is being invited to Italy. Four employees have been invited to Alaska. However, we cannot leave yet, work in the city has not been settled. But, then, imagine what we will hear about the trips. "They left for a rest," it will be said. [Fomicheva] You will excuse me, but even you have the old viewpoint! So, let them say it! In any country a person goes where he has a mind to, and it is only in our "camp of socialism" that a trip by someone in a managerial position is accompanied by "howling" in the newspapers. Previously, this was understandable, as they traveled on party money. But now? [Gilgenberg] When we were getting buses from South Korea, I wanted to go myself, but I did not allow myself to do so for this reason. Although today a trip abroad is really open to everyone, and any cooperator has traveled through Turkey, France... [Fomicheva] You have always wanted democracy to come, when you started the movement for it with Yakimenko. But are you living well today? [Gilgenberg] I will answer you like this: The builders of both socialism and a society with market relations are one and the same. And the methods are old, unfortunately. [Fomicheva] Well, is it good for you or not? [Gilgenberg] There is the hope that it will be good. And I think that it is absolutely necessary to retain one principle of socialism: A person should not fall below a certain level. And it seems that there was a higher morality. [Fomicheva] But this is all in your power as the city manager. Perhaps, start with pornography on vendor stands. After all, children pass by. Such, excuse me, nonsense is being disseminated in many aspects of life where we are smartly trying on the garments of foreign life. Without a moment's hesitation. But they do not accept pornography there either. What do you think of the decision of the State Duma on the amnesty? [Gilgenberg] It seems to me that this question should have been decided by lawyers at an international level. I am not very pleased that they were all released. But at the same time, in periods of crisis, the leadership was completely changed in all countries. A younger generation of politicians should normalize the situation in Russia. [Fomicheva] And in the kray? Will the two administrations reach an agreement? [Gilgenberg] I hope that common sense will prevail among the kray leadership. And then Maritime Kray has every chance of coming out of the crisis.
