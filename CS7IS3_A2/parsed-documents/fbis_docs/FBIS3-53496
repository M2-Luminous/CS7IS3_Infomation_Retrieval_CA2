This came in a statement by the Swiss Foreign Ministry. Switzerland claims that she is a neutral country and many Libyans go there for medical treatment at her hospitals supporting her economy through spending. Accordingly the Libyans should take note of this as they declare daily their defiance of the embargo and readiness for confrontation.
