What do you consider to be the highlights of that meeting? [Tudjman] It goes without saying that this meeting was of exceptional importance to me and the Croatian delegation. We discussed ways of translating into practice what we had agreed on by signing the accord. In this regard we primarily stated that Croatia needed U.S. and European support in order to resolve the issue of Croatia's territories temporarily under UN protection; that is, the incorporation of those territories into Croatia's constitutional and legal system. Naturally, we also discussed many other issues from the area of international relations, especially issues of relevance to bilateral relations between Croatia and the United States. [Correspondent] Did you have any interesting encounters with the representatives of the European Union? How do they view America's sudden decision to join in the process of resolving the crisis in the region of former Yugoslavia? [Tudjman] Yes, I met with the troika -- you know what that means, the present chairman of the European Union, Greek [Foreign] Minister Papoulias, former Chairman Claes and future Chairman Kinkel, German vice chancellor and foreign minister -- and then with Van den Broek and with around a dozen European ministers and ambassadors. We discussed the agreement and topical issues, primarily -- again -- the integration of the territories occupied by Serbia and under the protection of the peacekeeping forces into Croatia. [Correspondent] Let us go back to the agreements signed and possibilities for their implementation in the field. In your opinion, what is the minimum territory the Muslim-Bosniak federation [as heard] should get? [Tudjman] Well, there has been no discussion on that subject here in Washington. However, it has been established in the course of the talks so far within the framework of the European conference on former Yugoslavia and on resolving the Bosnian crisis that the present Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia should get 51 percent. Namely, it was envisaged at the time that the Muslims should get 33.5 percent and the Croats 17.5. Therefore, this is a minimum below which we cannot go, while talks are to continue on the basis of the Muslim demand for an increase in these territories, that is, as is often heard on the margins of diplomatic conversations -- the Serbs would have to pay a price for joining the confederation. So, it is out of the question that the Serbs could retain more than 50 percent, as some are saying. [Correspondent] Yesterday Mr. Redman was our guest in this same program. He mentioned not only the amount of territory that the Serbs should hand back but also the quality of territory, too. Would you like to specify and tell us what the most desirable territories are in the event of their being handed back to the Muslim-Croatian federation? [Tudjman] I believe that at the moment it would not be advisable for me to dwell on these issues, which will be negotiated. It is important to tell our public that the most important factors of world and European politics are in agreement that one should seek solutions at the green table, that a political agreement should be reached. Understandably, this agreement should be such as to take account of geostrategic interests too. [Correspondent] Talking about geostrategic interests, I believe that Croatia, people in Croatia, may find it particularly interesting as to whether this possible demand for the return of territories will sever the corridor to the so-called Krajina? [Tudjman] This issue, too, well, it remains to be seen in the course of talks. For us it is essential that we have the full support of the United States and the European Union, that is, all international factors, for the return of Croatian territories into Croatia's constitutional and legal system. [Correspondent] Let us stay a bit longer on Bosnia-Herzegovina. In your opinion, should, and under what conditions, the Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina be allowed to join the Croat-Muslim federation? [Tudjman] It seems to me that this question is unnecessary because the Serbs have so far shown no interest in living in a union. Therefore, what will probably be at issue is whether the Serbs can be forced to temporarily remain in some kind of loose union with the Croat-Bosnian federation, for a temporary solution, a definitive solution. [sentence as heard] The possibility of forming a confederation within the framework of Bosnia-Herzegovina is not discussed at all now. What is important, what the world has tried to achieve, is to establish peace between Croats and Muslims because it is in strategic interests to end the war and to reach a demarcation that would, in the future, guarantee a more stable order in this region. [Correspondent] In discussions of a global solution to the crisis in the region, a global settlement is very often mentioned. People here in Croatia have recently started fearing a possible revival of some kind of loose union in the region. Do you think that if the Bosnian Serbs are allowed to remain in the federation and have some kind of link with Serbia, that the international community will exert pressure on Croatia to join a confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Tudjman] It can be supposed that some circles in the international community would exert such pressure, and some are still nurturing such ideas. This is a well-known fact. However, the important and responsible international factors know that there can be no revival of Yugoslavia, of the Yugoslav union, and that regardless of what Serbia wants, Croatia on the other hand is firm in its standpoint that a new international order in this region is possible only on the basis of the mutual recognition of sovereign states created on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. [Correspondent] A meeting of representatives of Croatia and the so-called Krajina is scheduled, as we know, to take place in the Russian Embassy on Tuesday. Some information has been leaked, so I would like to check it with you. Is it true that our delegation will be headed by Hrvoje Sarinic and the Serb delegation by Mile Novakovic? [Tudjman] Hrvoje Sarinic will head our delegation, that is true. I also heard before my departure that their delegation will be headed by....[changes thought] But there will also be someone else as their political representative. Our public is probably also interested in the fact that this meeting was convened by President Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin. This meeting will be attended by a U.S. representative, too. [Correspondent] Will this meeting, as Churkin said, focus solely on a cease-fire, or will some political relations be discussed nevertheless at this early stage? [Tudjman] The agenda for this meeting will, of course, include a cease-fire, meaning the securing of -- shall I say -- a general cease-fire, something that will be an introduction to the further process of normalizing relations. In this context, one certainly cannot rule out talks on these issues. [Correspondent] A question that inevitably arises: Will Croatia have to alter some of its present laws -- the law on minorities, the law on the internal set-up, for instance -- in the process of reintegrating the so-called Krajina? [Tudjman] Well, Croatia had passed a constitutional law in conformity with the demands of the European Community, as it was known at the time -- the present European Union -- and in accordance with suggestions made by the arbitration commission headed by prominent French expert Badintere. There will be no reason for fundamentally altering Croatia's legislature. Understandably, we for our part will be flexible enough to reach an agreement on the peaceful integration of those regions into Croatia's constitutional and legal system while remaining determined not to allow Croatia's sovereignty to be eroded. [Correspondent] Could you please clarify this concept, this syntagma frequently heard of late -- expanded autonomy. [Tudjman] There can be no talk of any other expanded autonomy but the one already discussed. I am referring to two districts -- Glina and Knin, where the Serbs are in the majority. It is there that they will have the right to local self-rule in accordance with our Constitution and constitutional laws. Also, of course, the entire Serb community in Croatia will have all human rights guaranteed as well as ethnic community rights in harmony with international conventions. [Correspondent] We have heard certain rumors, and some observers -- we will not name them now -- claim that the so-called Krajina [Serb-held areas in eastern and southern Croatia] should be given the status that Kosovo and Vojvodina had under the 1974 Constitution of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. What do you think about that? [Tudjman] I think that such claims are nebulous. Kosovo is a province inhabited not only by a huge national minority, but also by almost 2 million Albanians who have a 90 percent majority and live in a compact area. In the same way, Vojvodina is a separate and historical province, which was not part of Serbia and Yugoslavia until 1918, and it is also ethnically, nationally mixed. There can be no comparison in that respect with the so-called Krajina in Croatia, which is not territorially linked and where the Serbs are in a proportional minority, except in the two districts that I have mentioned -- Glina and Knin -- which are not territorially linked. [Correspondent] By all appearances, the sanctions against Belgrade are the only effective means against greater Serbian policies. In your opinion, is it now possible to lift the sanctions in exchange for [Serbia] giving up the so-called Krajinas? [Tudjman] Now you have used the term exchange, such an exchange is possible only when a positive, acceptable solution is reached simultaneously -- with Serbia's consent -- in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and when Croatia's territories currently under the peace forces' protection are reintegrated into Croatia. [Correspondent] In your view, now that the agreement has been signed, has Croatia's position become stronger in the eyes of the Security Council, the United Nations? [Tudjman] Absolutely. In making its demands, Croatia's position is now very favorable. Croatia's position in the international community has become such that it has friendly relations, the closest relations with the United States; it has the understanding of the European Union in general, especially the leading European countries and, what is not important [as heard], the complete understanding -- especially now after the signing of these agreements on a federation and a confederation -- of a large number of Islamic countries and nonaligned countries which, as you know, are numerous and which are playing an important role in the work of the Security Council and the United Nations. To this effect Croatia's demands will be met by far greater understanding because Croatia has again shown that it is pursuing a consistent policy of resolving matters peacefully, that its objectives are in conformity with the international community. [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President. [Tudjman] Thank you and a good night to you.
