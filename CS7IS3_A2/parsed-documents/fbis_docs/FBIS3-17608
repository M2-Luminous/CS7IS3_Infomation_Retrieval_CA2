Ivan Plyushch said to reporters in Kiev on Sunday that there were no reasons to put off the election, scheduled for June 26. "This hullabaloo is groundless and pointless. The election is feared by those who don't believe they'll be elected," he said. Kravchuk has repeatedly insisted that the presidential election be postponed, because, he said, holding it before the new legislature convened could lead to a confrontation in society and paralyze authority. Commenting on the president's statement that the next parliament, to be elected on March 27, may not be a "full-blooded" legislature, Plyushch said, "There are too many specialists who have not only made an analysis but have drawn conclusions as well." "I will refrain from making such conclusions." "The parliament will be full-blooded," he said.
