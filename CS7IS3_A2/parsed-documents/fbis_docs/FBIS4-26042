Pending approval of the State Council, up to 100 foreign law firms will be allowed to set up branches in the country, up from the present 41, according to Du Guoxing, deputy director of the lawyers' administration department with the ministry. Foreign law firms will also be allowed to open in more coastal cities and provincial capitals than just the current five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou, Du noted. Du made the announcement at a seminar yesterday on China's first Foreign Trade Law, which takes effect July 1. The seminar was co-sponsored by the International Business newspaper and the APC Law Firm, both based in Beijing. Attending the seminar were more than 20 law experts, managers and officials, including senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. Due to China's rapid economic growth and rising business opportunities, more foreign law firms have applied for permission to enter the potentially huge Chinese market. So far, about 80 foreign law firms have applied with the Ministry of Justice to open offices in the mainland. They must also register with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. The country first allowed foreign law firms to set up branches in the mainland on an experimental basis in July 1992. Experience has shown that the experiment is a success, said Du, adding that the overseas law firms play an active role in helping more foreign investors enter the Chinese market, promoting Sino-foreign cooperation and training Chinese lawyers. An Australian law firm office, for instance, helped introduce nearly 30 foreign investment projects to China in just one year. Meanwhile, China will also encourage more Chinese law firms to open offices abroad. At present, there are only two Chinese law firms that have opened offices abroad, Du said.
