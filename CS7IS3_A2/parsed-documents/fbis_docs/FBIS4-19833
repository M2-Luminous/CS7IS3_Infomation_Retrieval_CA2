[Stoel] NATO has finally decided to issue a new ultimatum to the Serbs and to carry out air strikes if necessary. Are you satisfied with this decision? [Kooijmans] Yes, I am. It is clear that the UN Security Council has decided that the Serbs must leave Gorazde and that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops should deploy in the town. The ultimatum has been set for Sunday evening at 03OO. [Stoel] Are the Serbs to be fought from the air? Should the fighting not take place on the ground, as advocated by Minister [Jan] Pronk? [Kooijmans] At this time, that is absolutely impossible. In any case, according to the military, an airborne strike force could be used, and they [the Serbs] must take the credibility of this threat into account. [Stoel] What about the security of the UN ground troops? U.S. Senator Nunn, a very influential man, advocates evacuating the UN troops first before launching air strikes. Would you agree to this, too? [Kooijmans] Certainly not. This would be totally inconsistent with what has been decided by the Security Council; namely, that the UN troops absolutely should be stationed in Gorazde. This is the assurance that can be given to the safe areas and, therefore, there should not be any withdrawal. [Stoel] But the UN ground troops will be in danger? [Kooijmans] Necessary measures must be taken and some have been taken to ensure their safety as much as possible. [Stoel] What kind of measures? [Kooijmans] I cannot provide any information on that. [Stoel] They are secret? [Kooijmans] Those measures are confidential. [Stoel] Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton want to organize a summit on Bosnia. Does this still make sense? [Kooijmans] Yes, but do not forget that this is only to prevent Gorazde from being taken over completely. A political solution must also be reached and it is therefore very important that the different parties involved in the negotiations intervene. This is being contemplated in the form of a conference with all parties involved directly -- the United States, Russia, European Union, and the United Nations. [Stoel] Thank you, Mr. Kooijmans [Kooijmans] You are welcome.
