FBIS4-65582 "drweu097_p_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 GREECE * Developments in Political Spring * Developments in Political Spring 94P20755A 94P20755A CSO [Editorial Report] While Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras states he is mainly interested in attracting "the thousands of his anonymous supporters" since adherence to his party by well-known political figures is "natural," it would not be surprising if his longtime presence in the New Democracy (ND) resulted in a number of former and present ND deputies switching to his party, writes Dhimitris Kapranos in the 30 April-1 May Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. Nevertheless, a cautious Political Spring official cited by Kapranos warns that "switches" should not be expcted before the European Parliamentary elections, the results of which may "determine the fate of the big parties." At any rate, Political Spring aspires to doubling the 5-percent share of the vote it obtained in the last legislative elections. At the same time, Samaras' decision to vote in the Chamber of Deputies against the enlargement of the European Union has been much discussed, Kapranos continues. Samaras fears that enlargement without previous deepening will contribute to the creation of a weak European Union (EU) in which Germany will become a "European superpower" with ties to the Baltics, Poland, the Czech Republic, and other European countries, and which will be defined by German interests. Kapranos notes also that the Political Spring view of a "determined Greece possessing strong national characteristics" apparently has a deep resonance in public opinion.
