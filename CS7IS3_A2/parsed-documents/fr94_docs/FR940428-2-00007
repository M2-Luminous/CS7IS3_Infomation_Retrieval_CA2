Administrative or program-related requirements for specific programs are published annually in program announcements, application packages, or other documentation. ``Nondiscretionary assistance program'' means any NOAA program for providing financial assistance: (1) Under which the amount of funding for, and the intended recipient of, the financial assistance is specified by Congress; or (2) the recipients of which have customarily been a State or an interstate fishery commission. Programs whose recipients have customarily been a State or an interstate fishery commission are: Anadromous Fish Conservation Act Program (CFDA 11.405) Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986 (CDFA 11.407) Cooperative Fishery Statistics (CFDA 11.434) Southeast Area Monitoring & Assessment Program (CFDA 11.435) Columbia River Fisheries Development Program (CFDA 11.436) West Coast Fisheries Data Program (CFDA 11.437) Pacific Salmon Treaty Program (CFDA 11.438) Marine Mammal Data Program (CFDA 11.439) Alaska Salmon Enhancement (CFDA 11.458) 2. Notification of Applicant A NOAA program office will notify eligible applicants for nondiscretionary assistance programs of application requirements and deadlines. A complete and acceptable application must be submitted by the applicant to the appropriate program office at least 75 days prior to the proposed effective date of the award. The applicant must write ``Nondiscretionary'' in block 8 of the Standard Form 424, Application for Federal Assistance, to identify applications subject to these guidelines. Within 14 days after receipt of the application, the program office will notify the applicant in writing whether the application is complete; if it is not, the notification will specify what additional material must be provided before the application will be considered complete and processing initiated. 3. Processing of Application Within 75 calendar days after a complete and acceptable application is received, the NOAA Grants Management Division will notify the applicant of approval or disapproval of the application. Classification This notice of guidelines was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The Standard Forms 424, 424A, 424B and LLL have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act under OMB Control Nos. 0348&hyph;0043, 0348&hyph;0044, 0348&hyph;0040, and 0348&hyph;0046. This notice does not contain policies with sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that these guidelines, if adopted, will not have a significant economical impact on a substantial number of small entities because they specify only internal procedures for ensuring that NOAA meets the deadlines established by section 404 of the NOAA Authorization Act. Dated: April 19, 1994. Diana H. Josephson, Deputy Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10085 Filed 04&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;12&hyph;M
