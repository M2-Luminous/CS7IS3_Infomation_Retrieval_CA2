Vodopyanov: "Russia Needs a Worthy Fleet"] [Text] During the course of preparations for celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Russian Fleet, besides pride in its glorious centuries-old history, military seamen are also experiencing well-founded concern for the future of the Russian Navy. People devoted to the sea are bitter about the fact that for the first time in many decades, not a single ship was laid down at Russia's shipyards last year, and completion of those under construction was suspended or is being done at an extremely slow pace against the background of the massive decommissioning of ships and vessels, both obsolete ones and ones that could be preserved with the proper repair and modernization. What is the reason for this situation--is it merely economic difficulties, or is it an aggregate of other reasons? It is with this question that we began our interview with Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, first deputy minister of defense of the Russian Federation. [Kokoshin] The difficult situation of the Russian Navy is explained not only by the difficulties of the present situation in Russia and the political and economic consequences of the breakup of the USSR, but also by the past mistakes in organizational development of the Navy, when warships were being created, and basing and ground support and servicing systems, that is, all that we call infrastructure, were not properly developed. The same can be said about fleet armament, as well as reconnaissance and target designation assets. There is another aspect. Ships, even after being adopted into operational service, took a very long time to complete and, naturally, could not fully accomplish combat missions. What is more, today at the Baltic Shipyards the guided-missile cruiser Peter the Great is being completed. Only now is this ship, the fourth of this project, getting all the weapons that were to be on the first one. Huge delays in creating assemblies, individual components, and weapons systems of the warships also have an effect. So, the Navy is a victim both of the most difficult crisis situation of our economy and, simultaneously, of those problems of shipbuilding that built up over several decades. [Vodopyanov] Apparently, we can also include here the difficult situation with housing and other problems of social security which have taken shape in the fleets? [Kokoshin] Unquestionably. The trouble is that we created ships, including outstanding ones, but essentially forgot about people. This concerns not only officer personnel but also enlisted personnel. It seems that the large number of incidents in the Navy, including cases of suicide, are associated with the fact that crews are located in the secluded space of ship compartments for too long a time, and the conditions have not been created for them for real rest and relaxation on shore. [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, if the conversation turns to development of the Navy's infrastructure, a logical question arises: What is being done today to solve the problems you mentioned? [Kokoshin] Development of a system of basing and life support is a long-term program which must be planned for 15-20 years. In doing so, we must proceed from the fact that the idea of dispersing the infrastructure facilities for basing ship groupings intended to operate in one or several closely located operational areas is outdated. You see, a massive strike, not even nuclear but conventional, but with high-precision weapons, will destroy practically all the facilities no matter how we try to move them apart. Therefore, I consider justified the viewpoint of those experts who propose to position the fleets at several bases unified in technology of supporting the vital activities of the ships, weapons, and use of forces and weapons at sea. Such a concentration of forces give a tremendous advantage both for the development of the Navy's infrastructure and for creating normal living conditions for servicemen and their families. [Vodopyanov] In doing so, obviously, we must proceed from the real conditions and capabilities of our state? [Kokoshin] Undoubtedly. Unfortunately, we are just now beginning to really count our money, to say nothing of the Americans, Germans, and British. They will not invest their money unless they are convinced that every dollar, mark, or pound will provide the maximum return. In Russia's history, the great Prince Konstantin Nikolayevich--general-admiral of the Russian Fleet--and his fellow reformers devoted much attention during the reform period to what is now called "cost effectiveness." Today, every commander must become an economist. The general customer of the Navy's arms in the person of commanders of higher echelons, headquarters, and other command and control bodies must be able to analyze what is more beneficial to the Navy: For example, purchase five new destroyers or modernize 10 that are in service. Lay a new nuclear-powered submarine or modernize that which has proven itself well. Order a new cruiser or invest money in development of the infrastructure and life support of existing ships... Of course, to do this, we in the armed forces must have strong economic services, and one of our most important tasks is to instill in commanders of all levels a taste for careful analysis of the monetary resources which we possess and the combat effectiveness of those arms which we purchase for this money. [Vodopyanov] To do this, however, commanders must clearly know what the Russia's Ministry of Defense and you, as first deputy minister of defense, see as the Navy's role today. What is its concept of organizational development? It is no secret that in Russia's past and, the impression is forming, the present military doctrine, insufficient attention was and is being devoted to the Navy. [Kokoshin] There always was a double attitude towards the Navy. On the one hand, it was loved in a special way. And Russians, I would say, have a certain subconscious craving for the sea. It is no wonder that the periods of Russia's isolation concluded with departure for the seas that wash the present-day Russia, initially in the west and south (Baltic, Black, and Caspian seas) and then in the east (Pacific Ocean). On the other hand, due to our geostrategic position, we have traditionally been more of a land power than a sea power, and Russia's military fate was usually determined on land. Of course, there were critical moments and sea battles, such as Tsushima, which also determined the future foreign policy and the domestic situation of the Russian state. Nevertheless, the outcome of wars--the Patriotic War of 1812, World War I and II--were predetermined deep in Russian territory. This happened not only due to Russia's natural geographic position but also, it seems to me, due to the ambivalent attitude towards the Navy. It experienced periods of a great upsurge and deep crises. And such alternation was repeated over and over in Russia's history--we must not forget this. Remember that after Peter the Great, the Navy was very quickly brought to a deep decline by his successors. Then things were corrected somewhat under Elizabeth Petrovna, but it still cannot be said that the Navy was in a magnificent position. During the rule of Catherine the Great, the Navy flourished. It was during this period that the entire world heard the names Senyavin, Greyg, and Ushakov, whose glory was comparable to that of Rumyantsev and Suvorov. Under Paul I the Navy still held its place, but under Alexander I it again ended up in a difficult situation and was not used very much. Paradoxical as it may seem, the most hated name for seamen of that time was the name of the naval minister, Marquis de Traverse. However, he did not decide everything; he merely acted as an instrument of the top. Although the role of personality in the Navy was always great, its revival, at least of the Black Sea Fleet, in the first half of the 19th century was associated primarily with the name Admiral Lazarev. Later came the Crimean War, when the Navy was powerless against the enemy's armored steam-powered ships, and the Russian admirals, officers, and sailors became heroes of the land defense of Sevastopol. We also remember the already mentioned Tsushima and 1918, when a large part of the Black Sea Fleet was actually sunk... Overall, the Russian Navy had a majestic and sometimes tragic history, one that was more complex than that of the armed forces as a whole. In the recent past, at the turn of the 1960's, the Navy was subjected to a severe blow when nearly new ships that were far from exhausting their combat capabilities were scrapped. [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, you absolutely justly noted that we must not forget history, including that of the Navy. Is this taken into account in the new shipbuilding program? [Kokoshin] I would not say that we have a new shipbuilding program in the traditional sense. I think there should be a program of developing arms as a whole, of which the Navy would be a component. And this would include not only ships but also shore-based missile systems, naval aviation, and naval infantry... But the most important thing, I repeat, is to improve the basing system and the repair system. It is precisely such a program that we need--without a one-sided slant towards shipbuilding. This is especially dictated by the situation, resulting from the breakup of the Soviet Union, in the Black, Baltic, and Caspian Seas. As far as ships are concerned, I believe the idea of creating a relatively small number of aircraft-carrying ships merits very close attention. Overall, we need new inspiring ideas whose implementation can help us keep what we have for years. The young people of the Navy will have their say here... [Vodopyanov] But in order to advance, as you say, "ideas," those young people of the Navy need to know what criteria will determine the quantitative and qualitative composition of the Navy. [Kokoshin] Absolutely, Russia needs a powerful, modern navy without quantitative excesses, but with high indicators of combat and operational effectiveness; a navy which would blend in with an integrated military doctrine. Today it is especially important for all the armed services and combat arms to coordinate precisely with one another. Now, of course, there is no optimum in this sphere. As far as the missions to be carried out by the Navy are concerned, I think they primarily associated with safeguarding Russia's security in certain areas and zones adjacent to its territory and ensuring, along with the Strategic Missile Troops and strategic Long-Range Aviation, reliable nuclear deterrence. One of the Navy's most important missions will be to preserve according to specific parameters its oceanic functions, above all, in the context of reconnaissance, collecting data, and studying the hydrological situation. Among the combat missions, the primary one is to maintain the stability of strategic nuclear-powered submarines and create such conditions of combat duty that would enable us in the event of political crises and military operations to prevail in the near-ocean zones most vulnerable for safeguarding Russia's security and also in certain key areas of the world oceans. [Vodopyanov] But what is the basis for carrying out what is planned? After all, it seems to us that today much is justifiably being said about the insufficient thought given to the policy of conversion of the defense industry, which led to the collapse of our military-industrial complex and its loss of advanced positions. [Kokoshin] It must be recognized that we really did not have a conversion policy, although efforts were made to convert the military-industrial complex to producing peacetime products. But such a program should have been implemented over the course of 10-15 years and certainly on the condition of the stability of state administration. The conversion program proposed within the framework of the old system can only be considered a conversion palliative. When weakened "civilian" plants "hooked onto" enterprises of the military-industrial complex, it was able to work only in the presence of a directive force. And, of course, the conversion policy had to have powerful market stimuli and be built into an overall strategy of reformation of the economy and independent of directions from above. [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, how can you now characterize the condition of the industrial complex meeting the needs of the Navy? [Kokoshin] It is very difficult. Essentially, we are now fighting for the survival of the armed forces, including the Navy, and for the preservation of industry, if only in those volumes which would ensure maintaining the Army and Navy at the necessary combat readiness. This is an extremely difficult task. The director corps of defense enterprises agrees when you say that it is necessary to reduce military orders and the number of plants. But as soon as it affects the directors directly, they begin to take it back: They say, let us reduce others' orders, but not mine. Incidentally, we were also forced to curtail many developments to the limit and, figuratively speaking, will have to cut to the quick. For example, we determined Severodvinsk and the Sevmashpredpriyatiye [Severodvinsk Machine Building Enterprise] to be the center of nuclear-powered submarine building. Now all orders will go only there. But we must bring to readiness those submarines which we have in the Far East. Some are being completed at Nizhniy Novgorod, and large surface ships at Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg... [Vodopyanov] Again, it turns out that it is the Navy that is suffering the greatest damage of all the armed services? [Kokoshin] This is taking place due to its specific nature: The duration of the shipbuilding cycle, the fact that they are entire floating cities which combine much of what the Air Force, Missile Troops, and Air Defense Troops have... Therefore, such super powerful weapons systems are now suffering the most. The specific nature of today's industrial production and the fact that there are no strict rules governing behavior of first and second-level cooperating enterprises, which are very quickly switching to the production of civilian products that are in demand. Military orders have become unprofitable due to not being provided financial resources... [Vodopyanov] ...As a result, whereas before seamen often complained about a number of low tactical and technical parameters of newly built ships and the insufficient standardization of weapons and combat equipment with which they were equipped, today the Navy is more concerned about the discontinuance of deliveries not only of new and modern weapons but even series-produced weapons. Will it not turn out that the Russian Navy will celebrate its 300th anniversary not only without new ships but also with armament from "the Ochakov times and the conquest of Crimea?" [Kokoshin] You pose an absolutely valid question. I believe that we need to maintain the course of keeping a small number of warships in commission, but the most modern and really combat-ready, as they say, first-line ships. Such requirements, of course, also pertain to both aviation and to the other armed services, but especially to the Navy. We must be sure that if a ship flies the flag of the Navy and is in commission, it can be counted upon. In addition, there should be reserve ships with lower levels of combat readiness and a lower level of manning than first-line ships. Of course, both must be equipped with modern weapons. But there are a mass of obstacles here. [Vodopyanov] Can you dwell on this important aspect in more detail? [Kokoshin] In the former USSR, the expenditure mechanism of the entire life cycle of armament was dominant--from development to utilization. Often, reporting on the development of a project, say, for a new ship was the main thing, for which they handed out awards and prizes. Ships, weapons systems, life-support systems, and rescue and survival equipment, as it later turned out, were far from perfect in a number of cases due to such "reporting mania." Moreover, the vast majority of armament models were created without expectation of modernization. We are suffering from this to this day, since it is impossible to place new electronics, sonar equipment, and modern types of antennas on ship of most projects. But the main shortcoming in domestic shipbuilding, it seems, was the lack of a macro-system approach to construction and development of the Navy, including basing infrastructure, when the drive for quantitative and qualitative composition of the Navy under obviously overstated requirements of naval strategy (let us recall the "ocean strategy" of Admiral Gorshkov) was accomplished by painful decisions often dictated not by the Navy but by the military-industrial complex. There was nothing that defined the strategy of military shipbuilding--a state program coordinated by objectives, deadlines, and engineering tasks and unified for all scientific research institutes and design bureaus, shipyards, and docks. But those same Americans and Germans, far richer than us, built ships with a long-range sight. The Iowa-class battleships are a classic example of a proprietary attitude toward ships. But where are our Project 68-bis gun cruisers today, which were distinguished by outstanding naval architecture and fair seagoing qualities?! [Vodopyanov] Today the Navy has also lost (basically due to a poorly developed shore-basing infrastructure) newer ships; for example, the heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers Kiev, Minsk, and Novorossiysk, each of which served less than 20 years... [Kokoshin] That is because, as I already said above, we always pursued quantity, ignoring the qualitative characteristics of the Fleet and paying no attention to costs, which especially increase when operating less-than-perfect ships and basing points. Today we are forced to count every ruble; funds are catastrophically short. How in such conditions to optimize expenditures for the purchase of equipment and armament, shipbuilding and repair, and scientific research and experimental design work? Therefore, in the immediate future we must not count on any new grandiose projects, but we must solve more practical problems in order to preserve the maximum of what we have in the Fleet today. The Navy's main task for the next 2-3 years is survival. I will note that it is not vegetation, but survival with the evolutionary accumulation of combat might, structural and operational reorganization, being inspired by the lofty idea of the historical greatness of the homeland, and realization of its need for armed forces, and the Navy in particular. We must not forget that the Navy is still a special instrument of the state which can be used not only for purely military but also political tasks. I have in mind showing the Russian flag. I am convinced that we must accomplish the latter constantly, and there is no room for a bookkeeping approach here. A warship, especially a beautiful one (and Soviet, now Russian, ships are famous for their architecture), evokes admiration and respect. We must work out a kind of philosophy of using the Fleet, when it serves as a powerful factor of deterring an aggressor, without entering into combat operations but simply cruising back and forth off the coast or even beyond the horizon, and influences political "solitaire" along with other means and measures. [Vodopyanov] Especially since the Russian and Soviet Navy has such experience... [Kokoshin] I have talked a lot with veterans of the Navy who have more than once sailed the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. In a number of cases, our Navy played a very important role, when the situation was stabilized at a comparatively low level of escalation of some or other conflict by the sending of a detachment of our ships. No one guarantees that military threats in the world to the security of Russia will come to naught completely. So, we must be realists--we cannot get along without a Navy worthy of Russia.
