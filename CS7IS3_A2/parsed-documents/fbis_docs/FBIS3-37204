John Major told reporters after signing joint Russian-British agreements that the positions of both sides are completely identical on the necessity to continue searching for ways of a peaceful settlement of the conflict. He added that he and the Russian leader had agreed that such a settlement should be stable and that peace cannot be achieved by military means. According to Major, the positions of both sides also coincide on the necessity to place under UN control the heavy armaments of the warring sides near Sarajevo. The process has already begun and Major characterised it as a good chance for achieveing peace and urged Russia, the United States and the European Union to join efforts in order not to miss the chance. The British prime minister believes that the Russian negative reaction to the possibility of air strikes on Bosnian Serbs was caused by a certain misunderstanding of the essence of the NATO decision. He added that this was a competent and balanced decision which was limited by the concrete problem of Sarajevo and adopted according to a request of the UN secretary general. Major said he shared the conviction of the Russian president that British-Russian relations had reached the highest level in decades. This concerns trade, politics and military cooperation. Such a level of practical cooperation did not exist in the last 50 years, the British prime minister said. Major added that he had invited Boris Yeltsin to Great Britain and that the time of the visit will be agreed upon later.
