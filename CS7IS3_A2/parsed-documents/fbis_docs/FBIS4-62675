The protest demands suspension of the decision on raising utilities prices; otherwise the trade unions "will mobilize people to protest in front of the government building" and proceed to more energetic protest actions such as a manifestation in the Great National Assembly Square in Chisinau. The presidium of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions (FITU) issued today a similar protest saying that the increase of the utilities prices is nothing "but a mockery." The FITU "demands immediate suspension of the decisions on increasing these prices" and adds that "ignoring these demands will provoke social instability." Sources from the Federation say that the FITU Presidium had to make this decision under the pressure of several branch trade unions. Previously, the FITU had launched the idea of abstaining for six month from protest actions. Today, during the press conference of the Moldovan Agrarian Democratic Party, Moldovan deputy speaker Dumitru Motpan stated that measures have already been taken to suspend the implementation of the increased tariffs.
