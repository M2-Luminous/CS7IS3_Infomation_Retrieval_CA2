FR941006-2-00121 FR941006-2-00084 Additionally, allowing the NASD, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to approve, on a case-by-case basis, an issue of SEEDS that does not satisfy one of the existing requirements regarding market capitalization and trading volume, 21 or that exceeds the maximum allowable percentage of shares of the underlying security, 22 merely adds flexibility to the proposed rule change. The Commission believes that this portion of the proposal does not raise any regulatory concerns, particularly given the requirement of obtaining the concurrence of the staff of the Commission prior to listing. 23 21 See supra note 7. 22 See supra note 12. 23 If the NASD proposed a SEEDS that raised unique or significant regulatory concerns, the staff of the Commission would require the NASD to submit a rule filing to the Commission pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act. Finally, the NASD represents that a number of issuers, including Nasdaq listed companies, have expressed an interest in listing SEEDS on Nasdaq. In light of the Commission's approval of the listing of ELNs on the Amex and ELDS on the NYSE, accelerating approval of this proposal will ensure that the NASD is allowed to compete on an equal basis with the Amex and NYSE with regard to these equity-linked products. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register in order to allow the NASD to begin listing SEEDS without delay. As discussed above, except for two aspects the proposal merely provides the NASD with the ability to list equity-linked debt securities on the same basis as the NYSE and the Amex. Moreover, the Commission notes that the proposals by the NYSE and the Amex to list and trade equity-linked debt securities were published by the Commission for the full comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. With respect to the two aspects of the SEEDS proposal which expand on the standards previously approved for the NYSE and the Amex, for the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that no significant regulatory issues are raised that were not adequately address in the Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders. 24 24 See Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders, supra note 4. Finally, Amendment No. 1 to the proposal also eliminates the minimum holder requirement for securities which are listed pursuant to Article III, Section 2 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice but which trade in thousand dollar denominations. The Commission notes that this amendment merely conforms the NASD's rules to those of the NYSE which do not contain a minimum holder requirement for hybrid debt securities. 25 Accordingly, the Commission believes that this amendment does not raise any significant regulatory issues. 25 See section 703.19 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. For the above reasons, the Commission believes it is consistent with section 15A(b)(6) 26 and 19(b)(2) 27 of the Act to approve the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal on an accelerated basis. 26 15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;3(b)(6) (1988). 27 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. 20549.
