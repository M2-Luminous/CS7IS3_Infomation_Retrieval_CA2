Jiang Zemin said: "Although China and Korea established diplomatic relations not long ago, relations between the two countries have developed rapidly, leading to ever-widening fields of exchanges and cooperation, thanks to the joint efforts of the two sides. We are pleased with the smooth development of relations between the two countries." He said: Friendly relations between China and Korea now have a very good foundation. Moreover, they possess the conditions and possibilities for further developing these relations. In particular, there are good prospects for strengthening and deepening mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the two countries. The two countries may explore specific industrial sectors for cooperation, as well as the forms of cooperation. He said: President Kim Yong-sam's current visit is bound to give a positive impetus to further developing relations between the two countries. Last November, Jiang Zemin met with President Kim Yong-sam in Seattle in the United States. He expressed his pleasure at meeting with Kim Yong-sam again four months later and at exchanging views on relations between the two countries and on issues of common interest. Kim Yong-sam expressed great pleasure at having an opportunity to visit China. He said: Korea and China enjoy a traditional relationship dating back several thousand years. Economic cooperation between the two countries is highly complementary, and there are quite a few favorable conditions in this respect. He said that he had been deeply impressed by his visit to Shanghai the day before. There is tremendous potential for economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. They can cooperate in such industrial sectors as aviation, automobiles, and electronic program-controlled telephone exchanges. Kim Yong-sam noted: Further cementing economic and trade cooperation between the two countries will play a tremendous role in stabilizing the economy in the Asia-Pacific region, or even in the world at large. It will help promote world peace and stability. Kim Yong-sam expressed his belief that the visit would prompt the Korean side to actively encourage its enterprises to invest in China so that Korea would become China's reliable partner for economic and trade cooperation, and that cooperation between the two countries in all fields would be promoted further. Speaking of the situation on the Korean peninsula, Jiang Zemin said: The Chinese Government sincerely hopes that long-term peace and stability will be maintained on the Korean peninsula, and it supports the call for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. Without peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, there will be no genuine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. He said emphatically: In dealing with the issue of the Korean peninsula, one should proceed from the overall consideration for maintaining and developing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be resolved properly through dialogue within a trilateral framework involving the four sides. President Kim Yong-sam noted: The Korean side also hopes that the nuclear issue of Korea [DPRK] will be solved through dialogue and negotiation, instead of through pressure, and that China will continue to play its role toward this end. He invited President Jiang Zemin to visit Korea at a convenient time. Jiang Zemin expressed his thanks and noted that relevant specifics would be discussed separately through diplomatic channels. During the talks, the two leaders also briefed each other on economic development in their countries, exchanging views in this regard, and on regional and international issues of common interest. Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and concurrently foreign minister, and Wu Jichuan, chairman of the Chinese Government's reception committee and minister of posts and telecommunications, were present at the talks. Also present at the talks were Han Sung-chu, ROK minister of foreign affairs, and Kim Chol-su, ROK minister of trade, industry, and energy, who are accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his visit. Prior to the talks, President Jiang Zemin hosted a ceremony in the central hall of the Great Hall of the People to welcome President Kim Yong-sam and his wife on their official visit to China. Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, and others attended the ceremony. In the evening, President Jiang Zemin hosted a banquet there for Kim Yong-sam and his wife and delegation.
