[passage omitted] The Egyptian president's lightning visit to Turkey was his third since 1985. Yesterday's meeting between Mubarak and his Turkish counterpart reveals the nature of relations between Cairo and Ankara. The meeting was aimed at expanding the scope of political, economic, cultural, and military cooperation between the two countries. This cooperation is of special importance in light of the two countries' status in the region and of their relations with Israel. The Zionist entity's President Ezer Weizman paid an official four-day visit to Turkey one week before Mubarak's visit. Weizman said that the Middle East's future is dependent on cooperation between Israel, Turkey, and Egypt. A number of political observers believe that such meetings are a preparatory step toward concluding a regional alliance that will give the Egyptian, Israeli, and Turkish Governments the right opportunity for confronting every possible danger and for implementing their own policies. The United States is supporting this step to strengthen the ties of tripartite coordination and cooperation. The spread of the Islamic trend and the Islamic forces' activities topped the items discussed by Turkey, Israel, and Egypt. On the other hand, it can be said that strengthening Turkish and Egyptian relations with the Zionist entity prepares the proper ground for the normalization of relations between the other Arab countries and the usurper entity. It also prepares the ground for lifting the Arab economic boycott of this entity. This is quite evident to anyone who analyzes the political trend. The Islamic trend in the region is the primary target of the policy of developing relations between Egypt, Israel, and Turkey. This policy aims to tighten the noose around the countries that exercise independent policies that are not linked to the imperialist forces.
