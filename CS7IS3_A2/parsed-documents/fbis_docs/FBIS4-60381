In a press conference held recently, Baghdad Mayor Tahir Muhammad Hassun shed light on the environmental hazards that ensured from the direct and indirect effects of the U.S.-led aggression against Iraq. In an urgent call to international and humanitarian organisations all over the world, Mr. Hassun urged for an immediate action to save the Iraqi environment. The "Baghdad Call" aims at attracting the world's attention to the great damage inflicted by the U.S.-allied war and the continuation of the economic sanctions, the mayor said. He added that Iraq's environment has been greatly affected by the barbaric bombing by allied forces during the U.S.-led military aggression, indicating that the destruction of electric power faculties and water and waste water treatment plants has led to a cycle of contamination. The mayor added that Baghdad is calling for help because the embargo has greatly affected the level of municipal services, noting that Baghdad is some 900 square kilometres in area and has a 4.5 million population. He said Baghdad city is divided into some 1.3 [figure as received] municipal units has some 467 residential quarters. The mayor added that due to the continuation of the embargo the average water delivery has decreased from 45 liters per capita per day (L/C/D) before the war to reach some 18 liters per capita per day after the war. The mayor elaborated that severe damage has been inflicted upon water and waste water treatment plants. Moreover, fresh sewage is either overflowing in the streets or being discharged into the Tigris and the Euphrates without any treatment. Furthermore, allied bombing of roads and lack of spare parts needed to carry out maintenance because of the sanctions had caused cracks in sewer lines which in consequence caused ground water contamination. Many of these systems are either out of operation or operated at a reduced capacity because of pump breakdown, said the mayor. The ultimate threat is posed by the large quantities of sewage which flow untreated into the country's two major rivers and run downstream. These rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris, constitute the main water sources of the country, said the mayor, adding that some 50 per cent, that is some five cubic metres per second sewage water is being pumped directly into rivers. He added that Baghdad outskirts are still suffering from lack of potable water, noting that about one-third of Baghdad city lacks waste-water treatment system due to the stoppage of work on sewage and waste-water treatment projects due to lack of spare parts and materials due to the sanctions. Moreover, the work of waste collecting vehicles is hampered by lack of maintenance and spare parts causing in consequence heaps of garbage in residential quarters of Baghdad, noting that the number of workers has also decreased from 6332 to some 2500 ones. Solid waste disposal has been disrupted, consequently causing air pollution because people often tend to incinerate rubbish, said the mayor. Mr. Hassun added that the sanctions have also brought work on renovation project of Baghdad city of a standstill, noting that work on the said project has started in 1980s. He added that the project aims at renovating and refurbishing ancient and historical sites and holy shrines and historical mosques and churches. Mr. Hassun warned of the spread of epidemics saying that people of Baghdad city suffer from the wide spread of epidemics resulting from environmental pollution, the accumulation of garbage and lack of municipal services, noting that Baghdad hospitals hae reported a noticeable increase in communicable diseases. The mayor urged health organisations the world over to act swiftly for lifting the 45-month-old economic sanction imposed on Iraq.
