Perry, who arrived here on Thursday from South Korea, told a press conference that the United States places great hope in China in efforts to persuade the DPRK to relinquish its nuclear development program. Perry said that if the DPRK's attitude does not soften despite diplomatic efforts, the U.S. and allies such as Japan and South Korea will impose sanctions against the DPRK. Perry did not rule out possible military pressure on the DPRK, but he believes that would run the risk of bringing about a large-scale war. If the U.S. and its allies impose sanctions against the DPRK, they will be "moderate and step-by-step ones," Perry said. The U.S. defense secretary noted that if the DPRK fulfills its international duty on the nuclear issue, the United States is ready to discuss the issue of the normalization of political and economic relations.
