The federal foreign minister emphasized that there was "no contradiction" between the national interests of German and European integration. On the contrary, the unifying Europe was "the right place to enforce vital German interests," Kinkel said. In Europe and even beyond Europe Germany is dependent on open competition. "Only that way can our economy fully use its strength," Kinkel explained. The foreign minister said that another reason why Germany needs Europe was that "due to our past, the world is watching us closely." He argued that without Europe reconstruction and prosperity would not have been possible after 1945. Now Germany must safeguard this prosperity together with Europe. Kinkel emphasized: "The European Union accounts for 1.3 percent of the surface of the earth, 6 percent of its population, but 22 percent of the international product. There is not much one could add to that." It is essential, therefore, to conclude the Economic and Monetary Union. Kinkel stressed, however, that the joint European currency must be as stable as the German mark -- "or we will not have one." At its meeting of representatives, the FDP agreed on the principles of its European policy, calling for more privatization, flexibility, and a fundamental reform of the social and tax system to make Germany more attractive as a European center for production and investment. To make sure that the European Union is accepted by the people it is inevitable that the community has a social dimension, though it must be developed "carefully." The establishment of levels for social benefits must not go beyond minimum standards. The less developed member states must be "given a chance to develop their social systems in accordance with their economic possibilities." The FDP principles also plead for a "reduction of over-regulation" in European environmental policy. The FDP representatives nominated Bundestag deputy Uta Wuerfel as their leading candidate for the European elections, while Mechthild von Alemann came second.
