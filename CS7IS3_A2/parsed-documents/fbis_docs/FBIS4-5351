Observing the meaningful day, our people and People's Army officers and men are filled with great pride and dignity of having the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is an iron-willed military leader, at the head of the country's defense forces and the revolutionary Armed Forces. They are replete with the impregnable resolve to achieve the reunification of the fatherland and complete the chuche revolutionary cause to the end under the leadership of the comrade supreme commander. The election of KPA [Korean People's Army] supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il as chairman of the DPRK National Defense Committee at the fifth session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly held in April last year was the realization of the unanimous aspiration and burning desire of our people and People's Army officers and men to have their leader at the head of the defense forces and follow him. [applause] As everyone knows, whether or not the long-cherished desire of a sovereign state which builds socialism while repelling anti- revolutionary offensives by the imperialist aggressive forces and reactionaries is accomplished depends on the greatness of a leader [yongdoja]. History tells us that a country and nation with a great leader always prevail over both politics and defense, however those without a great leader [yongdoja] cannot defend independence and sovereignty, and, moreover, cannot complete its just revolutionary cause. In light of this, the people link the name of a leader with the fate of a nation and that of revolution, and convinced in tomorrow's victory, considering it as their greatest fortune to have a great leader. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--who has led the party, the state, and the revolutionary Armed Forces at the head from his early years -- wisely led the historic cause of modelling the whole party and the entire Army of the whole society after the chuche idea. He thus accumulated immortal accomplishments which will shine forever in the history of the fatherland. [applause] In particular, the achievements accumulated by the dear comrade leader on the road to strengthening and developing our revolutionary Armed Forces into a revolutionary Armed Forces of one-a-match-for-100 by firmly consolidating the country's defense power, are innumerably enormous. Highly upholding the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who accumulated great achievements in fulfilling the chuche socialist cause and (?overall) construction cause at the head of the self- reliant defense power, is another historical milestone in the people's security, firmly defending the revolutionary cause, and in victoriously advancing our revolution. [applause] By upholding the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is a great military commander, at the supreme head of the defense power, our people and the People's Army were able to firmly guarantee the work to further defend the chuche socialist system ever so strong and accelerate the completion of the chuche revolutionary cause at a new high stage. [applause] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Comrade Kim Chong-il has an indomitable will and courage, and outstanding intelligence and commanding art as befits the supreme commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces. This guarantees the constant strengthening and development of our revolutionary Armed Forces and their ever-victorious advance. The dear comrade leader is embodying at a lofty level the trait of an extraordinary military strategy and outstanding military commander who can lead our people and the People's Army to be ever victorious. The first mission of a military commander leading the military and people is to present a correct military ideology and theory to correctly elucidate the road in the construction of the main force of the revolution and in the victory in the revolutionary war. Here, the greatness of the military commander is concentratedly manifested. Through his extraordinary wisdom and activities that were carried out without sleep and rest, which no one can follow, the dear comrade leader developed and enriched the chuche-oriented military ideology and theory that the great leader presented. Thus, he provided the most correct guiding principle in solving the military problems of our times. The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il formulated the military doctrine of the great leader as an integral one with chuche military idea, military theory, and military tactics as its keynote and has comprehensively developed it in depth, thus, brilliantly solving the urgent questions raised by military practice in the present times. [applause] Because of this immortal achievement by the dear comrade leader, the chuche-oriented military ideology and theory were both in name and reality clearly proven as a new and unique military doctrine that is the most scientific and revolutionary military doctrine based on the man-centered philosophical theory. The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il developed and enriched the chuche-oriented military ideology into a new doctrine and propositions. In particular, based on the theory of the revolutionary outlook on the leader, he presented a unique military construction ideology that the working-class revolutionary Army is in essence an army of the leader and army of the party. This truly has important significance in building, strengthening, and developing the working-class revolutionary Armed Forces into a revolutionary Armed Forces that truly serves the party, the leader, and cause of socialism. The profound and multifaceted military ideologies and theories elucidated by the dear comrade leader are the most scientific and revolutionary military ideology and theory, all based on the chuche revolutionary theory. Therefore, it is being elucidated as an ever-victorious military (?valuable sword). Saying that the new era has ushered in with the end of the Cold War era, the imperialists and the renegades of the revolution are babbling about the so-called new military doctrine. In view of today's complicated situation, our people and People's Army are truly fortunate to possess the ever-victorious precious military sword which is running thoroughly with revolutionary spirit and scientific accuracy. [applause] Amid all sorts of rampant wave of antirevolutionary opportunism, our revolutionary Armed Forces are firmly adhering to their revolutionary character of being chuche-type revolutionary Armed Forces, and staunchly defending the socialist cause under the banner of chuche military idea, without knowing about trivial deviation of difficulties. With an outstanding and tested commanding art, the respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the whole party, all the people, and the entire Army to implement our party's line of self-reliant defense. In doing so, the defense capabilities of the nation have been consolidated rock firm in all aspects. Powerful self-reliant national defense power is a military guarantee that defends the national sovereignty from the imperialists' aggression, and that enables us to build the socialism and communism triumphantly. All-people defense system and powerful self-reliant national defense power--which firmly defends the sovereignty of the country and the nation by smashing any formidable imperialist enemy with our own power--are unthinkable without the excelled and tested leadership of the respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause] The People's Army is the core of the self-reliant national defense power. The major work our party has always given top priority to is bringing up the People's Army as the ranks of loyalty who sacrifice their life for the party and the leader [suryong] and as an indomitable army which can smash any enemy. The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has set forth the program of army construction on modelling the entire Army after the chuche idea. By so doing, he has provided a firm guarantee whereby our revolutionary Armed Forces can be brought up as an indomitable army defeating any formidable imperialist enemy as the party's true army, a revolutionary army, endlessly loyal to the party and the leader [suryong]. Likewise, in conformity with the requirements of modelling the entire Army after the chuche idea, he has given definite precedence to the party's monolithic ideological system and the monolithic system of guidance in the military construction and every domain of military activities. He has put big emphasis on strengthening the work of educating the spirit of loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong] among the officers. In this way, he has firmly ensured the unitary of the leader's ideology and leadership in every work of the People's Army, and achieved the entire Army's single-hearted unity, and made the entire Army have the faith of loyalty to the extent they would sacrifice their life for the party and the leader. The might of the revolutionary Army is a political, ideological might and this can only be highly demonstrated when it is connected with modern military techniques. The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has given decisive precedence to the work to firmly prepare the People's Army politically, ideologically while energetically organizing and leading the work to strengthen the People's Army militarily and technically. Thanks to our party's energetic leadership, today our People's Army has grown in strength and developed into invincible revolutionary Armed Forces with all services and arms, powerful means of strike and defense and unique tactics of chuche, which are sufficient for any modern warfare. The ever-victorious might of the People's Army lies in that the whole Army has one loyal heart to defend the party and the leader with death, closely united with one idea and one purpose, and are firmly prepared militarily and technically to defeat any formidable enemy. [applause] One of the great military achievements of dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has further wisely led the chuche-based cause of the founding of the Army, is having so firmly consolidated our People's Army in political, ideological, military, and technological aspects. [applause] In addition to strengthening the People's Army in all aspects, comrade dear leader brilliantly armed all the people and turned the entire country into a fortress, firmly set up an all-people and all-nation defense system in the entire country, built up a powerful self-reliant defense industry, and wisely led the huge work of resolutely coping with the enemies' new war provocative moves. Today, the civilian Armed Forces, including the Red Worker-Peasant Militia and Red Youth Guards, are generally firmly consolidated, and the entire nation literally turned into an impregnable fortress. And, because our own strong self-defensive national defense industry has been built, we have today come to have the capability of further improving the country's defense forces with our own strength if we made up our mind to do so. Along with this, the tradition of the people-army unity is fully blooming on a new, higher level and the ideological and willful cohesion between the army and the people is further firmly consolidated. The two troop reviews commemorating the 40th anniversary of the victory in fatherland liberation war and the 60th anniversary of the founding of the KPA, which left a record of a brilliant chapter of our revolution's chronicle, were active displays of the indomitable might of our self-reliant defense power with the People's Army as the core. This gave trust of victory to our people and the world's revolutionary people, and anxiety and fear to the enemies. The proud reality, in which none of the opponents dare to intrude the self-reliant national defense power that has been built under the extraordinarily difficult condition of building socialism amid constant risk of the U.S. imperialists' aggression and war, is a brilliant fruition of the outstanding and tested leadership of the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander. [applause] The greatness of a sagacious general is highlighted by the practice of leading the army and the people with peerless courage and outstanding wisdom to gain supremacy over the enemies' offensives, and of reliably defending the country's independence and the nation's dignity. Our country is an arena of the most acute confrontation on earth between revolution and antirevolution, and socialism and capitalism, and dark and heavy clouds of war constantly float around the Korean peninsula. However, our people and the People's Army have smashed [chitpusida] every step of the enemies' antirevolutionary offensive and reliably defended the independence right of the country and the gains of revolution under the wise leadership of the party and the leader. In confrontation with the enemies, dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, who wholly embodied the wisdom of a great sagacious general, has always gained supremacy over the enemies with wonderful and brilliant strategies and tactics and put the exhausted enemies on the defensive. In recent years, whenever the enemies conducted the Team Spirit war exercise, our country was laid in a situation of ultra-tension [choginjang] in a brink of war. Without the slightest hesitation and vacillation, our people and the People's Army fought to repulse them every time and made every step of the rascals' war exercises commotion stumble because they were led by the comrade supreme commander who has iron-clad will and peerless courage. The truth is that when the leader of revolution is great and the military sagacious leader is extraordinary, the people and the army can display independent spirit hundreds and thousands times more and become mighty people and indomitably strong army, is proven by our people's eloquent revolutionary practices today. The spirit of national independence, and revolution and militant trait of our people and the People's Army under the leadership of the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is an extraordinary sagacious general, are displayed today on an unprecedentedly lofty level. Today, our people and the officers and men of the People's Army are fully blossoming the revolutionary army trait of fulfilling to the end the invincibility of jumping into water and fire if it is an order of the comrade supreme commander, and the virtue of army-people unity in which the army and the people are upholding the party through complete unity. Only the great chuche idea--our party's revolutionary ideology--dominates in our revolutionary ranks, and in every hearts of our people and the officers and men of the People's Army, they are overflowing with the firm faith of sharing their fate with the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander. The trait of attaching great importance to the military in the whole society and the trait of faithfully learning the military affairs is overflowing, and the country has truly changed into an impregnable fortress. [applause] Even under the condition in which the imperialists tried to commit aggressive maneuvers at any time at all to crush [apsal] the small countries through forcible measures and threat, our party and people were vigorously advancing the socialist cause, with the faith of victory, because we were provided with a truly strong defense capacity and an invincibly strong army. Our country, which has a small territory and a small population, smashed [chitbusigo] all kinds of challenges of the imperialists and reactionaries and defended the nation's dignity. Therefore, all the victories achieved to advance the socialist cause are a great victory of the dear Comrade Kim Chong-il's, the great leader [yongdoja] of our party and people, iron-like faith and will, extraordinary strategy and tactic, and outstanding military strategy. [applause] Through this significant meeting, filled with the utmost admiration and blazing loyalty, on behalf of all the people and the officers and men of the People's Army, I would like to give the greatest honor and warmest thanks to the dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission and supreme commander of the KPA, who elucidated the dignity of the fatherland and nation through his extraordinary military ideology and refined leadership and always led our people and the People's Army toward the one road of victory and glory. [applause] Comrades: Today, our people and all the officers and men of the People's Army are faced with the heavy and honorary task of further consolidating the country's defense capacity like an impregnable fortress and to achieve ahead of schedule the fatherland's independent reunification and the ultimate victory of the chuche revolutionary cause in accordance with the demand of the prevailing situation. A tense situation in which a war may break out anytime prevails in our country at present because of the vicious antisocialist, antirepublic maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and other international reactionary forces. The U.S. imperialists, who had broken up [patan] the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, had the UN Security Council release the president's statement, which makes unjustifiable [tangchiannun] demands on us, and are more openly maneuvering to crush [apsal] us. Moreover, the U.S. imperialists are more frantically kicking up commotions for military pressure, while saying that they would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war. In step with them, the puppet South Korean clique intends to stage the nuclear war exercise against us at all cost and babbles that it would offer punitive retaliation [ungjing pobok] against us and use this as an opportunity to achieve reunification if it is necessary. The South Korean puppets put all the puppet armed forces on special alert and even made public a dangerous new plan to invade the North. Teaming up with the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, the Japanese reactionaries, as well, got more deeply involved in the maneuvers to ignite a fuse to a new war on the southern Korean peninsula. All facts show that the maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and other reactionaries to isolate and crush [apsal] our Republic have reached their extreme and that, as a result, a war may break out on the Korean peninsula anytime. However, any maneuver by the enemy cannot frighten our people and the People's Army, under the outstanding leadership of the great commander [yongjan]. If the bastards ignite a fuse to a war after all, our people and the People's Army, filled with a firm resolve to share the same destiny with the party, will resolutely tackle them head on and mercilessly sweep out [mujabihage ssuroborilgut] the enemy. [applause] Responding to the use of force with force and dialogue with dialogue is our firm will and policy [himenun himuro taehwaenun taehwaro tappyonhanun kossi uriui hwakko pudonghan uijiimyo chongchaegimnida]. The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys must not miscalculate [osan] our firm will and policy and act with discretion after clearly seeing the trend of the times. All the people and People's Army officers and men must vigorously wage the struggle to reliably defend the socialist fatherland and the revolutionary gains from the enemy's infringement [chimhae], build the country's defensive forces impregnable, and strengthen the People's Army into an invincible revolutionary army. The most important problem in effecting a bigger upsurge in the socialist construction while securing the chuche revolutionary cause by force of arms is brilliantly inheriting and developing our revolution's tradition of single-hearted unity. [applause] Single-hearted unity is the banner of victory and the primal basis of our revolution. Our single-hearted unity is the single-hearted unity which upholds the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il at the center of its unity with faith and filial duty, and is the everlasting single-hearted unity which does not move an inch even under any raging storm in the world. [applause] With strong faith that they will always win if there is the dear leader, all the people and People's Army officers and men must resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong] by becoming a shield of single-hearted unity and faithfully upholding the party's monolithic leadership. Firmly securing the chuche revolutionary cause by force of arms is the basic mission of the People's Army. The entire officers and men of the People's Army must make loyalty to the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander their faith, conscience, morality, and life by thoroughly arming themselves with the chuche idea. They must persistently hold fast to the party's line on modelling the entire Army after the chuche idea. Thus, they should strengthen the political, ideological might of the People's Army in every way. The officers of the People's Army must make the entire ranks overflowing with the revolutionary ethos of going through fire and water to carry through the comrade supreme commander's order and direction to the end and carrying out discipline, life, and learning the way the anti-Japanese guerrilla army did. They should also make the entire ranks overflowing with the traditional virtue of the unity between the officers and men, and the unity between the party and society. Furthermore, the officers of the People's Army must set up steel-like regulations inside the entire Army and prepare soldiers as one-a-match-for-100 fighters who are possessed of invulnerable power, military techniques, markermanship worthy of a crack shot, and adroit military strategy. They must ceaselessly modernize the armed equipments of the People's Army and further consolidate the military posts as an impregnable fortresses. Defending the socialist fatherland is an all-popular work. It is firm will of our people to vigorously push ahead with the socialist construction and the defense of the nation, holding a gun on one hand and a sickle and a hammer on another. [applause] Today's acute situation, in which provocative moves for a new war are endlessly perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique, calls on us to all the more firmly consolidate all-people, all-state defense system by thoroughly implementing our party's line on arming all the people and turning the entire country into a fortress. Our party members and workers must strongly arm themselves with our party's chuche-oriented view on war [chonjaenggwanjom] and firmly establish in the entire society a trait of attaching importance to military affairs and sincerely learning military affairs. By so doing, they must make thorough political and ideological, military, and material preparations against any unanticipated event on our own initiative [buruiui satae edo chudongjoguro taechohalssu innun chongchisasangjok chunbi kunsajok chunbi mulchilchok chunbirul pintumopsi kachuoya hagessumnida]. In particular, all the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards must cherish deep in their hearts great pride in being revolutionary warriors of the great general, strengthen combat and political training and, thus, defend their work places, villages, and schools with vigilance. The traditional beautiful trait of Army-people unity which is highly maintained today in our society is an expression of the noble idea and spirit that all people and the entire Army share the life and death and destiny with the comrade supreme commander under any stern trial. All people and officers and men of the People's Army must vigorously carry out the our guardpost is our village, our village is our guardpost movement and, thus, ensure that a beautiful trait be further fostered throughout the country in which the Army positively helps the people and in which the people sincerely assist the Army. By so doing, the Army and people must become one in flesh and spirit in the same trenches, resolutely punish the aggressors and, thus, again demonstrate the dignity and honor of the heroic Korea if the enemy dares to provoke a new war. [applause] The revolutionary economic strategy presented by our party is a banner of struggle to strengthen the overall national power and more highly display the superiority of popular masses-centered socialism of our own style. [applause] To thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy, we must highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. All party members and workers must score great upsurges in production and construction in hearty response to the party's militant slogan on vigorously accelerating the general onward socialist march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. The fatherland's reunification is the unanimous earnest desire of all Korean people and achieving the fatherland's reunification in the nineties without fail is our party's firm will. [applause] All people and officers and men of the People's Army must possess the belief that achieving the fatherland's reunification in the nineties is a certainty [hwakchongjok] because there is the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, resolutely crush [chippussida] the maneuvers by the antireunification forces, and more staunchly fight to hasten the fatherland's reunification. [applause] All Korean compatriots in the North and South and overseas must achieve strong unity under the banner of the 10-point program of great unity of the entire nation presented by the great leader and more boldly wage the struggle to prevent the danger of a new war and carry out the historic cause of the fatherland's reunification. A revolutionary road is far and turbulent, and our future road may be fraught with trials and adversities. However, we are not afraid of any trial. Our people and People's Army are filled with the firm belief that they, just like they did in the past, will be ever-victorious in the future, as well, because they uphold respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head of the party and revolutionary armed forces [[kyongaehanun kim chong-il tongjirul tanggwa hyongmyongmuryogui suwie mosigoitkie]. No matter how frantically the imperialists and reactionaries try to isolate and crush [korip apsal] our Republic, all progressive people of the world who love justice and peace will be on our side, and our socialism, the chuche-oriented socialism, which defeated all trials in history, will win victory after victory. [applause] For socialism to win victory and for imperialism to be ruined is the law of the development of history. Let us all be single-heartedly united around respected and beloved Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il and more vigorously fight for a victory in the socialist cause, the fatherland's independent reunification, and the ultimate completion of the chuche revolutionary cause. [applause] Long live the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, chairman of the DPRK National Defense Committee and supreme commander of the KPA! [applause]
