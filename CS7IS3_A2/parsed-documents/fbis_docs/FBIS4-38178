According to Minister Shulamit Aloni, the prime minister approved the visit. At the same time, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said this morning that this is not about a theater performance; rather, the Sha'th visit is a political demonstration by the PLO, and he will have no part of it. Minister Aloni said that at this stage, Jerusalem is a religious issue and that there is nothing more wonderful than having the capital of the Jewish people open to all. Olmert said he is pleased that in his meeting with the prime minister yesterday they did not deal with philosophy, because the issues at hand are political. The Jerusalem mayor said he is pleased with what he heard from the prime minister, but added that he gives Mr. Rabin and the government six months to prove their intentions in deeds, such as allocating resources for the city, expanding construction there, building roads, and developing the education system in both parts of the city. Aloni and Olmert spoke to Qol Yisra'el this morning.
