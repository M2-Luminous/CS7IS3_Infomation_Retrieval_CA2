The last address was in parliament at the beginning of June 1993. At that time, I insistently requested the National Assembly to give priority to adopting the fundamental laws on the court, the police, and state employees, as well as the necessary amendments to the Penal and Penal Procedural Codes. All of this had to be done in order to stop organized crime, which threatens us more and more every day. Unfortunately, certain deputies at the time viewed my address as a populist move, aimed to enhance my popularity, rather than an attempt on my part to seek a constructive solution to the problems. Now -- seven months later and after a series of dramatic events that showed the existence of organized crime in a dangerous scope and the elements of the Mafia, or at least the existence of preconditions of a Mafia emergence -- the same people pretend to be surprised and try to pass the responsibility off to the executive power, mostly to the police. I am far from exonerating the police and the executive power, because they bear a large part of the responsibility. However, I am puzzled by the fact that, while a danger exists for the legal order in our country, responsible institutions, political forces, and individual politicians continue to seek political dividends in the tragedy that occurred. Instead of realizing their own responsibility for the country's situation, they pass the guilt on to each other -- the parliament to the police and the government, the police to the court and the Prosecutor's Office, the court and the Prosecutor's Office to the court and the investigative bodies, the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] to the Union of the Democratic Forces [SDS], the SDS to the BSP, and so forth. This game is extremely dangerous, perhaps even lethal, for the state. I would like to remind you that crime does not distinguish between party colors and political convictions. It is directed against each one of us. Therefore, the political forces and the state institutions must not mutually seek each other's shortcomings but should unite their efforts against organized crime and corruption, with each one doing their share of the work. The cabinet, being the executive power, must show whether it really can govern and whether it has the courage and will to implement its functions and guarantee order and calm in the country, as well as preserve the citizens' lives, property, honor, and dignity. The parliament, which for two years now has violated the constitutional requirements of anything related to the judicial system structure, must finally adopt with priority the necessary amendments to the Penal and Penal Procedural Codes, the bill on the judiciary's structure, and the bill on the state employee. Without adopting the bill on the judicial system and really and fully completing the structure of this system with a supreme administrative court, a supreme court of appeals, and local courts of appeals, Bulgaria will not have an independent and efficient judiciary that could battle against organized crime and the budding Mafia. We expect the police, investigative authorities, the Prosecutor's Office, and the courts to immediately adopt energetic and bold steps aimed at imprisoning the criminals. I insist that all cases of overt banditry be investigated rapidly and without any pity. The corrupt and inefficient employees of the Ministry of Interior, especially the leadership, must go in order to preserve the honor of the Bulgarian policemen who work under exceptionally grave conditions. There are too many responsible state officials and politicians who send nameless denunciations and speak anonymously about corruption and crime in the realm of the executive. Taking its cue from those denunciations, the press constantly write about corruption in the high echelons of the power. By doing so, certain newspapers are trying to suggest that all those who work there are corrupt. It is high time to speak clearly, precisely, and openly on this matter and point out specific names, facts, and documents. It is high time for the political forces to adopt their share of the responsibility, rather than wash their hands with political declarations and statements against crime. They must adopt the necessary laws in the parliament, as well as identify any corrupt politicians in their own ranks. This must be done, because there is nothing more pathetic than political forces that claim they are struggling against crime and yet they simultaneously tolerate people in their ranks who own a large-size financial property of an unclear origin. It is not the Bulgarian citizens who should fear the criminals who walk free, but rather the criminals should fear the law and understand that wherever they hide, the judiciary will find them and punish them. As far as I am concerned, I will not leave a single state institution or service in peace that could assist in the struggle against crime until it begins to service appropriately.
