In a statement today, Sha'th said the Palestinian forces are not ready to enter Gaza and Jericho. He said they will first come to Egypt from several Arab countries. The Palestinian official called on the donor states to meet their obligations now, not after the signing of the agreement. He said the Palestinians need cash to finance arrangements for the entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza and Jericho. Sha'th said Norway is the only country to pay for the Palestinian police. It has paid $2 million. The other donor countries have not met their obligations, he said. Sha'th said the water issue will be discussed at the Civilian Affairs Committee in the next round of negotiations. Nasr Yusuf, a PLO military commander, has stated that the vanguards of the Palestinian police force, who were scheduled to enter Gaza and Jericho, will not now go there due to problems facing the negotiations. He said there has been no agreement on the final size of the police force or the timetable for its entry into the self-rule areas. Yusuf said the Israelis are linking agreement on the start of the negotiations with the signing of an agreement on the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [sentence as received]. The Palestinian official denied that the two sides agreed that the Palestinian police force should consist of 9,000 men. In a related development, MENA has learned that difficulties appearing at the last minute prevented Israeli officers from handing over Israeli police barracks to PLO representatives in Gaza.
