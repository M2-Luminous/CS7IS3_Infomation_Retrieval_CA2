FR940414-1-00090 FR940414-1-00010 Table 21._ National Estimates of Employment Losses and Possible Offsetting Employment Gains Based on Analysis of All Subcategory C Facilities Under PSES Option 3/S.1 1‚ê£ 1Estimated values (full-time equivalents) Estimated employment losses under option 3/S.1: Employment losses from facility closures 356 Employment losses from line conversions 209 Total PFPR facility employment losses 688 Estimated labor requirements and possible offsetting employment gains under option: Labor requirements for manufacturing compliance equipment 115 Labor requirements for installing compliance equipment 44 Labor requirements for operating compliance equipment 52 n,s Total labor requirements for PFPR regulatory compliance 211 4. Cost-Effectiveness of Option 3/S.1 The Agency estimated the cost-effectiveness of Option 3/S.1. The cost-effectiveness was conservatively estimated by considering the costs of removing the non-272 PAI wastewater pollutants and the 272 PAIs, but considering the number of toxic pounds removed only for the 272 PAIs. The analysis therefore understates the cost-effectiveness of the proposed option. To the extent that removals of non-272 PAI wastewater pollutants are achieved, the proposed option will be far more cost-effective than presented here. The estimated total annualized cost of Option 3/S.1 is $43.9 million in 1981 dollars. Option 3/S achieved an estimated 12,134,045 pounds-equivalent of pollutant removals. The average cost-effectiveness of Option 3/S.1 considering only the 272 PAIs is $3.62 per pound equivalent. EPA estimates that the proposed option will remove an additional 198,519 unweighted pounds of non-272 PAIs that are not accounted for in the cost-effectiveness calculation. Thus, the actual cost per toxic pound-equivalent removed should be significantly less than the $3.62 presented here. Use of toxic weighting factors provides insight into the significance of pollutant discharges under the proposed sanitizer exemption. As a result of the exemption under Option 3/S.1, total removals are reduced by 1,036 pounds relative to the zero discharge requirement of Option 3 with the additonal non 272 PAIs taken into account. However, when evaluated on a toxic-weighted basis, the reduction in removals is only 196 pounds-equivalent per year. This amount is only 0.002 percent of the industry toxic-weighted loadings of the 272 PAIs that would be removed by this regulation (about 12 million toxic weighted pounds). If toxic-weighted removals of non-272 PAIs were included in this comparison, the percentage of toxic-weighted pounds exempt from this regulation would be even less. M. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Under the terms of Executive Order 12866, this action was submitted to OMB for review. N. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed effluent guidelines and standards contain no new information collection activities and, therefore, no information collection request (ICR) will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
