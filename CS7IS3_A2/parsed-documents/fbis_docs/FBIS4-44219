Eguigaray described his visit to a country with 13 percent economic growth and that offers major targets for Spanish industry as "lengthy and fruitful." The minister also said that the visit sought to boost and consolidate relations with China following the establishment of economic cooperation and a sizeable credit channel during the 1993 visit to that country by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
