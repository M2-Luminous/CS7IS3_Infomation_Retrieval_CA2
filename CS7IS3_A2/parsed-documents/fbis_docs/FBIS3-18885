Lieutenant General Jose Faura Martin, good evening. [Martin] Good evening. [Nunez] You took over the job of Army chief of staff 20 days ago, and since then you have wanted to visit the Spanish blue helmets and the area where they are deployed. You have visited them on the day a Spanish military plane was hit by antiaircraft fire over the Krajina region. How do you evaluate this incident? [Martin] I think that it is an isolated incident because the situation here -- as far as I have seen it -- is fairly calm and under control, all things considered. That said, I think that such acts will not be avoidable for some time. And these acts cast a shadow on the peace and calm for which we are aiming. But I do not think it should be taken too seriously. [Nunez] So, apart from these isolated incidents, your assessment of how the conflict is evolving is positive? [Martin] In the area I have seen, yes. That is where the Spanish battalion is, yes, definitively yes. It is going well, very well. [Nunez] Would you say there is reason to hope for peace soon? [Martin] Yes, I think so. If it continues to go, as up until now, since the signing of the agreement, yes. One sees more normal life in the cities. Your colleague has said there were trams running in Sarajevo for the first time today. This means life is returning to normal in the area. [Nunez] You mention the normalization of the conflict but it also means our blue helmets have more work to do. The defense minister said they are working to 100 percent of their capacity. [Martin] That is true. Now that the Neretva route is opened -- that is the one we control -- the number of convoys is up, missions have been increased, and so our men are working to the hilt. Despite this, they are all in good spirits, morale is good, and the atmosphere in this Spanish unit is magnificent. [Nunez] The blue helmets have more work, does this mean that they are more at risk? [Martin] No, no, I think the risk has diminished. There is more work but there is less risk. [Nunez] Mr. Faura, the defense minister has said that a small additional contingent -- about 100 men -- might be sent to the area where our blue helmets are deployed. Considering the situation on the ground, would this be enough men? [Martin] I do not know, because the decision to send more men is a political decision in which I have no part. I will report back about what I have seen, I will inform the minister, and he will make his decision. I can not say right now what he will decide to do. [Nunez] Anyway, one can say that there is not only more work to be done, but the work is more important. [Martin] No, I would say the work is just as important as before but now there is more activity, there are more convoy escorts, more checkpoints. There have been new deployments in areas where we could not have people before -- this means it is safer to have more detachments -- but this does not make our mission more important than before. [Nunez] In April, the Madrid Group [name of current Spanish blue helmet contingent] will be replaced by the Cordoba Group. What will this new contingent find? What will you tell the new units that are going to go to the former Yugoslavia? [Martin] I think they will find a completely different situation to the one the Madrid Group found on arrival, a calmer situation, with maybe new missions, maybe more activities, but with less risk. Luckily. [Nunez] Lieutenant General Jose Faura Martin, Army chief of staff, thank you for answering the call of Radio Nacional de Espana. [Martin] Thank you. Goodnight. [Nunez] Goodnight.
