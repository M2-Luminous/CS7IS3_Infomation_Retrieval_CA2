As a BELINFORM reporter has learned, few of the candidates for the state's top post will clear the hurdle of amassing 100,000 signatures. For example, as of 11 May, the signature hurdle was cleared only by enthusiasts supporting Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich and Communist Party Chairman Vasyl Novikaw. More than 160,000 Belarusians signed the petition in support of the first candidate, and 115,000 of the second. According to the number of supporters, the initiative group supporting Stanislaw Shushkevich ranks next in line. That group has already collected 90,000 signatures. According to the headquarters for support of [opposition leader] Zyanon Paznyak, it is too early to release information on their campaign. The other initiative groups simply do not cooperate with the Central Election Committee for Presidential Elections.
