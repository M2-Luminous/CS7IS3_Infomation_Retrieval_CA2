The report includes recorded extracts of proposal papers read by six delegates from the political parties. First, U Sai Soe Nyunt, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy [SNLD], presents his party's proposal paper on the chapter headings relating to the state, state structure, and head of state. Referring to the chapter heading on state structure, he recalls that "at the National Convention Plenary Session held on 13 August 1993, the SNLD proposed that the Union of Myanmar be composed of Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Bamah [Burmese], Mon, Rakhine, and Shan States, which are equal. In other words, the Union should be comprised of eight states. The chairman of the National Convention Convening Work Committee prescribed that under the new constitution, the existing seven divisions should be formed into seven regions and the seven existing states should be formed into seven states, and that the said seven regions and seven states should have equal status. Therefore, this principle is different from our policy." He suggests some nomenclature changes to be made to suit the times. He proposes that Union state [pyi-daung-su pyi-ne] be changed to national state [amyotha pyi-ne], autonomous state [ko- paing ok-chok-ya pyi-ne] be changed to autonomous region [ko-paing ok-chok-ya de-tha], and ethnic state [lu-myo-zu pyi-ne] be changed to national area [lu-myo-zu ne-mye]. He proposes that members of the Union should be organized into these three categories. Addressing the issue of power sharing, U Sai Soe Nyunt suggests that "union states who are members of the Union shall be given political autonomy. The states shall not be allowed to exercise sovereignty, however." He proposes further that "autonomous regions be given administrative autonomy," and that "national areas be given cultural autonomy." He says: "The principle of a Union based on equal opportunity and status and the second point relating to full self-determination for the states are two issues that constitute the very heart of the Union. In other words, it is the very essence of the spirit of Panglong, and it should not be left out. Therefore, every time the issue of the Union is raised, it is necessary to scrutinize constantly whether it is based on the spirit of Panglong. The Panglong Treaty was signed in a spirit of unity." U Sai Soe Nyunt explains that "in order to ensure checks and balances between the two chambers of Parliament, it is necessary to have Bamah State, which is comprised of seven regions. Only then can the two chambers control and balance each other and serve the country's interests by legislating laws acceptable to all." Continuing, he says if some national races are granted autonomous regions for various reasons while other national races are not given the same status, despite meeting the requirements, the latter will be resentful and it will not benefit the Union. He says: "The British used the divide-and-rule strategy, and we will be accused of using the tactics of separate-and-rule in our era." Therefore, it is proposed that if the status of autonomous region is to be granted at all, it should be based on common criteria and fairness. He says it will be necessary to consider the wishes and demands of the national races who were ignored when the constitutions of 1947 and 1974 were drafted. "These national races are the Tai Lai, Tai Nae, Tai Mau, Tai Sar, Tai Hkamti, Tai Kadu, Tai Kannan, and Tai Kuan -- various groups of Tai Lian race -- who are spread throughout upper Sagaing Division and lower Kachin State." The Tai Lian are a non-Kachin race whose existence has been ignored. They were known as a Shan-Bamah race living along the railway line in Sagaing Division and Kachin State and their original name of Tai Lian has been forgotten for over 40 years. He says these groups of Tai Lian meet the requirements to have a Tai Lian autonomous region. He "appeals for the third time publicly that the following areas be declared as constituting the Tai Lian autonomous region: All plains in Bhamo, Momauk, Mansi, Shwegu in Bhamo District; in Myitkyina, Waingmaw, Mogaung, Mohnyin, Kamaing, (Mumkuam) of Tanai in Myitkyina District; the former territory of Wuntha Sawbwa in Katha, Indaw, Tigyaing, Banmauk, Kawlin, Wuntha, and Pinlebu in Katha District; Kale, Paungbyin, Tamu, Kalewa, Mawlaik, and (Mokang) in Kale District; and the former territory of Hkamti Sawbwa in Hkamti, Homalin, and Namyun." He then proposes that a commission composed of honorable and impartial persons be formed by the state in order to ascertain the genuine wishes regarding self-administered areas. He says if self- administered divisions are granted legislative power they should have a legislature. In such cases, there will be too many legislatures and it will contradict the principles mentioned by the work committee chairman -- each region and state should have their own legislature. Therefore, he proposes self-administered divisions not be given legislative power. Addressing the chapter heading on head of state, U Sai Soe Nyunt says: "We accept the principle that the president is the head of state. We differ in opinion, however, on the president's powers. We want the president as a ceremonial head of state as in the 1947 Constitution. We want the parliamentary form of government headed by a prime minister." Continuing, he says: "If it is determined that the presidential system is the most suitable for our country, it is suggested that the president be elected directly by the people, as in the United States and the Philippines. A person eligible to be elected as a member of parliament should also be eligible to become president. Therefore, we should prescribe the principle that a person who meets the age requirement and whose parents are both citizens meets the requirement for the post of president. There should be no other requirements." U Sai Soe Nyunt concludes his report by saying that "it is the firm belief of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy that members of state organs who are to administer the people should be freely elected and appointed by the people themselves." Next, U Thein Tun, a member of the group representing elected representatives from the National Unity Party, reads his paper. He first discusses the chapter heading on the state and requirements for self-administered areas to be formed in the regions and states under the new constitution. He suggests that a decision on the matter first be obtained from the convention. He supports the proposal that "the capital city of Yangon [Rangoon] be declared a union territory under the direct administration of the president." Continuing, he expresses his support for the procedures for electing the president suggested by the work committee chairman. He suggests that the president and vice presidents be allowed a second term, that they not be allowed to accept any other professional posts or allowed to hold shares in economic enterprises, and that they be allowed to declare a list of their assets and those of their family to the Union Parliament each year. He concludes his report by offering to work for the success of the National Convention through consultation and cooperation and with magnanimity and mutual trust. After a recess, the plenary session resumes at 1210. U San Hla, a member of the elected representatives delegate group from the Union Pa-O National Organization, reads his group's report. He supports the formation of the state as a union. He points out the imperfections of the prime minister as a head of state in previous administrations and endorses the proposal for a presidential system of government. Next, independent representative U Htaung Kho Htan reads the first part of a collective report by himself, U Yankyin Maw of the Shan State Kokang Democratic Party, and independent representatives Dr. Hmu Tang. He expresses the need to prohibit racial and religious discrimination in the new democratic state. His group report proposes that the name region not be used, and that all 14 states and divisions should be called states. He supports the basic principle on the formation of self-administered divisions or self- administered zones and proposes the need for prescribing "self- administered areas for the Kokang, Danu, Pa-O, Palaung, Bamar, and Wa nationals from Shan State; Chin, Kuki Chin, and Naga Chin nationals from Sagaing Division; and Asho Chin nationals living in Magwe Division and Arakan State." He also suggests the formation of a commission to determine self-administered areas. Dr. Hmu Tang reads the second part of the report. He proposes that the capital should be Rangoon and that is should consist of Sanchaung, Bahan, Kemmendine, Hlaing, Insein, Mingaladon, Dawbon, Yankin, Tamwe, Thaketa, Thingangyun, South Okkalapa, North Okkalapa, Mayangon, Ahlone, Pazundaung, Kyauktada, Mingalataungnyunt, Dagon, Lanmadaw, Pabedan, Botataung, Latha, Seikkan, and Kamayut townships. The capital should be a union territory administered by a mayor, elected by the people residing in the townships, and a city council. He says the basic principle of the president being the national leader of all national races should not be adopted, explaining that the status of national leader does not belong to a person just because he is a president. It is a status automatically designated by the people to honor heroes for their selfless service to the people and country. He also objects to the basic principal that the president should live in the country for at least 20 consecutive years to be eligible for election. He says it only depends on "loyalty to the country and people, love for the country, and goodwill toward the country." If the 20-year rule is adopted, it will be like closing the door of opportunity on the 20 million Burmese women who will never be able to get on the political stage. He proposes electing a president or vice president by rotating among the elected representatives based on equal representation from the Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Bamar, Mon, Arakan, and Shan. He finally proposes that any vice president who is not subsequently elected should not serve as vice president. U San Tha Aung, an elected representative from the Mro, or Khami National Solidarity Organization [MKNSO], is scheduled present his report next. Becuase he is a member of the panel of chairmen, he is excused from reading his report, and with the approval of the alternate chairman his report is put on record. The television announcer presents extracts of his report. The report proposes that the Wa; Pa-O; Palaung; Mro, or Khami; Kokang; Lahu; Naga; Rawan; Kayan; Akhar; Lihsu; and Danu national races should be allowed to have self-administered divisions. The report says the Mro national race has lived in a congruous territory in "Pauktaw, Ponnagyun, Mrauk-U, Buthidaung, Maungdaw, Rathedaung, and Kyauktaw townships of Northern Arakan State, and Paletwa township in Southern Chin State, with an estimated population of 150,000." The report also proposes that a Mro self-administered division should be established not by a commission but by the delegates. In the report, he supports the work committee's proposals on electing the president and vice presidents and adds a proposal that "in accordance with the constitution, the president and vice presidents should be given suitable remuneration, benefits, and housing." The plenary session ends at 1415.
