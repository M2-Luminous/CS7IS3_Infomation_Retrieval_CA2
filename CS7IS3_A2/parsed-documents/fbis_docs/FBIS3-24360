So, Sergey Vyacheslavovich, how are things going with you at Radio Russia? How are you able to stay afloat? It is said that there are plans to cut your appropriations sharply. [Davydov] I cannot answer anything about this question today. It is very frightening. Some figures were mentioned recently--50 percent of the needed financing, now--32 percent, in my opinion... I have simply stopped thinking about it, because this is all promises, not money. What are we living on now? On the money that we earn. That is earned by the entire television and radio company, not only radio. Of course, there is not enough money. But you get tired more of the uncertainty... They should already have decided exactly how many hours of broadcasting are needed. If 22 hours are not needed, like now, but five, then let it be five. But these five hours a day must have full financing. In exactly the same way, it should be decided clearly how many state radio broadcasting channels are required. As is known, there are now five of them. [Moroz] Does it not seem to you that radio is dying out, being squeezed out by television, and that it is being perceived more and more frequently as some kind of half-finished product--a phonogram without "pictures?" [Davydov] No, it does not seem that way. I think that radio will die when the last cultured person dies. Just what is a television "picture?" It is a means of making up for our laziness: After hearing some text, we are too lazy to think and do some additional imagining of what was heard; and so the task is made easier for us, we are given an image. Therefore, in particular, television theater and radio theater are completely different things. And radio theater is the same kind of cultural possession as television theater. Like the drama theater. What is more, there are after all genre theater and purely radio theater. For example, literary readings. There is a special radio audience. The blind, invalids... In addition, I suspect that today the number of radio listeners is growing. Imagine the television set breaking down; it is very expensive to repair now, so a person is limited to the radio set... Of course, radio, as well as television, is experiencing elements of a crisis, but it seems to me that the crisis in radio--in a cultural sense--is not that severe. [Moroz] In what, nonetheless, do you see this crisis? [Davydov] In many things. In particular, the departure of announcers of the old school and the arrival of journalists at the microphone has reduced the level of broadcasting culture somewhat. Errors have become more frequent... [Moroz] You understand, of course, that I asked the question about the possible death of radio exclusively for the sake of sharpening the conversation, and in order to provoke your professional pride. Nonetheless, do radio journalists not have a feeling of decline and second-grade status in comparison with television workers? After all, the whole country knows those who are on the air continuously. A person could be a rather average journalist, but the feeling is such that this is a dominant influence. Briefly, it is more prestigious to work in television than in radio. In such a case, do you not suffer from turncoats? [Davydov] The idea of the second-grade status of radio in comparison with television exists more outside the professional environment of radio journalists. We have had people who moved over to television, but not that many. Isolated cases. And they are journalists who did not become professionals in radio. A person who has worked in radio for a dozen or so years, as a rule, no longer aspires to television. He understands that radio is ANOTHER type of journalism, another type of art. It is like moving from opera to ballet. After all, there are opera and ballet theaters, and these seem to be close things. Close, but not very. But the attitude of the state and society toward radio really is like toward something secondary. It is remembered as a last resort, in periods of putsches and right after them, when television has distinctly exhausted its resources. At that time a stream of high-standing visitors rushes to us. They are all amazed at what squalor we live in and antiquated equipment we have, and they promise us the moon, but, naturally, as soon as the crisis situation passes they forget about their promises. [Moroz] What do you consider the framework of your radio day to be? What are its pivotal programs. And what are the main ideas that you put into your broadcasting? [Davydov] Of course, hourly information releases constitute the framework. It not we who make them--they are made by the Radio Russia information service. But this is the framework. Then we create our fillers. Firstly, the morning programs. Basically, journal and musical. Then there are the daily programs. These are children's and do-it-yourself programs. "Interlocutor" left us for Radio 1, and the "Home Academy" do-it-yourself program appeared. How to build a house, how to keep house, how to feed the family... The need for such programs is being felt more and more now. Politics is already starting to get boring. The "Author's Channel 'From the First Person'" grew out of the five hours of our first underground political broadcasting in 1990-1991. This is our main political program. Its title speaks for itself. This is an authors' radio, if you wish. After 1800 a block starts that, perhaps, is dearest to me--I hope employees who work on other programs are not offended by me--the artistic broadcasting block. Here even social and political journalism is done with a nuance of art. And at 2220 the purely hip youth program "Four Fourths" starts. It continues until 0200. It, of course, has its own problems, but the main thing is that there was nothing like this on radio. Although many of us grew up on the radio station Youth. Frankly, when this program started up, there was resistance--and tremendous resistance--from a number of listeners and a listlessly intelligent resistance on the part of the management of the company. But the young people, nonetheless, showed that there should be such a youth program. We still do not use it as an element of political propaganda, but I fear that it will be necessary to use it in this capacity as well: The mood among youth is an important factor in politics. [Moroz] What is the balance here between serious and entertainment programs, between culture and popular culture, for which you are striving in your broadcasting? [Davydov] Popular culture and entertainment is now concentrated here mainly, perhaps, in the "Four Fourths" program that I mentioned. There are also elements of entertainment in the morning program "The Beginning," although I would not call it entertaining. This year we changed the approach to thematic programs somewhat. They still were somewhat heavy. We cut their time to 15-20 minutes. And we expanded the musical flow of sound. Mainly at the expense of classical music and retrospective reviews. Moreover, it became clear that we hit the nail on the head here. There is a strong nostalgia in our society with respect to the 1960's and 1970's. It is also happy with retrospective music. But the classics are classics. The need for the eternal and imperishable is always alive among people. It is a number one problem for us--nothing to laugh at. So-called humorous programs have appeared here this year, but there is no particular response to them yet. And there is a problem with game programs. We have, perhaps, only one game program--"VZV" (Evening Amusement for Adults), which is done by Leonid Azarkh. It is necessary to play on radio. Radio games exist in the whole world. As I have already said, we concentrate politics in four hours on the "Authors' Channel." And this is probably the optimal variant. [Moroz] Do you know what kind of audience you have? [Davydov] Of course, we know, although, perhaps, not in great detail. Any kind of sociological poll is now too expensive. This audience is very broad and mixed... And rather conservative. Russia is a conservative country in general. This is not my observation and not my discovery. As one of my colleagues said, Moscow is not Russia, Moscow is Moscow, an entirely different country starts beyond the ring road. But it is mainly Muscovites who work for us, and they are young people as well. They do not always understand that beyond the bounds of the capital there is a very different country. So that we do not have 100 percent confidence that we know our listeners. [Moroz] To what extent do you depend on listeners? [Davydov] Unfortunately, to no extent. The other day there was a funny telegram: The main production line of the AZLK [Moscow Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant] was shut down as a sign of protest against discrimination with respect to the program "Interlocutor" (this program is now transmitted on the third channel). Well, where else can a production line of a very large automobile plant shut down as a result of the fact that a program ceased to exist on one channel and switched to another? But imagine what it would entail if such a thing happened somewhere else suddenly--let us say, the FIAT plant in Italy came to a stop, because of some perturbations on radio? At a minimum there would be parliamentary hearings. But in our country--nothing. Even such serious threats do not influence us in any way. In the meantime, dependence on listeners, perhaps, is exactly what would save us in the economic situation in which we find ourselves. If it were financial. But today, whether we pay for a radio point or not, whether we pay taxes or not, this has no effect at all on the work of the radio. Everything is dissolved in the common pot, it is depersonalized... [Moroz] How do you differ from other radio channels? From Mayak it is clear, but, let us say, from Radio 1? [Davydov] Our difference not only from Mayak but also from Youth and Orpheus is clear. But as for Radio 1, we have a significant similarity. The fact that we started to broadcast on the "first button" compelled us to arrange our broadcasting with a view to the first all-Union program. Our main difference from this channel is, perhaps, that we are a younger and more mobile radio. And now we have become even more dynamic--in connection with program timing and the expansion of musical elements, about which I have already talked. [Moroz] As a result of the departure of "Interlocutor" from your wavelengths, people were prepared to bring the automobile plant to a halt. But "Interlocutor" is not your program... [Davydov] Yes, it was accommodated on our wavelengths in a contract with Ostankino. This contract ended in 1993. [Moroz]...But do you have your own programs that are just as popular, that are liked as much by the people, and whose cancellation or switch to another wavelength would cause such a powerful listener protest? [Davydov] I am afraid of such a definition "liked by the people": Each program has its listeners. There are programs that are simply destined for success. No matter how they were made. Take, for example, the program "An old gramophone reminded me..." Or "A meeting with a song." I can simply sit, read letters, and play songs that people request. And it will meet with success. I do not want to diminish the role of those who produce these programs, but I repeat, they are destined for success. Or, for example, "Home Academy." Four young female employees "cover" five hours of air time in a week. They are real heroines, and a monument should be erected to them. But if I simply sat an announcer down who would read how to boil buckwheat, how to bring up a child...the program would be popular all the same. But there are programs of another kind--let us assume "Roots and Branches," which deals with the fates of a classic legacy in contemporary life. People appear in it of such a level as Yuriy Mikhailovich Lotman and Dmitryy Sergeyevich Likhachev. I cannot call it popular. But this program also established the face of the channel. Or we have the young radio journalist Sasha Korshunov--a fellow who digs into history. Moreover, who finds in it not cheap sensations but exposes many of its pages anew. There also was never a big stream of letters on its broadcast, and no production line will stop for the sake of it, but it has its listeners. This is also our face. [Moroz] What can you say about the innovations in recent years--the widespread use of going live on the air, telephone participation of radio listeners in broadcasts, and so forth? Do they not lower the quality of broadcasting? [Davydov] We went through a stage of being infatuated with listener telephone calls, while still working on the youth channel of radio station Youth, and in the first period of activity of Radio Russia. We very rarely resort to this now. Telephone communications with listeners occurs with us, as a rule, somewhat differently: We simply provide an open line telephone, next to which our invited guest sits for an hour to an hour and a half. But starting on 9 March a permanent open line telephone has been working on Radio Russia--in the reception room. Listeners can call it up from 1400 to 1800 during the day, Moscow time. But now local stations usually put listeners who call on the telephone on live broadcasts: This way, people bring their troubles and their problems to the attention of local officials. As for our live broadcasting, it takes up 10 of our 22 hours every day. In broadcasting to the European zone. The ratio is different in rebroadcasts. Here there are two sides. It is bad that it is impossible to correct anything. What is said is what is heard. But it is impossible to work without live broadcasting today. The situation in the country is changing rapidly. If only recording is used, you cannot keep up with this situation. [Moroz] The other day corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Khasbulatov who was released from prison said in one of his numerous interviews that the most trying experience in the prison cell was Mayak and Radio Russia, which were continuously broadcasting a stream of lies. According to him, it is necessary to have a powerful brain in order to come up with so much lying. He also said that one radio station was enough "to beat one's brains"--true, this was only said about Mayak. What do you think about this? [Davydov] In principle, I can limit myself to one phrase: We have not lost one court case to date. [Moroz] Have there been many trials? [Davydov] One or two are always going on. So, let Khasbulatov go to court, and we will figure out who lied where. [Moroz] I think the scientist had in mind not lies in a literal sense, but Radio Russia's political orientation. [Davydov] In that case, things have to be called by their correct names. If, while carrying out a certain political policy, we are also not sinning against the truth, our opponent may himself answer for slander. However, we will not begin, of course, to expend either the time or the money on such a court examination. [Moroz] But you do not intend to change your political orientation? After all, many are changing it now... [Davydov] You see, I am frequently told: "State radio should be apolitical." I reply: "Yes, in a normal society." Radio Russia was planned as a political radio "under Yeltsin." Well, I am a person who is more or less apolitical--it was simply interesting to me to make a new channel out of nothing. And journalists came here mainly out of political considerations. But when in the middle of 1992 a struggle of the two authorities began, we tried to maintain an objective approach. Deputies themselves commented here on everything that was happening. Aksyuchits did not scramble out of our radio. I am not now talking about broadcasting the meetings of the Supreme Soviet. Then the political fight intensified. It seemed to the Supreme Soviet that it was getting little air time. The idea came up for a "Parliamentary Hour." I tried to show that the appearance of this program would throw Radio Russia sharply into another, opposite direction. I was not listened to. From the very first minutes of the existence of the "Parliamentary Hour," streams of abuse came down on the president. And we were compelled to defend him. Today, of course, the situation is different, but the political struggle continues. The fate of the country depends on its outcome. But for this reason I will say once more, Radio Russia, like all state radio, cannot allow itself to be apolitical. Although, of course, we strive to present all viewpoints that exist in society.
