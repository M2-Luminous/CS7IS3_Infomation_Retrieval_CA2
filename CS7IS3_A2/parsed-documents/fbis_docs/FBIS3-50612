Radio Reloj at 2045 GMT on 24 December reports that Granma Province met its coffee production goal for the present campaign, representing a 15-percent increase over the same period, 1992. Radio Reloj at 2050 GMT on 24 December reports that the Austrian "Sun Over Cuba" solidarity group sent a donation consisting of a computer, school materials, and medicine. The donations will be distributed to the Camilo Cienfuegos School and the Rafael Freire Hospital in Holguin. The computer will be sent to the Institute of Solar Energy. Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 27 December reports that Royal, a Canadian company, has joined the airlines that bring tourists from Toronto, Canada, to Ciego de Avila, Royal is scheduled to fly to Ciego de Avila and Camaguey on a weekly basis. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 3 January reports that Villa Clara Province has attained an infant morality rate for 1993 of 6.6 per 1,000 live births. Radio Reloj at 2043 GMT on 3 January reports that Maria Lucia Ruiz, Havana tour manager in Colombia, last night greeted the first charter flight of Colombian tourists to Varadero. On 9 January, a charter flight from Colombia is to arrive in Cuba. Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 4 January reports that railway service between Guantanamo Province and the rest of the nation has been restored. Eighty percent of the merchandise going to Guantanamo Province is moved by rail. The same newscast reports that the Caribe Navigation Enterprise on the Isle of Youth has announced that the number of passenger trips by motorboat between Nueva Gerona and Batabano will be reduced this month because of a lack of spare parts: As of 10 January, there will be two rather than three departures. In order to make up for this reduction in the current transportation program, ships will also depart on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and return on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. "In order to achieve this increase, the ferry Isla de la Juventude, which can carry more than 500 passengers, will be rendered operative." Radio Rebelde further announces that Matanzas oil workers extracted 814,000 tons of oil in 1993, "which was 81 percent of the program for the period, at the same time setting a national record for crude oil production." Officials of the oil extraction enterprise of Central Cuba said that of a potential 21 million cubic meters of natural gas, just over 15.5 million cubic meters were used, "which shows that the demand for this fuel is still low. Despite failure to fulfill the investment programs, difficulties with the system for moving crude oil along the coast by ship, and scarce resources, this enterprise -- which produced the greatest amount of oil in Cuba -- showed an increase in drilling last year, with 15,500 meters. There are currently 180 wells in the largest oil deposit yet discovered in Cuba. Exploration continues in that zone with a view to increasing its potential and extracting higher- quality oil. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 4 January reports that Cuban oil workers hope to extract 1.2 million tons of crude in 1994. There are also plans to increase seismic research in 1994 with a view to improving exploration; Cuba hopes to have a much stronger investments program and to begin drilling all over the country. "Four new sites, located in the traditional petroleum areas, also will be opened." In the same newscast, Progreso's Sanciti Spiritus correspondent reports that the industrial gases factory in Sancti Spiritus has begun making chalk for use in Cuba's schools. The plant engineer notes that most of the chalk in Cuba used to be imported from China and that the chalk being produced in Cuba now is "almost of better quality than the Chinese chalk." Radio Rebelde Network at 1255 GMT on 4 January reports that Granma Province sugar sector workers have fulfilled the cold-season cane planting plan. They planted almost 437 caballerias; and 10 of the 11 sugar industry complexes met their commitments. Also, "Havana farmers made a big effort in December to catch up as regards the cold-season planting, and they began 1994 with close to 1,500 caballerias planted in tubers and vegetables, which will guarantee the program for February." Radio Rebelde Network at 1800 GMT on 4 January reports that the "La Victoria de Giron" citrus-producing complex, the largest in the nation, managed to stop the decline in its plantations by the end of 1993 by establishing cooperation in production that facilitated credits for buying fuel and agricultural inputs. This allowed the recovery of approximately 20,000 hectares, which constitute over 50 percent of the complex's lands. In 1993 the complex produced over 7 million quintals of citrus fruits. In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that 359 high-voltage transformers were recovered in Ciego de Avila Province in 1993. "The work team that specializes in the recovery of that kind of equipment is currently working on rewinding and adapting a group of 160-kilovolt Italian transformers that will be set up at sugar-production complexes in Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus for the current harvest." In the same cast, Rebelde also reports that a new type of materials-efficient floor tile, sometimes called "the streamlined tile", has been developed by the Construction Materials Enterprise of Sancti Spiritus. Production of this tile allows for practically doubling the amount of surface that can be tiled using the same amount of raw materials. The tile is made with scrap residue from the sugar mills in place of silica and powdered stone. Because of its light weight, this tile also is easier to transport and to lay.
