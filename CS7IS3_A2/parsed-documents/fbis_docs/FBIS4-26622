The subsidiary, Esso China Ltd., will begin to gather seismic data in a contract sea block on June 26. Esso and 14 big foreign oil companies, including Texaco, Chevron, Shell and Phillips-Arco, are now searching for oil and gas over a 64,246 square kilometer continental basin area in the sea. In May 1992, the Chinese Government decided to open part of the offshore area in the East China Sea to foreign oil companies. On June 30, 1992, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation opened bids for Sino-foreign joint development of oil in that area. Esso and 14 foreign oil companies beat fierce competition to win bids to search for and produce oil and gas in 18 blocks in the sea, in cooperation with the Chinese corporation. Li May Phipps and Kevin Biddle, both vice-presidents of Esso China Ltd., said that they were delighted at Esso's success in winning a contract block. The 2,120 sq km block is about 200 km north-east of Wenzhou, a port in Zhejiang Province. Biddle said: "We are fully confident of our success in exploring oil in the East China Sea." Since oil exploration in the East China Sea began in the early 1970s, an oilfield and nine oil-bearing structures have been discovered and 27 oil exploratory wells drilled there. After seismic exploration is completed and relevant data processed, Esso China Ltd. will choose the best well location to drill an exploratory well, he said. Drilling is expected to begin next year, he added. Founded in 1882, Esso is currently searching for oil and gas in more than 80 countries. It spent 8.2 billion U.S. dollars in investment and exploration in 1993. Esso opened a representative office in Beijing 13 years ago as part of its effort to participate in developing energy resources in China. Biddle said that over the past ten years and more, his parent company had spent 200 million U.S. dollars in the search for offshore oil and gas resources in China. To date, Esso has drilled 17 wells in two blocks in the South China Sea, striking both oil and gas there, he said. Moreover, together with Chinese partners, Esso is also searching for oil in the Tarim basin in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, he added. He said he thought that oil and gas resources in northwest China are probably even more promising than those in the Daqing oilfield in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and in the Shengli oilfield in east China's Shandong Province. Esso's cooperation with China is based on long-term interests, he said, adding that Esso will try to expand its cooperation with Chinese partners in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit. Esso is also willing to invest in energy projects in China, such as oil projects, coal projects and power projects, he added.
