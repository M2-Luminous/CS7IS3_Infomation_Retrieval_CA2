FR941028-0-00013 FR941028-0-00005 III. Discussion For the reasons discussed below, the Commission denies rehearing. A. First Sale Status Order No. 567 deleted §270.203(c) from the Commission's regulations as part of the removal of a number of regulations that were rendered obsolete or nonessential by the Wellhead Decontrol Act. The Commission continues to believe that the deletion of §270.203(c) was appropriate. The Wellhead Decontrol Act has eliminated all maximum lawful prices applicable to first sales. As a result, no purpose is any longer served by our exercising our authority under NGPA section 2(21)(A)(v) to define additional categories of sales as first sales ``in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this Act.'' Circumvention cannot be a concern when there are no maximum lawful prices to circumvent. The Commission recognizes that, as a result of the Wellhead Decontrol Act and our subsequent deletion of §270.203(c), interstate pipeline marketing affiliates' sales are no longer first sales. However, this fact does not create a competitive disadvantage for marketing affiliates as alleged. In Order No. 547, the Commission issued blanket certificates under section 7 of the NGA to all persons making sales of gas for resale in interstate commerce who are not interstate pipelines. Certain additional conditions were attached to the blanket certificates issued to interstate pipeline marketing affiliates to preclude potential discriminatory practices. Those blanket certificates place all marketers on an equal competitive footing by effectively eliminating the distinctions in treatment that formerly existed between regulated and non-regulated marketers. An interstate pipeline affiliated marketer may make sales under its blanket certificate at negotiated rates with pregranted abandonment to compete with unregulated marketers. Thus, at this time, there is no practical difference between treatment as marketing affiliates under the blanket marketer sales certificates issued in Order No. 547 and treatment as first sales. Petitioners' concern appears to be more that regulation under the blanket certificates might change in the future, rather than any concern with how this system of light-handed regulation operates at the present time. For example, Texaco Gas Marketing Inc. states in its request for rehearing, ``The blanket sales certificate regulations prevent the removal of Section 2[70].203(c) from having any present effect, but if the blanket certificate is modified or repealed, non-affiliated marketers and affiliated marketers may not be competing on a level playing field.'' 4 But, our July 28, 1994 order did nothing to affect the terms of the blanket marketer certificates issued by Order No. 547 and, therefore, the rights of the parties have not been affected, and thus no party has been aggrieved by our order. 5 Moreover, the Commission continues to believe that the existing blanket marketer certificates are appropriate, considering the competitive wellhead market and the changes in the industry due to restructuring under Order No. 636 and decontrol under the Wellhead Decontrol Act. Thus, no changes to those certificates are contemplated. 4 See Texaco Gas Marketing Inc. request for rehearing at p. 4. 5 See Williams Gas Processing Co. v. FERC, 17 F.3d 1320, 1322 (10th Cir. 1994), citing NARUC, 823 F.2d 1377, 1381 (10th Cir. 1987) and Office of the Consumers' Counsel v. FERC, 808 F.2d 125, 128&hyph;29 (D.C. Cir. 1987). (The Court held that to be considered aggrieved a party must demonstrate a ``present and immediate'' injury in fact, or ``at least *␣*␣* a looming unavoidable threat'' of injury. The alleged injury must be ``concrete, perceptible harm of a real, non-speculative nature.'') If the Commission were to alter the blanket certificates in the future, the Commission would reexamine the treatment of affiliate sales at that time.
