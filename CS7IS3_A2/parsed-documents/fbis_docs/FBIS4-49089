Thirty years have passed, things have changed, and so have generations of officers and men, but the "Steely Eighth Company" has always retained a steel-like style and discipline. During the period of reform and opening up, in particular, their spirit of arduously pioneering a cause and of being self-sacrificing, as well as their might, indomitable spirit, and unstained character make them an even brighter and more eye-catching banner of our Army. With what was that good steel -- the Steely Eighth Company -- tempered? It was tempered with a firm faith: the communist faith. This is a valuable experience worthy of serious study by all walks of life in the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. "Having a firm faith" is a principle to which our party always adheres in the course of party building. It is also a principle by which the Army should build itself. During the extremely formidable revolutionary struggle, it enabled our party and Army to have an indomitable spirit and strict discipline, and it united the people to triumph over innumerable difficulties and dangers. Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed it up, saying: "In our arduous struggle over the past decades, we have relied on a firm faith to unite the people to struggle for their own interests. Without such a faith, there would have been no rallying force. Without such a faith, there would have been nothing." "A firm faith" is still the soul of the party and the Army during the booming period of reform and opening up. Only by having a firm faith can our party and Army retain their inherent qualities, carry forward the glorious tradition of arduous struggle, and unite the people for the realization of the "four modernizations." It is the most basic requirement for the new "four have's" people to "have a firm faith." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "By saying that the factor of mankind is important, we do not mean ordinary men, but those who have a firm faith, are aware of the people's interests, and struggle for them." Today, reform has already entered the stage where key problems are being tackled, and interest relationships have been readjusted considerably. At this critical moment, we demand all the more that large numbers of officers and men like the "Steely Eighth Company" have a firm faith in their hearts, be willing to make selfless sacrifices, and act as a guide to society regarding the outlook one should have on tribulation, happiness, and values. At the present stage, as far as the broad masses are concerned, fostering a firm communist faith is a question of vigorously promoting and strengthening education. For Communist Party members and the officers and men of the People's Army, however, it is a question of discipline. This is determined by the nature, aim, and tasks of our party and Army. They must keep the communist faith in mind at all times, and must encourage and spur themselves on to have a deeper understanding of the people's interests. The reason the "Steely Eighth Company" can staunchly pioneer a cause in the face of difficulties and adversities, can remain untempted in the face of money worship and hedonism, and can be willing to stand guard duty for foreign-invested enterprises, is that they realize they are the servicemen of the people, and the builders of the communist abode. Therefore, they consider it a steely discipline to arduously pioneer a cause and to be self-sacrificing. In order to foster new hands with a firm faith, it is necessary first to educate young people, including young officers and men, with lofty ideals and a sense of discipline. For one thing, they are a main force in the modernization drive and are the hope of achieving our goals down the centuries. If they have no faith, no ideals, and no discipline, it will be difficult for them to take up heavy responsibilities, and it also will be impossible for use to achieve socialist modernization. On the other hand, the money worship, hedonism, and ultra-individualism existing in society always have young people as the main object of their seduction. If we do not stress ideals and discipline, corrupt and decadent things will seize the opportunity to take over and probably will interfere greatly with the pace of our advance. Education in faith and ideals is an advantage in our party's ideological and political work. Our Army has a wealth of experience in this respect, such as "education illustrated with history" and "passing on experience, giving help, and setting an example to new hands." They are not only clear-cut systems, but are also vivid and dramatic. The practice of the "Steely Eighth Company" shows that as long as we activate our minds, the form of education in faith and ideals will be rich and colorful, meaningful and wonderful scenes can be seen everywhere throughout the Army and the country, and heroic achievements during the new period and the experiences of ideological and political work will be carried forward to a great extent and will blossom everywhere.
