The source said: "The draft of the resolution prepared by friendly nations stipulates that 'the IAEA should report, within a month after it adopts a resolution on North Korea, if North Korea observes the Nuclear Safeguards Accord.'" It added: "This means North Korea is urged to allow additional inspections within one month." The source also said: "If the UN Security Council decides to adopt this draft, North Korea must have consultations with the IAEA on the additional inspections within this period." Prior to this, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix attended the UN Security Council meeting held on 25 March and said: "In order to maintain the continuity of nuclear inspections of North Korea, an IAEA inspection team has to enter North Korea again in six weeks to replace batteries and film."
