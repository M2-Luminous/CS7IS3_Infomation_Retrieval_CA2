FBIS4-515 "drafr070_c_94054" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA SACOB to Businesses: Plan for `Worst Case Scenario' SACOB to Businesses: Plan for `Worst Case Scenario' MB0804114494 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1125 GMT 8 Apr 94 MB0804114494 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Sean Feely] [Text] Johannesburg April 8 SAPA -- The SA Chamber of Business [SACOB] has alerted its 40,000 member enterprises to set up contingency plans in the run up to and after the April elections, SACOB legal affairs Director Ken Warren said on Friday [8 April]. Speaking in Johannesburg, Mr Warren said businesses should plan for a "worst case scenario", in view of the social turmoil and violence which has gripped the country ahead of its first all race polls. SACOB tentatively defined the worst case as a scenario in which the level of violence rises to a point that damages business property and the security of staff. The chamber sent in early March a circular advising all its members to bolster and check their provisions with regard to security, fire-fighting equipment, communication networks and the supply of essential production materials. Mr Warren said business had also set up day-to-day communication channels with the civil protection authorities in each area to monitor potential flashpoints. Violence has escalated, specifically in Natal-kwaZulu, ahead of the poll scheduled for April 26-28. More than 130 people have been killed in Natal-kwaZulu since the imposition of a state of emergency in the province on March 31. More than 50 people were killed in central Johannesburg and neighbouring areas in late March in confrontations during a Zulu protest march, disrupting many companies and threatening the safety of staff working in the central business district. An accountant died after being hit by bullets while working on his personal computer in his downtown office. The pc had been situated near a first floor window. The turmoil has raised fears in the business community that plant, equipment, raw materials and products could be damaged or destroyed, as well as employees wounded or even killed. "Planning and precautionary measures should commence immediately... Great care will have to be taken to prevent or minimise unnecessary anxiety or panic among employees," the SACOB circular advised. It recommended that plans be implemented to ensure the safety of employees travelling to and from work, and it could be necessary to house key personnel on the business premises. "Vehicle hijacking can be expected to increase, with freight vehicles and combis as likely specific targets, as a result of inter alia, pressure to transport voters to polling booths." In addition, the chamber urged enterprises to plan for power disruptions, and the provision of essential supplies of water, raw materials, food and fuels. Mr Warren said SACOB hoped a worst case scenario would not arise, but it made prudent business sense to be prepared for any eventuality.
