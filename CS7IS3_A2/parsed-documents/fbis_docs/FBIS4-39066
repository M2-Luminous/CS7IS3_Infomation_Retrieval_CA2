Pokidov video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] [Text] Today, while the town of Svobodnyy-18 toils away in its normal routine manner, the chief center for space research is being created on the foundations of a former missile unit. The Ministry of Defense has already allocated half a billion rubles to ensure its survival and the city's development. [Video shows aerial shots of Svobodnyy-18 town] New complexes for launching regular space rockets will be constructed on the basis of several launching pads that have survived. The first launch of this kind is planned for the beginning of 1996. Everyone can see for themselves that it is perfectly safe to live and work in the space research center; the Geiger counter indicates a perfectly normal radiation background even near a blown up nuclear missile silo. [Video shows uniformed personnel inspecting exploded rocket silo] What is the immediate outlook for developing Svobodnyy-18? This was the subject of our talk with Colonel Kalanchev, chief of staff of the center for space research. [Begin recording] [Kalanchev] We have two leading documents on the basis of which we conduct our work. Thorough technical inspections of all buildings, structures, and technical systems have been carried out, and orders for necessary equipment have been placed. Plans have been made, and the necessary assets for implementing these plans are being accumulated. [Pokidov] You have made an interesting statement: We are military people, and if we are ordered, we will launch a spaceship within a month. [Kalanchev] Of course, we will not be able to prepare a serious launch within a month, especially if it is a booster rocket. But military unit No. 06-660, which has been created for the realization of these plans, will carry out its goals in accordance with the timetable set by Colonel General Ivanov, commander of the military space forces, and of course by the minister of defense. [Pokidov] In other words, everything depends on financing. [Kalanchev] On financing first and foremost, but also on goals and schedules set for us. [end recording]
