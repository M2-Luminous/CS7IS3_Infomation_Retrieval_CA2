Akayev said the decree had been issued in order to prevent further growth in the number of the Russian-speaking people emigrating from Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyz Government will try to ensure equal representation of the Slav community in the state and local administration. The decree also provides for guaranteed representation of the ethnic minorities in all state power bodies. Within a month the Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry will work out proposals on the acquisition of citizenship for Russian-speaking inhabitants of Kyrgyzstan leaving for Russia and for those willing to come back to Kyrgyzstan from Russia. The proposals will be coordinated with the Russian party. The Kyrgyz Interior Ministry and the National Security Committee will strengthen their struggle against nationalism. Akayev suggested that the migration by the Russian-speaking population was causing large damage to the potential of Kyrgyzstan on the whole. He emphasized that increasing migration was due to the problems with the language, insufficient representation in the state bodies and other official structures and the display of nationalism in everyday life. Akayev announced that he had prepared one more letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin asking Russia to help Kyrgyzstan to resolve the economic problems. Akayev stressed that these issues must be settled urgently if Russia was interested in ensuring the position of Russians living in Kyrgyzstan.
