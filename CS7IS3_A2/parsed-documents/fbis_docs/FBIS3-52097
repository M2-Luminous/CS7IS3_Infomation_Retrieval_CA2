In the course of our interview with him a short while ago, he received a facsimile from Shim'on Peres. We will return to this later but first we asked Sha'th about the draft that was formulated in Cairo. Why has 'Arafat gone back on his agreement? Nabil Sha'th replied that the reports of a joint paper were an Israeli fabrication. There was no such document. [Sha'th] In fact, I do not know which paper Prime Minister Rabin is talking about. There were minutes that Mr. Peres dictated to his assistant Yoni [not further specified] in the meeting on 28 December. These minutes...[pauses] the next day we got a different draft from the Israeli side which differs significantly from it. And then, I sent a revised draft working paper to the Israeli side that I have not received any response on, so one wonders which agreement it is that Prime Minister Rabin is talking about. [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] We only have a handwritten draft, Sha'th asserted, which has not even been signed. The word agreement does not even appear on the draft. We asked Sha'th what the disagreements were about. [Sha'th] One, is about the size of the Jericho area. Number two is an issue related to the passages only in relation to the passage of residents of Gaza and Jericho; whereas we agree on all the rest of the modalities. [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] We asked Sha'th to comment on 'Arafat's claim that Israel was only offering the Palestinians something akin to an Indian reservation. [Sha'th] Whereas the Israeli side is always very sensitive about any symbol of sovereignty we talk about, like a passport or a postage stamp, we are also very sensitive about what we feel sometimes is an attempt to continue Israeli control of Palestinians in the occupied territories. Mr. 'Arafat's use of the word Bantustan for example, was as a result of his feelings that withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho should have given the Gaza and Jericho residents at least more freedom from direct Israeli control. Including of the crossing points. [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] Does 'Arafat have the power to impose his control, we asked Sha'th? Most definitely, he replied. 'Arafat was and remains the boss. All the talk about a revolt are completely exaggerated. Then, while we were still talking, a facsimile arrived from Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. [Sha'th] Would you hold on just a second. We have just received a letter from Mr. Peres and there is not a clear approval of going to Taba. In other words, he is still ready to hold the Taba negotiations but there is no specific date and I do not know if we are sure about the conditions for going back. Well, this may be clarified in a telephone call which I am going to make but as of now I see only a tentative approval that needs further confirmation. [passage omitted]
