The NBB told INTERFAX that it had made the decision "in view of the amount of time it is taking to unify the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus and the fact that the current state of confusion regarding payments cannot be allowed to continue." According to the NBB decision, all accounting in Belarus will be carried out only in the payment coupons until the monetary union officially takes place and all commercial organizations must convert their assets from Russian rubles to "zaichiki" at the official NBB exchange rate (10.5 to the Russian rubles on 24 May) within the shortest period of time. The NBB will set a special exchange rate every week for operations not involving trade and charges for services (especially transport and communications).
