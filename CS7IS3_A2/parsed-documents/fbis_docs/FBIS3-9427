What the average television viewer in Knin and Belgrade was able to learn on the basis of news reports is that the assembly "does not like" its government and that Bjegovic's cabinet, insulted and "humiliated," "no longer wants to play the game." However, the fact is that by resigning, Djordje Bjegovic has actually strengthened the position of his government and cabinet, so that at the moment he is virtually irreplaceable. First, according to the Constitution, once a new parliament is elected, the existing government automatically becomes the caretaker government. Meanwhile, until a new government is elected, the new parliament can remove any member of the government from office. However, when the prime minister resigns, something that prompts the resignation of the entire cabinet, the Constitution prescribes that all the ministers and the prime minister remain in their posts until a new government is elected. Therefore, the government remains in place, and the parliament -- which did not elect this government -- cannot remove the ministers from their posts. Bjegovic executed this maneuver with the aid of his close associates, the Benkovac lawyers Radomir Kuzeta (justice minister) and Sava Strbac (secretary of the government). In a statement to TANJUG, Strbac confessed that by resigning, Bjegovic "protected" the members of the government. The government submitted a report on its activities to the parliament as part of the seventh item on the agenda. The eighth item on the agenda was the removal of the information minister. By this time, Bjegovic and his advisers had already come up with the life-saving maneuver -- resignation. However, when it was time to tackle the seventh item on the agenda, the prime minister briefly left the assembly hall, the information minister was removed, and the resignation followed. Therefore, the items on the agenda were switched, and government sources said that Bjegovic had actually sacrificed the unpopular lady (Tanjga was removed from power by a unanimous vote of the parliament), while protecting himself and the remaining ministers! For three days, the deputies of the parliamentary position (from Babic's and Seselj's parties) and those of the parliamentary opposition (Martic's people and others) tried to outwit each other, certain important decisions were made despite the complaints of the minority that the majority was behaving as the majority, the ministers preached to and praised deputies, and the "position" monitored the procedures like the apple of its eye.... However, it was absolutely clear that the parliamentary session was overshadowed by two people who are not shadows, namely, the two Milans (Martic and Babic), who were watching the live television relay in some unidentified place, and who sporadically used couriers to summon their people (Bjegovic and Kovacevic) for new consultations and new instructions! In the current distribution of power, it is clear that the president of the republic is far closer to the government than the parliament, and that the parliament is some kind of opposition on the Krajina political scene. Martic has nominated Mikelic, whom he describes as a "prominent political worker" as prime minister designate of the new government. However, the majority of 45 deputies have already rejected him. On the other hand, Babic's party has issued a public statement saying that Mikelic was the man whom, four years ago, Zagreb (Ivica Racan) dispatched to Knin, while today Belgrade is offering him as the savior (?). Even in the area where accord is necessary and unavoidable (negotiations with the Croatian regime) there remains a distance between the, for the time being, irreconcilable opponents. The parliament has nothing against the Zagreb negotiations, but it has stressed that it is waiting for a report on the basis of which it will either reject or accept the possible decisions reached at the Russian Embassy. On two occasions yesterday, the majority in the parliament "washed its hands" of the alleged bianco agreement for the Zagreb negotiations. This was first denied by Drago Kovacevic, head of Babic's deputy caucus, and late last night by the parliament chairman, Radical Branko Vojnica, who denied the claims of Knin Television.
