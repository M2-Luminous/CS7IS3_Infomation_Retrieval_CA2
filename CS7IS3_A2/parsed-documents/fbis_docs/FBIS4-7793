Protection Force (UNPROFOR) stationed in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) on Monday [4 April] twice violated the territory of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), the Yugoslav Army said in a statement on Tuesday. Around noon on Monday, two UNPROFOR civilian policemen and a local interpreter illegally entered three kilometres into Yugoslav territory in a motor vehicle, the statement said. Because of the illegal entry to Yugoslavia, they were taken to the Slavujevac border post to explain the reasons of their presence there. Around 2:30 p.m. on the same day, three UNPROFOR armoured personnel carriers [APC] illegally entered 300 metres into Yugoslav territory, the statement said and added that the APCs returned to their base in FYROM after an energetic action of Yugoslav border guards. This is the second time this year that the U.N. peacekeepers deployed in FYROM have violated Yugoslavia's territorial integrity. In mid-January, two U.N. APCs manned with two U.S. and three Norwegian soldiers illegally penetrated 500 metres deep into Yugoslavia, also close to the Slavujevac border post. About 800 U.N. peacekeepers, mainly from the United States, were deployed last year in FYROM which unilaterally seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991, to protect the newly-formed state from an alleged threat coming from its northern neighbour Yugoslavia. The U.N. commander in FYROM said in his reports to the U.N. secretary-general, however, that no danger is coming from the north and that the Yugoslav-Macedonian border is calm and stable. Some opposition parties in FYROM have urged Skopje to deny hospitality to the U.S. troops "because their presence has brought nothing good to any nation in the world: They brought neither peace nor calm, but only the loss of sovereignty, war, death, drugs and other troubles."
