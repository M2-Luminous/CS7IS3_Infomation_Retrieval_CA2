In a statement to ANATOLIA agency in London, the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan declared that its forces seized the townships of Balkhah and Ahmad Awah, which occupy a strategic point from a transportation standpoint. The statement denied reports that 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, leader of the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan, was captured last week by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led by Talabani. The statement noted that 'Abd-al-'Aziz is currently conducting talks in Salah-al-Din to stop the clashes with Mas'ud Barzani. The statement further claimed that in the recent clashes, Talabani's forces were helped by Iranian communist Kurdish organizations and former PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] militants. Charging that the recent elections held in northern Iraq were rigged, the statement said that Barzani and Talabani failed to keep their promises to renew the elections and everyone should learn that Talabani's words cannot be trusted.
