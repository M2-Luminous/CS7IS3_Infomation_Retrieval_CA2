Paying homage to the martyrs for freedom in all the times and especially the latest martyrs, those of '90, President Berisha recalls the last winter of the dictatorship, the destructions and the numerous victims of that time. "March 22 makes us recall all these not for revenge but not to allow them to be repeated," the message says. President Berisha compared the extreme poverty and the suspended economy, the serious consequences of the isolation with the situation of Albania after two years under democracy, when Albanians could manage to have the most rapid economic growth and a stable and practically convertible currency through the profound reforms they are carrying out. The country in which for so many years the cults of Hoxha and Stalin prevailed has now one of the most progressive charter of the human rights and freedoms of the time. Albania has become an important factor for the peace and stability in the region. It defined its western character clearer than any other former communist country. Pointing to the overcome of the consequences of the 50 year long isolation in the foreign policy of Albania, Mr. Berisha says that engagement of Albania has given quite another dimension to the Albanian question in general and to that of the human and national rights and freedoms of the Albanians in their territories in the former Yugoslavia. At present, the Kosova question is first of all international and not simply Serbian as the Belgrade dictator claims, President Berisha says. Stressing the contribution of the aid and solidarity of the European Union and its member countries, of the U.S.A. and other friendly European and Islamic countries, to the achievements of Albania, Mr. Berisha expresses his conviction that the free Albanian individual has been the decisive factor in this direction. Concerning the difficulties that the Albanian people are experiencing, Mr. Berisha said: "There are numerous Albanian families or individuals who are not employed, who are on assistance or on pension that are experiencing very great difficulties in the daily life. I would like to assure them that the government will make uninterrupted efforts to improve their lives, to increase chances for their employment and to give them a social and economic support." Speaking about the Meksi government, Mr. Berisha pointed out that facing a destroyed country, the new Albanian institutions had to apply the economic reform, the law, to fight against corruption, thus scoring one of the greatest victories within a short period of time: the overthrow of the state-individual ratio in favour of the latter. "But our successes although great and undeniable cannot be considered an economic miracle," Mr. Berisha said, adding that Albania is the poorest country of Europe. "Our road towards prosperity and development is not filled with flowers but with serious difficulties." President Berisha said that "still there is a miracle existing in Albania, this is the vigour of freedom. This vigour will carry Albania nearer to the developed world, will ever more unite the Albanians wherever they are and will link them with other freedom-loving peoples and allied countries. Therefore, today all together let us say thanks God, and let us honour even more each other's freedom," the message says in conclusion.
