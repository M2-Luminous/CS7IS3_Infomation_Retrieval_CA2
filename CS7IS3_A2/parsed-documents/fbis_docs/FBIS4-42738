In order to maintain the number of jobs at the same level, the economy has to grow by 2 percent altogether, a study of the Economic Research Institute (Wifo) says. In the event of economic stagnation, the number of employees, including the self-employed, would decrease by about 0.5 percent. This year, with the same growth rate, the progress in productivity is the same as in the past, the Wifo stresses. The struggle against unemployment is, above all, complicated by the relatively low long-term economic growth and a major increase in the labor supply: If economic growth were to increase by 1 percentage point, employment would increase by 0.4 percent or about 12,000 persons. Despite the decrease in the average retirement age in the past 15 years, the labor supply increased by well over 1 percent per year. Almost half of it is due to the influx of foreign labor. Therefore, in the long-term, unemployment will only stabilize when the economy grows by 3 percent. The domestic labor market shows a clear discrepancy in its structure. Many new jobs in the services sector and in construction were not filled with unemployed, but largely with persons from the "hidden reserve" and from abroad who were looking for jobs.
