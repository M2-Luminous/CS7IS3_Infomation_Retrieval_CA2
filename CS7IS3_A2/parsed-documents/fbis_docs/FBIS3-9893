I could compare this moment of the special period, this political moment the nation is facing, with those days of fighting in the Sierra Maestra, with those days in 1958 we have been mentioning here. The difference is that this period is more prolonged. I would say that this period is more difficult than that one. It requires more talent, more commitment. The work is done under very complex conditions today, particularly following the hard blows the national economy has experienced. Only as a miracle of human will could the country's resistance be explained. So now I see radio in general -- I am not referring to Radio Rebelde alone, as a great rebel radio -- in a period similar to that one, in a very difficult and decisive moment. And I hope the workers, the reporters, all those who work at in radio will be aware of this and will be at the level of Radio Rebelde back then. Some day new generations will meet here again, the younger ones and some of the older ones will meet here again, and they will meet to recall the important role played by radio during these difficult days of the special period. [applause] [end recording] [Radio Progreso adds later in the broadcast that Castro's visit to Radio Rebelde lasted over three hours and that he stressed that, for very clear and objective reasons, nothing today compares to radio. Castro pointed out that the role of radio as a means of communication is growing: The print media are limited because of paper shortages and television has significantly reduced its programing because of problems with electric power and resources. Progreso adds that Castro said that in the Sierra we faced a local tyrant supported by imperialism, while today we are confronting head-on an imperialism that is employing every recourse in an effort to destroy us. Castro underscored that today we are conducting a greater and more meritorious struggle that the one waged then.]
