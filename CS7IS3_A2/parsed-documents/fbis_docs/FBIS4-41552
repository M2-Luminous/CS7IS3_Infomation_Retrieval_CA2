He Needs Money To Provide Country With Grain"] [Text] Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, speaking in a press conference yesterday, voiced the hope this year's grain production will be 90 or 95 million tonnes. While this year's production is less than last year's (99 million tonnes), the vice premier is convinced that Russia may virtually do without grain imports. Everyone, however, will have to work hard to achieve this goal -- those who gather in the harvest, and those who support the process financially and technically. The government will supposedly earmark 5.2 trillion rubles in centralized credits and 4.6 trillion rubles in a budget loan to get ready for and to gather in the harvest. In the vice premier's words, 90 percent of the money will be going out to the regions with the aim of forming regional grain funds. Besides, the grain growers will be provided with an opportunity to lease the necessary equipment or buy it on an installment plan. Mr. Zaveryukha stressed: The money should be made available in the shortest possible time, otherwise a successful grain harvest may be disrupted. At any rate, the vice premier was not prepared to give approximate prices of the grain to be gathered in, remarking only that prices should include all labor, material, and technical inputs. Touching on the food production situation on the whole, Aleksandr Zaveryukha sadly noted that the situation remains difficult and that production is declining. He pointed out, however, that production in the private sector grew somewhat. Minutes later, however, Mr. Zaveryukha stated that most of the agricultural producers are joint-stock companies, that is to say, private enterprises. This makes people wonder as to where production is declining.
