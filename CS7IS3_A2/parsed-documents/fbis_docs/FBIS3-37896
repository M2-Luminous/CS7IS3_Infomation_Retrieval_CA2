In his opinion, those guidelines should now be translated into legislative acts and in the steps to be taken by executive authorities. Then they will really become "actions with tangible results." Yakovlev stressed that the putting into effect of the main guidelines is the task for all branches of authority. Legislation and its subsequent implementation should be the next stage. The presidential address pointed to the absence of uniformity in the economic legislation and stressed that "a breakthrough in providing legal support for the market-oriented reform is urgently needed."
