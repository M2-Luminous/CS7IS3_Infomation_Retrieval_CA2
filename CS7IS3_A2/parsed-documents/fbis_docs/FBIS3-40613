This has been confirmed by the latest State Bank annual report which cites fiscal policy as one of the weakest areas of economic management. To meet the widening budget deficit, the government borrowed for budgetary support Rs [rupees] 63 billion against the whole year's target of Rs 25 billion. If the borrowing by autonomous corporations is also included, this figure would go up to Rs 129 billion. It should, therefore, not come as a surprise that Pakistan's total GDP [Gross Domestic Product] is mortgaged by debts to the extent of 86 percent. Financial discipline has rarely been the strong point of economy but during the 1992-93 financial year it seems to have been totally discounted. It was only in the later half of the year that some demand management measures were initiated but the economy had already been subjected to serious strains. With an economic growth at three percent, the same as the rate of growth of population, there was no increase in per capita income. The growth in the agriculture sector declined from 9.7 percent to minus 3.7 percent, and that of the manufacturing sector from 8.3 to 5.6 percent. Exports growth fell from 14.6 to 0.4 percent, but imports went up from 7.3 to 9.9 percent. Trade account recorded a deficit of 3.1 billion dollars causing a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves from 1,012 million dollars to 461 million dollars by the end of June last year. Heavy borrowing by the government and an excessive monetary expansion at 24 percent had a cripling effect on inflation whichs went into double digits and was recorded at 10.3 percent. The State Bank feels that price indices suffer from technical deficiencies and inaccuracies which would suggest that price pressures have accentuated more than these indices reflect. The decline in national savings from 17 percent to 14.6 percent is an inevitable consequence. Against such dismal performance of the economy, the targets set for this year underscore the need for financial discipline and concerted efforts. It has been proposed to achieve an economic growth of 7.5 percent, bring down inflation to 8 percent, build up foreign exchange reserves up to 1.3 billion dollars and reduce the budget deficit to 5.4 percent of the gross domestic product. Last year budgetary deficit was as high as 7.9 percent. Monetary expansion will be restricted to 14.5 percent. Already the [passage indistinct] effort in the budget was its [words indistinct]. The report makes a special mention of the demand management and resource generation measures introduced during the term of the caretakers. The caretaker government had raised additional resources worth Rs.17 billion. For the current year, the nation has already been subjected to a heavy dose of taxation and any further burden on it is to be avoided. The SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] report is of the view that it is too early to evaluate the outcome for the current financial year, but developments so far on the supply as well as on the demand side would indicate that the continuation of the reform measures and tight demand management policies pursued in the first half of the year will lead to higher growth, containment of inflation and improvement in the balance of payments. After having regained its autonomy, it is to be hoped that the State Bank will, through a balanced monetary policy, help to keep a lid on government borrowing, control monetary expansion within the target and contain inflation. The role of the central bank in keeping the economy on course is as important as that of the economic policy managers.
