Yevgenev under the "Privatization Program" rubric; date, place not given: "Voucher To Last Another Six Months"] [Text] The state program for the privatization of state and municipal enterprises in the Russian Federation (see ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA No. 1, 1994) can without any exaggeration be called a document long in the making. For various reasons, including political factors, work on it went on for 13 months. We asked Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Management of State Property [Goskomimushchestvo], to comment on its most important provisions: [Vasilyev] The program's main task is to create the conditions for the completion of check privatization. At the same time we have tried to take account of the lessons of the previous stage -- for instance, we have introduced a section entitled "Regional Peculiarities of Privatization." That is why the Far North, for instance, is seen as an autonomous region. The leaders of certain regions where a great deal has been accomplished have taken offense: Don't protect us like children, they say, give us more autonomy; and we have met them halfway. Quite another scheme is adopted in oblasts such as Magadan and Chita, which are close to becoming a socioeconomic disaster zone. Of course, here it is not a matter of generating revenue from privatization: The main thing is to ensure employment among the population. A whole section extends the regions' rights in the following direction also: They will themselves resolve whether facilities of one scale or another -- for instance, a city's engineering infrastructure -- should be privatized or not and, if so, how. The list of facilities whose privatization is forbidden has been increased. In point of fact we did not touch on these facilities earlier either, but now we have confirmed this documentarily. Well, indeed, what reason is there to privatize, say, the maritime transport rescue service? Its work cannot be based on commercial principles. But at the same time the register of organizations subject to compulsory privatization has also grown. It includes not only hotel complexes and motels, camp sites, boarding houses, and housing and utilities, but also debtor enterprises in all sectors. In other words, if you work badly and make losses, seek new managers through transforming the forms of ownership; change the system of management itself, and your hierarchical system. I hope that the position of those who up to the present time have been leasing premises not intended for habitation will become more definite. To this day they have been, as it were, living out of suitcases: And suddenly, on the expiry of their lease term they are asked to leave their cosy nest and sell the square meters to someone else, to say nothing of such inconveniences as the impossibility of obtaining credit on security. Now there is complete clarity in this area: If you have bought an enterprise at a competition or auction, you have the right to acquire also the premises that you were renting before. In the upshot, small-scale privatization will probably become more attractive. At long last order has been introduced with respect to the bloc of shares guaranteed to the state. All this used to be done arbitrarily, by eye. The program's drafters proceeded on the basis that the block, strictly defined in size, should correspond to this or that state interest. If the state sets itself the goal of keeping absolute control over an enterprise, it should own 51 percent of the shares (more than that is not necessary; the rest can be sold); if it aims at keeping partial control (which enables it to prevent a change in the joint-stock company's charter), it should be granted 25.5 percent of the shares. Like the previous program, the present program contains three varieties of perquisites for the employees of privatized enterprises. The first two have not undergone noticeable changes, but the third has been geared toward the forthcoming wave of bankruptcies. People assuming obligations not to allow the ruin of an enterprise receive the right to 20-30 percent of its incorporation capital. They put down a deposit of 200 minimum salaries, which is forfeit in the event of failure. Already today the new-fledged property class is selling cars and apartments in order to be come major owners of industrial property and, with the rights of private owners, to dispose of enterprises in such a way as to rescue them from collapse. The scale here is not limited -- it can be a chocolate factory, or the Likhachev Automobile Plant. Investment competitions will be held in a new way. Formerly, participants in these competitions swamped those attending with the most diverse and tempting programs, including foreign programs -- take your pick of which is the idee fixe, and which is the goose that lays the golden eggs. Henceforth there will be the following criterion: massive investments in the minimum time. And the need to contribute real money to the coffers of the enterprise directly after the auctions. It is well known that at present incompleted construction projects are sold with great reluctance. The owner dies, but does not give way -- it's mine! Here the following rule is introduced: In the process of privatization an uncompleted facility is removed from the enterprise's assets and goes under the hammer. Moreover, this is profitable to everyone: The owner receives half the proceeds, and the committee for the administration of property and the corresponding fund share the rest between them. In our view, this incentive should be effective. Protection for shareholders has been devised. Should one of them conceive a desire to sell his shares, he will pay no tax. In addition, no one has the right, without the knowledge of Goskomimuchestvo, to dispose of an enterprise's property until it has become private. Even before there were a lot of people wishing to sell goods on the quiet, while reorganization was underway. Restrictions have been imposed on the creation of holding companies. Knowing our old love of changing the landmarks and raking in the cash, we have written into the program that no holding can have more than 10 percent of the shares in any joint-stock company. At the same time the purchase of shares by commercial banks is restricted. The ruination of enterprises inevitably rebounds on banks, and therefore, on their investors. A chain reaction. We could become witness to what happened during the Great Depression in the United States. I want to bring cheer to the check investment funds: They are exempt from dual taxation. Undoubtedly, their influence on the affairs of an enterprise will also increase: Whereas before the fund could acquire no more than 10 percent of the shares of one entity, now it can acquire up to 25 percent. And one more detail that is of no little importance: There are strong and weak check funds. We have permitted the strong funds to buy up the shares of the weak funds. This has been done once again to prevent the bankruptcy of weaklings and, in the final analysis, to protect the interests of shareholders. Shareholders are also to have a greater say. It is established that only with the agreement of three-fourths of the members of a joint-stock company can the charter of a joint-stock company be changed, a large part of its capital handed over, or a decision on participation in holding companies be made. Cumulative voting is introduced, enabling a minority to be represented on the council of directors. A mechanism has been elaborated for holding assemblies of the joint-stock society. Let me say directly that it is not so easy to implement everything that is projected. Hence a system of "sticks and carrots" has been devised. Financial resources will be allocated to regions taking account of fulfillment of the State Privatization program. The stakes are high. But the problem for the country is also not inconsiderable. Increasing interest is being shown abroad in our privatization program. In principle this is no bad thing. But will Russian property not end up in the hands of "their" mafia? Especially the juiciest morsels: the defense complex, precious metals, oil, and gas. We therefore think the following system crucial: At the end of a competition or auction the organizations are to send the Federal Counterintelligence Service information on the winners in these auctions, and the Federal Counterintelligence Service is to gather all the necessary information within one month and present its conclusion to the government. And the government will issue the final verdict.
