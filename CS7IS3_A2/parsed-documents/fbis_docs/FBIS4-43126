He was not surprised by Forza Italia's result ("our polls had forecast it"), but he thought "the Center would lose more." "In any case, the results show that there is a gap between the voters of the Center and its leaders, who are too close to the Left," he added. On the League's losses, Berlusconi was very severe: "They should examine their conscience. People like those who respect pacts."
