The current rules were written in 1953, at the beginning of the Cold War period, and Erling Olsen thinks that it is time to put an end to the secret police's outdated picture of the enemy. Watching traditional enemies such as spies from East Europe is to be scaled down, while increased efforts are to be made against the new enemies. The new enemies are the international crime syndicates, the neo-Nazis, other extreme right-wing forces, the former BZ's -- the so-called autonomous groups -- [radical squatters and activists operating in inner Copenhagen] and the rocker groups. In an interview with SONDAGS POLITIKEN, Erling Olsen justifies his views by referring to the political changes that have taken place in Europe during the last five or six years. The Cold War is over, and the old antagonisms between East and West no longer exist. "What has happened is that we now have fewer external enemies and more internal ones," he said. The justice minister is of the opinion that the Russian mafia, the Italian Mafia, the Chinese triads and the South American drug syndicates represent a real threat to Denmark. He categorizes them as "internal enemies" because they set up branches here in Denmark and function as a sort of crime importation business. One example of their activity is the dozens of villa break-ins reported by the police north of Copenhagen each week. At the same time, Germany is exerting pressure on Denmark to get the Danish authorities to take a firmer stand against the extreme right-wing movements in Denmark. The Germans, among other things, resent the fact that sales of German nazi literature have taken place from a box number in Randers, and that the German Thies Christophersen is able to distribute nazi propaganda from his home in Kollund. "Germany is pressurizing us at the moment; they see us as so open and democratic that we may become a haven for German nazi forces and right-wing forces. They are able to conduct their business from here. We can also see that a number of the Danish nazis have fairly good links with the German right-wing forces. This is something we must keep an eye on," Erling Olsen said. The present government regulations were formulated by the then Justice Minister Hans Haekkerup and are confidential. The new ones will also be confidential, but will only be written after consultation with the five-member committee in the Folketing, set up in 1988 to keep an eye on both the Police Intelligence Service and the Defense Intelligence Service. "Writing the rules is my responsibility, but it is always wise to listen to others," Erling Olsen said.
