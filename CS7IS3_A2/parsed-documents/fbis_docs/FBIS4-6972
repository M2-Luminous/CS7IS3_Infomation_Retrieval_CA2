FBIS4-6972 "dreas080_a_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata Holds News Conference on Issue Hata Holds News Conference on Issue OW2604004194 Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese 1823 GMT 25 Apr 94 OW2604004194 Tokyo NHK General Television Network Japanese BFN [News conference by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata with unidentified correspondents in front of the prime minister's official residence, in Tokyo -- live] [Text] [Correspondent] The current situation seems to be extremely abnormal because at the very start of your assumption of the post, the administration's foundation has begun to break down. Concerning the abrupt formation of a new parliamentary group, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] regarded it as clearly an intentional action, disclosed its opposition, and announced its decision to break away from the coalition this evening. First of all, would you explain how you feel about this series of incidents? [Hata] Yes. Since I was elected the new prime minister at the sessions of both houses today, I originally intended to organize the cabinet as soon as possible. However, it is a matter of regret that SDPJ Chairman Murata came to see me and that during our talks, he told me that he personally thinks the creation of the new group -- Kaishin [Reformation] -- is an abuse of confidence and, as a result, he would like to have consultations with his party. And then, after midnight -- at about 0130 or around 0100 -- he gave me a phone call, saying that he had talked to each of them and that each felt -- though it is regrettable -- that it is an abuse of confidence. Therefore, he said if the situation should remain unchanged, his party will not be able to go along as a member of the ruling coalition parties. He said that though it is a matter of regret, it is what he wanted to inform me. Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, I feel that what he has told me was exactly what they had talked over within their party. But I was nominated as prime minister through voting by various parties. I am determined, in my position, to carry out my duties with their cooperation, and I requested that further talks be held. However, the fact is that he informed me of their decision after fairly thorough discussions, and then, 10 or 20 minutues later, the announcement was made. We regret it very much. [Correspondent] Concerning this concept of creating a new parliamentary group today, Mr. Prime Minister, did you know that it was included in today's schedule? [Hata] No. I heard that a notice for the group's formation was made at 2000 [1100 GMT] tonight, but I did not know that it would be done today. At any rate, as I have stated on various occasions, such as on television programs or in my interviews with you, when I review the past eight months of my work under the Hosokawa administration, I would give a high appraisal of the work done by each party since each had to overcome various difficulties. However, the point at issue lies in the fact that we could not discuss various problems among ourselves, but these issues had to be taken back to their parties for discussion. Under such a situation, I feel that it will be a serious problem because it will take much time to deal with the difficult problems we will have to handle in the future, and, moreover, we may not be able to take concerted action. In this sense, I have stated that it would be desirable to have two major forces in the true sense of the word. And if this cannot be done in one stroke, it would be desirable that in the process of creating something like a parliamentary group, the two major forces form gradually in the future. To tell the truth, this is what I have stated recently on television programs, and I have also stated that efforts should be made to this end. [Correspondent] However, the SDPJ maintains that it is an abuse of confidence. What do you think of this point? [Hata] Speaking of an abuse of confidence, I was watching television just now, and the action seems to have been interpreted as being aimed at driving away the SDPJ. As is known to you all, I feel...[changes thought] For example, when the name of Mr. Michio Watanabe was mentioned and when I felt that the idea was to exclude the SDPJ, I stated that since the SDPJ had so far made efforts to deal with various issues, plans should be worked out on the basis of maintaining the framework of ruling coalition parties. Therefore, I do not think it is right for the SDPJ to say that we betrayed them. Moreover, concerning the creation of this group, Mr. Ouchi and Mr. Hosokawa have stated their views. And, regarding the result of the action, it does not mean that the group will include only those who have gathered here. An appeal will be made to several other political parties -- or should I say all parties -- to join us, and in fact that appeal has actually been made. In this connection, this does not involve an abuse of confidence. For example, a parliamentary group was once formed by the Japan New Party and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger], and we have stated different views on this group. However, no one has ever mentioned an abuse of confidence. In this connection, I would say there must be some misunderstanding. This is what I feel now. [Correspondent] My next question concerns the schedules for tomorrow and after. For the time being, you have given up the idea of forming the new cabinet tonight. What plans do you have for tomorrow and afterward? [Hata] The situation now is that it was at about 2100 or 2130 that Mr. Murayama left here, and then he did not return here, rather the announcement was made. In this sense, there are questions as to how this result has been brought about and what discussions were carried out by the SDPJ. All parties, that is all other ruling coalition parties, have not gathered yet to talk about these questions. In this connection, I think all of us will probably get together to have discussions among the various parties tomorrow. Meanwhile, I will get in touch with other leading membes of our party, and I have been talking with leaders of other parties who were here just now. And I think it is important to tell the SDPJ our true intention. Therefore, I think the first thing I will do tomorrow is to have candid discussions with the SDPJ and try to ask them to remain in the coalition government. [Correspondent] Does it mean, Mr. Prime Minister, that you will have talks with Chairman Murayama yourself? [Hata] Of course, I will have to meet personally with Mr. Murayama, and I am ready to have talks with him at any time. Just now, I had talks -- what shall I say -- not with stinging words, with Mr. Murayama, but he told me frankly that the decision was made, though it was regrettable. However, I told him that maybe a little more time should be spent on discussing this issue. In reply, he told me that the decision was made after thorough discussions. And someone else told me just now: Mr. Hata, it is a matter of regret but Chairman Murata just left for a news conference. And when I asked him whether it would be possible to hold out a little longer, he told me that the chairman had actually left. My conversation with these two persons was not at all talk with stingy words. Therefore, first of all talks will have to be held among various political parties on the reason why the action was seen as an abuse of confidence. And if necessary, I will be ready to hold as many talks as called for. And we would like to appeal for further talks. And since ours is a coalition government, it involves many difficulties. However, I have never given up on the idea that there still remain chances for further talks. [Correspondent] However, if the SDPJ does not change its original intention, the Hata administration will probably be forced to run state affairs as a minority administration. [Hata] Since one party has disclosed its decision in such a way, there is a possibility that the situation will turn out as you have just pointed out. However, since we will continue to make efforts, I would like to refrain from making any prediction in saying such and such actions will be taken. [Correspondent] In that case, what will be the time limit? [Hata] Talking about the time limit, we are going to have consecutive holidays soon. If actions should not be taken before these holidays, the situation will probably become rather unstable. I would not like to set any time limit at this moment. However, I hope some sort of an orientation can be worked out as soon as possible. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, I think there must be change in the scheduling of Diet sessions, including your policy speech scheduled to be delivered tomorrow. Faced with the consecutive May holidays drawing near, what is your prospect for the scheduling? [Hata] I did not expect this situation. But the scheduling for the Diet sessions has to be decided. I cannot make any clear scheduling of the Diet sessions now because we have to see what the situation will be. Other ruling parties are supposed to hold a meeting here at 1000 tomorrow morning, and at the meeting I want to consult with them on how to deal with the issue. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, I remember you previously saying that politics that cannot win the people's understanding is not politics. Do you think that what is happening now is understandable to the people? [Hata] Frankly speaking, to avoid the people's misunderstanding, I want to stress that the coalition is formed by groups who have their own political backgrounds and policies. Unlike that of other nations, the coalition government in Japan is just eight months old, and there may be criticism of the coalition for delays in making quick actions. But since the coalition, formed after exchanges of sharp debates among its members, has made a fresh start amid a new trend in the world, I intend to always explain the status of the situation as much as possible to win the people's further understanding. Television programs are increasingly regarding me as a common person. My policy is that I always try to put my political activities on the common people's level. As I said earlier, I want the people to understand that the coalition is just eight months old, during which time it has had to overcome many difficult issues. I think that in that process, cooperative ties and mutual understanding among the coalition parties have been further deepened, and even when I talked to heads of the ruling parties such as SDPJ Chairman Murayama as well as secretaries general, I reaffirmed the cooperative relations among the ruling parties. But now, I strongly feel that although the coalition partners have so far cleared many hurdles, there is still difficulty in getting along with each other. I think within the SDPJ there must have been various opinions on how to form the coalition. Despite this, members of the SDPJ voted for me, and I cannot forget their support and hope to keep it in mind. [Correspondent] I want to reconfirm that you are still eager to manage the government beginning tomorrow while maintaining the current framework which the SDPJ joins, are you not? [Hata] We would like the SDPJ to stop thinking that we are betraying it. The coalition partners have agreed on policies by putting in many hours of discussions on such policy coordination. In view of this, I want to make all-out efforts to the end to ask the SDPJ to remain in the coalition. I think this is what politics should be. [Correspondent] So, you want to form the cabinet tomorrow? [Hata] Yes, I intend to do my utmost to do so.
