Convention of Nationalist Reformers Chairman Jacques Matanda announced two days ago that the radical Zairian opposition would launch an armed struggle to paralyze the country and force President Mobutu to quit. Jacques Matanda also said, quote: Mobutu can be overthrown, the main thing is to start it. As one might imagine, the MPR, the former sole party, has reacted to the statement. The party's European representative, Jean-Paul Huamba, has expressed his displeasure at Mr. Matanda's statement. He spoke to Mohamed Youssouffou Saliou. [Begin Huamba recording] Any idea of democracy that includes violence and any kind of undemocratic behavior must be rejected. Mr. Matanda has no right to incite people to violence, as Zairians are currently seeking a political solution to their problem through the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-TP]. The MPR, therefore, finds Mr. Matanda's statement in Luanda offensive. We have only just signed the Palais de Marbre agreement, which welcomed negotiators and former parliamentarians into the HCR- TP. He could have waited until the constitutional document governing the transitional period has been formulated, as this will clarify the political situation. [end recording]
