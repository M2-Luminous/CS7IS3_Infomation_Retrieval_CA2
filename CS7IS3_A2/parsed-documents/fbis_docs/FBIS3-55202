A View of the Results of the Parliamentary Elections From the Angle of Our Immediate Future"] [Text] Hoping That Fate Itself Has Not Toyed Too Long... I cannot shake off the thought that once again -- I am referring to the parliamentary elections and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's unexpected success -- unknown laws of the historical process are toying with us. The success of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] is at the same time an answer to the historically significant question of whether revenge by communism is possible in the foreseeable future. The answer is: It is not possible. This is also a shattering defeat for the bloc of national-patriotic forces grouped around the newspaper DEN and similar publications and exemplified by the National Salvation Front [NSF]. Who remembers the NSF now? Yet only a little while ago its leaders were terrorizing the Supreme Soviet, calling the political tune for Ruslan Khasbulatov, and making a puppet of Aleksandr Rutskoy; it was primarily they who were the source of the threat of a constitutional coup, they who were the organizers of direct actions to seize power, as demonstrated 3-4 October. So far we have twice witnessed the phenomenon of self-defeat by the forces of the past: communism as a social system in 1991 and the soviets as the organ of state power of that system in 1993. Maybe in Zhirinovskiy and his LDPR we have a new phenomenon -- the phenomenon of self-exposure. In other words, the transformation into a dead end of the destructive energy gradually accumulated over the years and the decades in society during the years of communist rule and later generated by every conceivable and inconceivable means by the NSF leaders, other communopatriotic organizations, and also the mass media. It has already happened more than once in history that the danger of a particular social phenomenon has been removed because it has suddenly acquired grotesque features in society's eyes. That is not a categorical assertion; rather it is an assumption or hypothesis. The Same Two Poles All Over Again? "What a strange and fateful country is Russia!" Ilya Erenburg wrote in his article "The Poles," published in Kiev in 1919. "It is as though the only colors left for it on the divine palette were black and white." You cannot help recalling these words when you think about what may lie in store for us. The two years until the next parliamentary and presidential elections in our dramatic life will probably move as swiftly as a play based on a book by Agatha Christie. And what will happen? The political center has collapsed as an influential force, and the polarization among the political elite has unfortunately also affected society itself, albeit not yet on a large scale. As yet there is no sign of either a second or a third echelon to take the place of the current democrats without detriment to our future civilized development. Yet at present radical trends are merely gathering strength. Experience of postsocialist development in Europe shows that the parties that have undertaken the extremely difficult mission of transforming the deathly economy and deathly political system into something viable with mechanisms for self-development through their reforming activity at the same time call into being negative processes and phenomena in the socioeconomic and spiritual and moral spheres which mean that they are usually defeated in the next elections. Their defeat is usually to the benefit of left-wing forces that have emerged from communism. Lithuania, Poland -- the list goes on. At present we have no such forces, and there is not even any sign of them. When Viktor Ilyukhin, one of the leaders of the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], was asked about the party's drift toward social democracy, he answered in the negative, claiming that this is just tactics. "If we had approached voters with extreme left-wing slogans, we would inevitably have lost the elections." That is frank. In the pure bolshevik style. But neither do we have any sign of an alternative on the right of the current ruling democrats. "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc]? The PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]? It is doubtful. Maybe, instead of the possible transformation of the Communists into social democrats, a bloc will emerge on the left made up partly of "Gorbachevites," partly of industrialists, partly of agrarians, and partly of moderate nationalists? In short, at present we are left with the same old gloomy bipolar picture. Will the Communists be replaced by nationalists? In general the current authorities have to forecast what the political spectrum may be in two years' time. And not only forecast it, but so far as possible channel the social process in a civilized direction. Zhirinovskiy As a Barometer of Russians' Social Temperature Nevertheless, let us return to our topic, so to speak. The wave of emotion in viewing the election results has abated. The hysterics from the particularly "neurotic" section of our intelligentsia have largely ended. Admittedly, a new round of moaning about other topics has begun. A considerable proportion of the intelligentsia has never grasped the simple truth that democracy is an expensive and troublesome business, and the intelligentsia's characteristic maximalist approach is totally unacceptable here. So the time has come for more civilized assessments, profound analysis of what has happened, trustworthy conclusions, and appropriate decisions. The tone of the serious press, statements by representatives of the establishment, and recent steps by the president show that the decline in the population's interest in the elections and referendum, the LDPR's unexpected success, and the unrealized hopes of "Russia's Choice" have been seen as a warning. And it has been heeded. The immediate future will indicate whether it has been properly heeded. However, a few fundamentally important details of the latest scene in the Russian political drama remain backstage. Nor can the audience see the prompters. Not everything is clear about the LDPR's success. At the same time it is totally obvious that however we describe Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's ideological and political views (neofascism, national-chauvinism, and so forth), however we explain his success, and whatever future we forecast for this success, today we are living in a different Russia from the country that existed prior to the elections. Neither better nor worse -- simply different. Reality is becoming increasingly complex and increasingly multidimensional, with more and more factors determining the vector of social development, and this development itself is becoming less and less unilinear and predictable. Essentially Russia is now different from the old familiar country that existed on the eve of the elections. It is simply that many of us have failed to notice this. We have failed to notice that the rules of the political game have changed fundamentally. The multiparty system and free access by parties to the mass media, the different capacities of different participants in the election campaign to pay for and exploit airtime, in general the different approaches toward the election campaign itself, the absence of an established political culture and traditions of parliamentarianism, and the pursuit of different moral (or immoral) imperatives objectively also created different conditions of political struggle. It's like the proverb: Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Dangerous Specter But, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. Rephrasing our unforgettable classics, let us say that the elections highlighted a specter that has begun to haunt Russia -- the specter of authorities that are out of touch with the people. So when the democratic public, frightened by Zhirinovskiy's neo-Nazi slogans and appeals, hastens to set up an antifascist movement in the country, I assert the following. Yes, such a movement must be created for we have already come face to face with fascism during the 3-4 October events. But the antifascist movement, if it is destined to exist, must not be reduced to the struggle against the LDPR. I emphasize, I constantly have the feeling that the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon," for all its possible dangers, is merely a timely warning to society. An even more serious danger -- unless, of course, the response is appropriate to the challenge -- may emerge from behind the not overly broad back of Vladimir Volfovich or from another direction entirely. Furthermore, his success has come as a surprise to Zhirinovskiy himself, and developments during the realization of this success may come as a surprise to us. The prevailing opinion is emerging that Zhirinovskiy skillfully reaped a harvest that he had certainly not sown. In other words, the votes for the LDPR were a transmogrified protest by our citizens against current living conditions. Correct. But this is not only a social protest, although that may be the predominant element. Discontent has built up in many areas. That is on top of the fact that many people have lost their accustomed status. And on top of the extremely negative fact of the lumpenization of a considerable section of the intelligentsia. First, there is crime and corruption. This is also a social and, as we know, serious problem, although it is mixed up with a lot of half-truths and downright lies thanks to the endeavors of the opponents of reform and the superficiality of our journalism and simply of stupid people. It will take more than three months, three years, or even thirty years to put a stop to them. Crime, corruption included, will exist as long as man lives, given that he is by no means a holy product of nature. This is shown by the experience of the most stable, "well fed," and law-abiding nations. In any case, we by no means lead the world in terms of the number of crimes. The problem, in my view, lies in, on the one hand, sharply reducing the most dangerous and worrying types of crime, especially organized crime, and, on the other, convincing society of the seriousness of the authorities' intentions, so that the crude lie about the "criminal revolution" and "criminal authorities" does not stick like mud to the reformers, particularly in the upper echelon of power. However, there is just one aspect to the problem. The reformers themselves must be clean, and the president and premier must be uncompromising in combating this evil. There is more need of glasnost here than in any other sphere. We must create conditions in which it is difficult for corruption to spread. Second, many people are feeling bad about the disintegration of the USSR, many people still have relatives in nearby foreign countries. Many people have lost their accustomed links and contacts and their accustomed way of life. Not to mention those for whom identity as an empire and superpower is the supreme value in itself; who would reduce their own mother to poverty for the sake of reveling in our military might and experiencing paroxysms of joy at the very thought that we are feared in the world and regarded as an "evil empire" and that we are capable of destroying all life on earth several times over; and who seriously believe in the possibility of restoring the USSR or the Russian empire and are prepared to countenance a bloodbath for this. All this must be explained to people. But there is a need for particular tact here. However, we must also tell the truth: Attempts to save the USSR by force would have meant a real tragedy for the peoples. Third, not only history, but also the communopatriots were on Zhirinovskiy's side. Revanchist forces conducted real psychological warfare against the president, the democrats, and Russian democracy in general effectively under the protection of the Supreme Soviet. The nationalists, together with the communists, managed to create in the eyes of a section of the Russian people a false image of a humiliated country acting at the bidding of the West and especially the United States and selling off its national assets. As though following the behests of Dr. Goebbels, the communopatriotic press kept on repeating absurd, deliberately false and simply insulting claims about Boris Yeltsin's "occupation regime," the "government of national betrayal and treachery," and "colonial democracy," called for a "national liberation struggle," urged the people to "rise up for a fight to the death," and so forth. In other words, it created an "enemy image" not only outside but also inside the country in an attempt to bring about the effect of wounded national pride characterizing Germany on the eve of the fascists' arrival in power. Clearly, this succeeded to some extent. And this happened at a time when Russia, as the legal successor to the USSR, remains a nuclear superpower and enjoys great political clout in the world. Fourth, when you consider that Zhirinovskiy is more of a good actor than a stage manager, his stage management is highly professional. He not only "privatized" virtually all the sore points of a society that has just embarked on the path of transition from totalitarianism to democracy but also keeps in mind the particular features of our national character and traditions, taking account of our strong and weak points. His attention focused on the following: the tendency of many of us at least to rely on simple and speedy solutions, including strong-arm solutions, the fear of independence, the habit at the drop of a hat of looking to the all-powerful state, which has to look after us, the continuing longing for a "master" who would emerge and "impose order," and the ineradicable belief in honeyed promises and simple gullibility. Even Cats Like a Kind Word What do the many people tired of poverty and hungry for rapid change care about Gaydar's macroeconomic schemes when Vladimir Volfovich promises to change life for the better as soon as they vote for him! To some people he promises free underwear, to others vodka, and to others entire countries on a plate. Psychologists who have made a special study of the personality of Zhirinovskiy have said how skillfully he exploits the stereotypes of behavior which were developed in society over many years of totalitarianism and which have by no means vanished but have merely entered a state of latency and, given the opportunity, are ready to immediately proclaim their existence. Take the problem of the hatred that was constantly fueled in Soviet society -- only its targets have changed. It is simple to make political capital out of hatred that can be easily aroused in conditions of crisis and directed against "yid masons," or "Caucasian nationals," or those who are "selling the homeland down the river." The psychologists emphasized that direct criticism, especially crude attacks on the LDPR leader, will inevitably boomerang. I don't know whether Zhirinovskiy would have been helped by hypnosis or psychotherapy if the democrats in various blocs and parties had not confused people; if society had not been in a state of deep crisis; if many people had not been so disoriented and troubled; and if the democrats had done what they ought to have done as democrats right from the first steps in the emergence of the new Russian statehood and new social system. What is really bothering people? Poverty? Yes, of course. But that is not what bothered us. The most oppressive thing is the apparent lack of any glimmer of light or prospects for the future. The disintegration of absolutely everything. The collapse of familiar principles and the values established over the years of Soviet power. The ones who find themselves in the most difficult position are elderly people and in part young people, many of whom are simply drifting with the current. Is this not why so many young people followed in "Zhirinovskiy's wake"? Where Are We Heading Many people have simply lost their heads in the face of the flourishing criminal business, raging "wild capitalism," the insolent behavior of the "nouveaux riches," the rampant crime, and the irritating behavior of our advertising, which has no sense of proportion or tact, in the face of a whole series of antisocial and antispiritual phenomena. They are fed up with communism, alias real socialism, and they do not want any return to the past, but they can in no way come to terms with what is taking its place. It is natural for questions such as "What are we building?" and "Where are we heading?" to arise in such conditions. And instead of attempting to answer these questions, to remove our fellow citizens' concern, and to explain to them that all this filth is the price society is forced to pay for the crimes of communism, which pushed the country out of its natural channel of development; that at the same time this is the price that must be paid in order to create eventually normal economic and social relations as the basis for our prosperity; that we have to put up with this filth as other peoples have done in order to avoid coming full circle and finding ourselves back in long lines facing empty shelves in the stores like our Ukrainian brothers, for instance; that we are almost on the point of more or less getting out of this filth -- in the face of all this the democrats arrogantly say: "We are laying the foundations of a new society in accordance with common sense and world experience, as other peoples have done." The people want to know what our social ideal is, what our new values are, what our new spirituality is. If their questions are not answered by the democrats, they will turn -- and in part already are turning -- to other political forces. In the extremely difficult struggle against the forces of the past, against the numerous and diverse forces of reaction, the democrats have consciously or otherwise surrendered to their political opponents some extremely important values revered by the people and capable of rallying them in the fight for the country's future. These include the ideals of social justice, patriotism, statehood, and lofty spirituality. These values must be won back without fail, especially as this process has already begun. Unless, of course, the democrats want to be defeated, thereby dooming the young Russian democracy to defeat as well. Last. In the years since August 1991 the democrats were concerned primarily to destroy the material and spiritual foundation of communism and prevent it from being revived. This is understandable. The forces of revenge are a real threat to our progress. But the focus of the struggle must now be shifted. I am convinced that the only social model that can be successfully implemented in our country is one which from the outset attaches exceptionally great importance to the social aspect of change and is geared, if you like, toward state paternalism, as in Japan, and toward preventing severe social contrasts. In the struggle between the two principles of freedom and social justice that has dragged on over the centuries, it is the latter that will triumph in our country unless we succeed in harmonizing them. And in this connection it is very annoying, no, very worrying that the democratic authorities seem to have divested themselves of everyday concern for people, or at any rate have not created appropriate mechanisms for this. But people who have grown up in the specific conditions of real socialism are often not yet ready for the independence characteristic of other countries. During the transitional period at least something must take the place of raykoms [party rayon committees]. In this sense Zhirinovskiy played the role of litmus paper. He visited many krays and oblasts. He said what people wanted to hear and flattered them. He praised. Persuaded. Reassured. Promised. And people took this as a display of attention, as a show of concern for them. And they responded. What Is To Be Done? The first conclusion. The policy of reforms "in all directions," so to speak, must be adjusted. I do not think it should be fundamentally changed. A coalition government? I do not think that would be sensible. Everything must be directed toward easing the situation of the most underprivileged section of the population as much as possible. The task of combating crime and corruption must become just as much of a priority. It is time to realize that these two problems have become extremely acute sociopolitical, spiritual, and moral problems, and the sympathies of the broad people's masses will be won by the side that can prove that it is capable of dealing with them. The second conclusion. The government must react more sensitively than ever to the mood of the masses, on the one hand, and explain, persuade, and prove the correctness of its line and the inevitability of passing through a stage of difficulties and the accompanying multitude of glaring antisocial phenomena, on the other hand. It must show more clearly what will happen if we turn aside from the course of reform and attempt to introduce a different model of transformations in present conditions. The third conclusion. The questions "What are we building?" and "Where are we heading?" must be answered at the highest level. The answer must be intelligent and immediate. Society needs a social, spiritual, and moral ideal. It is simply impossible to manage without this -- at least in our country. But all this will be left hanging in the air unless we begin building democratic parties. And not just a presidential party. We need a mass democratic party, in the spirit of struggle for a "society of universal well-being," if you like. The fourth conclusion. We must finally formulate the philosophy of national-state development and clarify its components. I reiterate: It is unforgivable that the democrats have left the idea of statehood and patriotism to those who, when it comes down to it, are neither patriots nor state-minded, if you mean by state-minded someone who fights for a social, democratic state called upon to serve the people rather than enslave them and to expend the country's resources in the interests of improving the people's well-being rather than waste them, as happened under the communists. The fifth and final conclusion. Foreign policy, including policy toward the nearby foreign countries, must also be adjusted in the light of the changes taking place in the country. Although I think it already is undergoing major adjustments.
