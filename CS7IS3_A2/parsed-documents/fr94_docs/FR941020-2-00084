SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: HUD/DEPT&hyph;2 contains a variety of records relating to HUD's accounting functions. These records are maintained for the purpose of supporting HUD's administrative management and collection of delinquent debts, including past due loan payments, overpayments, fines, penalties, fees, damages, interest, leases, sales of real property that are owed to HUD or to other Federal agencies. Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, notice is given that HUD proposes to modify some of the general routine uses and add new routine uses to this system of records. The revised routine uses (items (i), (k) and (l)) more specifically identify the categories of users (i.e., other Federal agencies) to whom records may be disclosed pursuant to authorized and approved computer matching programs undertaken for debt collection purposes. In addition, HUD is amending other routine uses (items (j), (m), (n), (o), and (p)) to permit more effective administrative management and collection of delinquent claims and debts owed to the U.S. Government under any programs administered by HUD. The amended portion of the system notice is set forth below. Previously, the system and a prefatory statement containing the general routines used applicable to all HUD systems of records was published in the ``Federal Register Privacy Act Issuances, 1989 Compilation, Volume I.'' Title 5 U.S.C. 552a(e) (4) and (11) provide that the public be afforded a 30-day period in which to comment on the new record system. The system report, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), has been submitted to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), pursuant to paragraph 4c of Appendix I to OMB Circular A&hyph;130, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals'' dated June 25, 1993 (58 FR 36075, July 2, 1993). Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a; 88 Stat. 1896; sec 7(d), Department of HUD Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). Issued at Washington, DC, October 14, 1994. Marilynn A. Davis, Assistant Secretary for Administration.
