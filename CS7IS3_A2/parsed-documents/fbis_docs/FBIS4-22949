I. Potapov, R. S. Gildenskiold, and I. L. Vinokur (Moscow); UDC 614:7-07(470)] [Text]Many years of industrial construction in Russia without comprehensive scientific work on the set of problems that determine the optimum impact of use of technologies on the environment and man have led society to the knowledge of many facts of the devastating effect on the environment and public health of economic activities in various industrially developed regions, now that the press has more freedom. According to data in an annual dealing with atmospheric pollution in cities of the Russian Federation, more than 40 cities are named in the list of cities with a high level of air pollution. Many hygienic research developments and data of WHO have shown that there is a distinct correlation between level and frequency of exposure to pollutants, morbidity and health status of people residing in such an environment [1-6, 9, 10]. The extent of manifestation of negative consequences of anthropogenic transformations of the environment is so great that, at present, there can be no question of simultaneous and comprehensive solution of the problem of improving and optimizing the stricken environment. We need to have validated routes for implementing in stages engineering, economic, social and medical measures in this direction. Laying scientific and methodological foundations for special mapping should be considered as one of the mechanisms for such control of this process. Originally, ecological-hygienic mapping, as a system of reflecting quantitatively and qualitatively the sanitary situation that has actually developed as a result of anthropogenic activities in a specific region, was elaborated at the Novosibirsk affiliate of the Hygiene and Occupational Pathology Scientific Production Association, with involvement of specialists in different fields of knowledge of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences [7], and in subsequent years it was further developed at the Moscow Research Institute of Hygiene imeni F. F. Erisman and other research institutions. The value of such mapping to the national economy, from the standpoint of environmental and health protection, lies in the fact (provided information is reliable) that it permits differentiated presentation of the severity of ecological-hygienic disturbances in the objects of investigation, forecasting future development of negative tendencies, determination with some degree of reliability of the most dangerous ``hot'' spots of environmental impact, and then to plan adequate effective measures for immediate and long-term implementation. Obtaining complete and reliable information is a difficult aspect of such ``ground-based'' multifactor mapping (geographic position, aerometeorological distinctions, concentration of industry, its composition, conditions of formation of fields of environmental pollution, potential for atmospheric pollution, self-purification processes, resettling of workers -- guidelines and their implementation, criteria of the burdens on the environment, health status and morbidity of the public, and many others). This applies, first of all, to quantitative and qualitative assessment of industrial sources of environmental pollution. We know that, at the present time, there is far from accurate registration or inventorying of industrial enterprises, in the absence of reliable devices (automated or semi-automated) for recording the toxic components of waste contained directly in the smoke plume. Consequently, reliability of forecasting on the basis of this indicator of technogenic impact is also relative. On the one hand, the correlation between overall impact of toxic substances on public health has been established for marked contrasts and, on the other hand, it does not have an adequate scientific foundation when exogenous factors are of low intensity. Evidently, it is worthwhile to also mention that so-called mobile sources -- exhaust from various means of transportation -- present a serious problem with respect to assessing the multifactor impact. We cannot fail to mention the capabilities of laboratory monitoring of environmental pollution which are presently based on methods of chemical assay that are not accurate or selective enough. High-precision physical monitoring methods and supply of modern instruments in different localities, even in hygienic research institutions, are being adopted too slowly. From the standpoint of enhancing forecast quality and, accordingly, recommended means of tactical interaction in a positive direction of development of the national economy, it is important to accurately assess the potential for pollution released by the soil and vegetation accumulated in the course of long-term operation of enterprises, which usually have obsolete technology, as a result of desorption by toxic substances, often already transformed in the environment, from the surface of buildings and installations, and the probability of their secondary negative impact on all living things within the limits of artificially created geochemical territories. There are grounds to discuss the fact that, with all the benefit of developing and using modern hygienic mapping, at present it is deemed desirable to direct efforts, as much as possible, toward upgrading this important direction of national economic, sociohygienic and ecological research. Aerial mapping from outer space, as a large-scale additional element of ``terrestrial'' mapping, may be viewed as an important one of these informative procedures that are on the front lines of our science. What would we like to gain from the use of this methodological procedure and what we can expect of it, in view of the fact that space engineering is, as a rule, considerably ahead of the capabilities of ``terrestrial measurements'' from the standpoint of hygiene? First of all, with the high resolution of the equipment, it is realistic to expect obtaining precise data on the range of pollution of a given industrially developed territory as a result of long-term settling of toxic constituents of discharged waste on the earth's surface. Special emphasis should be placed on the fact that the first joint work with the research center for space ecology indicates that, as of the present time, the main characteristics of the technogenic burden on a specific territory, as ``seen'' from space, are in the form of distinctly circumscribed spots differing in intensity. Technically, it is possible to obtain cross-sections of such a spot according to saturation density at any specified altitude, starting virtually with the earth's superficial layer. At present it is extremely important for space engineering to enable us to determine the differences in extent of involvement of the environment of a given part of a city, a region, not only according to intensity and density of the smoke cloud, but also according to composition of main and permanent elements of urban pollution -- sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, heavy metals, etc. The intensity and qualitative composition of the smoke ``plume'' traveling in the wind direction would enable us to compare the findings of ground- based studies (laboratory, forecasts, mathematical) to values recorded from space, which would have a direct influence on reliability of data and, of course, help enhance the quality of work carried out everywhere in the direction of ecology and hygiene. We believe that, to some extent, such studies will help define the optimum locations for permanent observation stations for monitoring actual industrial pollution levels in residential parts of urban regions. They could have a substantial impact on development of forecasting of significance of spread of pollutants, which is used extensively in the form of an effective method of calculating the scatter of waste in the atmosphere (OND-86) in industrial construction plans [8]. Determination of pollutants differing in saturation over the entire potential range of pollution of a region under study, which is done under ordinary conditions in isolated cases by very labor-intensive work, for example, metallometric photography, would make it possible to correctly ``trigger'' the mechanism for adopting the most effective measures to ``correct'' the developed adverse situation locally in a given region. And there is one more important factor. Because of two-way definition and refinement of methodological approaches to terrestrial and space monitoring in order to enhance reliability of indicators of technogenic pollution of a residential region, one can expect with confidence that ongoing and dynamic ground-based monitoring of the sanitary condition of the urban environment, which is very expensive, could be handed over entirely (with great informativeness) to space monitoring. Within the same approach, one could develop an enlarged scale,comprising the intensity of pollution spot coloration and concentrations of main and overall pollutants; on the basis of this scale, objectively validated territories differing in degree of pollution of the environment, zones of biologically hazardous existence, etc., could be charted with utmost reliability on the map of Russia. In this regard, it is hoped that the representative positive experience in determining correlations between intensity of pollution according to darkness of the spot from space and data on demography and morbidity pertaining thus far only to one nosological form, involvement of respiratory organs, would make it possible to formulate and solve on a global scale the problem of defining the order and urgency of development of protective steps. It would be desirable to use, along with the data from space mapping, those obtained from ground-based hygienic mapping, medical statistics and clinical studies, which would make it possible to create in cartography a scientific classification of ecological-hygienic zoning. Such an approach would have a substantial effect on solving a number of problems. It will become possible for the State to allocate funds in a purposeful way with scientific validation for environmental protection (at the expense of fines imposed on enterprises and local budget), first of all in the most hazardous polluted regions for the purpose of ongoing and rapid amelioration. As a mandatory prerequisite in plans for socio-economic development of specific regions, closure of particularly hazardous industries and plants, and implementation of radical reconstruction of enterprises with adoption of modern, progressive waste-free or minimum-waste technologies within time periods coordinated in each individual case, would be an objective argument against further build-up of the industrial potential within a specific, limited polluted territory. In order to comprehend the sociohygienic situation, an accurate ``view from the top'' would permit objective evaluation of biologically possible or impossible further resettling of workers in a given region as a whole and as applied to each major urban region. Just as important, and perhaps even more important, is objective determination of optimum times, from the standpoint of safeguarding public health, for implementation of long-term programs, developed with the participation of hygienists, for improving living conditions, measures to improve the health of the public in each specific city, rayon, and region; the established ranges of migration of technogenic impurities when waste is discharged through ultratall smokestacks would permit consideration of the internationally important matter of migration of pollutants across frontiers from the territory of our State to adjacent countries. Appropriate mapping of dynamic features of this process would also permit solving the problem of lowering the intensity of directional flow and improving the existing situation. Of basic importance is the question of correlation between factors of environmental pollution and health indictors. One can advance to quantitative forecasting of health indicators, including morbidity indicators, by establishing, with use of hygienic monitoring, the quantitative correlation between the integral sanitary description of the environment and indicators of health status of different age-sex and social groups -- physical development, functional (including immunological) deviations, morbidity (most frequently determined according to frequency of seeking medical attention) and mortality rates. From the standpoint of hygiene, when monitoring public health it is important to organize records of premorbid states (prenosological diagnoses), first of all among the child population, on the basis of analysis of results of periodic physicals. It will be necessary to devote particular attention to forecasting morbidity related to the negative influence of environment polluting factors, development and determination of integral pollution indicators and priority pollutants, detection of groups, territories and diseases at risk, keeping records of social, environmental and other factors. Bearing this in mind, it is imperative to immediately integrate ground- based information obtained in the course of ground-based hygienic mapping, which includes not only data on pollutants, but also on their effect on human health, with the maps plotted from space of changes in transparency of the atmosphere, and to develop methods for such integration, which should conform accurately enough both to the capabilities of terrestrial and space monitoring, and to the goal of solving the most pressing problems of protecting the environment and human health, i.e., we are referring to involvement of health care agencies in the system of ecological-hygienic ground-based and space monitoring, on the basis of using modern technology, knowledge in environmental hygiene and mathematical methods. Thus, refinement of a reliable enough ground-based and space method of monitoring and ranking, which would permit not only ecological hygienic zoning of the country, but also systematic ongoing information about changing situations in order to control the quality of the environment on the broadest scale in the interests of public health, is the principal factor, from the standpoint of science and practice, in development of this direction of research.
