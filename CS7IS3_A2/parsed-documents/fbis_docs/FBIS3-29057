International sanctions against the Stalinist state would heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula, the main opposition party concluded at the meeting attended by supreme councilors and lawmakers belonging to the National Assembly's Defense and Foreign Affairs-National Unification Committees. The letter will be delivered to Clinton, via Secretary of State Warren Christopher, by Rep. Chong Tae-chol when he visits Washington later this week. The party also agreed that if sanctions become inevitable after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors meeting slated for Feb. 21, they should be taken on a step-by-step basis. Spokesman Pak Chi-won said the letter would convey to President Clinton the party's hope for fresh efforts to seek a peaceful way out, such as a package solution, by calming down U.S. hard-liners warning of the danger of war on the Korean peninsula.
