FBIS4-31257 "dreeu110_a_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 ALBANIA Authorities Close Road Link With Montenegro Authorities Close Road Link With Montenegro AU0706132894 Paris AFP in English 1300 GMT 7 Jun 94 AU0706132894 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, June 7 (AFP) -- The only road link between Albania and Montenegro has been closed to traffic for five days, a local daily reported Tuesday. The Albanian authorities have forbidden any vehicles from crossing into or out of Montenegro -- which together with Serbia forms rump-Yugoslavia -- at Bozaj, said Lazar Jankovic, spokesman for the Yugoslav Commission for Border Incidents, quoted Tuesday by the local daily POBJEDA. The road is open to pedestrians. The Albanian authorties apparently took the action after Albanian truck drivers had blocked the border because, Jankovic said, they were "unhappy at the changing criteria imposed by Yugoslav customs officials." Since a total embargo was imposed on Yugoslavia two years ago, the Bozaj border-control post has become the focus of traffic in oil and other supplies for the Yugoslav market. Several Montenegrins were arrested recently by Albanians for trafficking oil, according to rumours which Montengrin authorities refuse to confirm. PJOBEDA said it had learnt from unoffical sources that six policemen and a Montenegrin customs officer were being questioned for their role in the trafficking.
