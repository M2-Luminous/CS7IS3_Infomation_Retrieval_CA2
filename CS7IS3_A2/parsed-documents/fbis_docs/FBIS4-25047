Retaliation was immediate against those Hong Kong reporters who signed a statement boycotting official propaganda events in China, and they were not to be allowed to cover news related to the Qiandao Hu incident. The rapid retaliation by the CPC authorities shocked many people. An informed source in the CPC propaganda department said that the tough approach taken by the CPC authorities to the Hong Kong media was related to the "leftist" shift of their general policy toward Hong Kong. Lu Ping's recent remarks negating Hong Kong's role as a political city show that the CPC authorities have in fact revised the "one country, two systems" policy laid down by Deng Xiaoping to deal with the Hong Kong issue. At present, the CPC's interpretation of the "one country, two systems" policy is: the "one country, two systems" formula refers only to the economic system; that is, Hong Kong may continue horse racing, night club dancing, and stock speculation. However, Hong Kong people must not be allowed to oppose the Communist Party in the political realm and must abide by the four cardinal principles. That is, in the political realm, there will be no "one country, two systems." Such an interpretation is substantially different from their previous position of allowing people to swear at the Communist Party. According to the source, the CPC authorities recently decided to bring mass media operations in Hong Kong under strict control after 1997 in order to guarantee social stability and guarantee China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. They will not allow some people to "create disturbances" in Hong Kong by using press freedom. An informed source revealed that a relevant department of the CPC authorities had set up a special body to secretly formulate rules of behavior and management regulations for the press in Hong Kong after 1997. This will substantially narrow the scope of press freedom in Hong Kong from what it is now. He said: Another measure the CPC authorities will take is to run a party organ fully representative of Beijing's position. The newspaper will be directly run by the government of the special administrative region [SAR] and could be named XIANGGANG TEQU BAO [HONG KONG SPECIAL REGION JOURNAL]. He said the plan had been put into practice, and a number of officials would be transferred from various journalist units to Hong Kong batch by batch to prepare to publish the newspaper. Reportedly, a deputy editor-in-chief of BEIJING RIBAO has recently been appointed as deputy editor-in-chief of TA KUNG PAO, and he will also be on the preparatory group of XIANGGANG TEQU BAO. The informed source also said that in his view and that of his friends, if major change does not take place in the Chinese Government, after 1997, the press freedom enjoyed by Hong Kong people today will be substantially restricted by the Beijing authorities. As things are different than the mainland, the CPC authorities will not control the nonpolitical parts of the press. However, political news reportage will be brought under strict control according to news rules and regulations. He said that it was still unclear how the new rules and regulations would be formulated, because the Beijing authorities kept things highly secret in this regard. It is expected that the CPC authorities will lay down restrictions on subjects and opinions to be handled by the press in the name of safeguarding state security and interests, maintaining social stability, and preventing subversive activities against the government. The SAR government will be authorized to close down mass media which violate the regulations, or legal action may be taken against them. However, he thought that the CPC authorities would not release regulations for controlling the press too soon. They would not do this until the date of government transfer in 1997 is very close, because such an act is obviously a violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Press freedom is the last line of defense for Hong Kong people to safeguard their current lifestyle. The British have never published any official organs in Hong Kong. The overall plan Beijing will use to control the press and public opinion in Hong Kong will certainly destroy Hong Kong people's confidence and could even throw the local community into complete chaos.
