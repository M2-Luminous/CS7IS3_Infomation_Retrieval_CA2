"Bolkestein will not enter the new cabinet if that is his demand," Kok said yesterday evening in Amsterdam. The VVD leader's position about the children of illegal immigrants, stated last week in a debate on television, is an obstacle to the "purple" coalition [comprising the PvdA, the VVD, and the Democrats 66 (D66)], in the eyes of the PvdA. "There are barriers which you cannot cross mentally and morally," Kok said. At yesterday's May Day celebration, it emerged that in the PvdA, doubts are increasing about whether a cabinet with the VVD is possible. Minister Van Thijn said that the gap between his party and the VVD "is very big" and during the election campaign "is getting bigger day by day." A "purple" coalition was only possible if "the VVD does not get the opportunity to attack the social justice of this country," Van Thijn said. Yesterday PvdA leading candidate Kok would not say whether he preferred a "purple" coalition or a coalition with the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], but he did say: "I can imagine that it is possible to make better agreements with the CDA on the social question than with the VVD. With its proposals, the VVD is taking the most extreme position." PvdA chairman Rottenberg also noted that the VVD, with its positions on foreigners, was making it "extremely difficult" to achieve a "purple" coalition. On AVRO radio yesterday, Prime Minister Lubbers said he expected the CDA and the D66 to act together in the coming cabinet formation and the PvdA to also probably be part of the next cabinet. "It is best for tackling social and economic problems that the CDA and the PvdA work together," he said. "The best way to follow up the fight against crime is a dialogue between the CDA and the D66." In Amsterdam yesterday, Kok said that it was possible that he would become prime minister in the coming cabinet. But he warned the PvdA against euphoria, now that it could possibly become the biggest party, even though according to the opinion polls it will not come close to getting the 49 seats it has at present. "If we get 35 or 36 seats, that is a serious blow. The fact that we would then be the biggest party is not sufficient compensation for that." Yesterday, the Green Left Party pronounced itself in favor of a progressive cabinet (with the PvdA and D66), if necessary, governing with VVD support. If the three left-wing parties together got 70 seats then "the right can move aside," Brouwer, the [Green Left] party's leading candidate, said.
