FBIS3-6216 "dreas050_d_94039" FBIS-EAS-94-050 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Mar 1994 South Korea * Newspaper Profiles Kim Chong-il's Supporters 942C0073A Seoul SINTONG-A in Korean Feb 94 pp 421-439 942C0073A Seoul SINTONG-A Language: Korean Article Type:CSO [Article by reporter Hwang Ui-pong: "Powerhouses in the Kim Chong-il Republic"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The story about the likelihood of something serious happening inside the power structure in North Korea where the succession of power to Kim Chong-il has been nearly completed is not limited to the realm of fiction. The Japanese biweekly SAPIO in its 12 August 1993 issue printed a sensational article about the possibility of a violent clash between the Kim Il-song faction and the Kim Chong-il faction. The article said: "The first round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea on matters concerning North Korea's withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] was held in New York. But the venue for the second round was moved to Geneva. It appears that Kim Il-song had something to do with the change of the venue. He probably wanted to prevent Kim Chong-il from making policy decisions and give his own instructions to the North Korean delegatio through Ambassador Kim Kwang-sop in Vienna. Earlier, on 18 March, just a week after North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT, Kim Kwang-sop took up his post as ambassador in Vienna. He is the husband of Kim Kyong-chin, daughter of Kim Il-song's third wife, Kim Chong-ae. Kim Kyong-chin is Kim Pyong-il's sister. Behind the sudden appointment of Kim Kwang-sop was Kim Il-song's desire to avoid isolation from the international community by dispatching Kim Kwang-sop, a man belonging to the anti-Kim Chong-il force, to the seat of IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] headquarters." The SAPIO article continues: "There is a possibility that an internal change in North Korea, irrespective of sanctions from the outside, will happen. Nobody knows when a neurotic Kim Chong-il might instruct his close aides who are present at a midnight meeting surrounded by pretty women to mount a deliberate attack on the South to provoke the South Korean front-line division commanders, or might order his aides to take up a plan to invade the South as a subject of discussion at such a meeting. Should that really happen, first- and second-generation revolutionaries might urge officers who support Kim Pyong-il to rise up in order to block Kim Chong-il's adventure." The content of the SAPIO article seems to have little substance. There is almost no reliable information to substantiate the likelihood of serious strife or conflict breaking out within the North Korean power elite, at least at this moment. Rather the dominant view is that, with the process of "dynastic succession of power to Kim Chong-il" progressing smoothly, a tidy Kim Chong-il kingdom is in the making. Nevertheless experts on North Korea are cautiously watching developments in North Korea. According to them, it appears on the surface that the Kim Chong-il hierarchy is being established, and there is ample room for unstable developments, depending on the situation. In the opinion of these experts, North Korea could be engulfed in an unpredictable political upheaval when Kim Il-song dies. One thing is certain about the Kim Chong-il leadership, namely, that after Kim Il-song dies, there will be internal strife in one form or another, and the way this strife is overcome may decide the fate of the Kim Chong-il regime. The prevailing view is that, in this process, threats to Kim Chong-il from opposing forces may come in the form of internal conflict among those in power rather than in the form of something like a popular uprising. Accordingly, it is very important to examine the profiles of those in power in North Korea in predicting the future of not only the current North Korean regime but also the Kim Chong-il regime after Kim Il-song's death. Would there emerge in North Korea a man like Khrushchev who downgraded Stalin? Or would the successor to the dictator in North Korea fall as Hua Guofeng did after Mao Zedong died? To examine the personal connections of those in power in North Korea, it is necessary first of all to know the peculiarities of the North Korean power structure. As everyone knows, In North Korea the party dominates the power structure. The party stands above the government, and all decisions and policies of the government are under party control. Power centers on three organizations, namely, the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee that exercises supreme leadership when the WPK Congress is not in session; the Political Bureau in control of the Central Committee; and the core of the Political Bureau, namely, its Standing Committee. The Political Bureau, which is at the center of power, currently consists of 13 full members and nine candidate members. The full members are: Kim Il-song (head of state, WPK general secretary, and chairman of the WPK Military Affairs Committee); Kim Chong-il (chairman of the National Defense Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Armed Forces [KPA]); O Chin-u (minister of People's Armed Forces); Kang Song-san (premier of the State Administration Council); Yi Chong-ok (vice president); Pak Song-chol (vice president); Kim Yong-chu (vice president); Kim Yong-nam (minister of foreign affairs); Choe Kwang (KPA chief of General Staff); Kye Ung-tae (party secretary); Chon Pyong-ho (party secretary); Han Song-yong (party secretary); So Yun-sok (responsible secretary, South Pyongan Provincial WPK Committee). These are really the most influential persons in North Korea. Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il, and O Chin-u (members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee) are at the core of the power center in North Korea. Considering the fact that O Chin-u is a symbolic figure representing the military as Kim Il-song's comrade in revolution, it may be said that Kim Il-song and his son are the ones who actually rule North Korea. The Secretariat, as important as the Political Bureau in the party machinery, discusses matters relating to personnel and other important matters as they arise and make pertinent decisions. Whereas the Political Bureau is a political organization that chiefly makes highly important political decisions, the Secretariat may be called an "organization above the administrative branch of government" because it formulates major practical polices and commands their implementation. The Secretariat consists of 11 members, including Kim Chong-il and Kye Ung-tae, under Secretary General Kim Il-song. It has 27 specialized divisions and has 12 municipal and provincial WPK committees under its control. In North Korea where the party stands supreme, holding party power means holding state power. The WPK Department of Organization and Guidance was the first official organization that Kim Chong-il joined in 1964 after he graduated from Kim Il-song University. It is in the party machinery where a majority of his trusted followers are placed. The WPK is Kim Chong-il's power base. The one who draws the foremost attention in the North Korean party hierarchy is Chang Song-taek, 49, husband of Kim Chong-il's younger sister. As a WPK Central Committee member, Chang heads three party departments, namely, the Department of Three-Revolution Team, the Department of Labor Organizations, and the Department of Youth Affairs. Irrespective of his position and rank, Chang Song-taek's star is rising rapidly because he is Kim Il-song's son-in-law and Kim Chong-il's brother-in-law. Opinions differ, but many experts regard Chang Song-taek as the third most powerful person after Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. Chang Song-taek is said to be a highly capable person with smooth personal relationships. What is more, he spends his money generously for people around him. That is why he is very popular. He is regarded as Kim Chong-il's alter ego in the party. Whereas Kim Chong-il is not easily accessible, Chang is readily accessible. Naturally, party cadres tend to flock around the latter. Chang is called "Kim Chong-il's itinerant counterpart" because he is the man who puts into execution policies prepared by Kim Chong-il and his policy planners in the party. Kim Chong-il has such an unquestioning trust in Chang Song-taek that he is quoted as saying, "You are the only person I can trust and depend on." Interestingly, some observers say that Chang Song-taek is rising so fast in the hierarchy that he is being held in check by both Ki Il-song and Kim Chong-il. Originally, Kim Il-song is said to have opposed accepting Chang as his son-in-law. Chang met Kim Il-song's daughter, Kim Kyong-hui, 48, for the first time while they were in college. Kim Kyong-hui, Chang's classmate at Kim Il-song University Department of Political Economics, loved him passionately. When Kim Il-song discovered their love affair, he forced Chang to be transferred to Songdo College of Political Economics in Wonsan. But Kim Kyong-hui loved Chang so much that she would travel to Wonsan by rail at each weekend to see him. In the end, Kim Il-song gave in and approved their marriage. Even after the marriage, Kim Il-song continued to hold Chang in check. In June 1990, when Kim Chong-il recommended that the vacant post of director of state security be filled by Chang Song-taek, Kim Il-song squashed the recommendation. They say the reason Kim Il-song is holding Chang Song-taek in check is that Chang is superior to Kim Chong-il in ability as well as in character. It is noteworthy that Kim Chong-il is also holding Chang Song-taek in check despite the fact that Chang is known as his closest aide. There were rumors that some sports officials and ambassadors known as Chang's men were replaced. In the latter part of 1993 the North Korean press mentioned "eliminating the act of playing toady to some cadres and fueling factionalism." Observers say that Chang Song-taek is the only person who could have been linked to this report. In its 24 June 1993 weekly edition NAEWOE TONGSIN reported that Kim Chong-il began to put his brakes on Chang Song-taek's abuse of power. Based on testimony by a North Korean defector, NAEWOE TONGSIN said: "In early 1991 Kim Chong-il convened a meeting of important party cadres in the central party headquarters during which he pointed out and criticized one by one the irregularities committed by Chang Song-taek." Following this episode party cadres were said to be trying to avoid Chang. As a matter of fact, it is difficult to confirm the rumor about the discord between Kim Chong-il and Chang Song-taek because their political activities are veiled in secrecy. But that rumor cannot but be the focus of attention because the blood ties among those at the top of the hierarchy might work as a fuse to kindle a power struggle. The story in Chong Ul-pyong's novel--the story that Chang Song-taek becomes the party general secretary after Kim Il-song and his son are ousted from power--may be based on the same assumption. Kim Il-song's brother, Kim Yong-chu (72), is also arousing attention these days. Kim Yong-chu was removed from power in 1974 when Kim Chong-il officially emerged as Kim Il-song's heir apparent. But he staged a comeback late last year for the first time in 20 years when he was named a Political Bureau member and vice president. Speculation is rife regarding his comeback. In the past there were various rumors about his whereabouts. Some said he was convalescing in Siberia in the form of de facto confinement. Others said he was in Moscow. Still others said he was under house arrest in a house in South Pyongan Province. Ko Chong-song (33), who defected to South Korea in June 1993 while working as a guidance worker at the revolution's historical site in Kanggye, Chagang Province, testified as follows about Kim Yong-chu's whereabouts: "Kim Yong-chu underwent medical treatment (for a mental disease) in Chamosan for a while after he was ousted from power by Kim Chong-il. Later he moved to Unsuri, a mountainous village in Nangnim County, Chagang Province. Subsequently, he stayed in Chosan County or, maybe in Iwon County, in Chagang Province until he moved to Puchang-tong, Kanggye City, in 1980. He stayed in Kangye until April 1991. As far as I know, he lived there idling away at home with no particular job. "Kim Yong-chu lived in a duplex unit (about 20 pyong) in a two-story workers apartment complex in Kangye with his wife and two daughters. I heard the rumor that he had a son also. His older daughter was a guidance worker at the provincial Administrative [and Economic Guidance] Committee, and his younger daughter worked at the meteorological observatory in Chagang Province. It was in April 1991 that Kim Yong-chu moved to Pyongyang. About a week before he moved, his home was burglarized. Rumors said that the thief made off with a watch and money. "According to rumors, Kim Yong-chu was able to move to Pyongyang after his two daughters petitioned Kim Chong-il. On the day he moved, Kim Chong-il went to Kanggye aboard a special train. When Kim Chong-il arrived, Kim Yong-chu's daughters met him for the first time. When the women addressed Kim Chong-il as `dear leader comrade,' he said to them, `You should not address me like that,' and told them to call him cousin." Experts on North Korea make the following general analysis about the reasons for Kim Yong-chu's comeback: First, Kim Yong-chu has been reinstated because the succession arrangements for Kim Chong-il are so secure that he can no longer be Kim Chong-il's rival. Second, the comeback is aimed at making Kim Yong-chu, Kim Chong-il's uncle, the guardian of the system for Kim Chong-il's succession to power. Despite his exclusion from power for over 20 years, Kim Yong-chu's future role, particularly in the field of North-South relations, deserves attention in view of his career, including his cochairmanship of the North-South Coordinating Committee which he held when he was director of the WPK Central Committee Department of Organization and Guidance. Some experts say that it is a mistake to regard him as an "expert on South Korea." When the 4 July 1972 Joint Statement was issued, he was named as cochairman of the Coordinating Committee simply because he was the counterpart of Yi Hu-rak, then ROK Central Intelligence Agency [KCIA] director. In reality, Pak Song-chol was in charge. However, some observers speculate that if a hurdle is raised in the way of Kim Chong-il's immediate succession to the presidency upon Kim Il-song's death, Kim Yong-chu might assume the presidency on a provisional basis for the purpose of crisis management. Kim Nam-sik of the Institute for Peace said that Kim Yong-chu appears to have the ability to serve at least as a complementary force for the Kim Chong-il leadership structure, and that, depending on circumstances, the possibility cannot ruled out that he will serve as provisional president in the event of Kim Il-song's death, thereby filling the vacuum in the transitional period before the Kim Chong-il regime establishes itself. The party line is an absolute guideline for action in North Korea, and any deviation from it automatically constitutes an antiparty, antinational, and antistate act. It is Kye Ung-tae (76), Political Bureau member and party secretary in charge of public security and judicial affairs, who sees to it that the party line is effectively implemented at party, government, military, and public levels. He is a powerful man with the right of personnel management over the director of state security, the minister of public security, the president of Central Court, and the procurator general of the Central Procurator's Office. Kim Si-hak (71), director of the WPK Department of Administration, furnishes Kye Ung-tae with various information collected from intelligence, public security, and judicial sources. By analyzing such information, Kye Ung-tae provides "partywide" guidance. He consults Kim Chong-il and receives instructions from him on important matters. In short, Kye Ung-tae is a powerful man who holds all intelligence and inspection organizations under his control. Chon Pyong-ho (70) and Han Song-yong (67) are both Political Bureau members and members of the party Secretariat. Chon is in charge of heavy industry, and Han in charge of machine and metal industries. They were appointed to the Secretariat after the Kim Chong-il era began. They are Kim Chong-il's intimate technocrats who have shared their political fortunes with him. Reportedly, Chon and Han--both children of revolutionary martyrs--stayed with Kim Chong-il for about six months in Kim Il-song's residence before Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute opened in 1946. They were among the children of fallen revolutionaries whom Kim Chong-suk [Kim Il-song's wife] looked after in her home. In this way these children entered into special relationships with Kim Chong-il from their childhood. Chon Pyong-ho is an authority on theories on party building and has such outstanding writing ability that he has reportedly drafted theses and speeches for Kim il-song and Kim Chong-il. Chon Pyong-ho is a member of the National Defense Commission. He is unique in that he is the only nonmilitary person in the commission besides Kim Chong-il, its chairman. In this position Chon pushes forward Kim Chong-il's stand by playing the role of a pipeline connecting the National Defense Commission to the party. Both Chon Pyong-ho and Han Song-yong are not only quick-witted, but also have profound expertise and an outstanding ability. Although their stars have not risen as fast as Kim Tal-hyon's, they have steadily maintained the tempo of their ascendancy and are regarded as important pillars propping up the Kim Chong-il heirdom. So Kwan-hui (68), WPK secretary in charge of agriculture, is an influential person known as Kim Chong-il's intimate economic brain. He is recognized as an agricultural expert credited with the founding of the so-called chuche-based farming method. Kim Kuk-tae (76), director of the WPK Department of Cadre Affairs, was among the first graduating class of Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute. He is the son of the late Vice Premier Kim Chaek, who died during the Korean war. Kim Kuk-tae graduated from Kim Il-song University and studied at Moscow University. He is a bulwark and shield for the Kim Chong-il regime. A party theoretician, he was in overall command and supervision of political, ideological, and propaganda activities while serving as director of the WPK Department of Propaganda and Agitation in the 1967-1973 period. He was at the center of attention when he pushed forward the drive to found the unitary ideology system of the party. As part of this drive, he reorganized history research rooms into Kim Il-song research rooms. Kim Kuk-tae played a decisive role in consolidating Kim Chong-il's power by ousting Kim Chong-il's stepmother, Kim Song-ae, and his uncle, Kim Yong-chu, from power. Reportedly, it was thanks to Kim Kuk-tae that the practice of hanging portraits of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il side by side was established. Hwang Chang-yop (69), secretary in charge of ideology, and Yang Hyong-sop (71), speaker of the Supreme People's Assembly [SPA], are expert theoreticians. As such they are the ideological prop of the establishment and the "royal instructors" who teach the art of kingship to Kim Chong-il. Hwang Chang-yop, husband of Kim Il-song's niece, is a philosopher. After graduating from Kim Il-song University, he majored in philosophy at Moscow University. Upon returning from Moscow, he filled the chair of philosophy at Kim Il-song University and began to demonstrate his ideological and theoretical talents. He became the SPA speaker in his forties and served in that post for three terms. Beginning in 1975 or thereabout when North Korea joined the Nonaligned Movement, Hwang Chang-yop visited more than 30 countries on over 20 occasions organizing chuche ideology research organizations in host countries. Thus he made a great contribution to the effort to muster the support of nonaligned nations by unfolding his so-called people-to-people diplomacy. Reportedly, Hwang Chang-yop began to teach the art of kingship to Kim Chong-il when the latter was named heir apparent at the Seventh Plenum of the Fifth WPK Central Committee in September 1973. From then on he assumed responsibility as manager of Kim Chong-il's public as well as private life. He introduced Kim Hye-suk (43) to Kim Chong-il. They say Kim Hye-suk is Kim Chong-il's second wife. After Kim Chong-il divorced his first wife, Hong Il-chon, there was a two-year blank period. In the course of searching for a candidate for Kim Chong-il's second wife, Hwang Chang-yop uncovered Kim Hye-suk, a beautiful woman hailing from Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province. She is a graduate of Kim Il-song University. Hwang worked hard to rewrite Kim Chong-il's experience and his background in such a way as to fit his position as heir apparent. Hwang arbitrarily changed Kim Chong-il's birth place from the Soviet Union to Mt. Paekdu, and greatly contributed to idolizing Kim Chong-il by inventing such epithets for him as "the Party Center," "the Dear Leader," and "the Sagacious Leader." All North Korean state programs and all foreign proposals to North Korea must be approved after going through ideological scrutiny by the party's chuche ideology research group led by Hwang Chang-yop. Particularly, any plan directed toward South Korea and various South Korean proposals are said to be subject to double scrutiny by him. Hwang Chang-yop, the circumspect scholarly type, pays more attention to giving lectures on chuche ideology than discussing matters of mutual interest when he meets foreign guests. That is why foreign visitors who meet him often give their impressions by saying, "It was like receiving a college lecture." Yang Hyong-sop is the only high-ranking North Korean official who hails from Cheju, South Korea. While attending Moscow University, he became acquainted with Kim Yong-chu. Thanks to this tie, Yang Hyong-sop became Kim Il-song's relative by marrying Kim Sin-suk (86), Kim Il-song's cousin. His face was familiar to us because he hosted receptions for the delegations to the second, fourth, and sixth rounds of North-South high-level talks in Pyongyang in his capacity as speaker. Because he was close to Kim Yong-chu, Yang Hong-sop was demoted to president of the Academy of Social Sciences from a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau in 1980. But he reemerged in the forefront of power as SPA speaker in April 1984. He became a candidate member of th Political Bureau, thus rising in rank from 32d place to 18th. The following are among the influential persons in charge of South Korean affairs--an important function in the North Korean power structure: Kim Yong-sun (59), party secretary for South Korean affairs, and Kwon Hui-kyong (66), director of the WPK Department of Investigations. In the personnel reshuffle last December, Ki Yong-sun lost his post as a candidate member of the WPK Political Bureau and slipped from 15th to 26th place in the ranking. This gives the impression that his power has been weakened. But judging from the fact that he still holds his position as party secretary for South Korean affairs, apparently he is still an influential person. According to recent reports, North Korea set up a high-power special measures group in preparation for sudden breakthroughs in its relations with the ROK, the United States, and Japan. Reportedly, Kim Yong-sun has taken charge of the U.S. unit. Kim, a tall massive figure, 180 cm in height and 90 kg in weight, is regarded as a key player in the North's policy toward the South. An anecdote illustrates Kim Yong-sun's straightforward personality. In 1984 when he was the deputy director of the WPK Department of International Affairs, Kim Chong-il said to him: "Inasmuch as what the party's Department of international Affairs does falls within the realm of foreign relations activity, its members should practice social dancing, such as the polka." So, Kim Yong-sun organized a dance party in the courtyard of the party central headquarters building, to which members of his department and their wives were invited. At the sight, officials of other department exclaimed, "The international department is going wild," and squealed to Kim Chong-il. The plea that the dance party was held according to Kim Chong-il's suggestion was not accepted. The party Department of Organization and Guidance investigated the case and confirmed some "cases of love affairs." As a result, Kim Yong-sun and 70 employees, about half the total number of employees of the Department of International Affairs, were dismissed. Kim Yong-sun staged a comeback a year after this case, and in the end became director of the party's Department of International Affairs. Kwon Hui-kyong is an expert on foreign information and collects information on South Korea. Apparently, he was chosen as the person in overall charge of this area because of his ability to collect and analyze information, a skill he learned while serving as ambassador to the Soviet Union for many years. While working as ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kwon Hui-Kyong used to return home once or twice a year to provide Kim Chong-il with high-level information and thus succeeded to win his trust. The fact alone that Kwon served as ambassador to the Soviet Union for 15 years in two stints shows that he carries a lot of weight. There is an anecdote that gives some glimpses of Kwon Hui-kyong's character and loyalty to Kim Chong-il. When Kwon was ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kim Chong-il from time to time called him back for drinks. Each time he left Moscow for home, he kept not only his embassy staff but also then Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, his superior, in the dark about his trip home. As a result, occasionally there was a stir in the North Korean embassy because nobody knew where the ambassador was. Kim Ki-nam (68), director of the WPK Department of Propaganda and Agitation, may be reckoned as another influential figure in the WPK. He has held this job since 1987 and is said to have very close personal ties with Kim Chong-il. Actually, he is regarded as one of Kim Chong-il's closest aides. Number-one writer in the party, Kim Ki-nam not only writes articles for Kim Chong-il, but also takes overall command of all information and propaganda. All famous slogans in North Korea--such as "Let us live in our own way !" and "Study in the manner of anti-Japanese guerrillas!"--are his brainchild or were brushed up by him. Kim Ki-nam; Hyon Chun-kuk, NODONG SINMUN editor in chief; and Kim Chong-suk, MINJU CHOSON editor in chief, are called the "Gang of Three" of the propaganda team. The military in North Korea is strictly under the control of the party, but it has the potential of playing the most powerful role in an emergency. That is why the military is always the focus of attention. At present the military is regarded as one of the major forces buttressing the Kim Chong-il succession system. But according to experts on North Korea, it is difficult to predict the course the military might take after Kim Il-song's death. That is why the military must be watched most closely in connection with any possible change in power in North Korea. Among the influential figures in the military, O Chin-u (78) may come first. He is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and ranks third in the ranking order. He also holds the posts of minister of the People's Armed Forces, first vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, and member of the WPK Military Affairs Committee. As these titles suggest, he is the top man in the North Korean military. He belongs to the first generation of revolutionaries who engaged in anti-Japanese partisan operations under Kim Il-song. He actively supported the campaign to lay the groundwork for Kim Chong-il's succession to power, and was promoted to the rank of marshal in 1992. He has been constant in his loyalty to Kim Il-song and his son. There is an interesting anecdote telling how O Chin-u came to be reverentially loyal to Kim Chong-il, who is inexperienced and so young compared with him. One day in the early winter of 1985--the year in which O Chin-u was promoted to the rank of vice marshal--while driving a Mercedes-Benz 450 alone through Sosong Street, Sosong District, in Pyongyang at about 0200, his car hit a concrete pole in front of the Memorial Hall honoring the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War. A policeman on patrol spotted the accident. Seeing the emblem of the vice marshal of the People's Army on O Chin-u's shoulder, the watch bearing a Kim Il-song mark on his wrist, and the special license number on his car, the policeman immediately knew that the driver was a high-ranking official in the hierarchy and took him to the hospital immediately. Meanwhile, the story says, Kim Chong-il, informed of the accident, promptly took measures to save O Chin-u's life. On the night before the accident, O Chin-ui had a heated argument with Kim Chong-il at a drinking party about the question of dismissing O Kuk-yol. After the party was over, a frustrated O drove the car by himself leaving his driver and aide de camp behind, and had an accident on the way. That was the circumstance surrounding the accident. This anecdote is often cited to explain how O Chin-u came to be loyally devoted to Kim Chong-il, and how Kim Chong-il came to trust O Chin-u so much. In connection with the future of North Korea, O Kuk-yol (65) draws more attention than O Chin-u. Reportedly, O Kuk-yol, a KPA general, is currently in charge of the party's Department of Operations. But in the future he is expected to be the minister of the People's Armed Forces. O Kuk-yol is a son of O Chung-hup, Kim Il-song's comrade-in-arms in partisan fighting. He was among the first graduating class of Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute. He is an elite military officer who graduated from Kim Il-song University and a Soviet air force academy. He was appointed as Air Force commander in 1968 at the age of 40. In the middle of the 1970's O Kuk-yol, together with O Chin-u, suppressed the forces in the military opposed to the system insuring Kim Chong-il's succession to power. From then on O Kuk-yol enjoyed the complete trust of Kim Chong-il. In 1979 he was promoted to KPA chief of General Staff with the rank of lieutenant general (equivalent to two-star general in the South) and became a candidate member of the Political Bureau. In this way he emerged as a key figure in the military. However, while breezing along on the royal road to success, O Kuk-yol had to relinquish his post as KPA chief of General Staff, which he had led for 10 years, to Choe Kwang in 1988 because of his friction with O Chin-u. In those days O Kuk-yol, banking on Kim Chong-il's trust, ignored O Chin-u. As part of a scheme to oust O Kuk-yol, O Chin-u sent him to the Higher Kim Il-song Institute in January 1988 for a month-long training course. Meanwhile, O Chin-u presented a written evaluation report to Kim Il-song detailing irregularities committed by O Kuk-yol. As a consequence, O Kuk-yol was relieved as KPA chief of General Staff. According to Ko Yong-hwan (41), a North Korean defector, O Kuk-yol is very popular among younger military officers. He is so popular that a saying circulates among North Korean military personnel that "if O Chin-u wages war, we might lose; but when O Kuk-yol does, we will win." The reason for O Kuk-yol's popularity is that, whereas O Chin-u has "the image of a senile old man," O Kuk-yol looks like an intelligent man of vision. While serving as KPA chief of staff, O Kuk-yol made many reasonable suggestions, including the suggestion that, to promote the modernization of the military, military personnel be given more opportunities to have overseas training, and that military commandeers be given more power so that they might not need to try to read the minds of political officers. Another influential military figure who deserves attention alongside O Kuk-yol is Choe Kwang (76), KPA chief of General Staff. Choe Kwang, a vice marshal with background as a former partisan fighter, ranks next only to O Chin-u in the military. Dr. Kang In-tok, director of the Institute for Far Eastern Studies, regards Choe Kwang and Kim Kwang-chin (76), who symbolize the first generation of KPA soldiers, as persons to be reckoned with. Choe Kwang early on criticized the partisan-type antiquated North Korean military system and called for its modernization, and thus ended up losing his power. The key figures in the North Korean military may be divided into two groups, one consisting of the first generation of partisan fighters, and the other consisting of military technocrats. KPA Vice Marshals Paek Hak-nim (76), Yi Ul-sol (74), and Chu To-il (78) belong to the former, whereas Generals Kim Tu-nam (66), Kim Kang-hwan (64), and Yi Pong-won (67) belong to the latter. Paek Hak-nim is in charge of security matters as a member of the Military Affairs Committee and minister of public security. A veteran partisan fighter, he has been a close aide to Kim Il-song. He was a company commander of Kim Il-song's security force and later its overall commander. Pak Hak-nim is always associated with the legendary story that he rescued Kim Il-song from danger during an assault by his guerrilla unit on an area adjacent to the Tumen River bank. It is a well-known story throughout North Korea that Pak waded through the snow at the foot of the mountain in northern Manchuria searching for pine nuts for Kim Il-song who was completely exhausted in the icy winter weather there. Anyhow, thanks to this personal tie to Kim Il-song, Paek is also on intimate terms with Kim Chong-il. They say Paek brought from overseas the kinds of acoustic equipment and musical instruments Kim Chong-il liked as a gift for him. Yi Ul-sol and Chu To-il, both members of the party Military Affairs Committee, head the General Bureau of Security and the Pyongyang Defense Command, respectively. These titles are indicative of their standing in the military. As a matter of fact, they have greater power than their positions suggest. Like Paek Hak-nim, they "have waited upon" Kim Il-song "near at hand." That is why, experts say, they are in a position to make the most of their unique ties to Kim Il-song and his son. The range of their activities is not limited to North Korea, and they are expected to go as far as it is necessary to prop up the Kim Chong-il heirdom. They are expected to serve as a shield for the Kim Chong-il regime when Kim Il-song dies. Kim Tu-nam, Kim Kang-hwan, and Yi Pong-won all belong to the second partisan generation and are graduates of Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute. They belong to the military power elite. Kim Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan are former and current directors of the party Department of Military Affairs, respectively. These two and O Kuk-yol are called "the troika who established the unitary ideology system of the party in the military." What draws attention in connection with the careers of Kim Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan is the fact that both formerly served as deputy chief of Section 13 of the WPK Department of Organization and Guidance. This department is one of the 22 departments under the party Central Committee, and it has 13 sections. To all intents and purposes, the Department of Organization and Guidance is the highest power center in North Korea. It provides party guidance to all party, government, and military organizations through personnel management and ideological scrutiny. It is common knowledge that when it comes to personnel affairs, background materials prepared by the Department of Organization and Guidance play a vital role in taking personnel actions with regard to officials at the same level as or at higher levels than provincial party secretaries (equivalent to the rank of provincial governor), vice ministers of the State Administration Council (same as vice minister of the cabinet), and general officers. The Department of Organization and Guidance was the public organization in which Kim Chong-il began his public career. The fact alone that Kim Chong-il still has this department under his personal control is indicative of its power. Various information converges on the Department of Organization and Guidance in the form of a daily report so that the department can use it in making ideological evaluations of important cadres. The collected information covers everything about cadres, for instance, details of a drinking bout the director of a certain department had with a certain person for a certain number of hours; or details of the medical treatment a certain military general received and the doctor's opinion on the patient's condition. These bits of information are used in evaluating cadres. Therefore it is no exaggeration to say that in a sense a guidance functionary in the communications and transportation section of this department has more power than the minister of posts and telecommunications. Section 13 of the Department of Organization and Guidance in charge of military affairs not only gives guidance for the correct implementation of the party's military policy but also actually exercises the power held by the party Military Affairs Committee and the National Defense Commission. This department is really all-powerful because it also directly controls the KPA Party Committee and the KPA General Political Bureau. From the fact that Kim Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan once served as deputy director of this department in charge of Section 13, most probably they must have wielded immense power over the military. Yi Pong-won is currently deputy director of the KPA General Political Bureau. O Chin-u being its director, Yi may be regarded as the de facto director. Yi, responsible for political control over the military, is in essence the special person Kim Chong-il dispatched to the military. He is expected to become next director of the General Political Bureau, succeeding Choe Kwang. Persons emplaced in administrative, economic, and diplomatic positions in the State Administration Council are not as powerful as those in the party and military. But they are the ones who are charged with the task of finding practical solutions to difficult problems confronting North Korea, such as how to achieve economic development and how to improve North Korea's relations with the United States and Japan. That is why their roles are assuming added importance. As far as we are concerned, technocrats in North Korean government organizations are the effective windows through which we can predict whether it is possible for North Korea to shift its direction to reform and opening. That is why attention is focused on these technocrats and the roles they are playing. The State Administration Council, with the largest array of expert technocrats, is equivalent to our cabinet. But there are limits to its role because the party Political Bureau or Secretariat formulate all important policies and the State Administration Council draws up only detailed plans for their implementation. However, with the same influential persons holding both party and government positions, there are quite a few powerful persons in the State Administration Council. Premier Kang Song-san (63) is Kim Il-song's cousin by a maternal aunt and the fourth-ranking member of the Political Bureau. He is a leading technocrat who has steered the North Korean economy together with Yi Kun-mo and Yon Hyong-muk. After graduating from Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and Kim Il-song University, Kang Song-san majored in economics at Moscow University. He started out as a guidance worker at the party Department of Organization and Guidance. He successively served as director of that department, responsible secretary of the Pyongyang Municipal WPK Committee, premier of the State Administration Council, and responsible secretary of the North Hamgyong Provincial WPK Committee before he was reappointed premier of the State Administration Council. As is apparent from his blood ties to Kim Il-song and his career, Premier Kang Song-san is the top administrator in North Korea who has breezed along on the elite track. In a sense it is quite natural that his name is adorned with such epithets as "the front-runner of the new generation" and "the man at the head of the second generation of revolutionaries." Kang Song-san has been reckoned as one of the few trump cards that North Korea can use in reviving its economy. This can be easily understood when one traces the footsteps he has taken until now. This is because his career and North Korea's economic development and policy for opening are closely linked. Kang Song-san was appointed to the premiership for the first time during the third session of the Seventh SPA in January 1984. At this session he, then first vice premier, delivered a speech titled "On Stepping Up South-South Cooperation and External Economic Activities and Further Developing Trade Activities." After this speech, he was named premier of the State Administration Council. His speech drew attention because it was unique in that it called for active economic exchanges with capitalist countries. During his premiership, North Korea enacted the joint venture law in September 1984 to facilitate ventures with foreign enterprises. In December of the same year North Korea established the External Economic Committee. He was relieved of his premiership in December 1986. Later, in March 1988, he was appointed as responsible secretary of the North Hamgyong Provincial WPK Committee. It appeared that he was demoted from the premiership to a position equivalent to provincial governor. But in the intervening years he worked out the plan for the development of "the Najin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade Zone." Opinions differ about his image as a proponent of reform and opening that his career projects. Some say that, given the nature of the North Korean regime, Kang just acted administratively each time Kim Il-song and his son issued instructions and that the measures for opening he took were not of his making. Others, on the other hand, claim that it is a fact that, despite certain limitations, Kang Song-san has pushed for the opening of North Korea. It is said that there are more than 10 vice premiers in the North Korean State Administration Council. Relatively well-known among them are: Choe Yong-nim (68), Kim Hwan (64), and Hong Sok-hyong in charge of the economy; and Kim Yong-nam (69) in charge of foreign relations. Many observers predict that some day Choe Yong-nim and Kim Hwan will become premiers of the State Administration Council. This is to say that Kim Chong-il trusts them that much. According to these observers, Choe Yong-nim, a veritable retainer for the Kim Il-song clan, might become premier if the Kim Chong-il heirdom is beset with trouble, or if an economic crisis erupts and voices mount demanding accelerated opening to the outside world and faster economic development. Choe Yong-nim, vice premier and minister of metal industry, is a retainer of the Kim Il-song family who early on served as senior secretary of the presidential palace. He is known for his meticulous character and his mental agility. He is said to be fluent in Russian, English, and Japanese. After becoming a vice premier in February 1984, he consolidated his position as the nucleus of administrative and economic organizations. He was relieved as vice premier in October 1985, but staged a comeback as a candidate member of the Political Bureau, vice premier, and chairman of the State Planning Committee in May 1990. Vice Premier Kim Hwan once appeared to have been purged for a while but later staged a comeback. He is regarded as a would-be reformist in the Kim Chong-il era. He graduated from Kim Il-song University and Karl Marx School of Engineering in East Germany. He once served as a member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and a member of the party Secretariat, and subsequently held other important jobs. He tried to set up a Chinese-type special zone in Kim Chong-suk County, Yanggang Province. Kim Hwan came out with that idea when Kim Chong-il was groping for some changes after he had consolidated his position as heir apparent at the Sixth WPK Congress. Although Kim Chong-il endorsed Kim Hwan's plan, Kim Il-song rejected it, and as a result, Kim Hwan was ousted from his post. Hong Sok-hyong was named vice premier and chairman of the State Planning Committee succeeding Kim Tal-hyon in last December's reshuffle. He is a grandson of Hong Myong-hui and a son of Hong Ki-mun, former vice president of the Academy of Social Sciences. The background of his career advancement draws attention. Hong Sok-hyong successively served as first minister of metal industry in the State Administration Council and as a candidate member of the WPK Central Committee. He has been the responsible secretary of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex WPK Committee since 1988. He is known for his expertise in metals in particular and in science and technology in general. His latest promotion has prompted speculation that the focus of North Korea's economic policy will shift to economic activities in the field. In connection with Hong Sok-hyong's role, it is noteworthy that he is concurrently chairman of the State Planning Committee. In a socialist state under a thoroughgoing economic planning system, the duties of the state planning committee are very important indeed. As a matter of fact, it has been customary for North Korea to assign big wheels to the chairmanship of the State Planning Committee. Particularly in view of the real condition in North Korea, which is in a transition period, we can easily imagine the great hope the party leadership might pin on Hong Sok-hyok. Kim Yong-nam, foreign minister and concurrently member of the Political Bureau, is the godfather of North Korean diplomacy after the late Ho Tam. He was born a son of a railway worker in North Korea. After graduating from Kim Il-song University, he studied at Moscow University. Upon returning from Moscow, he embarked upon his career as a party bureaucrat in the party Department of International affairs. As a diplomatic technocrat, he concentrated on European diplomacy until the late 1970's and on Southeast Asian and African diplomacy beginning in the 1980's. He has long served in the bureaucracy, probably because he is the type who stands aloof from factionalism or sectarianism. Attention is focused on how he will deal with outstanding issues, such as the IAEA nuclear inspection issue and the problem of improving North Korean relations with the United States and Japan. Yi Hwa-son (58) and Kang Sok-chu (55) cannot be counted out from the list of influential figures in North Korean diplomacy. Yi Hwa-son is deputy director of the party Department of Organization and Guidance in charge of Section 2 of the department. He is not conspicuous to outsiders, but he is said to exercise very strong influence on North Korean diplomacy. He holds the right of personnel management over all North Korean diplomats except Kim Yong-sun and Kim Yong-nam. Even Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu is said to be cowed in his presence. Lately Kang Sok-chu has become a "star diplomat" as he often appears before mass media in his capacity as North Korean delegate to U.S.-North Korean negotiations on the nuclear facilities inspection issue. Kang, currently vice minister of foreign affairs, emerged as an important diplomat when he addressed the UN General Assembly as senior North Korea delegate when North Korea was admitted to the United Nations in late 1991. He is classified as a typical technocrat. Very little is known about the background of his career. The period in which he began to cut a conspicuous figure in the North Korean Foreign Ministry coincided the period in which the campaign to establish the Kim Chong-il heirdom was in full swing. This may suggests that Kang Sok-chu may be one of the Kim Chong-il intimates. According to Ko Yong-hwan, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to the South, Kang Sok-chu is a man who is "intelligent, skillful in adapting himself to circumstances, and fond of reproaching others to their faces." Kang stands ready 24 hours a day to answer the call of Kim Chong-il at any time. According to Ko, when Kim Chong-il calls up the Foreign Ministry at 2300, Kang moves from room to room in shirtsleeves and slippers to collect papers in person instead of using the intercom and fax machine. Experts on North Korea say that, inasmuch as Kim Chong-il set it as his strategic goal to establish diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan, he will have no choice but to keep Kang Sok-chu in important posts because of his proficiency in English and expertise in diplomacy toward the West. The future courses of the "faded stars" like Yon Hyong-muk (62) and Kim Tal-hyon (54) deserve attention. These two are well-known to us as the former premiers of the State Administration Council who attended the high-level inter-Korean talks. Although they are removed from the top post in the central government, they are expected to stage a comeback in view of their outstanding abilities as economic technocrats. Inasmuch as they are typical North Korean proponents of opening to the outside world, much is to be expected from them when inter-Korean economic cooperation moves into high gear. Yon Hyong-muk, a native of North Hamgyong Province, graduated from Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and the Ural College of Engineering in the Soviet Union. After he became a guidance worker at the party Department of Organization and Guidance, he continued to climb the bureaucratic ladder and was elected to the party Central Committee in 1970 at the age of 38. In 1974 he was named a member of the Political Bureau and the party Secretariat. He is regarded as the foremost front-runner among the elite technocrats. After emerging as the number-one heavy industry expert, he became premier of the State Administration Council in December 1988. But he was demoted to responsible secretary of the Chagang Provincial WPK Committee at the Fourth Session of the Ninth SPA for his failure to fulfill the economic plan. Yon Hyong-muk is known as a cautious and learned man with outstanding powers of judgment. Commenting on his personality, a defector from the North said, "If Kang Song-san knows only one side of a particular issue, Yon Hyong-muk will know three sides." Yon Hyong-muk currently is a candidate member of the Political Bureau. Therefore it is hard to conclude that he has been ousted from power. We can guess the future standing of Kim Tal-hyon on the same basis as in the case of Yon Hyong-muk. Once he was called an "immediate candidate for the premiership," but he suddenly disappeared from the front stage of the power scene late last year. At that time speculation persisted that he just took responsibility for the slowdown in economic development as a matter of formality, and therefore he cannot be regarded as ousted from power completely. Observers attach weight to Kim Tal-hyon not only because he is a rare economic expert in North Korea but also because he is the husband of Kim Il-song's cousin once removed. Viewed from this angle, recent reports that Kim Tal-hyon has taken charge of a special measures team on South Korea deserve attention. According to Ko Yong-hwan, Kim Tal-hyon says what he has to say even in front of Kim Il-song. In brief, he is the only man in the administration who can say "No" to Kim Il-song. That is why Kim Il-song sometimes characterizes him as "an arrogant but intelligent man." There is the rumor that Kim Tal-hyon has been demoted as a warning because he appeared to be the head of the reformist group. As is apparent from the above analysis, the North Korean hierarchy consists of the intimates of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il without exception. In the socialist regimes in the Soviet Union and China, squabbles about party lines or policies begot factions, and factionalism gave rise to power struggles. But it seems that North Korea maintains a nearly perfect patriarchal leadership structure centering on Kim Il-song and his son. This feature of the North Korean power elite is a by-product of the process in these past 20 years by which the Kim Chong-il leadership has thoroughly consolidated its support base while laying the groundwork for the succession of power. Nevertheless, an analysis of major players in the apparently monolithic North Korean power elite reveals some elements of factionalism. First, the power elite has a strong characteristic of nepotism. Its salient feature is that many of Kim Il-song's relatives are entrenched in the center of power. The relatives of Kim Il-song and his son number more than 20. They include: Kim Song-ae, Pak Song-chol, Yang Hyong-sop, Hwang Chang-yop, Kang Song-san, Kim Chung-nim, Kim Tal-hyon, and Kim Yong-sun. According to an analysis by a research team headed by Dr. Chon Hyon-chun at the Research Institute for National Unification, about 7 percent of the full members of the WPK Central Committee are Kim Il-song's relatives by blood and marriage. Considering the fact that it is difficult to ascertain the kinships because of the closed nature of North Korean society, the ratio must be much greater than that. About 50 percent of these relatives on the Central Committee are above the 30th place in the ranking order. This ratio squares with the fact that five members of the Kim Il-song clan are among the first 10 places in the ranking order of the Political Bureau. Second, graduates of particular schools are conspicuously numerous. Graduates of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, which has courses from kindergarten to high school, account for 3 percent of officials with the rank of vice minister and above and 13 percent of the full membership of the Central Committee. These figures are only confirmed ones, and the actual numbers may far exceed them. As for colleges and universities, Kim Il-song University and Kimchaek Polytechnic College top the list by a large margin. The ratio of graduates of the Kimchaek Polytechnic College is increasing, reflecting the tendency to attach greater importance to expert technocrats. Of those who studied abroad, 70 percent studied in the Soviet Union. All this indicates that the path from Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute to Kim Il-Song University to universities in the Soviet Union has been the typical academic track for the North Korean power elite. Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute is a special school that admits only bereaved children of fallen revolutionaries and children of high-ranking officials. Anyone who enters this school will automatically be put on an elite track. The regional distribution is also interesting. Overall, those who hail from Hamgyong Provinces and Pyongan Provinces account for a large proportion. Particularly in the Central Committee, those from Hamgyong Provinces account for 48.4 percent of the total full members, although the population of North and South Hamgyong Provinces accounts for 22.6 percent of North Korea's total population according to 1990 statistics. There is a historical factor behind the overwhelming large proportion of natives of Hamgyong Provinces in the power elite. It is said that Kim Il-song was reluctant to employ people from the areas that were once under the control of UN forces during the Korean war because, in his opinion, the temporary occupation compromised their social integrity. For this reason, he filled key posts with people from the Hamgyong Provinces, particularly North Hamgyong Province. On the basis of our analysis of the key figures in the North Korean power elite and the peculiarities of their personal connections, we wonder whether it is possible to prognosticate about the possibility of change in the power structure in North Korea, particularly the possibility of the Kim Chong-il regime disintegrating after Kim Il-song dies. Experts on North Korea admit that the process of succession of power to Kim Chong-il has progressed successfully. But they predict that when Kim Il-song dies, the present atmosphere of unconditional loyalty to Kim Chong-il might undergo considerable change. Kim Chong-il may be able to take over the reins of government from Kim Il-song, but it is impossible for him to inherit his father's charisma. That is why, experts say, there is bound to be a centrifugal force at work within the power elite. Dr. Chon Hyon-chun gave the following estimate about the possibility of change in the power structure in North Korea: "The cohesive power of the Kim Chong-il power elite is stronger than that of the power elite in any other socialist country. That is why, supposing Kim Chong-il will take control of North Korea after Kim Il-song dies, it might not be until at least three to five years after the succession of power that factional moves begin to appear. If factionalism appears in North Korea, it will be triggered by strife between the relatives of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il and a group of expert bureaucrats who are not their relatives." In this regard Dr. Kang In-tok says that it is necessary to watch the first 1.5 generations of revolutionaries as well as the military. This generation of revolutionaries has been relatively alienated by the North Korean regime and might find it difficult to regard Kim Chong-il as a qualified successor to power. Therefore, when Kim Il-song dies, this generation might not show much reverence to Kim Chong-il. In the military are many who have experienced life in the Soviet Union and East Europe. Therefore, experts say, these military officers are bound to question the appropriateness of Kim Chong-il as Kim Il-song's successor when the senior Kim dies. It is said that as a rule the party controls the military in a socialist country. However, experts say that this is true only in peacetime, and in times of emergency the military would control the party. In this event technocrats might join the anti-Kim Chong-il move in alliance with the anti-Kim Chong-il group, although not as its leading force. If so, we are interested in the question of who could be the center of the anti-Kim Chong-il force in such an emergency. In this connection, some observers pay attention to Ambassador to Bulgaria Kim Pyong-il (41), who is Kim Chong-il's half-brother. But the dominant view is skeptical about Kim Pyong-il because of his youth and lack of experience. Nevertheless he remains a factor to be reckoned with because he resembles Kim Il-song and is more popular than Kim Chong-il. We cannot ignore the outlook that, as examined above, the North Korea power elite would not change so easily. Some critics question the claim that in North Korea there is conflict between hard-liners and moderates or between conservatives and proponents of opening. In the opinion of these critics, we should not overlook the fact that people like Kim Tal-hyon, who are regarded as belonging to the group of proponents of opening, in reality have a strong party spirit as well as expertise and they are not diehard proponents of reform and opening. In conclusion, if there is to be any change in the North Korean power structure, chances are high that change will appear after Kim Il-song's death. In this event, how the "powerful" military and the group of expert bureaucrats who have relatively good rational judgment, as well as the group of people who are not related to Kim Il-song by blood or marriage and who have been left out of power, will act will be the most crucial factor.
