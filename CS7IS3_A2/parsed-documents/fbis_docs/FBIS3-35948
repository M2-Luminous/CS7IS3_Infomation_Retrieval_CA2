[Correspondent] Mr. Gilmore, could you please inform us on humanitarian aid which U.S. Government is providing to Armenia? I am in particularly interested in problems with delivery of kerosene. What is causing the delay? [Gilmore] The first two loads of kerosene, more than 10,000 tons are in Batumi from December. First load of 5,000 tons is also in Batumi from December 21, the second part of kerosene for Armenia was delivered to Batumi at the end of December. Our partner in realization of this operation is the American organization Fund of Democracy and Development. We are also working with agency on transportation of cargoes, which in turn is collaborating with Georgian railway in order to deliver kerosene to Armenia. Unfortunately we were not able to resolve all delivery problems but we are working in this direction, and I am sure the kerosene will be delivered soon. I am afraid in trying to guess the date of delivery, as I am unable to tell when the trains from Georgia will arrive. I may also add, that the Fund of Democracy and Development purchased another batch of kerosene, which is now in Rotterdam and Heife. This batch will be delivered to Batumi at the end of January. [Correspondent] Could you please give some details, what are the delivery problems? [Gilmore] I may only say, that the Fund itself is signing contracts with the agency of cargo transportation, and the latter in ?turn with the administration of Georgian railway. The delay was most probably caused by change of transportation tariffs, and this change wasn't ?he fault of the Georgian side, since such change of tariffs was carried out in all CIS countries. But I need to stress, that the U.S. Government is not participating in negotiations directly, and thus it is not responsible for development?of any specific transportation conditions. [Correspondent] Do you mean, that U.S. Government is not responsible for transportation? [Gilmore] My answer is neither "yes" nor "no", the question is rather complex. U.S. Government is financing the transportation of kerosene. 15 million dollars were allocated for this program, another 1 million was allocated by Japan. These money were paid to American firms, which are directly responsible for signing contracts. Therefore U.S. Government is responsible for the program in whole, but for the separate topics of the contract. [Correspondent] Nowadays people need trust most of all, and our government along with other governments of former USSR countries are not trusted too much. I am sorry for we are loosing the trust in receiving aid from the USA. What do you think in this regard? [Gilmore] Yes, I understand. I have to feel it on myself, but I am sure that all kerosene cargo for Armenia will be delivered to the place. Increase of prices in Georgia forced transportation companies to revise the contracts and to develop new ones. We didn't expect such delays, and I thought, the first cargo will be delivered at the end of December. [Correspondent] And you were unable to influence on these processes? [Gilmore] No, since we don't understand all the details. One of those is the price increase in CIS; the other is the terrible condition of Georgian railways: they are extremely overloaded. In addition to this transportation companies had problems on holidays (New Year and Georgian Christmas), when it was in fact impossible to find a representative of Georgian Railway Administration, in order to work on the contract. The other problem is shortage of electricity in Batumi: there was no electricity even for the functioning of electric trains. But I am not trying to justify myself. We hope now, that the first batch will be here soon, we cannot delay anymore. It could be worse. Meanwhile, and you probably know this, we purchased kerosene here in Armenia in order to make sure we can start the distribution to several groups of population, who live in extremely severe conditions. This was done in accordance and collaboration with Armenian Government. [Correspondent] There are gossips, that kerosene was purchased from Azerbaijan, is this true? [Gilmore] This is absurd, nonsense, if not to say stronger. Kerosene was purchased from one of Armenian companies well known both to the Armenian Government and to us, and later the kerosene was delivered to Arm?nia. Money for this deal entered the Armenian bank. [Correspondent] During the recent briefing you mentioned another program -- program of food distribution. What was this program, who was it dedicated for, and did its realization start? [Gilmore] Indeed, we are going to purchase potatoes and to distribute it among the families where children are deprived from one of the parents. Realization of the program already s?arted, though there were delays caused by gasoline purchase. The idea was in purchasing gasoline for the dedicated amount of dollars and to pay thus to the farmers from which we were going to purchase potatoes. This potatoes will be packed in 10- and 20-kg bags and distributed among families with deprived children. This aid is particularly for this group since it's receiving the most little aid compared with others. [Correspondent] Who is going to deal with distribution of this aid? [Gilmore] Armenian Apostolic Church in New York headed by the Archbishop Barsamyan, and the Fund of Aid to Armenia. We are collaborating with them and with the organization CARE. Money will be paid to the church, which in turn transferred to the partners dealing with gasoline trade. Delivery of potatoes has already started, and I believe, the distribution will start this week. [Correspondent] Could you tell something on the aid programs you planned? [Gilmore] I have already mentioned that 15 million dollars were allocated for kerosene, 25 thousands dollars were dedicated for purchasing gasoline and potatoes; we should also remember the additional $7400. $250,000 was allocated by CARE for 10- and 20-kg food parcels, which will be distributed among those in need. $673,000 was dedicated by CARE for helping pensioners and lonely, also to the inhabitants of Gyumri and Vanadzor: during the period from November ?o April everyone will receive three parcels of 14 kg each; 20,000 tons of agriculture products such as wheat, rice and beans were dedicated by the Agriculture Department of the USA. All the mentioned aid is organized by the CARE program, the Fund of Aid to Armenia and the Armenian Apostolic Church in New York. Another 20,000 tons are allocated to Armenia by the program "Food for Progress". There are a few additional programs in the sphere of medicine, approximately 5 million dollars worth. This program is dedicated to help young mothers and those women who are expecting a child. $650,000 are dedicated for the program of teaching doctors and business specialists. In nearest future we are going to deliver sowing grain to Armenia to be distributed among farmers. This is also a program of U.S. Government, where will be also participating private organizations and Armenian Ministry of Agriculture. Approximately 7 million dollars will be dedicated to this program. We also planned special programs worth no less than 500,000 dollars -- such as distribution of food parcels for the inhabitants of the earthquake zone, and an another small but important project to help commercial banks in the conditions of changes to the market economy. [Correspondent] I am most of all interested in this last aid, the aid for the economical development of Armenia. [Gilmore] We are currently working with the Ministry of Economy in order to prepare technical aid to Armenian commercial banks. We include here also the training of bank employees in the conditions of the new system, i.e. during the period of changing to the market economy. [Correspondent] How much did you spent for this program? [Gilmore] I have no precise data in this regard, but the expenses will be lower than the sums dedicated for kerosene or grain. This program is planning to carry out seminars for bank employees in Armenia, and possibly, some of them will be invited to the USA for special training on a higher level. Thus the expenses for this program may be calculated only when it is finished. But even now we may estimate, that it will make tens of thousands dollars. [Correspondent] What about possible allocation of money for stabilization of the Armenian national currency? [Gilmore] The problem of giving Armenia money for stabilization of the dram rate is very complicated, and this is not the problem which may be solved by the U.S. Government alone. One of the main rules for such institutes as International Currency [Monetary] Fund and International Bank of Reconstruction and Development, is not to allocate credits to countries which are involved in a conflict. USA is one of the countries who founded these organizations. And our policy in this regard is to work with these organizations. [Correspondent] But could USA help Armenia separately, without participation of these organizations? [Gilmore] Theoretically this is possible. Direct aid could be given by the United States and by the 7 countries. But here again the USA should work with the World Bank and the International Currency Fund. Unfortunately I cannot get into details. I may only say, that currently the Armenian government is carrying negotiations with these structures, and U.S. Government is also participating in these negotiations. There have been such negotiations recently, by the way, and we couldn't reach a "breakthrough", but there is progress anyway, and I would stress that the progress was reached by the Armenian Government. Whatever your Government is, it is facing the same difficulties during negotiations with International Currency Fund and the World Bank. Armenian Government is doing its best. [Correspondent] So you mean, that our Government may be successful in this problem? [Gilmore] I'd say, that Armenian Government is doing its best in order to find a formula acceptable for International Currency Fund and the World Bank. This is not easy to do, since the rules of these institutions are not created especially for Armenia. But I believe that Armenia will be successful in this problem. I wouldn't like to tell anything in this regard, I can just say, that your Government is working very hard. [Correspondent] The reason why am I asking the details of this problem is that, as far as I know, several Eastern European countries, Poland in particular, received such aid from Western countries. [Gilmore] True. There were several cases, when Western countries and the USA in particular have given aid not only via international organizations, but also on a bilateral basis by means of so-called currency stabilization funds. One of such examples is Poland. But we didn't reach the necessary point in the case with Armenia yet. The reason is the same -- being involved in a conflict. I wouldn't like to talk on how long may such a situation last. It is the task of the Government of Armenia to report on this. But I must say, that the Armenian Government is taking active efforts. Particularly, there were several visits to Washington recently, and there were high level visits on the level of International Currency Fund and the World Bank. All I could add to this would be a guess.
