According to statistics, the province's financial revenue in 1993 was 7.32 billion yuan, an increase of 32.7 percent over the same period last year. At the same time, because of strict controls on and a rational arrangement for spending, the province basically realized a balance in revenues and expenditures and satisfactorily fulfilled the 1993 financial targets set out by the new term of the provincial government. Because of correct decisionmaking, the provincial CPC committee and the provincial government achieved satisfactory results. Last year, in view of the province's difficult financial situation, the provincial CPC committee and the provincial government called on all localities to build up confidence and to reverse the financial situation. They called for achieving 7 billion yuan in revenues in 1993 and for realizing a basic balance in revenues and expenditures. They worked out an eight-point plan on promoting the financial work and set out specific demands on reaching the targets for financial revenue and balance, and on devising measures to realize these targets. The provincial government also signed letters of responsibility with provincial financial departments, various commissions, and city governments. At the same time, all levels of departments changed their thinking on financial management and also implemented the thinking of self-reliance, of increasing revenues and reducing expenditures, and of striving to achieve a balance through their own efforts. Party committees and governments increased and strengthened their support and leadership over financial work and exerted more effort to explore new sources of revenue and to cut expenses. While striving to increase sources of revenue, many local governments also made efforts to rectify defects in the fiscal contract responsibility system, to prevent revenue losses, to exercise strict control over granting tax reductions and tax exemptions, and to ensure the steady growth of financial revenues. In 1993, prefectures and cities witnessed a comprehensive growth in revenues. The province recorded a breakthrough in revenues of more than 6 billion yuan, which was followed by another breakthrough in revenues of more than 7 billion yuan. Many localities not only achieved a balance in revenues and expenditures but also eliminated some of their past deficits. None of the counties under the jurisdiction of Xuancheng Prefecture suffered financial deficits over the past decade. The province's deficits in 1993 were down from the projected deficits by more than 500 million yuan. The improved financial situation has greatly promoted the province's sustained, healthy, and rapid development of its economy.
