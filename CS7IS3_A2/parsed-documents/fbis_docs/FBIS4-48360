FBIS4-48360 "drafr095_d_94021" FBIS-AFR-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Chissano Briefed on Events Chissano Briefed on Events MB1605201394 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1730 GMT 16 May 94 MB1605201394 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network Portuguese BFN [Text] Nampula Governor Alfredo Gamito today accused the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] of still looking for trouble by trying to expand the so-called areas under its control, while launching frequent incursions into government-administered areas where it detains people, particularly members of the ruling Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party. Gamito said this while presenting a provincial government report to President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano. Gamito said Afonso Dhlakama's men have been harassing those they arrest. The governor said when faced with this situation, the agencies established under the terms of the Rome peace accord say the matter is the responsibility of the Mozambican police because those actions are carried out by people wearing civilian clothes, though it is known that they are Renamo soldiers. Gamito noted that the police lack the means to resolve such issues. In his report, which was presented at an expanded meeting of the Nampula provincial government, Gamito said Renamo's relations with government agencies have been marked by arrogance, clashes, and hostilities. He said but for the provincial government's reconciliatory and reasonable posture, the forces of law and order would have already opened police files and initiated lawsuits. Alfredo Gamito accused civil servants, workers, and vagrants with a criminal record of also adopting an attitude marked by arrogance, clashes and hostilities, and of being disrespectful. Turning to the advisers appointed by Renamo, Gamito said they also adopt the same attitude in dealing with him. The provincial governor said he has serious doubts whether something positive will be accomplished with the advisers or even if Renamo intends to do something in areas it claims to control. Gamito questioned whether Renamo's administration is not a mere figment of its imagination. Governor Gamito said what one finds in Nampula Province are military bases and the respective areas of influence with captive residents, most of whom are not originally from those areas. Turning to his relations with other political parties, Alfredo Gamito said they are constructive and characterized by mutual respect, particularly with Maximo Dias' Mozambican Nationalist Movement, and Carlos Reis' Mozambican National Union. Gazmito added: That is the type of exhausting relationship that we have been experiencing, but they will not be able to wear us down. The president of the republic is apparently pleased with the political activities the Frelimo Party has been carrying out in Nampula, judging by the thousands upon thousands of people who welcomed him this morning. This afternoon, Chissano met with the Frelimo Party's Provincial Committee. A well known Nampula journalist said even if Frelimo loses the legislative election in that province, Chissano will definitely win the presidential election. One will be able to gauge the electorate's mood during the rallies Chissano intends to hold in the cities of Nampula and Nacala, as well as in the capitals of Malema, Lalaua, and Namapa Districts. From what we have so far seen in the city of Nampula, Chissano's adversaries in the October presidential election will have to work very hard. His opponents have not yet started campaigning, which makes local analysts feel that a presidential candidate like Arouca is naive and ignorant of the local situation when he raises important issues in the press, but that does not say anything to potential voters who do not have money to buy food, let alone newspapers. At this morning's meeting of the provincial government, Gamito gave a detailed account of the socioeconomic situation in the province.
