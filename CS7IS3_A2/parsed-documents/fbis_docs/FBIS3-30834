There does not seem to be. Yet, many severe remarks by Djukic about Croatian state policy demand an explanation. [Luburovic] Could you comment on the Geneva agreement between Croatia and Serbia? [Djukic] That agreement is certainly a step forward, but only toward the establishment of a mutual dialogue between Croatia and Serbia, that is Yugoslavia and Croatia. However, the agreement does not bring about any advance in the quest for a settlement of the crisis in Croatia. Serbia and Serbian policy are key factors in solving the problem of the reintegration of the UN Protection Areas into the legal system of the Republic of Croatia. Precisely for that reason, as far as the agreement is concerned, at the moment my attitude would be closer to the assessment made by Milosevic rather than that of Tudjman. [Luburovic] In that context, how should the words of [Krajina Serb leader] Milan Martic be interpreted, when he stated after the victory in the Krajina elections that "the only relations that Krajina may have with Croatia are neighborly relations?" Does that comply with your assessment? [Djukic] That only speaks for the fact that Milosevic has not yet given a sign that the UN Protection Areas in Croatia might possibly be reintegrated into the integral Croatian state. Therefore, for the time being, Martic also cannot but follow Serbian policy on the occupied Croatian territories. At the very moment when Milosevic's attitude toward the Serbs in Croatia and the settlement of their political problem and status becomes more specific, Martic will also become more specific in those terms. [Luburovic] Do you think that it is better for Croatia for Martic to have won the so-called Krajina elections, or would it have been better if Milan Babic had won? [Djukic] It is better that Martic won, because he blindly follows Serbian policy. [Luburovic] In other words, you believe that Milosevic will support the reintegration of the occupied regions into the Croatian legal system. [Djukic] Not only am I sure about it -- I am more than sure. And that certainty of mine comes from the fact that the UN Protection Areas cannot find any grounds for survival except within Croatia. If that is a fundamental truth, than it is logical that Milosevic will also have to come to the same conclusion, and he may already have come to it. However, he is still making good use of those areas while calculating his general policy. That policy has not been rounded off, because the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is still uncertain. [Luburovic] Do you link the conclusion of the Bosnian issue to the conclusion of the Croatian issue? [Djukic] Absolutely. [Luburovic] In what sense? [Djukic] It is very important for Croatia that Bosnia- Herzegovina remains a union of three constituent peoples. There are two possibilities for Croatia -- either it will form a confederation with the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and the Bosnian republic [Bosnjacka republika], or Herzeg-Bosnia will secede and join Croatia, while in that case the Serbian republic in Bosnia would join Serbia as well. In that case the question remains open as to what should be done with the UN Protection Areas, in which the population is predominantly Serbian. Those regions are conquered, and we, as well as the world, have to acknowledge that as a political reality, or a reality of time, or any other reality whatsoever. A part of that reality is also that the Serbs from the unoccupied part of Croatia are leaving in ever greater numbers, which considerably changes the attitude toward Croatia. [Luburovic] Where are those Serbs leaving for? [Djukic] Yugoslavia and Western Europe. [Luburovic] These are recent trends, are they not? [Djukic] Yes, they are. [Luburovic] Do you have any exact data on that matter? [Djukic] According to our estimates, in the free territory of Croatia there are 200,000 to 220,000 Serbs. Which means that almost a third of the Serbs who lived in 1990 in those free territories of Croatia are leaving. This is a great political danger for a Croatian policy that wants to solve the problem in a peaceful way. [Luburovic] How do you assess the arrival of Jovan, the Orthodox metropolitan of Ljubljana and Zagreb, in Zagreb? [Djukic] That is certainly a step toward the normalization of integral Croato-Serbian relations. That is a sign of the sudden furtherance of that normalization, which contributes to the affirmation of religious freedom in Croatia. [Luburovic] Do you think that the return of Metropolitan Jovan to Zagreb is an autonomous decision of the Serbian Orthodox church, or is it politically colored? [Djukic] It is an autonomous decision by the Serbian Orthodox Church, which is confirmed by the reaction of the Orthodox Church in Croatia with respect to the Croatian authorities, the Serbs in Croatia, and so forth. Yes, We Are Refraining From Discussing Bosnia-Herzegovina [Luburovic] It is noteworthy that SNS deputies always refrain from taking part in the parliamentary debates on Bosnia-Herzegovina. They also abstain from voting on the issue. Why? [Djukic] You are right in saying that we do refrain from that. It has to do with our attitude, which we have made public by criticizing Tudjman's proposal, which he made in Germany, that a confederation with Herzeg-Bosnia and the Bosnian republic should be formed. We objected to that proposal because it deals with legal and political subjects that are internationally unrecognized for the time being. Therefore, we believe that the problem of Bosnia- Herzegovina is a problem of the three constituent peoples, and in no case a matter of the Croatian concern. [Luburovic] Still, the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia obliges President Tudjman and the parliament to take particular care of those Croatian people outside Croatia. [Djukic] Look, the Constitution could have obliged them to do many things, if those things had been stated in it. We should take care of them, but no greater care of the Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina than of the Croats in Vojvodina, or Serbia, for instance. I think that when that unfortunate war came about, we were supposed to take better care of the Bosnian Croats, but not in such a way that today almost the entire world is condemning the way in which it is being done. And all that was unfolding in such a way that the relationship between the Croats and the Serbs in Croatia have been pushed to the margins. [Luburovic] What do you think about the negotiations of the Croatian authorities with the representatives of the rebel Serbs? [Djukic] Those negotiations may last for many years. We have always held a positive attitude toward them. [Luburovic] You are not a member of the negotiating team, are you? [Djukic] No, I am not, but if you want to know why, you should seek the answer in Croatian policy. [Luburovic] From the point of view of the media, one gets the impression that Milorad Pupovac is a new political player in the game of the normalization of Serbo-Croatian relations. Is that an indication that the time of Milan Djukic has passed? [Djukic] The time of Milan Djukic will have passed only when he leaves politics. Whom Croatia exploits, and in which way, when dealing with the issue of Serbs in Croatia, is a matter of those who take upon themselves such roles, without recognizing themselves in them, while it is also a matter of a Croatian policy that may think that in such a way something might possibly be accomplished. Basically, the determination of the SNS and its representatives is not to be a disposable party, to avoid any conflicts with the opposition, nor to be suppressed by the attacks and assaults that speculate about who we are and whom we support. We shall persevere with the determination that the Serbs should recognize themselves in Croatia in a just way, that Croatia should become a civil state, and that we should elect a president who will have enough strength to greet his fellow citizens, and not just Croats. [Luburovic] Do you think that Tudjman is not such a president? [Djukic] We are certainly rather dissatisfied with the policy of President Tudjman with regard to the Serbs in Croatia. [Luburovic] Why? [Djukic] We want President Tudjman to be as much the president of the Serbs as he is of the Croats in Croatia. He cannot be the president of the Serbs if he a priori, as early as in his reception address, says that he is the president of Croats and all other citizens. I beg your pardon, "all other citizens" means that the category of citizens is a second class category. Look, if Zagreb is the capital of the Croats, then a nasty part of the Serbs in Croatia might ask themselves: Wait a minute, if that is so, then what is the capital of the Serbs in Croatia? And I must also add that the president himself is actually making the Serbs demand that Knin be their capital. [Luburevic] What are your relations with President Tudjman like? [Djukic] At least I think they are correct. Which means that I have never spoken to the president as though I had any complexes, or feared him while approaching him, let alone disrespected him. I recognize him as the president of the state, but I also freely tell him what is right and what is wrong. I think that many would wonder if it is possible that I dare to tell the president straightforwardly everything that I really think, which is always in the best interest of Croatia, the Croatian people, meaning Croats as well as Serbs, and all others. [Luburovic] The critics of President Tudjman most usually portray him black and white. He is either good or bad. How would you portray him? [Djukic] I dislike President Tudjman's occasional lack of strength in his own determination when confronted with the political attitudes of some individuals. Which means that Tudjman could be better as a president. Furthermore, he ought to understand that the Serbs make a great distinction between the Croatian state and the Croatian authorities. That is very important. However, it can be noticed that the president equates the Croatian authorities and the Croatian state. We draw a distinction on that point. We respect, love, and esteem the Croatian state. That is our right and our obligation.... Serbs' Rights and Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia [Luburovic] Is it also a desire? [Djukic] Yes, it is also our desire, but loyalty must not be demanded from us Serbs and stressed as a condition. And that is because there are also nasty Croats. I cannot understand why a Serb, who was twice jailed during the old regime, cannot obtain citizenship for that reason, while a Croat, who was indicted many times, can. Therefore I want to say as a Serb that I live in my country, and that is Croatia. I shall respect and value the Croatian authorities as far as they really serve my needs and interests, particularly when there is an entire people whose affairs are to be settled. Croatia was guilty of a great failure in 1990 when the authorities tried to preserve Croatia within the borders that had been established in AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] Yugoslavia, while not giving a thought to the problem of how to solve the question of statuses that had changed with Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia. At the time Croatia did not think that the Serbs, by seceding from Yugoslavia, should also keep rights they had obtained earlier. [Luburovic] If I understand you correctly, you are saying that the war that happened here was the fault of the Croats? [Djukic] It was not the Croats' fault, but the fact that it is a Croatian co-fault is undisputable. [Luburovic] In other words, you believe that all the guarantees that the Croatian state has given to the Serbs so far have come too late. [Djukic] Absolutely. [Luburovic] But Martic maintains the same. [Djukic] It is hard to change Martic's conviction now in terms of what would have happened if Croatia had agreed in 1990 to establish a civic society, and to give the Serbs cultural autonomy. And we also know that the cultural autonomy of the Ruthenians, Italians, and others was guaranteed for over 50 years by the 1974 Constitution [as published]. So, it is late now. You see, since the adoption of the Constitutional Law two years have passed, while it has still not been implemented. [Luburovic] Are you saying that the Serbs should be given more than they are given by the Constitutional Law on Minorities' Rights? [Djukic] The problem is that the Serbs have not been given anything. They have obtained something on paper, which we welcomed, and which we believe should be implemented in all segments of society. If Croatian policy had done that, the situation would certainly have been different. [Luburovic] Excuse me, but there have recently been frequent cases of Serbs, who live at the time in the occupied regions, being granted citizenship certificates and their overdue pensions are also being paid. [Djukic] That is true. But there was no need to generate problems where no problems existed. [Luburovic] There are opinions in the Croatian public that the occupied regions could be easily reintegrated in the system of the Croatian Republic by taking the military option. [Djukic] In my opinion, the military option does not exist any more, not even in theory. The forces of the right and impulsive spirits may demand that, but we have to find the strength and resources to make the people return to their homes. [Luburovic] What you have just said sounds to me like a piece of hackneyed demagogy, particularly because the leaders of the Serbs in the occupied regions of Croatia incessantly point out that Croatia and the so-called Krajina of theirs are two neighboring countries. How are they supposed to come to their senses? [Djukic] Come on, what else can you expect from them when they know what awaits certain individuals at the end of the story? [Luburovic] Some analysts claim that no Serbian option in Croatia has as much strength to convince the Serbs from the UN Protections Areas of the necessity for the war finally to end as Branko Horvat's Serbian Democratic Union [SDU] does. [Djukic] Anybody who can do anything in that respect is welcome. Which is to say, if the SDU has such strength, there is no reason for it not to contribute to the cessation of the war. However, the Serbs are clever enough, and know exactly what the Serbian options are, and what the Croatian options are, that is to say, which options protect their national identity. Thus we know that the SDU is a Croatian party, that its leader is a Croat, but also that there certainly are Serbs who support it. Today no one could persuade Martic by saying: Come on, please, join Croatia. [Luburovic] Several days ago a group of Serb representatives in the parliament founded a sort of Serb representatives' club. They had also entered the parliament as Serbs, while some of them even as independent candidates. What made them characterize themselves as Serbs rather than as citizens of Croatia with a certain political platform, or at least as a club of representatives of all the national minorities in Croatia? [Djukic] We, the SNS, and our club have been stressing that issue since we entered the parliament. You must have noticed that we entered the parliament as Serbs, in compliance with the Constitutional Law. We did that because, according to the law, the Serbs are supposed to have 13 representatives in the parliament. And all these people who are joining the Croatian parties are joining them as citizens of Croatia who support that particular platform. Excuse me, but in 1990 we had 31 Serbs in the parliament, as was confirmed by President Tudjman in his address to the United Nations. That was when five representatives of the Serbian Democratic Party left the parliament. Tudjman said himself that those who had left the parliament were the legitimate representatives of Serbs. Which is to say, that there are Serbs in the Social Democratic Party is not questionable, but counting them among those 13 is. You cannot have a Serb, a representative of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, support something that is in the interest of the protection of the Serbian minority in Croatia. [Box, page 5] [Luburovic] Are you referring to an autonomy model for the Serbs in Croatia like that of Kosovo and Vojvodina in former Yugoslavia? [Djukic] Yes, I am referring to the Vojvodina model in 1974. However, that contradicts Churkin's theory about a state within a state, because, as far as I know, no example of such a state within a state exists in the world. However, I do not want to speak about form, but rather about content. That means that the districts of Glina and Knin must be given back to us, rather than to be organized within two counties. Furthermore, the question of the territorial degree of that autonomy still remains open. As does the question of eastern Slavonia and Baranja. [Luburovic] I do not understand what is open in those questions? [Djukic] They are open because there are Serbs living there now. And we are making efforts to ensure the return of the refugees to their homes. If that happens, as it ought to happen, then the Serbs will no longer be a majority there, so what we would understand as an autonomous province is the region of the present districts of Glina and Knin, where the borders of townships would be taken into account in determining the borders of the districts, rather than the existing administrative borders. Certain alterations should be made in that respect, because there is the question, for instance, of whether it makes any sense for the village of Vrhovine to remain outside the borders of the autonomous province. If the refugees do not return, then the entire political reality will be changed. And I am afraid that, given the current policy, the refugees will not be going back very soon.
