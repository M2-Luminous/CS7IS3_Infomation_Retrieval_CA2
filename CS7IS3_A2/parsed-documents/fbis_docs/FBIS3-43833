He had just been elected the ANC candidate for premiership of the new Western Cape Provincial Government at a special conference held at the University of the Western Cape. The post of premier will replace the current provincial administratorship after the April 27 elections. Dr Boesak beat his only opponent, legal and constitutional expert Dullah Omar, by 136 votes to 120. Branch representatives of the ANC, the Congress of SA [South African] Trade Unions and the SA Communist Party cast their votes after a number of other candidates withdrew from the race. Dr Boesak said that in the coming election the Western Cape would be the test for the ANC's non-racial character. "If we loose this election the dream for a non-racial democracy, for the rest of our country as well, will die here. It is our responsibility to set the tone for the non-racial democracy which this country must become." He said the reconstruction and development the ANC had spoken of would also be put into practice in this region. "That talk has not just been for elections," he said.
