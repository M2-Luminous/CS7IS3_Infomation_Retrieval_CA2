After the end of the talks that lasted two days, Zotov had a meeting with Latvian Prime minister Valdis Birkavas. Both sides pointed to perceptible progress, achieved on the key issues. A complex agreement on the legal status of a Russian anti-missile radar station in Skrunde has almost been completed. An agreement may be reached even on the most controversial issue -- the time- limit of the functioning of the radar station. The Latvian prime minister again offered apologies to the Russian side about the incident [as received], that took place in Latvia, and said the government was taking measures for preventing in the future the actions that could have a negative impact on bilateral relations.
