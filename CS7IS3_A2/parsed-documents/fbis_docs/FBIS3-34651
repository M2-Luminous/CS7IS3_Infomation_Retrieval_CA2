The meeting was called for by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Najjab said he did not attend the meeting to protest the manner in which the Executive Committee was treated. He said the decisions of the committee and the instructions it gave to the Palestinian negotiating delegation were not respected. The Cairo agreement between 'Arafat and Peres was a deviation from all these decisions and instructions. Al- Najjab urged the Executive Committee members to reject the Cairo agreement because it entrenches the Israeli understanding of the Declaration of Principles. Al-Najjab, who is the representative of the Palestinian People's Party [PPP] in the Executive Committee, warned against continuing the current policy of dealing with the negotiating process, which is proceeding without any terms of reference and any clear negotiating plan that is committed to the Palestinian understanding of the Oslo agreement, whose objective is to secure Israel's withdrawal from all Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 and to guarantee the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. Al-Najjab warned against the danger of unilateral and unstudied decisions, and against responding to pressures employed by foreign parties that do not take into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Al-Najjab called anew for respecting the Executive Committee's decisions and for organizing its action as the higher Palestinian authority, including its decision to form a body responsible for negotiations that no party can overstep. He also called for adopting a Palestinian negotiating plan that reflects the Palestinian militant concept of the Oslo agreement, and for assigning qualified Palestinian politicians the task of implementing this plan. Following the signing of the Cairo agreement, the PPP's Political Bureau issued a statement, a copy of which was received by AL-RA'Y. The statement urged the Executive Committee to reject this agreement and to lay down new bases for the negotiations aimed to realize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The statement described the agreement as disappointing to the popular aspirations, and said the warnings expressed by the PPP when it conditionally accepted the Oslo agreement were legitimate. Since the beginning, the PPP has called for giving the Oslo agreement a militant concept and not to view it as a petition presented to the Israeli authorities. The PPP also called for working out a clear negotiating plan, for high Palestinian performance, and for a fixed political authority. These demands ensure that the Oslo agreement will be the beginning of the march toward independence, and prevent the Israeli concept of implementation of the agreement, which would entrench the occupation. The Cairo agreement is closer to the Israeli understanding of the Oslo agreement. It adopted the Israeli concept of security, which is an expansionist one that seeks to entrench settlements. This concept conflicts with the natural concept of security as stipulated in Resolution 242, which is based on the 1967 borders.
