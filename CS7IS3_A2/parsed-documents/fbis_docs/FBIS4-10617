The call for bids to privatize Lan-Chile and the other companies will be made at the national and international level. Minister Felipe Sandoval referred specifically to the case of the Empremar Company, which has a branch, Transcontainer: [Begin Sandoval recording] This company has a legal restriction imposed during the military regime that prevents the state from selling more than 35 percent of the company. What we will do in the next few days is to submit a bill to remove that restriction on the company in order to allow its capitalization, to allow its association with the private sector in order to solve its economic problems. [end recording] Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia was asked if this decision that is being made only one month after the new government was inaugurated was a bit too hasty, too fast. [Begin Garcia recording] As we said, our intention is to have the markets operate efficiently. And we believe market conditions will allow the efficient operation of these companies through the private sector. [end recording] Garcia said the government will guarantee an appropriate price for the sale of public companies, thus safeguarding workers' legitimate interests and giving them the option to participate in their purchase. He also said this privatization process is the first in this administration and the idea is to continue with the privatization of public companies because it is the best way, Garcia emphasized, to safeguard the interests of all Chileans, especially the poor.
