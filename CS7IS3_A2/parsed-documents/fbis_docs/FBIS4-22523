The production of brilliants here has not yet emerged from the formative stage. But it is important that it is being developed under market conditions, paving the way toward development of a Russian diamond market and actively contributing to an upswing in the economy of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The "Tuymaada Diamond" Joint-Stock Company has assumed the principal burden of resolving the problems associated with the establishment of cutting plants. Aleksandr Ivanovich Im, the company's Moscow representative, tells us about the company's activity and its problems and prospects. His work is typical of specialists in this new sector in the republic's national economy who have come from other fields of activity and are enthusiastic supporters of diamond industry development. Aleksandr Ivanovich was born in the village of Suntar in the Yakut ASSR in 1957. In 1984, he graduated from the mechanical design faculty of the MVTU [Moscow Higher Technical School] imeni Bauman, after which he worked for 9 years at the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute (TsAGI) imeni N. Ye. Zhukovskiy. Because of economic circumstances he was discharged in 1993 and became an adviser to the torgpred [trade representative] of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). He has worked in the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK since September 1993. "What does the name of the company mean?" Familiarity with it usually begins with a question such as this. Tuymaada is the name of the valley where Yakutsk, the capital of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), is situated. This is where our company, which marks its 3d aniversary on 20 March 1994, is located. We can say with every right today that its establishment marked the formation of a new center of the Russian diamond-cutting industry, as well as a new diamond-processing sector in the republic's national economy. The organization of such a company by a group of young persons with initiative was effectively supported by our government in the spring of 1991. And this is understandable, because the republic received the right to dispose of 100 percent of the technical diamonds extracted in it and 20 percent of the jewelry-quality diamonds. The company was initially formed as partly a state enterprise in order to realize the state program for development of the diamond-processing industry of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). "Tuymaada Diamond" is an open-type joint-stock company. The charter capital of the company has grown from 10 million rubles [R] to R1.8371 billion. Altogether, 49,898 shares of stock have been issued; 31.63 percent of them belong to the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), 22.53 percent belong to the gosimushchestvo [State Property] Management Fund, 5.45 percent belong to the Fund for Public Social Support, and 3.65 percent belong to the Labor and Employment Committee. The largest stockholders, with representatives on the board of directors, include companies such as the "Almazy Rossii Sakha" AK (14.85 percent of the shares), the "Zoloto Yakutii" APK (6.8 percent), The Altay "Kristall" Production Association (5.74 percent), the "Aldanzoloto" AO [Joint-Stock Comapny] (5.21 percent), and the "Sakhainvest" Checking Investment Fund (1.67 percent). Altogether, these stockholders hold 34.27 percent of the shares. And finally, 34.1 percent of the shares are held by other stockholders, each of whom owns less than 1 percent of the company stock. As we see, the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK functions with participation not only by Yakut enterprises, but other Russian enterprises as well. I also emphasize that although diamond processing is an export-oriented sector and entry into the world market is in the company's plans, it is now operating in the Russian domestic market and selling its output to CIS countries as well. Successful operation of diamond-cutting plants depends not only on a reliable source of good uncut diamonds, but experienced, skilled personnel. Their skill is developed over the years and is passed on from generation to generation. For this reason, the training of workers and specialists has been a fundamental labor problem for us. We have managed to resolve it--young people have been sent to learn at Russian and Ukrainian enterprises and foreign enterprises. We have also invited specialists from other localities. The first diamond was cut in 1992, and this first of our own brilliants, which we obtained in the village of Suntar, was of quite high quality and created a real wave of enthusiasm, reinforced confidence in the practicality of our plans, and prompted the rayon administrations to provide us with assistance in every possible way. The local administrations made their contribution to our company in the form of stone buildings that were available, which speeded up the process of establishing the plants considerably. Altogether, 16 diamond-cutting plants are to be built in the 1993-1995 period in accordance with the state program. Six plants--40 percent--have already been put into operation, and all the rest are scheduled to be commissioned from April to August this year. That is, the program will be fulfilled ahead of schedule. The Suntar, Yakutsk, Churapchinskiy, Verkhnevilyuyskiy, Berdigestyakhskiy, and Namskiy diamond-cutting plants are now in operation. They are all provided with the most advanced Russian and foreign equipment. Equipment valued at R1.6 billion has been delivered and installed. Two enterprises have also been built to turn out diamond powders and tools and to produce items made of uncut gemstones. Transport and commercial firms have been formed. A controlling block of stock in the "Eyge" Bank has been obtained. So an entire range of structures has been established to ensure the stability of our diamond-processing sector. The company's plans include the establishment of jewelry enterprises which make extensive use of our product in their work. The result of our 3 years of work has been the formation of a system of joint-stock companies [AO], joint ventures, and the joint-stock companies [AK] associated with them. The "Amma Diamond," "Lena Diamond," "Sargy Diamond," "Mayya Diamond," "Vostok Diamond," "Ensieli Diamond," and "Kebeey Diamond" joint-stock companies and the "Sakha Japan Diamond," "Amma Padani Diamonds," "Kuoliti Diamonds," "Ensieli Diam," and "Tuymaada Raykhbard Diamond Ltd" joint ventures are engaged in diamond cutting. The "Kyundyu Tass" Joint-Stock Company is producing items made of gemstones and the "Sakha Diamond" Joint-Stock Company is turning out diamond powders and tools. In looking back at what has been achieved, we see the creation of prestigious modern work places in the republic as one of the important results. Nearly 900 persons are working in the company structures, including over 170 engineers and technicians and more than 700 workers, of whom 463 are cutters. Another 165 persons are in training. We are especially proud of this result, inasmuch as our cutting plants have been dispersed in agricultural uluses [settlements], which not only helps to resolve the problem of employment for the rural population, but has a beneficial effect on the entire local economy. There is a real possibility of shifting the uluses from republic budget subsidies to funds which they have earned themselves. But after all, according to the statistics, all the uluses depend on the subsidies for 95 percent of their support, which inevitably reinforces parasitical attitudes and social apathy. But now attractive types of employment have been developed for the residents. In addition, the funds going to the republic budget from the production and sale of brilliants make it possible to improve the financing of many public health, education, and cultural facilities. But while the social importance of the diamond-processing industry in the Republic of Sakha is quite apparent, the economic effectiveness is questionable at times. How economically feasible is the construction of cutting enterprises in remote, frosty Siberia, and in the villages as well? Will they be profitable? Yes, they will be. And our economic calculations have already been confirmed by experience. So what is increasing the expenditures? The lack of roads and long distances are leading to increased transportation expenses. The freezing weather increases the expenses for heat and electricity. And northern residents must be paid much more for their work than the residents of Russia's central regions. All the same, the value of diamonds is so high that the expenditures for transportation, heat and electricity, and wages have a relatively small effect on the value of brilliants. On average, 85 percent of the value of a brilliant is in the value of the uncut diamond, and nearly 10 percent of the value is in the wages. The other expenses for manufacturing and sales, leasing of premises, heat and electricity, and transportation account for no more than 5 percent of the value. And while all these expenses under the conditions in our republic are three times higher when compared with the West, for example, the value of a brilliant with the wages paid there is increased by only 5 to 10 percent. But this makes it possible with good work organization, modern equipment, and the cutters' high skill to count on the competitiveness of Yakut brilliants not only in the Russian domestic market, but the world market as well. For example, our wages cannot be compared with wages in the West at present, and in addition, we do not pay the high rent that they must pay, which enables us even now to speak about the lower production cost of our product. Of course, the industrial processing of diamonds should be in complete conformity with the standards recognized by the world cutting centers and should take rapidly changing market conditions into account. And while all these years the specialists of the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK lived continuously in an investment routine and were preoccupied by the problems of financial resources and construction, we have now come really close to a new stage in our development, when the quality of the brilliants and their conformity to market demands are assuming decisive importance. World experience shows that a cutter approaches the peak of his skill in 5 years, spasmodically raising labor productivity: three to five times as much each year for the first 3 years, and two to three times as much in the last time period. Today the production cost of cutting brilliants in the republic's cutting plants is very high because of low productivity. But this situation will gradually change, gross output will increase, and expenses will begin declining. And our task is to react in a timely manner to the change in "style" in the cut diamond business and requirements of the jewelry industry. The fact that our plants have 30 to 50 cutters, as a rule, and are not giants by any means helps us in coping with this problem; they can be restructured and improve their technology easily. We are guided in our development by the achievements and traditions of the Russian diamond-cutting school, whose authority is quite reliable. All the same, the classical "Russian-cut" brilliants from the traditionally high-grade uncut diamonds in the world markets are being squeezed by brilliants which may have a less complex but very diversified cut. Two of the six cutting plants already in operation are using the same technology which is used at other Russian plants, but four of them are using a different technology--Belgian, Japanese, or Israeli. In addition, the company includes joint ventures with Japanese, Belgian, and Israeli firms, which facilitates the assimilation of new organizational and technological principles in the work. The new technologies are also attactive because they increase the output of a finished product from uncut diamonds and reduce the cost of brilliants. And returning again to achievements in the 3 years of development at the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK, I would like to stress the following conclusion of fundaamental importance: our company has been practically a pioneer in the world cut diamond market. A Russian domestic market for cut diamonds, with all the structures needed for this, still remains to be developed. Joint-stock companies for processing diamonds in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) were practically the first to take this path by selling brilliants to jewelry plants, firms, repair shops, commercial banks, and individual citizens. Other Russian cutting plants left after the collapse of the USSR with which we were actively collaborating inherited a cumbersome production facility without developed commercial structures and a rigid framework of technical conditions. On the other hand, these plants have SPTU [presumably: agricultural vocational-technical schools] with established traditions in training specialists and developed machine building. I think that although we have different tasks and we are in various stages of development, we have more common interests than differences. In selling brilliants, we are establishing a market for them in Russia at a time when the quality of brilliants as a fine investment commodity has begun to appreciate considerably under the conditions of high inflation. In the world market, the value of cut diamonds increases by an average 300 percent over a 10-year period. So brilliants are a commodity which yields an average profit on investment of 30 percent annually, and often even more, since the price for brilliants is highly individual and depends on numerous parameters. A brilliant is always a brilliant. The merits of a brilliant need not be advertised and its profitability need not be demonstrated. A brilliant that is purchased requires practically no special care from its owner, and it just rises in price. Especially as the level of prices for brilliants in the domestic market has turned out to be unexpectedly productive--in wholesale batches it is higher than prices in the world market. This makes it possible for the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK to allow a discount of up to 10 percent from the prices of wholesale batches in sales to its stockholders. Moreover, we guarantee that we will buy back the brilliants if stockholders are in urgent need of funds. Can you become a stockholder in our company? Yes, you can. We are beginning the sixth stock issue and we are counting on investments. In previous years only about 5 percent of the company's shares were distributed in the Russian market as a whole, but 95 percent were distributed within the republic. Now the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK intends to increase the sale of stock shares in the Russian national market. They are in good demand, and the price in the Moscow stock exchanges is 9 to 13 times their nominal value. The next emission will reflect the results of reassessment of the fixed capital, and each ruble of the stock's value will be reinforced by real physical assets. We are confident that this stock issue will be bought up quickly by those who are able to assess the commercial attractiveness of stock shares from the diamond business. In entering the market environment, we became aware of the practically complete lack of needed information in the country on the prices for uncut diamonds and brilliants in the world markets in one region or another. There are not enough studies and forecasts of market conditions. The instability of export duties is a big obstacle. We would also like parliament and the government to expedite establishment of the necessary legal and normative basis for normal operation of the diamond-processing industry under market conditions. * * * Tuymaada Diamond Our address: 677000, City of Yakutsk, Russia.
