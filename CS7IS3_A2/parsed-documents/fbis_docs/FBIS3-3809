Participants at the sessions share the view that stability is a prerequisite of reform and development for, without political and social stability, nothing can be achieved. On the other hand, reform and development constitute the groundwork of stability for, unless reform and development are pushed forward vigorously, stability can hardly be firm and enduring. The economy has developed remarkably fast in the last two years. Meanwhile, however, the inflationary pressures have mounted and bottlenecks have formed in certain fields. Therefore, the planned growth rate for this year has been reduced to 9 percent from last year's 13.4 percent. This cut is necessary because painful experience in the past has taught us that growth, when it comes too fast, without regard to economic laws and with no real benefit, is false growth that will eventually become a burden. Development must be steady and healthy with a well-coordinated and rational industrial structure and an efficient mechanism for economic operations. Several essential reform measures in key economic sectors have already been introduced. Their impact will certainly be strong and far reaching. These reforms are being carried out as the economy continues to grow fast. They should constitute a great driving force for development rather than a hindrance. We should always be on the alert and take prompt action to iron out any problems that may crop up. It is clear that a stable political and social climate must be maintained if the aforesaid reform measures are to be implemented smoothly. Participants in the NPC and CPPCC sessions have offered valuable suggestions to ensure the success of this year's reforms and consolidate the country's present stable scene. Several issues have drawn their intensive attention. Last year while the income of urban residents increased 10.2 percent, that of their rural brothers increased only 3.2 percent. This shows the rural people are at a great disadvantage. Price hikes and inflation immediately affect the lives of the people, particularly those in towns and cities. The government has adopted concrete measures to combat inflation and rein in prices. The recent decision to monitor and strengthen supervision of prices for 20 basic necessities and service items for the people is an apt example. Then there is the issue of corruption. The crackdown on corruption has been given much publicity since last year and has so far achieved notable results. This has enhanced the image of the Party and the government in the eyes of the people at large. However, corruption is still a serious problem and resented by the man in the street. There must be no let-up in the fight against corruption and for a clean government. A proper settlement of these and some other issues will provide, by and large, a stable environment for the accomplishment of this year's tasks. We believe the blueprint mapped out by the NPC and CPPCC sessions will win wholehearted support of the whole nation and we hope 1994 will be a fruitful year for China's economic development and drive towards a socialist market economy.
