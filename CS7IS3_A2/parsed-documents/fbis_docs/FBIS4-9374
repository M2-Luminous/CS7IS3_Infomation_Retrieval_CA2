Does such a danger really exist, and from where will it come, in your view? [Dimitrov] Everyone is well aware that since the conflict began in Yugoslavia, risks exist for Kosovo, for Macedonia, and hence for Bulgaria as well. This is why my lips are tired of repeating that intervention by international organizations and effective groups that can really achieve something, namely NATO, is necessary. I have been repeating this since 1991 and have been saying it almost daily since the conflict broke out in Bosnia. In the final event, thank God, it turned out that the policy followed by the SDS government was a sensible one. We recognized the [former Yugoslav] republics, following which others recognized them as well, thus demonstrating that this is the way to prevent the conflict. We have been attacked for recognizing Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], but, in the end, everyone recognized this republic because they realized that this is the only sensible way to guarantee tranquillity. Our government wanted blue helmets and observers to be sent to the FYROM, and the FYROM got them because this is the way to guarantee that there will be no expansion of the conflict. Naturally, these actions are being carried out because everyone realizes that it cannot be excluded that an unpredictable communist regime like Milosevic's may do anything. If it does something that leads to an expansion of the conflict, there is a very big risk of that our Bulgarian home will be set on fire. Bearing in mind these dangers, which are not immediate at the moment, we should do everything within our powers to ward off this possibility. I am glad that the NATO forces are in [the former] Yugoslavia. They are a guarantee that any such expansion will be checked. [Koleva] Can we regard the stance adopted by the SDS parliamentary group today as a kind of vote in favor of the policy that your government followed? [Dimitrov] Today's vote does indeed show that the SDS fully supports the positions that the SDS government defended with much effort and at no little risk. [Koleva] How do you explain the position of the Socialists in the parliamentary debate when they voted en bloc against the UN request? [Dimitrov] I think they are acting as agents of an imperialist expansionist policy advocated by certain circles in Russia that hope that the heightening of tension in the Balkans and the intensification of Serbian expansion might bring in Russia to act as an arbiter in this region.
