FR940407-2-00014 FR940407-2-00009 The cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 92.47 percent. On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT) in Floral Trade Council v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal-Mogul Corporation v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders as the ``all others'' rate for cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding, and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate of 92.47 percent established in the first final results published by the Department in the Federal Register on August 6, 1984, (49 FR 31313). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22(c)(5). Dated: March 31, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8380 Filed 4&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
