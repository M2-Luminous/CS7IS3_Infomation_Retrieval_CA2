Jack Charlton's football team, the only surviving World Cup contender from these islands, has achieved a breakthrough in cross-border relations through sport which the politicians, meeting again in Dublin yesterday, have been painfully unable to emulate. After the latest round of talks, Sir Patrick Mayhew -- memo to PM, don't reshuffle this one -- said he was "optimistic but not expectant." Come to think of it, that's about right for the Italy game, too. Football apart, there is not much to be expectant about on the Irish front. The long awaited European elections have been and gone. The doomsters were proved wrong. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists topped the poll and Paisley immediately claimed a mandate against Dublin "interference." But he topped the poll last time too, and his share of the vote was slightly down this week, the only one of the big three candidates to fall compared with 1989. In the generally unchanging pattern of Northern Irish elections, the new features were John Hume's sharply increased vote -- he came within 1,300 votes of pushing Paisley into second place -- and the less spectacular hike in the Unionist share. With Sinn Fein staying very much where it generally is -- at 9.9 per cent in the north, and 3 per cent in the Republic -- the election's advance bark was notably worse than its actual bite. Contrary to the pessimistic pre-election talk, the Irish equation has emerged largely unaltered and, if anything, slightly improved. But the surrounding atmosphere of random tit-for-tat sectarian killings this week is a reminder that the constraints of the grim, dull truth are almost as powerful as they have always been. Anyone hoping for a breakthrough when Sinn Fein finally deigns to give its reply to the Anglo-Irish Declaration early next month is still entitled to look tentatively on the bright side; but the probability is now overwhelmingly that this will be yet another false dawn for any peace process. Sinn Fein's response increasingly seems as if it will not be a straight yes or no, not least because Sinn Fein, all the signs suggest, remains so divided. The only consistencies in its position are the discordant signals which continue to emerge and which equally continue to cloud the possibilities of real progress. Last month the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, talked of the "reality of conflict" as the background against which the search for solutions must take place, which was taken as meaning that he expected the violence to continue. A few days later he listed a further series of demands which could help produce his movement's compliance, some of which might be negotiable while others might not. But the most fundamental questions of all on this territory still have to do with consent. Everything turns in the end on whether Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA accept the right of the people of Northern Ireland to determine their future. If they do accept it, what possible justification can there be for continuing violence? If they don't, how can any agreement be reached consistent with the repeatedly stated aims of the British and Irish governments? Unless or until Sinn Fein can plainly accept consent, not coercion, as the basis for unification one day, its manoeuvrings over clarification and its programmes of demand are irrelevant to the outcome. And though it still doesn't say so directly, there seems little chance of it reaching such a conclusion. A peace process with Sinn Fein aboard would clearly be much more credible than one which excludes it. But the European elections showed once again that Sinn Fein's support, North and South, is far too thin on the ground for anyone to accept its right to dictate what should happen.
