Under the impact of the wave of reform in the rural system, large numbers of farmers are escaping from the confines of the land, applying themselves vigorously to enlarging the scope of their business activities, and continually opening up new fields of endeavor in rural modernization. Twenty-one percent of rural female workers have already turned to lines of work outside of agriculture, which is not much different from male laborers, of whom 30 percent have turned to lines of work outside of agriculture. Of them, 52.4 percent have turned to industry and processing; 16.5 percent are putting their efforts into commerce, or the service industries; 4.7 percent have entered the ranks of the construction industry; 2.8 percent are specializing on the transportation industry; and 23.6 percent are going into other industries. Women are involved in many parts of social production, and their income is increases every day. The ratio between the incomes of women and men is approximately 0.78 to one. Education and Training. In the 15 years since reform and opening up, 46.3 percent of rural women throughout China have received some kind of training in agricultural technology. According to this survey, women make up 27.6 percent of farmers, with occupational titles of agricultural technician and above. The rise in their own educational level has also further raised the consciousness of rural women about providing even more educational opportunities for the younger generation. The survey found that 80 percent of women aged 18 to 29 expect their children to attain at least a high school education. Marriage and the Family. Changes show up mainly in that a wife's opinions on important policy matters in her family cannot be ignored. There has also been a steady decrease in incidents of family violence. Participation in Society. The results of an evaluation of the political awareness of China's rural women show that 49.8 percent of them could correctly give the name of the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and 11.2 percent could give the name of the President of the United States in that year. Among the major topics that they discussed with others, 13.8 listed social phenomena and issues first, while 13.4 percent ranked first exchange of information related to their work. It is plain that rural women harbor great enthusiasm for participating in external affairs. Pre-Natal Care. According to the survey, over the last ten or more years, rural women have come to attach more and more importance to pre-natal care, while rural pre-natal care services have also become more and more organized and standardized. Among women under 40, 46.3 percent are able, during pregnancy, to receive prenatal examinations in accordance with their doctor's advice, and 57.2 percent have the assistance of a midwife, or medical personnel, during delivery. At present, 66.5 percent of villages have a trained, qualified midwife. Social Attitudes. Although the traditional idea that "men should be in charge of the outside, and women should be in charge of the inside," is still deeply rooted in rural areas, the self-awareness of China's rural women is gradually being increased. The survey shows that 66.1 percent of people either doubt or deny the view that "males are by nature better than females;" 61 percent deny the notion that "a woman should avoid being in a higher position than her husband;" and 71 percent approved of the statement that, "I would despise myself if I could not accomplish anything."
