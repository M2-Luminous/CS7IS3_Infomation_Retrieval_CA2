Horta, who is also international relations director of the Cuban Institute of Arts and Motion Picture Industry (ICAIC), told EFE that the police arrested him on 18 June as he was leaving the Havana airport on his way to Mexico. He said he was taken off the plane twice while the police thoroughly searched his luggage. He said the Cuban authorities later refused to return his passport. The reason for his trip to Mexico was to promote the New Latin American Film Festival, which is held in Havana every December. "This situation has been humiliating. I never thought I would ever abandon Cuba, but this abuse is intolerable. I do not know if this is part of the prevailing wave of repression in the country, but I will not tolerate it any longer," he said. Horta, who has been director of the film festival for four years and has participated in its organization for the past 16 years, said he has not yet decided whether he will request political asylum in Mexico or if he will travel to the United States. Roberto Casin, former PRENSA LATINA director in Mexico, defected in May 1991 while in Mexico and later traveled to Miami, the United States.
