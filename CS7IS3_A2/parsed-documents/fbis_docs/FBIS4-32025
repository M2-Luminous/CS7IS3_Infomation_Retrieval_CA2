The president of the Republic gave an interview to Kossuth Radio just before our program. Regarding the elections, the head of state said that they took place in an orderly manner and that the people voted for changes. [Goncz] ``The election result is obvious. The country's political will is clearly revealed. It cannot be questioned; its legality cannot be questioned. If we wish to analyze the reasons, such as whether the country voted for or against something, the debate on this will probably last for a while. It is a difficult test of conscience for everybody. ``The country wanted modernization, progress. It wanted to move toward security of existence. I am convinced that the country wanted a change in style, which is by all means positive. ``The country disliked something very much. I think that the country did not like the style, because we consequently forgot, or were inclined to forget, that the bourgeois mentality of the country had progressed, under the surface, even during the 40 years of communist rule in spite of their intentions. So a society with a rather bourgeois and secular character came into existence, and its system of values in essence differed from the system of values and symbols of the previous four years. It can be understood that all the parties are currently battling with the problem of self-definition. ``The SZDSZ, as the second winner in my opinion, must decide whether to join a coalition or not. And the greatest winner, the MSZP, must clarify how much it will dare and how much it will have to accept from its past and how much it can reject from its past, and with whom and to what extent it can become a modern social democratic party within the four-year cycle.'' [Announcer] Regarding his talks with the six parties in parliament, Arpad Goncz said that in his view not all of the organizations have yet managed to find a new identity. [Goncz] "I saw the intention to be in the opposition and to face the facts. [sentence as heard] I saw the difficulty of facing the facts, and in some cases I saw the intention of escaping from reality." [Announcer] The head of state also evaluated the coalition talks up to now. [Goncz] "National reconciliation is definitely an aim. A Hungarian is not another Hungarian's enemy. If we do not try to keep selecting who is and who is not Hungarian, then I think there will be room for everybody here, and it is in our commom interest to build the country for everyone's benefit." [Announcer] Arpad Goncz described the fact that Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn laid a wreath together with Erzsebet Nagy, daughter of Imre Nagy, as one of the first signs of national reconciliation. [Goncz] "If Gyula Horn wanted to pay tribute and express feelings of this kind, then with the gesture of laying a wreath at the symbolic grave of the 1956-ers and at the grave of Imre Nagy, together with Erzsebet Nagy, daughter of Imre Nagy, he simply expressed something without words." [Announcer] In conclusion, Arpad Goncz cautioned against the new goverment laying its hands on the press because, according to the president, this affair could explode at any time.
