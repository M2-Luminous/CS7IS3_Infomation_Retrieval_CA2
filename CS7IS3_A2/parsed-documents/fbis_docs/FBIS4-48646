To a far great extent than in other liberation movements on the subcontinent, whites played an important role in the fight against apartheid. They made a distinctive contribution in student politics, the trade unions and the legal sphere. During the 1950s and 1960s they were prominent in the South African Communist Party and its successor, the Congress of Democrats, and in the ANC's trade union arm, the South African Congress of Trade Unions. White intellectuals and student activists again played a vital supporting role in the resurgence of black unionism in the 1970s, and in the rise of the United Democratic Front a decade later. Here are eight who, by historical irony, already hold or are on the threshold of high public office: HALTON CHEADLE Tipped as the new director-general of manpower, Cheadle (44) is a lawyer with impeccable "struggle" credentials. After whetting his appetite for union affairs as a student on the University of Natal's Wages Commission, he became a national organiser for the Textile Workers' Industrial Union. His ground-breaking work in organising black workers in 1972 and 1973 -- when the Industrial Conciliation Act did not recognise black labour unions -- earned him the wrath of the security police. "Anyone who organised black workers clearly constituted a threat to the state," says Cheadle. He had a five- year banning order slapped on him in 1974, but it lapsed after two years. During his "house arrest" he completed a law degree with Unisa [University of South Africa]. Afterwards he joined the Centre for Applied Legal Studies at Wits [Witwatersrand University], where he still holds a teaching chair. In the 1980s he started the legal firm Cheadle, Thompson & Haysom with Nicholas Haysom in Johannesburg. "Hundreds" of labour cases and a number of human rights cases put Cheadle's firm on the legal map. In 1985 Cheadle and his partners represented the Uitenhage community in the Kannemeyer Commission of Inquiry into the death of 21 marchers at the hands of police, and the following year there was an interdict against the police when Port Elizabeth district surgeon Dr Wendy Orr spilled the beans on police torture. That same year the firm's challenge against the second State of Emergency on behalf of a trade union grabbed headlines. Cheadle made his mark on constitutional law last year when he served on the Ad Hoc Committee on Fundamental Rights at the World Trade Centre negotiations. What motivates him? "Certainly not the money. I suppose the best is the people I work with. The people in the struggle are the most extraordinary people." On the director-generalship he says: "I am talking to people, but I like my life at the moment." JOHN DANIELS A foreign affairs expert and professor of politics at the University of Durban-Westville, Daniels (50) seems a likely candidate for a top Department of Foreign Affairs position by virtue of his close connections to the ANC task group on foreign policy and his training of diplomats for the new order. Daniels cut his anti-apartheid political teeth in the student movement. He says he came out of school a supporter of the United Party, but underwent a "radical political conversion through NUSAS [National Union of South African Students]. "For the first time I found myself working in a non-racial organisation." He was president of the University of Natal-Pietermaritzburg SRC [Students Representative Council] in 1965 and vice-president of NUSAS the following year. He took over as NUSAS president when the incumbent, Ian Robertson, was banned. He soon attracted the attention of authorities, who refused him a passport when he wanted to study overseas in 1967. In 1968 he was re-elected NUSAS president, but things became too hot and he went into exile until 1991. He did a PhD in the United States and became a professor of political studies in Swaziland -- where his association with the ANC started. Swazi authorities deported him in 1985, after which he worked as a researcher in Holland and for a leftwing publisher in London. On his return to South Africa he joined the Rhodes University department of politics, where he headed a diplomacy training programme. He moved to the University of Durban-Westville last year. He says the area of international affairs may hold far fewer difficulties for the new government than domestic transformation. He expects pressures on the Reconstruction and Development Programme, which may mean a retreat on some promises. "I fear cynicism, bitterness and slow delivery." President Nelson Mandela's "incredible international stature" will smooth the way for South Africa's reentry to the world arena, says Daniels, and the new government can play an important role in giving the Third World a greater voice in the United Nations. Daniels says he is in two minds about the possibility of taking public office. "If offered a position in the Department of Foreign Affairs, I would seriously consider it, although I am also very committed to academic life." ALEC ERWIN Erwin (48), an economist who made his career in the trade union movement, has been named deputy minister of finance in the new national cabinet. He is an ANC MP in the National Assembly. Like his contemporary Halton Cheadle, he graduated from Wages Commission to union involvement. He helped found the Institute for Industrial Education in 1973 and made his name as one of a number of whites who played a critical role in the reconstruction of the trade union movement after Sactu [South African Congress of Trade Unions] was smashed and forced into exile. During a wave of bannings and detentions in the mid-1970s Erwin was put under surveillance, was targeted in police raids and had is passport withdrawn. In 1979 Erwin became the first general secretary of the newly launched Federation of South African Trade Unions (FOSATU), which was to form the backbone, with the National Union of Mineworkers, of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions]. He served COSATU, and later the National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) as education secretary. He became involved in ANC structures in Durban after the oragnisation's unbanning and represented COSATU on the National Economic Forum. Erwin hopes for a constructive relation between labour and government, but "it is crucial the union movement maintains its independence and organisational strength." DEREK HANEKOM Hanekom (41) was appointed minister of land affairs last week -- eight years after he walked from prison in Pretoria following a terrorism conviction. In 1990 he became co-ordinator of the ANC land and agricultural desk. Hanekom matriculated from Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and did his national service in Potchefstroom, after which he travelled and did assorted jobs -- including farming -- in Europe, America and Israel. From 1978 to 1983 he was a dairy, poultry and vegetable farmer in the Magaliesberg, where he started facilitating linkages for the ANC. But he was arrested -- with his wife, Trish -- and sentenced to three years in jail. He served the full term. Trish, a Zimbabwean citizen, was later deported to Zimbabwe and Hanekom followed. He was appointed co-ordinator of the Popular History Trust in Harare. He returned in 1990 to take up the ANC position. NICHOLAS "FINK" HAYSON "In another society my first concern may have been rugby, which is my passion," says Haysom. But "in South Africa it has been difficult to live a normal life while there are glaring inequalities and injustice". Like his partner Cheadle at the labour and human rights law firm Cheadle, Thompson & Haysom, Haysom has a long "struggle" track record and is likely to be the legal and constitutional advisor in Mandela's office. He is a human rights, constitutional, and security expert and ANC appointee to the Police Board established in terms of the National Peace Accord. He was "something of a liberal even at school", and got caught up in progressive student politics at the University of Natal, where he was SRC vice-president from 1973 to 1975. In 1977 he was elected SRC president at the University of Cape Town and president of NUSAS [National Union of South African Students]. Haysom was detained without trial for short periods in 1976 and 1980, and for about five months in 1981, when the government cracked down on the trade union movement. Like Cheadle he joined the Centre for Applied Legal Studies at Wits, where he is an associate professor. He is member of the ANC's committee on constitutional affairs and took part in the Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] and World Trade Centre negotiations. Of the "new South Africa" he says: "It's exciting, but I'm also sure it's going to be difficult to transform a society and civil service that has worked in a particular culture of authoritarianism and militarism to one that is transparent." JANET LOVE Once branded on police posters as "armed and dangerous", Love (38) made a rapid ascent to transitional structures after being granted indemnity three years ago -- her current position is deputy executive director of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. Her political life started at Wits University, where she was elected to the SRC and the NUSAS executive in 1975. A year later she started working covertly for the ANC. She facilitated communication between ANC cadres outside the country and internally, and between banned people. In 1978 Love left the country for "a short period that turned out to be 10 years". In Europe and Southern Africa she was involved with SACTU [South African Congress of Trade Unions] and was trained as an Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing (MK]) guerrilla. In 1987 she returned illegally and lived under a series of assumed identities, and took part in MK's Operation Vula. "In 1990 the SAP [South African Police] got wind that I was here and put out a series of mug shots of me, saying I was 'armed and dangerous'." She spent a year on the run. In June 1991 Love was granted indemnity, and the following year was elected to the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional executive, where she helped set up the Codesa negotiations. As the TEC winds down, she has been mentioned as a possible appointee to the President's Office, but says nothing has been finalised. CHARLIE NUPEN A lawyer and a big man ("Isn't it one of the ironies of life that he is called Charlie when he is about eight feet tall," quipped an IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] staffer), Nupen (43) shot to broad public attention as commissioner of the Independent Electoral Commission. As NUSAS president in 1974 he led a campaign for the release of political prisoners such as Mandela and Walter Sisulu. For that he spent a year on trial in 1976, but was acquitted. After university he practised as a labour attorney in Cape Town and from 1980 to 1987 was an attorney with the Legal Resources Centre -- where he helped establish a jurisprudence in the Industrial Court. After that he was appointed national director of the Independent Mediation Service of South Africa. Nupen says he is optimistic. "I'm incredibly pleased about the security situation now; that has been one of the most impressive aspects of the electoral process." Economic development is predicated on stability, he says. ? "If (peace) can be sustained, it augurs incredibly well for investment, development and Reconstruction and Development Programme." Nupen may consider another public office -- and there have been discussions around a Department of Manpower position -- but Independent Electoral Commission legislation precludes him from holding one for 18 months. DR TIM WILSON Wilson (50), tipped for a senior Department of Health position, has a strong community health background, both as practitioner and as the ANC's health policy co-ordinator. Wilson's godfather was Professor Z.K. Matthews, ANC Cape leader in the 1940s, and his association with the ANC started at birth, he says. He kept the struggle in the family by marrying SACP [South African Communist Party] legend Braam Fischer's daughter, Ilse. While Wilson was completing his medical studies in England his passport was withdrawn, presumably because of his association with ANC activists. He returned in 1970. "I was lucky only my passport was withdrawn. There were people who had it tougher than me," he says. In the late 1970s he became involved in community health, and led a research project in Soweto. He was one of a group of doctors who took the South African Medical and Dental Council to court for its failure to censure doctors involved in the cover-up of Steve Biko's death. In 1986 Wilson was appointed director of the Alexandra Health Centre, where he felt the brunt of informal repression. After he and other staffers refused to hand over records of patients to police, a series of arson attacks was launched against the centre. He moved into ANC health policy structures in 1990. Wilson says first priority is to overcome the fragmentation of health services. When a unified health policy is introduced "we can raise the level of health care in this country, infinitely, with the current resources we have."
