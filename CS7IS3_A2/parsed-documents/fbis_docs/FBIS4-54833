However, the question of who will be president has remained unanswered, despite the fact that the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (that was adopted on 30 March in Sarajevo) stipulates that president ought to be appointed within 30 days of the adoption of the Constitution. Time is running out, but the Croats and Muslims-Bosniaks have not yet been able to agree on which people the president will be chosen from. Even if they eventually agree that the future president should be a Croat, the question remains who will be the president, since the Croatian People's Council [HNV], which was founded in mid-February this year in Sarajevo, although objecting to being referred to as a political party, still has political aspirations regarding the future head of state. Furthermore, 10 days ago the HNV put forward Ivo Komsic, chairman of the Croatian Peasants' Party [HSS] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a presidential candidate. This was an occasion to talk with Komsic. [Posavljak] Unlike your regularly participation in all the negotiations between the Herzegovina Croats and Muslims, always as a member of the Bosniak delegation, you were not present at the latest round of talks? [Komsic] It was about an agreement between the two governments on economic and humanitarian matters, and I am a member of the Presidency, rather than a minister in the government. Also, it was a meeting of two parliamentary parties: The Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] and the Party of Democratic Action [SDA], to which I do not belong. I do not know what kind of agreement they will reach, but regardless of what they agree, it is necessary to carry out talks with other parties in the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because not a single deputies' club in the Parliament is homogeneous. Also, one has to reconcile attitudes within the Croatian deputies' club, and within the Muslim-Bosniak deputies' club, because both of them are heterogeneous. They are composed of parties with different orientations. [Posavljak] You said that the latest round of talks was about an agreement between two parliamentary parties, whose legitimacy had been confirmed by the elections back in 1990. It is obvious that the SDA and the Muslim-Bosniak leadership are making agreements with their partner in power, namely the HDZ. Your HSS is not taken into consideration, is it? [Komsic] To put forward such arguments is to try to revive the old argument about which party is legitimate, and which has a right to represent the interests of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We feel that such a debate is superfluous, all the more so since the war has changed many things in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and many parties have squandered their legitimacy and legality. The parties may discuss issues and reach agreements, but all the agreements must be reached within their deputies' clubs, while there is also the highest authority -- the constituent assembly, where decisions are made by a two-thirds majority. Proposals that are passed in the clubs do not necessarily have to pass in the assembly. [Posavljak] The HSS was founded as late as last year, so it could not take part in the 1990 elections, but now it is competing for power. [Komsic] When a party was founded is not important at all. The HSS revived its activities in Bosnia last year, and nobody can deny any party's right to put forward its candidates. The HSS is to be given considerable credit for the accomplishment of peace in Bosnia, even for the achievement of the Washington Agreement and the institution of the constituent assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Contribution to peace is the only measure by which the legitimacy of any political party can be measured. The time has come for the position of certain parties to be determined by evaluating their contribution to peace. The HSS has its deputies' club in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I have to say that a number of HDZ deputies support the work of the HSS. [Posavljak] Who are those deputies? [Komsic] I do not want to mention names, but I will corroborate my assertion by saying that a member of the HNV and HSS won the support of a majority of HDZ deputies when the chairman of the Croatian deputies' club was being elected at a previous constituent assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Posavljak] You are promoting the HNV and its candidates although you claim that the HNV is not a political party. What is it then? Is it an association of citizens, and can it be taken as a serious political party as such? Rift Among Croats [Komsic] The HNV is an executive body of the Croatian National Assembly that took place in Sarajevo on 6 February this year. That body is struggling for the implementation of the conclusions adopted at the convention, which are absolutely in accord with the Washington Agreement and the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and will struggle for it until everything that has been agreed upon or planned is implemented. [Posavljak] Did the foundation of the HNV cause a division into loyal and disloyal Croats, that is, to what extent have you contributed to the disintegration of the unity of the Croats at a time when intensive homogenization of the other two peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina is taking place? [Komsic] If we value the collective interest of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is for peace, I suppose, then there is no need to campaign against the HNV and the people who have brought about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Before the foundation of the HNV and its concept of federation, we had a war between the Croats and the Muslims. The theory about a rift among the Croats is sustained by those who are struggling for power, by those who tried to create a national state for themselves in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and who cannot reconcile themselves to their political defeat. The new Constitution represents their defeat, and now those forces want to achieve power again in order to protect their own interests. As for the Croatian nation here in Bosnia-Herzegovina, those who disintegrated the Croats, who sacrificed half a million Croats for the creation of a Croatian national state in Bosnia-Herzegovina, are now trying to push their policy through the institutions of the Federation. They are trying to revive and deepen the rift that they themselves caused among the the Croats by campaigning against the HNV. [Posavljak] You keep saying that the HNV has brought about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that your policy brought about the Washington Agreement as well. However, the representatives of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna claim the same for themselves, and it is they who signed the document. Who is to be given credit for the accomplishment of the peace agreement between the Croats and Muslim-Bosniaks? [Komsic] Representatives of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna stated their attitude at the assembly in Livno, and according to the Livno resolution the Croatian people claims sovereignty and statehood in Herzeg-Bosna, while all other Croats would be protected by international institutions for human rights and freedoms. That means that their resolution declared us to be a national minority in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but this concept of theirs as stated in the Livno resolution ultimately failed. [Posavljak] In view of your attitude that it is precisely the HVN that has preserved the Croats' equality as a nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, how do you interpret certain denunciations on the part of certain groups among the Croatian people, saying that you are a Croatian Sejdo Bajramovic [the Albanian member of the Yugoslav Federal Presidency before the war] [Komsic] I can only say that history will answer many questions. In Politics -- Out of Necessity [Posavljak] The HNV has already announced its criteria that the candidates for federal posts should meet. One of those criteria is that none of the candidates should ever have been involved in the Croatian-Muslim war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Are there any such people among the current politicians at all? I refer thereby also to you and to Stjepan Kljujic, member of the Bosnian Presidency, because the Croats in central Bosnia consider you to be indirect participants in the conflict, but on the Muslim side? [Komsic] Those are insinuations, and in proposing these criteria we referred to the people who were actively involved in the conflict either as protagonists, or through the media, generating hatred between the two peoples. [Posavljak] Are your attitudes and explanations supported by the Croats in central Bosnia, where you yourself come from, and would you dare visit your native town of Kiseljak now, convinced of the correctness of your policy? [Komsic] An unpredictable danger in such places not only for me, but also for other people, lies in uniformed groups or individuals who have broken loose from any control. Those who are under the control of or subordinated to the General Staff of the Croatian Defense Council represent no danger for any of us, which means for me as well. I travelled enough during the war throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I stayed in Grude, Citluk, and Capljina without any fear. [Posavljak] You also said that the HNV put the blame for the conflict on those who had generated hatred between the peoples by waging a media war. One of the elements of the Washington Agreement stipulates the urgent cessation of the media war. While listening to Sarajevo Radio these days I have noticed that the Croats are still referred to as Ustashas. Do you feel uncomfortable when you hear that the official, state-run media refer to your people in such a way? [Komsic] I have already made many public statements about the terminology used, which is quite unbecoming to the media. After all, the Ustasha movement was never in conflict with the Muslims, and never supported the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, because of the fascist connotation that the term conveys, we disagree with the use of it. It is incorrect rather than offensive. [Posavljak] What will happen to your political career if the HDZ and the SDA reach an agreement? Do you see any political future for yourself if Herzeg-Bosna's candidate becomes president? [Komsic] My engagement in politics has resulted from necessity, from the need for the protection of Croatian interests in the region. I am not worried about my political career because I have never aimed at one. Everything that I have done has been out of necessity, to save what could be saved, and now we want the consensus between Muslims and Croats to be preserved through the implementation of the Constitution. [Posavljak] Still, you have not given up your candidacy for the future president of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Komsic] My candidacy for one of the leading offices in the Federation was announced by the HNV some 10 days ago, while other things will be determined in the course of negotiations. [Posavljak] With respect to your attitude that everything that you are doing is for the benefit of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, would you give up your presidential candidacy if the Croatian interest demanded that? [Komsic] Yes, because it is all about the implementation of the project of Federation, and if somebody else were to implement it, I would be very happy.
