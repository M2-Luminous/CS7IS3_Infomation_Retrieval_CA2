The visitors will be headed by Jean Pierre Desgeorges, vice president of the French National Sponsorship Council [Consejo Nacional de Patronato Frances] (CNPF), which is a collective that includes 225 organizations in the industrial, financial, and services sectors. Cuban business sources consider this first CNPF visit as very important, because the collective represents approximately 1 million French businessmen, including chiefs of state, ministers, and private and public leaders, and has 43 committees in several countries that operate under the management of important world business personalities. At the meeting, which will continue until 10 February, the 32 members of the visiting delegation will hold talks and meet with Cuban executives who work in various economic sectors, such as construction material, tourism, transportation, electricity, and banks, among others. Likewise, it is expected the French delegation will meet with top Cuban officials, including Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State; Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Council of Ministers; and Roberto Robaina, the Cuban foreign minister.
