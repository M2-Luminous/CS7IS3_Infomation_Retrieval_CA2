FR940706-2-00052 FR940706-2-00034 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany; Application to engage in Nonbanking Activities Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Bank), has applied pursuant to 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and 225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage in various activities through Deutsche Bank Sharps Pixley, Inc. (DBSPI) and Sharps Pixley Brokers, Inc. (``Brokers''), both of New York, New York, which were acquired indirectly by Deutsche Bank from Kleinwort Benson Group plc, London, England on December 31, 1993. Deutsche Bank proposes to engage in the following activities through DBSPI: (1) trading for its own account for nonhedging purposes in gold, silver and platinum bullion in the spot, forward and over-the-counter (OTC) option markets; and (2) providing various financing services. Deutsche Bank proposes to provide futures commission merchant (FCM) execution and investment advisory services through Brokers, an FCM registered under the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq .), on the following contracts: Copper Futures, Options on Copper Futures, Gold Futures, Options on Gold Futures, Silver Futures, and Options on Silver Futures on the Commodity Exchange, Inc.; Copper Futures, Options on Copper Futures, Lead Futures, Options on Lead Futures, Zinc Futures, Options on Zinc Futures, Aluminum Futures, Options on Aluminum Futures, Tin Futures, Options on Tin Futures, Nickel Futures, Options on Nickel Futures, Aluminum Alloy Futures, and Options on Aluminum Alloy Futures on The London Metal Exchange, Limited. The activities will be conducted on a world wide basis. Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity, or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form. National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984). Deutsche Bank states that the Board previously has determined by Regulation that certain of the proposed activities, when conducted within limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and orders, are closely related to banking for purposes of 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. See 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(1) and Westpac Banking Corporation, 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 61 (1987) (making, acquiring or servicing loans or other extensions of credit); 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(18) and (19) (providing FCM transactional and advisory services with respect to bullion contracts). Deutsche Bank also maintains that the Board has determined by order that several of the other proposed activities, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in previous orders, are closely related to banking. See Midland Bank, PLC , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 860 (1990) (trading gold and silver bullion in the spot market for a bank holding company's own account); J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated , 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 151 (1994) (providing FCM transactional and advisory services with respect to nonfinancial commodity contracts). Deutsche Bank maintains that DBSPI and Brokers would conduct these previously approved activities in conformity with the conditions and limitations established by the Board in prior cases. Deutsche Bank further states that the Board previously has not approved trading platinum bullion in the spot market for a bank holding company's own account, or trading gold, silver or platinum bullion in the forward or OTC option market for a bank holding company's own account for nonhedging purposes. With respect to trading gold and silver in the forward and OTC option markets, Deutsche Bank maintains that the Board previously has determined that trading for nonhedging purposes in the proposed derivative contracts with respect to other bank-eligible investments is closely related to banking, and, therefore, that trading these contracts with respect to silver and gold bullion also is closely related to banking. See Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 217 (1989) (trading foreign exchange for a bank holding company's own account for nonhedging purposes in the spot, forward, options, futures and options on futures markets). With respect to its proposal that Company trade for its own account in platinum bullion, Deutsche Bank states that the OCC and the New York State Banking Department have approved this activity for banks under their respective jurisdictions. Deutsche Bank also states that the Board has approved under 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act the purchase and sale of platinum coins, under limited circumstances. See Standard Chartered PLC , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 681 (1990). Deutsche Bank also states that the Board has approved, under Regulation K (12 C.F.R. part 211), trading in platinum by bank holding company subsidiaries located outside the United States. See J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 552 (1990). Deutsche Bank maintains that for these reasons, the proposed trading in platinum bullion is closely related to banking. In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by DBSPI and Brokers ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). Deutsche Bank believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Deutsche Bank maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Deutsche Bank to offer its customers a broader range of products. In addition, Deutsche Bank states that the proposed activities will not result in the adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than July 31, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by 262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 29, 1994. Jennifer J. Johnson, Associate Secretary of the Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16289 Filed 7&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6210&hyph;01&hyph;F
