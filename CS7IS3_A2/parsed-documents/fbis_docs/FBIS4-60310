Officials at Queen 'Alya' international airport said that their decision to deny the Yemeni citizens entry was made "on the instructions of higher authorities." He said that "that was clear partiality in favor of Sanaa." Eyewitnesses at the airport said that the YEMDA office director confirmed to the Jordanian passport authorities that the Yemeni nationals had return tickets and had guarantees from the company for a week's stay in Jordan, but the authorities rejected that. YEMDA sources in Amman confirmed this and said that the passengers returned to Aden after being denied access to the transit area from where they could have continued their trip to Damascus. A responsible south Yemeni source has stated that the Jordanian authorities acted in that way, and also turned back Colonel Naji 'Ali Naji, director of the Yemeni defense minister's office and member of the Joint Military Committee who had arrived in Amman for treatment, but at the same time they sent six planeloads of medical aid to Sanaa, thereby indicating alignment with the northern leadership in the current conflict in Yemen.
