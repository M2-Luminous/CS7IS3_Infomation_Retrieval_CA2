Robaina said: "If it is an `America's Summit,' Cuba has earned a place there because, regardless of any different economic models, the summit will lack political plurality if we are excluded." Robaina also discussed the upcoming Ibero-American Summit, scheduled for June in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). He said Cuba hopes that "we, the American countries, will be able to meet without receiving orders from the United States." Robaina added: "Cuba hopes the Cartagena Summit will issue resolutions and not merely express intentions as in the past three summits." The upcoming Ibero-American Summit is one of the goals of the Cuban Foreign Minister's three-day official visit to Uruguay and will be a goal of the visits he will subsequently make to Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay within a "political-economical offensive" as he described it himself. The Cuban Government hopes to receive more concrete support from the Ibero-American Summit against the U.S. trade "blockade" on Cuba. The foreign minister added: "It is not necessary to ask for (Latin American) political support against the blockade because we already have it. Now this support must be translated into investments." Nevertheless, the quest for these investments during Robaina's current tour is of "a preparatory nature," without hopes for concrete results. "Until we honor our debts to these countries there will be an atmosphere that does not contribute to striking more significant relations," Robaina said. Cuba owes about $1.2 billion to Argentina and $33 million to Uruguay. The foreign minister said the Cuban Government intends to reduce these debts by delivering goods (specially medicines) and, above all, by getting the creditors to invest in Cuba. Concerning his subsequent stops, Robaina noted he already has a confirmed meeting with Argentine President Carlos Menem, a Latin American leader who has been very critical of the government system in Cuba. A meeting with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has still not been confirmed. A meeting with Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy is much more complex because there are no diplomatic relations between Paraguay and Cuba and, therefore, Robaina's visit to this country is unofficial. Robaina emphasized: "During this tour, my task involves explaining to the respective presidents the current Cuban situation, which is extremely complex. At this moment, our top priority involves finding an economic model that will allow us to integrate ourselves into today's world without giving up our political system's sacred achievements." In Montevideo, the Cuban foreign minister met President Luis Alberto Lacalle and Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu. Although his official visit ended on 6 April, Robaina will stay in Montevideo, on a private visit, until 8 April. The Uruguayan politicians did not make any remarks on the meetings, even though both of them openly expressed their government's position, favoring a democratic opening of the Cuban system that will allow its integration into Latin America by reconciling its government system with those prevailing in the rest of the continent.
