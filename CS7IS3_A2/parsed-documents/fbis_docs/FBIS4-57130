In a directive defining the guidelines for national strategies against violence, the Security Advisory Board listed nine [as published] fronts of action to fight common delinquency and organized crime. Anti-Violence The National Police, the Defense Ministry, and security organizations, under the coordination of the Prosecutor General's Office, must create and support the Specialized Homicide Brigades to be deployed in the most critical regions to promote gun control. The Armed Forces will toughen their fight against subversion by training their staff and broadening their operational capacity by means of carrying out other actions to attack the financial sources of the subversion and the groups that embrace private justice and common delinquency. In short, according to the directive, the DAS [Administrative Department of Security] will coordinate with the Prosecutor General's Office, the Finance Ministry, the Bank of the Republic, and the National Superintendency of Banks on the development of specific plans to curtail money laundering, irregular money inflows, and illegal enrichment. In due time, the government will promote campaigns asking citizens to help eradicate kidnappings. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry will adjust budget guidelines to improve the performance of the Unase [Antiextortion and Kidnapping Unit]. Justice The directive goes on. Mayors and governors must give priority to developing local security plans, which must be submitted to the National Security Council before 30 June. These officials must also prepare the Justice Development Plan, update the infringement system [regimen de contravenciones], promote the mechanisms for out-of-court conflict settlements, and cooperate in the consolidation of the Prosecutor General's Office and the legal system. Meanwhile, the National Penitentiary and Prison Institute must expedite the construction of six new prison centers and bolster the maximum security wings. Police Force The Defense Ministry must increase the presence of policemen nationwide. The goal is to increase the number of professional soldiers by 10,000 in two years and to create two new mobile brigades. Likewise, within a month, the National Police must champion the Career Statutes and conduct evaluations of the agenda of the Immediate Attention Centers (CAI) to improve their performance. The National Police commissioner, meanwhile, must restructure within two months the procedures to respond to the complaints of citizens. Intelligence According to the new presidential directive, the Defense Ministry must strengthen the channels of coordination among security agencies and upgrade communications systems to ensure that all intelligence organizations are linked within three years. Policemen, the DAS, and the Prosecutor General's Office must prepare a counterintelligence program to avert subversion and drug trafficking infiltrations and to prevent internal corruption within the State's security corps. Peace and Reintegration Those guerrilla groups that show a resolute willingness to rejoin civilian life will benefit from reintegration plans that include judicial and sociopolitical guarantees, as well as security guarantees. Only the president, through the Peace Counseling Board and the National Rehabilitarion Plan, will hold talks and negotiations with those groups who accept preestablished conditions. President Gaviria reaffirmed the validity of the reintegration plans for guerrillas to rejoin civilian life and said that mayors and governors will actively participate in the implementation of these plans to guarantee that the commitments included in the political agreements of each department will be honored. Options for Youths The Education Ministry, with the help of the private sector, will persist in promoting efforts to achieve the expansion of high school education through the creation of 600,000 new high school openings by 1995. The Labor Ministry, with the help of governors, mayors, and the Presidency, will promote the development of local, national, and regional programs to offer counseling, orientation, and training to potential entrepreneurs and job-seeking youths. Human Rights The presidency will continue to promote programs to defend human rights and democracy by conducting civic education campaigns to respect rights and their mechanisms of protection.
