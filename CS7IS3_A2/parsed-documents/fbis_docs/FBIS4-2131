He stressed: In a sense, halting deficits means maintaining stability. So, we should adopt real means to treat the problems by looking into both its root cause and symptoms, expand the dynamics of the deficit-halting work, and accelerate the pace of halting deficits. Participating in the investigation and study activities were Wang Baosen, executive vice mayor of the municipality; Duan Bingren, member of the standing committee of the municipal party committee; Li Runwu, vice mayor of the municipality; and leaders of the relevant committees, offices, bureaus, banks, and Changping County. The nonferrous metal industrial corporation is the largest money-losing enterprise of the municipal industrial front. To help the municipality's money-losing enterprises halt deficits, Chen Xitong established contacts with the nonferrous metal trade on a contracted basis and began his investigations first from Xinyue copper tube plant. On 25 March, Chen Xitong and his party inspected the workshops of the plant, held talks with the workers, and gained an understanding of the production and management situation. After that, he heard the reports by the corporation and plant leaders. [passage omitted] Chen Xitong stressed in his speech: Beijing should submit its work to and serve the overall situation of "grasping favorable opportunities, deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability" as required by the central authorities; and correctly understand and handle the relationship of reform, development, and stability. At present, the municipality has a large number of money-losing enterprises. This tendency, if continues, will affect stability. In a sense, grasping deficit-halting work means maintaining stability. We must pay high attention to this, expand the dynamics of the work, and make real measures and opinions. In halting deficits, enterprises should treat the problems by looking into both their root causes and symptoms. That is, the workers of the enterprises whose production is totally or partially suspended should have work to do. By so doing, temporary problems will be solved. This means helping meet an urgent need. Simultaneously, we should exert great efforts to enable money-losing enterprises not only to halt deficits but also to be prosperous and well developed. There must be a process of eliminating "poverty." Fundamentally speaking, we should rely on reform to halt deficits. On the premise of increasing economic results, we should first rely on markets. We should eliminate the viewpoints of planned economy, readjust structures according to market demands, popularize the reform experiences gained by the first light industrial bureau, and use the favorable opportunities of setting up the market economic system to optimize the distribution of production factors, including the optimum organization of personnel. It is also necessary to carry out various methods, including the shareholding system, the joint investment system, the system of state ownership and civilian management, and the bankruptcy method. The key to carrying out these methods is to emancipate the mind, to firmly grasp favorable opportunities, to proceed from the actual conditions of Beijing, to expand the dynamics, and to accelerate the pace. Chen Xitong also urged plant directors and secretaries of the money-losing enterprises to be inspired with enthusiasm and to unite with the broad masses of staff members and workers to spare no efforts and strive to "reduce deficits, strike a balance, make slight profits, and make development." On the premise of developing production and increasing economic results, we should increase the income of the staff and workers so that the staff and workers will have expectations and be inspired with enthusiasm. Enterprises should strengthen internal management and gain internal potential. We should positively use foreign capital and strive to enter the international market. In his speech, Wang Baosen urged overall departments to proceed from stabilizing the overall situation to positively help money-losing enterprises halt deficits and increase profits. Meanwhile, money-losing enterprises should develop products with good economic results and process the materials provided by foreign countries. Duan Bingren urged in his speech that the money-losing enterprises make good use of their limited funds, rely on their own forces, pool the wisdom and efforts of their staff and workers, and strive to tide over the difficulties.
