He reminded the meeting participants that the Ossetian-Ingush conflict alone required some 100 billion rubles in 1993. Speaking of the division of powers between the center and regions, Shakhray said his ministry is preparing a treaty with the Kaliningrad region. However, he noted equality of regions does not mean their automatic identity. Some 60 per cent of federation subjects live on allocations. "Bearing this in mind, similar treaties with Russian territories will be elaborated," he said. In the words of Shakhray, some 7,300,000,000 rubles worth of a fund will be formed to support northern areas. The money will be taken from the federal budget to help the delivery of prime necessities. A number of northern cities, including Norilsk, will be temporarily closed.
