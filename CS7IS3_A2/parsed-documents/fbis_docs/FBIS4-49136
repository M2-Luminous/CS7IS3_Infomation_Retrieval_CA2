Mr Wu, managing director of Hopewell Holdings and the recently floated Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), said his companies would look for more attractive developments in Asia. "I find a lot of places which are much greener than China," Mr Wu said. CEPA has become embroiled in a row with mainland authorities on the level of returns offered by China on foreign investments in power projects. Beijing has capped returns at 12 per cent, compared with the 18 per cent which Mr Wu said he was offered by other Asian countries. Hopewell Holdings, the construction arm of Mr Wu's business empire, is also battling on another front over the construction costs of the Boca Tigris bridge in Guangdong province. The 59-year-old businessman attacked mainland authorities at a seminar in Hong Kong earlier this week when he claimed the returns were too low by international standards. He said a realistic rate was about 18 per cent and 15 to 16 per cent was workable if the Government cut the red tape involved in setting up power projects. However, he stepped up his attack in Manila on Friday on his way to a ground-breaking ceremony for CEPA's latest power station, a US$1.6 billion (HK$12.37 billion) coal-fired operation in Pangasinan province. He said he would consider avoiding China if the issue on capped returns could not be resolved. "I don't think I can change the mind of the Chinese people and so I would say it could be better to back off," he said. He added that he was unlikely to be alone in his thinking about power developments on the mainland. CEPA was spun off from the Hopewell group earlier this year with plans to invest and develop power projects throughout Asia, but particularly in China. The group has announced plans to build several operations on the mainland. It has signed letters of intent to build power facilities in Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong and Shenzhen and has a preliminary agreement on building a power plant in Guangxi. CEPA's development in the Philippines is scheduled to be commissioned by 1996. President Fidel Ramos was at yesterday's ground-breaking ceremony and said that plans were in the pipeline for CEPA to build more power plants under the Philippines' build, operate and transfer (BOT) scheme.
