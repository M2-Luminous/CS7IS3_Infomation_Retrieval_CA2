"This move will primarily correspond to the interests of the Moslem population," he pointed out. Churkin expressed a supposition that several leaders of the Bosnian Moslems probably thought "that the airport in Tuzla will be used for military transportations. These are people who wish war but not peace." At the same time Churkin expressed the opinion that "most authoritative and serious Moslem leaders want peace and this is the reason of the visit of the premier of the Bosnian government Haris Silaidzic to Moscow on Monday. [no end quotes, as received] He underlined that Russia intends to look for a common language with the Moslem leadership. It will try to make its utmost so as interests of Bosnia's and Herzegovina's Moslem community "were taken into consideration in the course of the political settlement."
