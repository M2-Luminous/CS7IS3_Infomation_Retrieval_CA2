Political observers and journalists quickly began to compare Mr. Johnson to his controversial predecessor, Mr. Peter Mokaba, but he is a diplomat and not a fighter--the right choice to lead the youth in this time of reconciliation. Or so they say. It is easy to come to such a conclusion. Where Mr. Mokaba's speeches are full of passion and fire, Mr. Johnson is cool, calculating, and logical. But on Saturday, shortly after Mr. Johnson's inauguration at the Youth League's annual convention in Soweto, Mr. Tokyo Sexwale, the ANC district leader for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area, warned that the young lion's bite should not be underestimated. The enthusiastic singing and dancing with which the approximately 1,500 delegates greeted his inaugural address attested to his popularity among the militant youth. When you sit in his office high above Plein Street in Johannesburg, his eyes keep you riveted to your seat. He is not put off by a joke, and he does not smile during the interview. As is the case with most of the offices in Shell House, the ANC's headquarters, there is a long line of people outside his door. The furniture is sparse and Mr. Johnson's sports shirt is not suited to the warm summer day. Lulu is actually short for Mlungisi, he says. He often leans forward over his lectern when he wishes to emphasize his words. About his fiery predecessor, Johnson says: "Mokaba's bully image was created by the media. There are other leaders who make bellicose talk, but the media singled him out. Peter is a dedicated fighter for freedom and human rights. But like many other people who were leaders under apartheid, he is no stranger to rage." Johnson (29) has few pleasant memories of Keiskammahoek, the place where he was born in Ciskei: "I will always remember how a policeman forced me to strip naked so that he could search me." He had his baptism of fire during the tumultuous 1980s in the burning townships of Port Elizabeth: "In those years everything was simply consumed by the struggle. We had to fight to survive. I was born in the struggle. It is my mission to fight for freedom for all the people in this country," he says. Johnson does not like to answer the question as to whether he is a Christian, but it was his involvement in a Christian youth organization that led him to start judging the system of apartheid by the Scriptures and he rejected it. His political career then accelerated. He joined the Congress of South African Students (COSAS) in 1980 and he was the national president of that organization in 1983 (Mokaba was also a COSAS man). Shortly after COSAS was outlawed by the government in 1985, Johnson was arrested for his political activities. After his release in 1989, he found himself once again in the trenches and around December he advanced to become vice president of the ANC Youth League--the office he occupied until he was elected its president last week. What course are the ANC youth going to take? "The Youth League is a militant organization and we will always remain so. The struggle is by no means over--we will continue to fight," he said. "Until there is peace and democracy for everyone in South Africa, the youth will continue to have to defend their townships at night with AK-47 rifles. The illusion of a `lost youth' is rubbish. We were never lost--we were at the forefront of the struggle and we will always be there." He believes that the youth have a role to play in national reconstruction and development: "We cannot, however, bury the bitter fruit of 300 years of apartheid overnight; we are looking rather at a period of at least 10 years. That is why the Youth League is looking at five-year programs for reconstruction and development in all areas." COSAS' cause still remains near and dear to his heart. "Black matriculation examination results were pathetic, but the roots of the problem lie in apartheid. The education crisis is going to get worse next year--thousands of students are going to be turned away because of unfair admission requirements and because they do not have the money." Johnson rejects the rumors that the ANC leadership is afraid of its youth and is modifying its policy to appease young people. "As Youth League president I am also a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee. Our working relationship with the ANC is excellent--I can walk into Mandela's office at any time. Although we are a part of the ANC, we do not play second fiddle to it--we make our own decisions." He does foresee that the Youth League will always be a pressure group within the ANC. "It is for that reason that I am a proponent of a youth parliament that would see to the interests of youth at the highest level." And are the more militant members of the ANC Youth League attracted by the bellicose talk of the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC)? "I personally investigated the situation when those rumors began to circulate, primarily in the Vaal River Triangle and Soweto. I and my people on the scene kept a watchful eye on the situation and I do not know of any member of the Youth League who joined the PAC. Regarding the contributions of the DP [Democratic Party] and other South African and foreign organizations to the freedom struggle he says: "There are those who claim to be experts on freedom and democracy. But the same DP that now claims to be a champion of democracy regarded the ANC's freedom fighters as terrorists until recently. P.W. Botha and Van Zyl Slabbert were in collusion." This young lion has a warning for right-wingers: "Those organizations that are pursuing only violence should be aware that time is running out for them. They had better not come looking for rapprochement at the last minute." But, after all, the olive branch is there as well. "Even then we will be ready to accept them. We offer a home for youth across the entire political spectrum. We fight for peace and democracy for all South Africans." Sexwale said at Johnson's inauguration that he spoke like a future president. Perhaps he is right. After all, Nelson Mandela had his baptism of fire decades ago as the leader of the ANC Youth League.
