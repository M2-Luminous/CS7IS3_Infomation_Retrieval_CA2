FR940505-1-00105 FR940505-1-00012 Nonroad engines and equipment are generally not registered or licensed by a state, with the exception of recreational boats. This fact makes it difficult to administer and enforce a rule for equipment that is different in California (or even in some areas of California) than it is in the rest of the country. But if these subcategories are to contribute their share to the attainment plan (and their share can be quite large as all other types of mobile sources are tightly controlled), then EPA must consider going beyond national standards, fashioning a plan which assures that equipment used in the FIP areas meets tighter standards, and that equipment purchased outside the control area cannot be used to avoid the cost of control. That is what the FIP proposal attempts to do for nonroad heavy duty engines. A fleet-average standard with a declining emission level which reflects the historical number of new engine purchases and old engine retirements, similar in concept to that for on-highway heavy duty engines, is proposed. Operation of heavy equipment in the FIP areas will be prohibited if the equipment is not part of a registered fleet. Nonroad equipment owners may pool their fleets to facilitate compliance, just as with highway fleets. An equipment labeling system is proposed to allow enforcement by EPA. (b) Small Nonroad Equipment (spark ignited engines at or below 25 horsepower, 19kW). Since March 1992, EPA has held several public workshops and meetings to solicit information on technical characteristics, emissions, potential regulatory strategies, and other issues related to small spark ignition engines. The Agency believes that the best approach for setting emission standards in this category will be a consultative approach of negotiated rulemaking often called ``reg neg.'' But there is also a sense of urgency about the need for areas to benefit from the reductions in emissions that will result from standards in this category. The result is that EPA will be pursuing a two phased approach to regulation of small spark ignition engines. In the first phase, EPA will propose regulations through the normal regulatory process. These regulations will be similar to California's regulation for 1995 and later utility and lawn and garden equipment engines. EPA's proposal will extend the regulations in California to engines which California is currently pre-empted from regulating. The second phase of regulation will utilize the reg neg process to develop consensus on important issues, such as useful life, in-use emissions, evaporative emissions, test procedures, and market based incentive programs. EPA believes that Phase 1 standards will result in a 40 percent reduction in the HC inventory from small engines. Phase 2 will achieve a 90 percent reduction in HC inventory from this category. The agency expects that achieving a 90 percent reduction would not depend solely on more stringent exhaust emission standards, but rather on a combination of strategies (e.g., scrappage or other programs to accelerate turnover, fuel requirements , and/or evaporative controls). EPA's Phase 2 rulemaking is intended to apply nationally in approximately 2000 to 2001. If the Agency's phase 2 program does not come out of the reg neg process providing for a 90 percent reduction in HC, then EPA has committed to propose those more-stringent measures applicable to California, either statewide or in the FIP areas, which are necessary to the overall attainment strategy. The federal rules are expected to explicitly exclude spark ignition marine engines, engines used in underground mining, motorcycle engines, aircraft engines, and those used in recreational vehicles which will be covered elsewhere. (c) Motorcycles and Recreational Vehicles. EPA believes that by using existing on-highway motorcycle technology, it is possible to reduce the contribution of nonroad motorcycles and recreational vehicles to the HC and NO X emission levels in the FIP areas. Therefore, it is proposing to treat on-highway and nonroad motorcycles in California equally and to apply a more stringent set of exhaust emission standards to all new on-highway and nonroad motorcycles sold in California after January 1996. This proposal encompasses engines used in such vehicles as mopeds, dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles (ATVs), and go-karts. The standards are being proposed statewide, because EPA believes that that is necessary to assure that the equipment used in the FIP areas meets standards. The level of stringency may require the substitution of 4-stroke nonroad engines for the 2-stroke engines currently used in some nonroad applications, but there is also the prospect that catalyst technology may be viable. (d) Spark-Ignition Marine Propulsion Engines. Reductions from this subcategory of nonroad equipment will come from a national program of emission standards and from a registering/permitting fee system for operation in FIP-area waters. The national regulation, scheduled to be final by November 1995, will reduce emissions from outboard engines, personal watercraft (jet-skis, etc.), sterndrive engines, and inboard engines through application of new engine emission standards. The standards themselves are not being proposed in the FIP, but will be proposed in September 1994. Reductions in per-engine emissions are expected to be on the order of 70&hyph;80 percent from current two-stroke outboard and personal watercraft engines, and up to 30&hyph;50 percent from current 4-stroke carbureted sterndrive and inboard engines. The standards will apply to new spark ignition marine propulsion engines produced after August 1, 1998. Certification procedures will be similar to on-highway procedures, with some modifications appropriate for the ways these engines are used. The program may also include features such as assembly-line testing and recall. Although these national standards will result in substantial emission reductions per new engine, overall reductions in emissions from this category will depend on how much boating activity uses the newer, cleaner engines, and how much activity uses older engines. EPA expects that approximately one half of the total fleet of marine pleasure craft owned by FIP-area residents will meet the standard by the year 2005. However, equal use of old and new engines, in combination with other available measures to reduce VOCs, does not appear to be enough to meet the goals of the FIP. Therefore, EPA is also proposing a permit based fee system for marine engines produced before the new standards take effect, to strongly discourage use of these very high emitting engines in the FIP areas. The fees for emission permits would be based on the average excess emissions of pre-control engines compared to engines meeting the new emission standards. This fee system would take effect in 2004, and would apply to only operators of marine pleasure craft who wished to operate a boat in the FIP areas. Owners who live in the FIP areas but only use their boats elsewhere would not be affected. Owners of boats meeting the new emission standards would be eligible for emission permits free of charge. (5) Programs for National Transportation Sources and Federal Activities. The litigation which resulted in today's FIP proposal arose at least in part from a feeling in California that the emission regulation of certain sources was not keeping pace with the attainment needs of California areas or with the stringency of control imposed on other sectors of the California economy. For today's FIP proposal, EPA is proposing controls for these sources which include the following provisions:
