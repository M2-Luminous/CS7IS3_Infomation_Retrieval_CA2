FBIS4-24859 "drchi107_a_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General DPRK Refutes IAEA Report on Refueling Operations DPRK Refutes IAEA Report on Refueling Operations OW0306054394 Beijing XINHUA in English 0456 GMT 3 Jun 94 OW0306054394 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Pyongyang today refuted a report made by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the discharge of spent fuel from a nuclear power reactor has now made it impossible to select fuel rods for later measurements. A spokesman for the General Department of the Atomic Energy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said the operation to discharge the spent fuel in the five megawatt nuclear power reactor started from early may for technical or safety reasons, the NODONG SINMUN reported today. The whole process is under strict containment and surveillance by the IAEA which installed four monitoring cameras, he said. "Our core refueling operations are being done in such a manner to maintain the ability to take measurements later," the spokesman was quoted as saying by the KCNA NEWS AGENCY. He described claims that those later measurements will be very difficult as an attempt to internationalize and politicize a technical issue to pursue a "sinister political purpose." "If some officials of the agency secretariat declare that the technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods has been lost, we have to take a decisive countermeasure," he said. The spokesman urged the IAEA secretariat to return to a fair position that is conducive to the settlement of the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula.
