Chernomyrdin promised them to take into account all their requirements concerning the social and economic situation in Siberia when finalising the federal budget for 1994, the main parameters of which will be made public in the Russian president's message to parliament on February 18. The premier said that the draft provides for a big federal budget deficit which, in his opinion, was caused above all by the continued industrial slump in Russia. To prevent the acceleration of the slump and inflation, Chernomyrdin said that it was necessary to conclude an agreement between producers, trade unions and consumers on fixing prices, tariffs and wages. The premier sees a non-monetary approach of pulling the country out of the crisis in such an agreement. Representatives of Siberian unions and workers squarely put the question of settling, at long last, the problems of debts to enterprises, timely payments of wages to civil servants, legislative guarantees of the general tariff agreement, changes of the taxation system in the country and payments of debts to peasants. The prime minister promised that all proposals on state financing will be undoubtedly taken into account when finalising the federal budget for 1994. As for debts for agricultural products purchased by the state from peasants last autumn, totalling some 1,000 billion roubles, payments will start literally in the next few days, the premier assured. At the same time, he warned that the state will not fully pay all debts at once. The prime minister stressed that the government intends, in future too, to take utmost efforts for social maintenance of poor segments of population and civil servants as well as to examine closely possibilities of creating new jobs. He also spoke against holding strikes at this difficult time for the country.
