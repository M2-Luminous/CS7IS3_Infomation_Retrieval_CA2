Three thousand soldiers supported by a counterinsurgency brigade will try to put a stop to the bloody wave of violence in the region. What is to guarantee its future operational success in the wake of the fissures in the peace accords among the political forces and following the assassination of several dozen activists of Hope, Peace and Liberty, and other leftist leaders? What does the Armed Forces know aside from what the parties involved in the dispute have said? EL TIEMPO has exclusive information about a classified intelligence report on the incipient alliance between insurgents of the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Popular Liberation Army (EPL) dissidents against those who have demobilized. Military officials believe they have reliable evidence that FARC guerrillas have forged their first alliance with the criminals of the "Bernardo Franco" Front, part of Francisco Caraballo's group which is a violent dissident faction of the EPL. According to the Armed Forces' information, the insurgents of the 5th and 34th Fronts have begun to support members of the "Bernardo Franco" Front with training, supplies, loans, and arms sales. Although they have not carried out any joint actions, it is feared that the alliance could increase the number of victims of the political control of the zone. The classified report reveals, for example, that in one of the largest guerrilla camps in Uraba, located in the El Porroso area in Mutata municipality (Antioquia Department), there are units of the "Bernardo Franco" Front and close to 250 guerrillas of the two FARC fronts. According to military officials, the first step toward an "alliance" was the agreement reached in July 1992 between the FARC's 5th Front and David Meza Pena, "Gonzalo." Meza obtained the help of the FARC in a kind of guerrilla "boarding school" for the EPL's nascent dissident group. According to the report, there are 710 armed guerrillas in Uraba. The militias, for their part, have grown substantially in the last year. According to the report, close to 800 men belong to the FARC's Bolivarian Milita, which operates in Apartado, Chigorodo, Mutata, and Carepa Municipalities. The two FARC Fronts and the incipient "Bernando Franco" Front are trying to divide into at least five or six fronts. Those fronts have the mission of opening political space and, according to military officials, obtaining control of the region's largest union: Sintrainagro [Banana Worker's Union]. This is what has led to the systematic assassination of members of Hope, Peace and Liberty. The following groups currently operate in the region. The 5th Front The history of the struggle for political control is not new. In fact, beginning in April 1971, the FARC secretariat decided to bring to Uraba a group of insurgents who later became the 5th Front. Now 22 years later, that front is a kind of "parent" front in the region and has 350 combatants. Its area of influence comprises Murindo, Apartado, Chigorodo, Carepa, Turbo, Necocli, and San Pedro de Uraba Municipalities. Up until April 1993 the front was under the command of Efrain Guzman, "El Chucho," who was transferred, following the 8th conference of the FARC, to the FARC secretariat, where he is now in charge of coordinating the bloc of the FARC's northeastern front. The 5th Front is under the command of Noel Mata Mata. According to the classified report, it consists of a general staff, a company charged with security for the general staff, and four combat companies. The main camp is in Porroso (Mutata). According to intelligence information, the guerrillas of that front have been setting up camps and schools in Los Tocales, Rosali Arriba, Puerto Galleta, El Porroso, and Tamarindo. The 34th Front This front operates with 200 men organized into three "companies": Cacique Nutibara, Cacique Tone, and the Chanburay Indian Group. Each one has several companies operating in the region. Since 1987, in view of the excessive growth of the 5th Front, the FARC secretariat decided to organize the 34th Front. But it was not until mid-1991 that the presence of this criminal group was felt in the region. Security organizations know with certainty that this front is less belligerent than the 5th. However, it was the insurgents of the 34th who attacked a military patrol several months ago in Mutata and killed three soldiers of the Army. Intelligent reports say that the 34th Front was exclusively in charge of the trafficking of arms and contraband along the border, as well as extorting tourist businesses in the Capurgana region. At the same time, they add, one of the 34th Front's principal sources of financing is drug trafficking. According to Armed Forces' reports the front maintains 1,200 hectares of coca plantations. The crops in the Acandi and Zapzurro zones belong to the guerrillas. According to military officials, the desire for the money generated by these crops has been a decisive factor in the growth of the front. The commander of this front, also known as Comision Alberto Martinez, is Luis Uzuga Restrepo, "Isaias Trujillo," or Jose Salvador Galan Rodriguez. Trujillo maintains control over the Acandi, Unguia, Riosucio, Rioneca, and Balboa Municipalities, as well as the entire border with Panama. The guerrillas' presence in Dabeiba, Frontino, and Uramita Municipalities leads intelligence organizations to believe that the FARC is trying to split the 34th Front and that a new one, called "Mariscal Sucre," has already begun to form. This front, according to the report, would have the same basic mission of distracting the authorities' attention in order to continue with its drug-trafficking activities in Acandi and Zapzurro municipalities. EPL Dissidents They were a group of 25 men. They had two missions: to revitalize the EPL and to eliminate their former comrades who decided to lay down their arms at the beginning of 1991. Now there are 160 guerrillas. They do not call themselves the EPL, but the "Bernardo Franco" Front. And according to President Cesar Gaviria himself, they are responsible for the majority of assassinations of members of Hope, Peace, and Liberty. This front has five combat commissions, a "support commission," and local guerrillas (similar to the the FARC Bolivarian Militias) in the municipalities under its influence. The commanders of the commissions are David Mesa Pena, "Gonzalo"; Efren Vargas Gutierrez, "Gavilan"; Juan Alvarez Pastrana, "Rodrigo," and Orlando Vergara. But the group's recruitment efforts continue. According to the report, its members are trying to form various "guerrilla fronts" each comprising five commissions. Since the beginning, it has carried out its criminal activities in El Tres, El Dos, Turbo, San Vincente del Congo, Pueblo Bello, San Jose de Bulatos, and Pueblo Nuevo. The front's influence extends to Arboletes, Necocli, Apartado, Chigorodo, and Carepa municipalities. The military officials attribute the strengthening of the "Bernardo Franco" Front to its capacity for recruiting into its guerrilla ranks inhabitants of the region who have families there and who have a very good knowledge of the terrain in which they operate. According to the officials, the families' houses serve as hiding places for arms and guerrillas. In addition, they obtain information about the movements of the security forces and its enemies, the members of Hope, Peace, and Liberty.
