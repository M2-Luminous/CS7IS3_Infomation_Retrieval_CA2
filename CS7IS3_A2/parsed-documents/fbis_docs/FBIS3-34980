The most important outcome of his visit was the signing of a defense agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Aliyev said that an agreement will also be signed on the laying of a pipeline between the two countries to transport Azerbaijan's oil to the Mediterranean Sea. President Suleyman Demirel responded by saying that Turkey will support Azerbaijan in its war with Armenia. However, he stressed that Turkey is not obliged to give direct military support to Azerbaijan within the framework of the defense agreement between the two countries. It seems that the officials of the two sides are making an effort to reactivate relations between Baku and Ankara, which have been damaged by a chilled atmosphere for some time. It will be recalled that the ousting of former President Ebulfaz Elchibey, who was known to have close relations with Ankara, caused a significant setback in relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, Turkey's approach to the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia and its failure to give the necessary financial support to Baku at the time weakened relations between the two sides and caused dissatisfaction in Azerbaijan. Undoubtedly, similar developments weakened diplomatic contacts between Baku and Ankara in 1993. Considering Ankara's long-standing Pan-Turkic approach and the strategic importance of the Caucasus, that state of affairs caused anxiety in the Western countries, which planned to influence the republics in the region through Turkey and the Turkish Government. Meanwhile, Moscow's disclosure that it regards Central Asia and the Caucasus as a security zone for Russia worried the Turkish Government. In view of that, Turkey made several initiatives to improve its relations with the Baku Government and dispel the dark clouds between the two countries. In fact, it made an effort to persuade Baku to maintain a policy in Ankara's favor by promising political and economic aid to Azerbaijan. Several news agencies have reported that Ankara informed Baku a few hours before Aliyev arrived in Turkey that it will give a credit of $15 billion to the Azerbaijani Government, construct a center for foreign diplomats in Baku, and help Azerbaijan open diplomatic missions in foreign countries. Meanwhile, Baku has planned to improve its relations with Ankara and use its close links to the Western countries to create a favorable atmosphere for the resolution of the dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Nevertheless, several observers are convinced that Moscow can condone the improvement of relations between Ankara and Baku as long as they do not pose a threat to Russia's interests.
