If a new parliament confirms its decision on holding elections and gives them legal force, then the president will determine his attitude to the elections, INTERFAX-UKRAINE was told Monday by the head of the presidential service responsible for internal policy, Nikolai Mikhalchenko. On Saturday, the president said that he intended to request that the new parliament give its opinion on presidential and local elections. Kravchuk also said that he still believed that presidential elections in Ukraine on 26 June were premature. Speaking about his attitude to the presidential elections, he said "I shall not agree to holding elections until they are backed by our Constitution and laws." In January, President Kravchuk said that he did not intend to take part in the presidential elections on 26 June. In later statements he did not change his point of view. Mikhalchenko said that the organizations which nominated Kravchuk as candidate for presidency may collect signatures without waiting for his final decision on standing for election. According to Ukrainian electoral law, the nomination begins 90 days before the elections and ends 60 days before. A candidate may be nominated by a party at a congress or by an assembly of 500 voters. The nominee may be registered if he collects 50,000 signatures, including at least a thousand from each of two-thirds of the total number of constituencies.
