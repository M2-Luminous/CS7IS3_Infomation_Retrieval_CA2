NODONG SINMUN says that the proclamation of the programme by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 20 years ago was a historical event which opened the road of a revolutionary turn in the building of the Workers' Party of Korea and in the struggle of the popular masses for socialism. The paper quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying: "Our revolution has greeted a new upsurge under the guidance of Comrade Kim Chong-il. It was since the start of his guidance that a new turn began to take place not only in the party work but also in the work of the political, economic and cultural domains and great innovations and upsurge have been effected in all the fields of socialist construction." The paper says: The 20 years since the proclamation of the programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea have been decades of gigantic creation and construction in which all the spheres of social life have been thoroughly transformed our own way, with a tight grasp on the idea and theory of the dear leader as the lifeline of the Korean revolution, decades of a proud struggle and victory in resolutely defending and glorifying socialism, determinedly smashing all challenges and obstructions of the imperialists and the reactionaries. In the course of the efforts to implement this programme, our party's revolutionary line of independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence has been strictly applied in all domains of the state activities and social life and Korean-style socialism has been strengthened and developed into the most solid and viable socialism remaining unshaken in any storm. And it must be noted that in the struggle to imbue the whole army with the chuche idea, the Korean People's Army has been built up into combat ranks of a-match-for-a-hundred soldiers ready to devote their youth and lives for the party and the leader, into invincible army equipped with modern means of attack and defence of our style. This is a proud success defying comparison. The Korean people have been able to effect changes of the century in all sectors of the revolution and construction under the slogan of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea and they owe all this to the wise guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. All the party members and other working people should hegard it as their first and foremost task to arm themselves firmly with the idea and theories of the dear leader, the basis of our singlehearted unity, and should resolutely defend and glorify the leadership exploits of our party through the application of the chuche idea. MINJU CHOSON calls upon all the officials and working people to increase the might of our motherland in every way and carry to accomplishment the revolutionary cause of chuche started in the secret forest of Paektu by more resolutely fighting in singlehearted unity around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, deeply cherishing the great national honour and happiness in living and making revolution under the leadership of the illustrious leader.
