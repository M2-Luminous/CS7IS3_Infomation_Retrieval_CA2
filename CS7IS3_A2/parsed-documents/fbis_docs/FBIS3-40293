Their development, on the basis of the concepts of the capitalist market economy, will be priorities for the economic development of the country, without denying the positive role played by trade and construction. Now, at the conclusion of the second year of democratic government, it is very significant that these three fields of economic development have registered increases. Statistics are more eloquent that any propaganda of orators, since they do not allow you to depart from reality and they clearly show the development of Albania on the basis of the program of the Albanian Democratic Party. The Voice of Progress From the Subsoil The figures are higher at the end of this year, compared to 1992, for all the mines and the processing industry. For example, compared to the same period in 1992, the Chrome Corporation had, for the 10-month period, some 1,939,455,000 leks' worth of goods sold, or 617,758,000 more than in 1992 -- a 147 percent increase. Before the end of the year, the Copper Corporation had 1,295,822,000 leks' worth of goods sold, or 167,643,000 leks more than last year -- a 115 percent increase. The work continues without interruption. The Petroleum Corporation had 6,386,541,000 leks' worth of petroleum sold for the period from January to the end of October 1993, 2,082,745,000 more than in 1992 -- a 148 percent increase. Elektro-Energjetika is coming into the new year with 735,521,000 more leks' worth of product sold than in the first year of the democratic government. The demarcation line between the communist hell and the free and rich life is 22 March 1992. [passage omitted] In 1993, 24,889 more metric tons of petroleum, 7,882 more tons of gas, 13 tons, or 117 percent more lubricating oil, and 13,162 more tons, or 126 percent more distilled fuel oil were processed than in 1992. Other petroleum subproducts such as petroleum pitch and petroleum coke also registered increases of 6,544 tons and 7,895 tons, respectively. This has been a good year for the chrome mines, which are the treasures of the Albanian subsoil, along with the petroleum and copper resources. Some 5,156 more tons of 41.6 percent enriched chrome and 11,356 more tons of carbonic ferrochrome were produced in 1993 than in 1992. And what about the copper mines? Some 6,141 more tons of concentrate, 426 more tons of blister copper, and 204.2 more tons of copper wire and cables than in 1992. There was also an increase in the production of electric power, caustic soda, glass products, fabrics, knitted goods, clothing, plastic products, and so forth. New Investments of the Democratic Government In the area of investments, the team of the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources, headed by Abdyl Xhaja, worked in accordance with the program and the economic platform of the democratic government. Thus, in the sectors covered by this ministry, some 432.3 million of the planned 562.7 million leks were invested in only nine months. Some 116.8 million leks were invested in oil drilling and prospecting and we have 101.8 million leks for geological prospecting. [passage omitted] During the year, considerable investment funds were devoted to the construction of roads connecting the mines to residential centers, cities, and villages. Some 32.7 leks were invested for more than 12 segments of roads, 103 percent more than in 1992. About 28.2 million leks, more than the planned amount, have been invested for the modernization of some wells and other annexes in the main mines of the country, for the purpose of increasing production and creating new work places. New Work Places Are Being Created For the mineral processing and mining industry, the year 1993 saw an increase in the creation of new work places, although not to the extent which is possible for this priority field of our economy. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that more people got jobs in the industry in 1993 than in 1992. As of 1993, about 103,507 people are employed in enterprises of the mining industry, including the budgetary and nonbudgetary sector. In addition to the wage fund of 2,802,038,000 leks, the democratic state has given these workers an additional 570,897,000 leks in compensation, for the purpose of relieving and alleviating the social problems which are a natural result of the implementation of economic reform.
