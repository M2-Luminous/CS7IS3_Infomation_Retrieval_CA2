He said in his statement that Russian State Duma had issued an amnesty for all the defendants in the case of 1991 August coup attempt while there was more and more evidence that the former president of the USSR had himself participated in the coup. It is an internal affair of C.I.S. but the amnesty does not touch Lithuania which restored its independence in March 11, 1990 after a half-century of Soviet annexation. Actions of Soviet putchists in 1991 in Lithuania will be further treated here as international crimes and rude violation of Lithuanian law, the statement said.
