Deinekin made these comments on 22 March in an interview with EL MERCURIO during which he also referred to the visit of a large Russian delegation to FIDAE 94 [International Aerospace Fair] and his country's offer to train a Chilean cosmonaut. Asked about the recent NATO threat to the Serbs surrounding Sarajevo (former Yugoslavia) to use airplanes to bomb them if they do not hand over their weapons to the United Nations, Deinekin categorically rejected such a possibility. He explained that he has been saying for a long time that an air attack on the area is inappropriate, because aviation is not the way to face the type of civil war taking place in that part of Europe. He said: "This is why the Russian Air Force is categorically against any type of bombing, by Croats, Serbs, Muslims, or anybody. It is categorically against it." He added that the soldiers would survive a bombing because they are trained for it, and only the common people would be killed. He said that to start the type of attack threatened by NATO, certain basic and essential requirements should be fulfilled. He said: "All civilians -- old people, women, and children -- would have to be evacuated first before the bombings. Only then should an attack against military targets be made." Otherwise, he said, there will be too much bloodshed, and no one can be forgiven. He added: "There should be no more bloodshed. I hope peace will prevail in the world." He also said: "The Russian Air Force is very concerned about the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and there is also no doubt that the Russian Air Force is at peace." Deinekin is carrying out a six-day visit to Chile as part of FIDAE 94. Gen. Deinekin emphasized the Russian presence at FIDAE with the participation of the best Russian experts and advanced fighting weapons. He said: "This place offers us excellent possibilities to establish contacts with different groups." He added that this type of fair shows the progress of aviation that can really contribute to the progress of people. He also reiterated the Russian Government's offer to train a Chilean cosmonaut. Deinekin indicated that the Russian presence at FIDAE was not only aimed at showing its advanced combat systems but at ratifying its country's intention for real technological exchange.
