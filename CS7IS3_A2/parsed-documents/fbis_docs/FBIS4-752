The mediation committee notes that the authorities of the Third Republic -- the state president, the speaker of the National Assembly, and the prime minister -- support and encourage the mediation efforts being undertaken by these two associations, and that the parliamentary opposition has shown its willingness for dialogue and equally endorses the initiative of the two associations. Consequently, the mediation committee notes with satisfaction the desire for openness and dialogue exhibited on both sides, and strongly urges the two parties to refrain from any act or acts that could compromise national unity, peace, social harmony, democracy, or the Republic. At this juncture, the committee earnestly calls on the opposition to set aside any initiatives which could lead to strikes and civil disobedience, and to refrain from any statements likely to thwart the ongoing negotiations. The mediation committee counts on the two parties' sense of responsibility, wisdom, moderation, and their commitment to the creative values of civilization -- which constitute one of the basic hallmarks of our people -- in order to preserve unity and brotherhood among all Nigerois, to ensure economic well-being and progress, and to guarantee as well as safeguard democracy, peace, and social harmony in our country.
