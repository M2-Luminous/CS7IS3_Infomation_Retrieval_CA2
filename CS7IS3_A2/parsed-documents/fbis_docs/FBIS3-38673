Speaking at a conference on security policy in Munich today, Ruehe called for "rapid changes" in financial conditions for the troops. At the same time, the defense minister announced the establishment of "crisis reaction forces" [Krisenreactionskraefte]. The Bundeswehr is in a position to fulfill its mandate with regard to domestic defense, he said. However, the troops are not yet capable of taking part in measures involving "international crisis management." To this end, a flexible, adaptable, assertive unit would have to be set up to cover missions under UN auspices, Ruehe said. In particular, this includes "extensive mobility for the transfer of forces."
