Yin, speaking by telephone, said he had been advised of the decision on Thursday, three days ahead of the screening of his own film, "The History of Xinghua," in the French Mediterranean resort. "The producers and the two leading actors of my film were also informed that their exit visas from China had been refused," he said. Yin, 36, said he felt victimised by a decision that had affected another film-maker, Zhang Yimou, who made "To Live." "He's the one who's sick, and I'm the one getting the treatment," he said. The bar on Yin, which was initially reported in Cannes Thursday, came after Zhang announced that he would not attend the Cannes premiere of "To Live." "Because my film ... has still not received its censors' visa in China, I am unable to come to the Cannes festival. I regret this very much," a statement released by Zhang in Cannes said. Zhang is director of the 1991 hit "Raise the Red Lantern." "To Live" tells the story of three generations of a family living through the China of the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. "The Story of Xinghua," filmed in northern China last year, won approval for screening abroad from the Chinese censorship board. The movie recounts the story of a grocer who makes a fortune selling stones stolen from the Great Wall, but succumbs to a tragic death in a treasure hunt under the wall.
