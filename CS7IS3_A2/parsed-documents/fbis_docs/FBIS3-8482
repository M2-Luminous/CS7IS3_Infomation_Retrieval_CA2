As for the Greek demands of changes in the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Constitution and its flag, he stressed he "had never given nor can now give promises" for possible changes by Macedonia, but these issues can be discussed in an effort to seek compromises. But, he said, no negotiating is possible in conditions of embargoes and preconditions. In reference to the "Greek-Serbian" axis, Papoulias' visit to Belgrade, and the embargo that followed afterward, President Gligorov said he considers mutual relations between the Balkan countries to be their internal affairs. It is only important to accept Macedonia as an independent and sovereign state, whose existence is a condition for peace and stability in the Balkans. President Gligorov does not believe that additional troops in Macedonia, whether Russian or from any other country, are necessary. He said present UN peace-keeping forces are sufficient. Asked on the latest radicalization of the Serbian party in Macedonia, Gligorov stated he does not expect any border incidents (although they are not completely excluded as long as the war is on), because Serbs in Macedonia are given all possible rights. "I would be happy to see such rights for the Macedonians in Serbia," he added. Gligorov said the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] split is a "normal process in a democratic state." The worst possible solution would be forming ghettos of any nationality. It is another issue what forces and what party option will come out as a winner. Asked on Bulgarians in Macedonia, Gligorov said they have been given the opportunity to self-declare themselves in previous consensus. The East-West corridor is a "priority matter" for the Macedonian president. Mr. Gligorov said he is personal friend with the Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and said Mr. Zhelev is a man of wide democratic views close to his own.
