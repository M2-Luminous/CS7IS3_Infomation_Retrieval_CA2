This has made people doubt the standards of China's civil aviation industry and even lose their confidence. The foreign press even rated China's aviation industry as the least safe. In fact, the Civil Aviation Administration of China really has something debatable in terms of flight safety, keeping flights on schedule, and services. -- There were frequent aviation accidents in the past few years. The number of accidents even increased in 1992 and 1993. In nearly four months from 31 July to 24 November 1992, five major aviation accidents occurred in Nanjing, Guilin and other localities causing 309 deaths and five passenger planes and helicopters damaged. Another four accidents took place in 1993, causing deaths. The number of accidents and deaths in China's civil aviation industry is alarming. According to statistics, 25 accidents occurred during scheduled flights in the world causing 990 deaths in 1992, while the number of deaths during accidents of Chinese air carriers accounted for one-third of the total number of deaths caused by international carriers in the world in that year. If a Chinese air carrier has an accident, the reason for such an accident is very seldom made public, stirring up a great deal of doubts among the people. Although we should not blame the flight crews of China's aviation industry for all the accidents, the people's worries about the quality of these crew members are not entirely groundless. An official of the department of airworthiness under the State Administration of Civil Aviation said: "The guerrilla sentiments of some civil aviation flight crews is incompatible with the scientific management procedure. They are used to do things by relying on their experience instead of acting with a scientific approach." In addition, the emergence of various regional airlines has also brought many new problems to the management and safety of China's civil aviation industry. According to a survey, three of the crashes in 1992 involved air carriers of China's new airlines. -- Incidents of hijacking air carriers continuously occurred. As of 26 November, there were eight cases of air carrier hijacking in 1993. Among the eight cases, seven air carriers were hijacked and flown to Taiwan, while in one particular case, hijackers were later subdued on an Air Eastern passenger plane on 26 November when the plane was seized and on its way to Taiwan. Due to the large number of casualties on the air carriers when attempts to thwart hijacking failed in the past several years, we have always adopted the attitude of attaching great importance to safety of passengers and air carriers. Therefore, we do not desperately try to thwart hijacking. Meantime, we have repeatedly asked the Taiwan authorities to repatriate all hijackers back to the mainland so that we can subject them to severe punishment in order to attain the goal of executing one as a warning to a hundred. -- Not many of China's air carriers depart or arrive on time. According to statistics, 225 flights were delayed in 1991. The number of flights delayed rose to 1,319 in 1992 in which 86 percent of all flights by Chinese carriers departed and arrived on time, close to the international average. This percentage declined to 81.9 during the first half of 1993, a drop of 10.2 percent as compared with the same period in 1992. The civil aviation industry on the Mainland often gives no explanation for its schedule delay. Nor does it offer any compensation for the time loss, making the passengers unhappy. The schedule delay has also drawn criticism from the media at home and abroad. However, due to the fact that China's civil aviation industry has a tremendous backlog in construction and it is hard to come up with good measures to correct their outmoded practices. According to an analysis conducted by a official of the Civil Aviation Administration, China's air traffic control system, the system of flight detours and that of holding planes in the air have caused serious wastes and greatly affected the arrival and departure of scheduled flights on time. Right now, the civil aviation industry in foreign countries has generally used II-ILS [instrumental landing system], but none of the airports on the Mainland has met the II-ILS standard. Therefore, takeoffs and landings are often delayed whenever the weather is abnormal. Not long ago, heavy snow hit Beijing. Even after the snow stopped and the airport was open to traffic our reporter's flight schedule was still delayed for 10 hours. It was said that the pilot refused to take the risk of taking off under such weather conditions. -- Poor service. In addition to the quality of flight stewards and stewardesses, the poor service of China's civil aviation industry is closely connected with the shortage of flight crews. There are 13,000 flight crew members for China's civil aviation industry with an average of 30 members for each plane. According to statistics compiled by the FAA of the United States in May 1992, there were a total of 6,083 planes run by various U.S. airlines, and the number of flight crews reached 400,000 in 1900 [as received] with an average of 66 crew members for each plane. Therefore, while we criticize China's civil aviation industry for the poor service and indifference of the service personnel, we have found, after a specific analysis, that most of the flight crews for China's civil aviation industry work many extra shifts and are extremely tired. There was such a saying in China's civil aviation industry on the Mainland. A Civil Aviation Bureau official was once on an inspection tour of an airline service. He asked a stewardess a question: "Why don't you smile while working in the passenger plane?" "I cannot smile. I work overtime everyday. I am so tired that I want to cry," replied the stewardess. The aforementioned contradictions have greatly damaged China's civil aviation industry's reputation at home and abroad. Jiang Zhuping, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, believes that in addition to the poor infrastructural facilities, lack of professionally trained people and some of the rules and regulations pending further improvement, an outstanding problem is the lax administration. Right now, it is of great urgency to strengthen administration in China's civil aviation industry, he said. To ensure the safety of the civil aviation system and improve service, the related units in China have repeatedly issued circulars and worked out measures to ensure civil aviation safety. In early 1993, the State Council approved and distributed the "Circular on Proposals Concerning Civil Aviation Safety." Not long ago, Jiang Zhuping, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, once again emphatically pointed out the need to develop civil aviation transportation in a safe and coordinated way. He said that to strengthen macro-control in China's civil aviation industry, the central task is to resolve the issue of structural imbalance caused by over-expansion. If there are too many air carriers, they would disperse productivity and lower the scale merit. Unreasonable and improper competition between different air carriers would adversely affect their stable development. Therefore, in purchasing more passenger planes, we must take into consideration the operational and maintenance capabilities and ensure that the ground facilities are able to cope with the additional planes. Meanwhile, we must make proper arrangements to adjust the flight schedules. Right now, the Civil Aviation Administration of China has temporarily stopped to accept applications for the establishment of any new airline. He also emphatically pointed out: "From now on, those who seek to buy or rent planes will have to go through a strict procedure according to the regulation, and we will strengthen the control over the purchase and rental of airplanes. We will also set up a network of training centers to strengthen the training of flight attendants to help them improve their services. We have imported a batch of sophisticated navigational equipment, and established the Beijing Flight Attendants Training Center and the Zhuhai Flight Simulator Training Center to improve the technical and management skills in China's civil aviation industry. Low Starting Point, Large Rate of Growth The speed in the development of China's civil aviation industry in recent years is eye-catching. An official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, named Liu pointed out: There are 38 air carriers in China right now, including 25 regional ones and 13 air carriers under the direct administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China. China has more than 600 civil aviation planes of all types, offering a total of 47,267 seats. As of the early 1993, the Civil Aviation Administration of China opened up 563 domestic and international air routes including 492 domestic air routes and serving 110 cities. There are 58 international air routes serving 53 cities. There are 13 regional air routes. Additional 35 domestic air routes will be added between the spring of 1993 and that of 1994. China's civil aviation industry was placed under the control of the Chinese Air Force prior to 1980. Only after 1980, it was placed under the leadership of the State Council and under the administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China. There are six regional civil aviation administrations. This is the first major change in the civil aviation administrative system in China. Another reform took place from April 1987 in the civil aviation administrative system on the Mainland. The State Council approved the plan for the reform of the civil aviation administrative system. Its basic train of thought is that as government organizations, the Civil Aviation Administration of China and its regional branches play a supervisory and administrative role. The flight operation, transportation, service and other production units form various air carriers. They and the airports become economic entities which manage their own affairs with an independent accounting system for each department or air carrier. Airports in various districts have also become independent. In order to cope with this situation, six regional civil aviation administrations have been set up to perform official functions. In 1993, China's civil aviation industry has become more comprehensive and established a large number of regional aviation companies. The reform measures taken by China's civil aviation industry have made its business booming. In 1992, its air transportation volume stood at 4.26 billion ton/km, up 32 percent over 1991 and 13.2 times over 1978, after it registered a sharp increase of 30 percent in 1991 over that of 1990. Its rate of growth is 3.4 times greater than the world average during the same period. During the first half of 1993, China's civil aviation industry still saw rapid growth in transportation volume which stood at 2.38 billion ton/km. A total of 15.8 million passengers flew China's skies during that period. China's civil aviation industry is among the top ten in the world. This official pointed out that six of the 13 aviation companies under the direct administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China are key enterprises. They are as follows: China International Aviation Corporation. Its insignia is a red phoenix. It has a total of 62 planes with 97 international and domestic air routes including 39 international and regional air routes. Its assets, volume of sales and profits exceed other air carriers in China. China Eastern Airlines. Its insignia is a flying swallow. It has a total of 66 planes with its base in Shanghai. It covers the whole country and connects China with Southeast Asia and Europe. It has a total of 130 air routes at present, going to more than 50 cities in the country. It also has regular flights to the United States, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Belgium, Spain and other countries as well as Hong Kong. Not long ago, a Eastern Airlines Group was formed with the air carrier as the center. It has more than 30 enterprises handling businesses in aviation, tourism, air kitchen, real estate, trading and advertisement. China Southern Airlines. Its insignia is a red kapok flower. It has a total of 89 planes. It is one of the air carriers with more international air routes. The China Southern Airlines Group which operates with the air carrier as its center mainly handles air transportation. It also handles other businesses such as express parcel delivery by air, commercial advertisement, in-flight catering service, imports and exports, hotels and tourism. China Southwestern Airlines. Its insignia is a roc. It has a total of 33 planes. China Northern Airlines. Its insignia looks like a flying hawk and also like the rolling Changbai Mountains. It has a total of 92 planes. China Northwestern Airlines. Its insignia is a swan flying through a sickle moon. It has a total of 42 planes. Because of economic factors, most of the passengers on the mainland are businessmen or government employees on business trips. Therefore, China's air aviation industry can still barely meet the needs of the market right now in addition to maintaining scheduled flights. In 1992, the busiest flights were those between Guangzhou and Shanghai. There were 4,826 such flights, offering 1,033,363 seats. The rate of passenger occupancy is 88.6 percent. The next is Guangzhou-Beijing. The number of flights totalled 4,166 in 1992, offering 1,006,150 seats. Its rate of passenger occupancy was 88.2 percent and its regular payload is 61 percent full. There were 3,304 flights between Beijing and Shanghai, offering 1,130,800 seats. Its regular payload was only 43.4 percent full. There were only 830 flights between Guangzhou and Fuzhou, offering 111,016 seats. The rate of passenger occupancy reached 96.3 percent, ranking top in the country. The Guangzhou-Fuzhou flights are the busiest on the mainland. As compared with the average world rate of passenger occupancy of 66.2 percent, it is quite obvious that there are more passengers than China's air aviation industry can possibly serve. Although the development of China's air aviation industry is fast, it still lags far behind the world advanced nations, because China had a weak foundation in the past. For example, the Beijing International Airport has the largest number of takeoffs and landings on the mainland every year -- 68,000. However, this figure is only 10 percent of the world's busiest airport -- the Osaka International Airport. The Baiyun International Airport has the largest capacity for handling passengers in China -- 9.01 million, but that of the Gatewick Airport in London is 18 million. Therefore, from a long-term point of view, China's air aviation industry is not large enough. Some related experts believe that a large number of Chinese passenger planes are outmoded such as AN-12, AN-24, Y-11, Y-5 and Y-7. Some of the planes should no longer be used, but they are still flying. In addition, the number of passenger will greatly increase, as China's economy is rapidly developing, the nation is opening wider and wider to the outside world, the people's living standards are rising, and there will be more and more foreign tourists. If we do not develop our air transportation as soon as possible, our civil aviation industry will become a "bottleneck" of China's development. Shockwave From Regional Airlines An upsurge to establish regional airlines was whipped up on the mainland since 1992. This has created a shock wave in China's aviation industry. People call it a regional airlines shock wave. China's first regional airlines is the Shanghai Airlines established in 1985. Right now, there are 25 regional airlines. Except for a few regional airlines, large ones have five to six planes, while small ones have two to three planes. Some ones even have no planes at all. The majority of them render passenger services. On the one hand, the regional airlines help make more seats available to passengers, while on the other hand, they offer competition to the national airlines. Right now, the business of the regional airlines is booming. In 1992, the total air transportation volume of regional airlines stood at 200 million tons, and nearly 3 million passengers flew China's skies, marking increases of 47.4 percent and 33.5 percent respectively over 1991. However, the most serious threat to the national airlines posed by the regional airlines is their competition for professionally trained people. A pilot must finish four years of studies at the Institute of Civil Aviation and go through six years of flying while learning in order to become a competent pilot who can fly a solo. China's air aviation industry is unable to solve the problem of staff shortages and help its staff members improve their quality within a short period, because it takes so long to train professionals. Meanwhile, staff shortages lead to fierce competition between the regional airlines and the national airlines for professionally trained people. Right now, about 150 pilots graduated from institutes of all types each year. With the number of intermediate and high-level engineering staff included, only 500 to 600 professionally trained people are available each year for the air aviation industry. This is far from being enough. It is only a drop of water in a bucket. According to an estimate made by an official of the Department of Personnel and Manpower under the Civil Aviation Administration of China, a civil aviation pilot's annual income including basic pay, flying pay, flight crew meal subsidy, comprehensive and frugality bonus is about 14,000 yuan. However, regional airlines pay their pilots several times more than their national counterparts. This is a tremendous attraction to the pilots. This year, there are 100 military pilots who have been transferred to work for the civil aviation industry after some training. One regional airlines with only one plane, successfully recruited more than 20 of these pilots at one fell swoop with high pay. Only slightly over 10 such pilots have been hired by the large China International Aviation Corporation. Engineers and mechanics are also in great demand. The maintenance department of a national airline had more than 200 engineers and mechanics. Over 70 of them left for other airlines which offered higher pay. When the Hainan Airlines was established, more than half of the Boeing 737 maintenance staff working for the China International Aviation Corporation left to work for the Hainan Airlines. The leadership of the China International Aviation Corporation is worried about this situation, but there is nothing he can possibly do for the time being. Meanwhile, due to the fact that most of the regional airlines only have a few planes, some of the pilots who have been hired by the regional airlines with higher pay have little chance to fly, causing waste. Besides, accidents are prone to occur in newly established airlines, because they have weak foundation, less capital and poor operational conditions. In addition, they are using outmoded or even obsolete planes. They also lack of supervision to ensure flight safety and airworthiness. There were three plane crashes in 1992 that involved new airlines. A relative department in China believes that the excessively rapid increase of the number of airlines has further aggravated the structural imbalance in the civil aviation industry and brought many problems to aviation safety. As early as the beginning of 1993, the State Council, in a document it issued, pointed out the need to examine and approve any application for the establishment of any airline in strict accordance with the regulations, procedure and standards. Other departments must not handle such application without the proper authorization. Special consideration must not be given to any locality or unit that has not met the requirements for the establishment of any airlines. The State Council document also stipulated that no airplane or helicopter is allowed to take off by any person without a license issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China or without a certificate of airworthiness for the plane. In order to rationally solve the contradiction between the regional airlines and the national airlines, fully utilize the limited manpower and ensure maximum flight safety, the Civil Aviation Administration of China had temporarily stopped to accept any new application for the establishment of any new air carrier from July 1993. An official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China said to our reporter that right now, the administration has worked out some measures to restrict airline staff in switching jobs. The regional airlines are not allowed to contact pilots of other airlines privately for job switching. If there is a need, negotiations should be carried out between airlines to solve problems. The national airlines may lease or transfer personnel to help regional airlines develop themselves. Flight crews or mechanics who privately switch jobs without authorization may lose their licenses to fly or do aircraft maintenance work. Airline, airport and flight control personnel are not allowed to accept side jobs. Major Adjustments in Airline Ticket Price For many years, China has implemented a system of dual ticket price. That is, the officially announced price as well as the discount price. Foreigners and residents of Hong Kong and Macao buy their airline tickets at the official price, while mainland passengers buy their tickets at the discount price with the latter about 30 percent lower than the former. Both the national or the regional airlines sell their tickets at the unified price. They have no authority to change prices for their tickets. An engineer who is in charge of ticketing in the Beijing Civil Aviation Building said, the official ticket price in 1992 is approximately 0.5 yuan per km, while the discount price is 0.31 to 0.34 yuan per km. For example, the officially announced ticket price between Beijing and Guangzhou is 0.5 yuan per km, while the discount ticket price is 0.34 yuan per km. The price structure for about 90 percent of the flights on the Mainland is like that. The ticket price for flights between Guangzhou and Guilin is slightly exceptional. The officially announced ticket price is 0.72 yuan per km, while the discount ticket price is 0.34 yuan per km. In addition, the price is comparatively higher for flights of shorter distances. For example, the ticket prices for flights between Guangzhou and Swatow are 0.92 and 0.97 yuan respectively, while prices for flights between Guangzhou and Chanjiang are 0.9 and 0.94 yuan respectively. Besides, foreign residents must use foreign exchange certificates to purchase tickets. The dual ticket price system confuses foreign residents. They are not so happy. This system causes a great deal of inconvenience. The leadership of the Civil Aviation Administration also believes that this system is unable to keep pace with the developing market economy and the opening-up program. It makes China's air aviation industry less competitive. It is against international practice, and should be reformed. In June 1993, the Civil Aviation Administration issued a circular to temporarily put the officially announced price into effect from 25 June for passenger tickets on 114 busy air routes from Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other localities. That meant the abolishment of the discount price. Domestic and foreign passengers must buy tickets in accordance with the existing officially announced price list. Taking the officially announced price list for these 114 air routes as the highest limit, various air carriers have the authority to give their passengers up to 20 percent rebate. The Southern Airlines operates on 56 of the aforementioned 114 air routes. On reforming the ticket price system, an official of the Civil Aviation Administration believes that China's civil aviation industry has begun to follow the international practice. It has also given various air carriers even greater power to manage their own business. From now on, various air carriers may adjust their price list according to market demand whenever conditions permit without the approval of the Civil Aviation Administration. This encourages various air carriers to compete with one another and improve their services. Right now, various air carriers on the mainland have adopted measures to attract passengers. The China Southern Airlines has stipulated that passengers in group of ten may purchase group tickets at a 10 percent discount. A 10 percent discount is also given to any passenger who buys a round trip ticket between Guangzhou and Tianjin and between Guangzhou and Shenyang. Structural Reform Is Key Nearly all the people interviewed talked about issues on reforming China's civil aviation industry. All of them believe that without reforming itself, this industry has no way out. Structurally China's civil aviation industry is gradually turning the enterprises under its administration into a modern corporate system. It is changing the situation whereas the functions of government are mixed up with those of the enterprises. This industry is becoming more and more market-oriented and competitive so that it can set up a modern enterprise system. Right now, there are two large civil aviation groups -- the Southern Civil Aviation Group with the China Southern Airlines as the mainstay and the Eastern Civil Aviation Group with the China Eastern Airlines as the mainstay. In addition, the China International Aviation Corporation which has not yet formed any group because of personnel changes will do so in the future. By forming groups, China's aviation enterprises would have more power in managing their own businesses. To form enterprise groups is an important measure to improve the industrial structure of China's civil aviation industry. As for the investment system, China's civil aviation industry will adopt the form of limited-liability companies to raise its funds in society. Regional air carriers are welcome to cooperate with and buy shares of main national air carriers. China's civil aviation industry will support the various localities to build airports, and it will share risks and profits with them. As for capital, we may expand the scope of business of Sino-foreign joint ventures and strengthen international cooperation. Foreign airlines may become shareholders of China's air carriers, and airports may be built by Sino-foreign joint ventures. Foreign residents may be invited to work as managers or consultants in order to make full use of their managerial experience to improve management. In fact, China has already attained some achievements in opening its civil aviation market and attracting foreign investments for its civil aviation industry. By the beginning of 1993, the amount of foreign investments used in China's civil aviation had exceeded US$5 billion. Some of the funds have been used to rent 126 planes and set up 12 Sino-foreign joint and cooperative ventures. The first Sino-foreign joint venture for China's civil aviation industry is the Beijing Air Catering Limited which is a joint venture with Hong Kong. The China International Aviation Cooperation and the Lufthansa Germany Airlines set up a joint venture called the Beijing Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Ltd., forming a base area for doing maintenance service to European and U.S. planes according to international standards. In order to meet the rapidly increasing social demands, China's civil aviation has imported a large number of planes and become one of largest buyers on the world aircraft market. Since 1992, China's civil aviation industry has taken over 80 planes, including 65 passenger planes. In March 1993, it had again ordered 20 Boeing 737 planes and one Boeing 757 plane. In the early days, China's civil aviation industry had already used foreign loans to rent planes. It also used its own funds and special state loans to rent 238 large- and medium-sized planes from abroad. Only in 1992 alone, it had imported 25 planes with US$1.25 billion financed by the Mitsubishi Trust Bank, the Hong Kong Ting Hip International Leasing Company, the Hong Kong Bark Tat Leasing Company and the U.S. Xinfu Company. In addition, China had begun to raise China Aviation Funds abroad since last year. The first batch of such funds in the amount of US$66.6 million has been secured. Securities in the name of China Aviation Funds are already on the European stock market. Right now, foreign investments in China's civil aviation industry are still limited to the building of airports, the purchase of maintenance equipment and the development of other infrastructural facilities. For example, the Wuhan Airport is built by a joint venture between the Hong Kong New World Group and the Wuhan City government. The Xiamen Butterfield and Swire Aircraft Engineering Company Ltd, is one with six shareholders. The Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Ltd, has a 41 percent share, the Chinese side a 29 percent share and 10 percent each by the Hong Kong Cathay Airlines, the Japan Airlines and the Singapore Airlines Engineering Company Ltd. Nevertheless, China's civil aviation industry remains weak in flight control, aircraft maintenance and flight crew training. There still exist all types of unfavorable factors in this industry. In early 1993, the leadership of the Civil Aviation Administration of China had considered the establishment of air carriers in the form of joint ventures. According to well-informed sources, the relevant departments in China are prepared to work out some regulations for the establishment of airlines in the form of joint ventures, but at the present moment no such regulations have been announced. Therefore, China's civil aviation still has a long way to go before it attains a spectacular development and makes tremendous progress.
