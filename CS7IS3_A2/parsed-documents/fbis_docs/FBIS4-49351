It conveyed and implemented the guidelines of the two national meetings on vegetable basket work convened by the State Council, and drew up an overall plan for vegetable work this year. The conference called on governments at all levels, especially city governments, to strengthen leadership, see to it that the vegetable basket project is well carried out, and make unremitting efforts to ensure ample market supply, stabilize prices, and stabilize society. Governor Fu Xishou and Vice Governor Zhang Runxia attended the conference. Each made an important speech. In the past six years since the implementation of the vegetable basket project in Anhui, the provincial government has appropriated 17 million yuan to support and encourage cities to grow vegetables under the program of replacing subsidies with rewards. Marked results have been achieved thanks to the great deal of work done by the governments at all levels. At present, a large number of bases for growing vegetables have been established throughout the province. In 1993, the province's per capita consumption of vegetable, meat, and eggs approached the level of economically developed areas in the country, but some existing problems should not be overlooked. From the middle of November last year to the beginning of this year, the prices of major staple food such as popular vegetables and pork in urban areas rose considerably, thus pushing up the general price index. Analyzing the causes for the price rises, Vice Governor Zhang Runxia said: The rise of vegetable prices at the end of last year was related to natural disasters, but it also exposed the problems in the areas of production and commodity circulation. The main problems are: In the past two years, the supply of vegetables and other nonstaple food has been relatively good. As a result, there has been a relaxation of investment in and service in connection with the vegetable basket project. Furthermore, as the pace of urban construction was accelerated, fine and high-yield vegetable- growing plots in suburban areas have been used for construction purposes. In the past two years urban vegetable-growing plots throughout the province decreased by 30,000 mu. The building of new vegetable-growing plots failed to meet demand due to a lack of investment. As there was a shortage of labor for growing vegetables in urban and suburban areas, some vegetable plots were abandoned or badly managed. Vice Governor Zhang Runxia pointed out: We should conscientiously sum up experiences and lessons and carry out the vegetable basket project successfully with a high sense of responsibility to the people. In his speech, after briefing the participants on the guidelines of the recently held central conference on rural work, Governor Fu Xishou stressed: Carrying out the vegetable basket project well is an important measure for checking inflation. This year is vital for us to establish a socialist market economic structure. If we fail to stabilize the supply of vegetables and rice and allow prices to rise considerably, social stability will be affected, and our reform and development will be affected. Therefore, it is the bounden duty of governments at all levels to solve the problem of vegetable supply. They should continue to implement the system of placing the responsibility on city mayors and make the vegetable basket work an important criterion for evaluating city mayors. Before its term expires, the provincial government will continue to pursue the policy of replacing subsidies with rewards. It has been decided at an executive meeting of the provincial government that this year the provincial government will appropriate a sum of fund to commend and reward cities that have done exceptionally well in carrying out the vegetable basket project. Fu Xishou pointed out: At present, we should strive to solve the few outstanding problems regarding the vegetable basket project. First, we should stabilize the area for growing vegetables and strictly ban indiscriminate requisitioning of vegetable plots for use for other purposes. Second, we should establish markets for agricultural and sideline products. Third, we should grasp the means of macroeconomic regulation and control; establish a reserve system for meat, vegetables, sugar, and other major staple food; establish a risk fund for nonstaple food and a system for monitoring the prices of agricultural and sideline products. Fourth, we should effectively strengthen market management and concentrate on resolutely punishing such illegal acts as manipulating the markets, jacking up prices, producing and selling faked and shoddy goods, and swindling the masses so as to safeguard the interests of producers and consumers. Fifth, all departments should coordinate in carrying out the vegetable basket project well.
