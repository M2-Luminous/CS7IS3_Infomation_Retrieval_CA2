"That was the best decision that Mr. Hata could make" just half an hour before the House of Representatives was to have voted on a no-confidence motion against his cabinet, said Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). Citing many difficult problems facing Japan ahead of the July 8-10 summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in Naples, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) said, "The Diet should elect a new prime minister to carry forward upcoming political reform policies without taking any retracting steps." "A general election would create a political vacuum for almost one month. That would be a worst scenario for Japan, which is only just beginning to see some signs of economic recovery," Hiroshi Saito, chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., said, expressing his relief. Kosaku Inaba, chief of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, another influential business group, said, "A new government is required to make utmost efforts to salvage the ailing economy and promote administrative and tax reforms." But Makoto Murata, head of the Japan Petrochemical Industry Association, voiced his perplexity over the ongoing political uncertainty, which he said would have adverse effects on currency and stock markets and on business activities.
