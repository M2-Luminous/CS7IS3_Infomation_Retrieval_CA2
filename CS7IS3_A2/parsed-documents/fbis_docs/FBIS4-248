FBIS4-248 "drafr066_d_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Renamo: Government Maintains Armed Groups in Zambezia Renamo: Government Maintains Armed Groups in Zambezia MB0504202094 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1730 GMT 5 Apr 94 MB0504202094 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network Portuguese BFN [Report by Edmundo Galiza Matos] [Text] In a communique issued to the media this afternoon, the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] accused the Mozambican Government of maintaining and sustaining what it described as small groups of armed men in Milange District, Zambezia Province. Reacting to the accusations, Teodato Hunguana, assistant government chief negotiator at the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] of the General Peace Accord, said what is currently being noticed in Zambezia Province, and which concerns the government, is the existence and activities of an armed movement entitled Rombezia, which wants to divide the country in two. Hunguana said both the Zambezia Provincial Government and the central government are investigating the existence of this group. He said the case must not concern just the government but also Renamo and everyone else, since national unity is at stake. In a communique this afternoon read by Rahil Khan, spokesman of the Renamo Information Department, Afonso Dhlakama's movement points out that the alleged armed groups in Zambezia Province must be disarmed by the government. The communique said the armed groups are led directly by Gimo Phiri, the first leader of the Mozambican National Union [Unamo], which belongs to the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and not Mr. Carlos Reis' Unamo. In an interview with Radio Mozambique this afternoon, Minister Teodato Hunguana was asked to comment on the communique. [Begin recording] [Hunguana] Well, the only comment I can make is that in Zambezia Province we are very concerned with the existence of an armed group called Rombezia which wants to divide the country. This is one of our main concerns in Zambezia Province. The other concern is the infiltration into Zambezia Province of armed Young Pioneers from Malawi. This is our second major concern. [Matos] Mr. Minister, how many men does Rombezia have, more or less? [Hunguana] Well, we still do not have exact, confirmed figures, but we have information that there are hundreds of men. [Matos] And who is their leader, Mr. Minister? [Hunguana] We do not yet have all the information, but we do know that the group's objective is to divide the country, thus endangering national unity. [end recording] Elsewhere in its communique, Renamo also points out that the government has transferred about 8,000 troops and members of the People's National Security Service to the police force. Consequently, it calls on the government to present their list officially. The communique also alleges that all these men were transferred to the police force, along with their weapons, such as bazookas, AK47's, and tanks. The communique says in order to calm the people, the government must act in good faith. Rahil Khan did not present proof for his allegations regarding the police, pointing out that the time was not ripe. Minister Teodato Hunguana said Renamo is engaged in yet another political maneuever by creating phantoms. He said this issue has already been discussed in depth and resolved in meetings between the president of the Republic and the Renamo leader who agreed, among other things, on the presence of an international police contingent to work with the national police.
