FR940513-1-00107 FR940513-1-00022 Under a model State child labor law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition (a child labor advocacy group of 35 organizations interested in updating child labor laws), the maximum hours of employment for 14- and 15-year-olds would be set at 15 hours a week while in school, and 30 hours a week when school is not in session. For 16- and 17-year-olds, the maximum work hours would be 30 when school is in session and 40 hours when it is not. The Department has also continued to receive input from the public suggesting that certain changes be made in the regulations. 5 The National Restaurant Association (NRA), the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA), and the Fresno (California) Private Industry Council, among others, have requested that the Department change the regulations. Correspondence has also been received from individual employers, Members of Congress, and members of State legislatures. 5 Section 570.38 of the regulations provides that persons desiring revisions of subpart C of part 570 may submit in writing to the Secretary of Labor a petition setting forth the changes desired and the reasons for proposing them. In response, the Secretary may either schedule hearings or make other provisions for affording interested parties an opportunity to be heard. In 1992, for example, the NRA noted that nearly 20 percent of employed teens work in food service occupations and that roughly 25 percent of the industry's hourly workers are in their teens. The NRA also pointed to a high overall teen unemployment rate and suggested a number of reforms to the regulations, including: (1) Allowing 14- and 15-year-olds to work up to 24 hours a week when school is in session for four days or less due to holiday or vacation breaks (currently limited to 18 hours during weeks when school is in session for one or more days); (2) Expanding the limit to 4 hours on Sundays through Thursdays, i.e., days followed by school days, and to 8 hours on Fridays and Saturdays (currently limited to 3 hours on school days); (3) Changing the 7 p.m. limitation during the school year to 9 p.m. on Sundays through Thursdays and to 11 p.m on Fridays and Saturdays; and (4) Changing the 9 p.m. limitation during the summer vacations (from June 1 to Labor Day) to 11 p.m. Reforms suggested by the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) include: (1) Allowing 14- and 15-year-olds to work up to 24 hours a week when school is in session for 5 days, and up to 36 hours a week when school is in session for any part of a week due to holidays or vacation (with the actual hours limit determined by subtracting from 40 hours, 4 hours for each day that school is in session during the partial school week); (2) Changing the current 3-hours-per-day limit when school is in session to 4 hours; and (3) Changing the 9 p.m. end-of-day limitation during the summer period to 11 p.m. The Department is also aware of the child labor standards established by State governments. In this regard, nearly all States have employment restrictions applicable to young workers and, although many have adopted standards similar to the Federal standards for 14- and 15-year-olds, the restrictions vary significantly. For example, most States limit the number of hours that may be worked in a day when school is not in session to 8 hours; only three States allow more than 8 hours of work in a day when school is not in session. Most States limit the number of hours that may be worked in a week when school is not in session to 40 hours; fifteen States, however, permit work in excess of 40 hours when school is not in session, with the number of hours allowed ranging from 44 to 56. With respect to the number of hours that may be worked in a week when school is in session, a large number of the States do not have any specific restrictions. Eighteen States restrict work to no more than 18 hours; two States restrict work to 16 and 15 hours, respectively; two States restrict work hours to 18 hours but allow more hours when school is not in session for a full week; and seven other States have provisions that allow work in excess of 20 hours a week when school is in session. Of the States that restrict daily work hours, 20 provide for a 3-hour limitation on a school day, whether or not the following day is a school day; one State sets a 3-hour limit on days followed by a school day; and one State permits longer hours on Saturdays and Sundays. A daily limit of 4 hours is allowed by seven States, with one of these States permitting additional hours on Fridays and on a school day preceding a day when school is not in session. Four States have established maximum permissible daily and/or weekly combined school and work hours, i.e., 10 total hours of combined school and work on a daily basis, or 48 total hours of combined school and work on a weekly basis. In 28 States, work beyond 7 p.m. is prohibited except during the summer, on a holiday, or on a day preceding a day when school is not in session, when work until 9 p.m. is allowed in 26 of these States, and until 10 p.m. in the other two States. Two additional States prohibit work after 7 p.m. at all times. An additional 19 States allow work at least until 8 p.m.; another five States permit work until 10 p.m. In addition to allowing more working hours during the summer, State standards often distinguish between days preceding a school day from those preceding a non-school day. Several States also make a distinction between full school weeks and weeks when school is in partial session because of holiday and vacation time, permitting more hours to be worked in partial school weeks.
