Designs and denomination of these stamps are: "the vast expanse of desert", 15 fen; "flowers in the desert", 20 fen; "forest of diversiform-leaved poplar", 40 fen; and "oasis in the desert", 50 fen. Desertification is a serious environmental problem challenging the whole globe. China has vast areas of desert and is seriously affected by desertification. At present deserts constitute 15.9 percent of China's land area. In recent years China has achieved notable results in harnessing desertification, with drought-enduring shrubs and trees, such as the diversiform-leaved poplar, planted to shelter farmland and stop moving dunes. So far, some 6.7 million hectares of the country's deserts have been afforested, and 10 percent of the desertified land has been effectively harnessed. The designer of the stamps is Meng Sihui from the Palace Museum.
