The new office -- the Department of Fair Trading under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce -- is responsible for ensuring fair competition and banning illegal monopolies in the business sector, according to sources with the state administration. The department is also responsible for drafting rules concerning fair trade and dealing with unethical trade cases. Other obligations of the new State organ include investigating and dealing with cases of illegal speculation, protecting consumers rights and handling serious consumer-related cases. It will also oversee the implementation of business contracts, while helping guide the resolution of economic disputes in China's arbitration courts. To eliminate unfair trading practices and illegal monopolies, China last year instituted a law governing unfair competition. Another law to protect intellectual property rights has been passed. The government is further considering the introduction of a new law banning illegal trade monopolies. It would supplement the law governing unfair competition in a bid to ensure fair trade, administration officials said. The new law is expected to ban regional restrictive business practices and unfair restraint of trade by public utilities, such as cooking gas and electrical supply companies. Unfair trade practices such as illegal lotteries to promote sales and kickbacks in awarding business contracts are still common in China. Cases that have been discovered have been dealt with by the law, according to local reports. A Hainan Province company was recently fined 10,000 yuan ($1,150) for setting a top prize of 30,000 yuan ($3,448) in a promotion activity. The prize was much higher than the law's ceiling of 5,000 yuan ($575) for such awards.
