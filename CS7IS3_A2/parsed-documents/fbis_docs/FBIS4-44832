This victimized research--mostly technological--is done in about 80 percent of all the science institutes, which are supposed to survive by covering half of the expenses out of their own resources (contracts, microproduction, etc), while the other half from a special fund, representing 1 percent of the economic units' production. In many cases, because of the financial blockage, these institutes are so poorly funded that they can no longer satisfy their obligations. In 1993, only 50 percent of the special fund could be collected. For instance, SIDEX Galati presently owes over 4 billion lei, which the company serenely admits it can't pay. The fines, recently doubled, no longer have any effect. As a consequence, the Ministry of Research and Technology administering the fund started 1994 with 80 billion lei of unpaid bills (arrears). In the attempt to liquidate them, during the first trimester of the current year, the ministry has been thus unable to provide practically any kind of financial support to research organizations in their charge. So the situation of the latter became dramatic. Many institutes had to resort to loans of ruinous interest in order to cover, more or less, the payment of salaries. A new wave of dismissals looms on the horizon, especially for the specialists. Some institutes might even have to go as far as to interrupt their activities altogether. The severe, long-term consequences of these developments can be easily comprehended. During a recent meeting with the press, Dr. Eng. Dumitru Doru Palade, the minister of research and technology, has categorically denied rumors that this special fund intended for supporting scientific research will be terminated. According to him, new financing sources for this vitally important activity for the nation are assiduously being sought. This situation could be improved by terminating the financing of geological prospecting, which is supported by the same fund and is also in arrears.
