Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku said the Commonwealth was not a peace-keeping organization. He said it was only acting as a mediator to help strengthen democracy in South Africa. The Commonwealth, a loose association of former British colonies, has sent a mission of observers to South Africa for the elections from the 26th to the 28th of next month.
