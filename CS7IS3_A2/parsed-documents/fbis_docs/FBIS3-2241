The main tasks of this meeting are: to implement the guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as of the party's basic line; and to study and arrange the work on enhancing and improving propaganda and ideological work under the new situation in line with the principle of "adopting a two-handed approach and of putting equal emphasis on the two-handed approach." It is hoped that party's leaders at various levels and comrades working at the propaganda and ideological front will, through this meeting, further understand the overall situation; unify thinking; rise with force and spirit; work in a down-to-earth manner; create a new phase in the propaganda and ideological work; and better mobilize, unite, and encourage the broad mass of party members and the masses to constantly advance the cause of reform, opening up, and modernization construction. Now, I want to discuss several issues. 1. The Importance of Enhancing Propaganda and Ideological Work in the New Period. Of the several fronts that our party leads, the propaganda and ideological frontline is a very important one. Among our party's various levels of leading organs, propaganda and ideological work departments are very important departments. Among our party's cadres contingents, the propaganda and ideological work contingent is a very important force. Both the first generation of the leadership collective of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core and the second generation of the leadership collective of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core attached great importance to leading the propaganda and ideological front and to giving play to the roles of propaganda and ideological work departments and propaganda and ideological work contingent. The history of past decades has shown that be it in revolutionary wars or in socialist construction, great victories are inseparable from propaganda and ideological work. This is a basic experience of our party. Attaching great importance to giving full play to the powerful role of propaganda and ideological work represents a major tradition and a major superior feature of our party. It is the people's undertaking to build a rich, strong, democratic, and civilized socialist country. With the help of the party's leadership and through their own efforts, the people embark on their undertaking to realize their own interests. Propaganda and ideological work departments shoulder a vital mission in this cause. To sum this up, we may say that this mission is to correctly publicize the party's theory, line, principles, and policies; and to reflect vividly the great practice of the masses, to mobilize all positive factors, to turn all negative factors into positive factors, to unite all forces that can be united, and to fight to accomplish the magnificent goal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our propaganda and ideological work calls for arming our people with scientific theories, guiding them with the correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring them with outstanding works so that new generations of socialist-minded people who are endowed with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a sound education, and a strong sense of discipline can be continuously trained and fostered to provide a powerful ideological guarantee and to play a supportive role in forming public opinion in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the important remarks during his south China inspection in 1992 and since the holding of the 14th CPC National Congress, the situation concerning our country's modernization construction has been excellent, reform and opening up have made great strides, the economy has maintained sustained development, people of all nationalities have shown solidarity and lived in harmony, and the country has enjoyed social and political stability. At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" was adopted and the action plan for reforming China's economic system in the 1990's was formulated. Reform of our country's economic system has reached a new stage where promoting overall reform of the economic system and seeking to achieve major reform breakthroughs are integrated. At present, the international situation's pattern is moving toward a multi-polar development. This helps expand our country's maneuvering room in handling international affairs. Economically-developed countries are now undergoing readjustment of the economic and industrial structures. Our country has improved relations with Western countries. Asia-Pacific regions continue to maintain relative political stability and an excellent situation for thriving economic development. Our country's friendly and cooperative relationship with neighboring countries and a vast number of countries in the Third World has been further strengthened. Of course, we are still faced with some difficulties and problems in the course of progress, requiring us to pay constant attention to studying and solving those problems. Generally speaking, both the international and domestic situations are relatively advantageous to our promotion of reform and construction, which are indeed a hard-to-come by good opportunity. In the current year, the basic policy of the work of the whole party is: under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, to comprehensively implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress, as well as by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to accelerate the building of the socialist market economic system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; to safeguard political stability, and promote all-round social progress. The overall mission of the whole party in the current year is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability. All party comrades must understand this overall mission, submit to and serve this overall mission, act under the awareness of this overall mission, and do a good job in all areas of work. The new situation has made greater and greater demands on the propaganda and ideological front. The party's theory, line, principles, policies, and our goals of struggle need to be publicized more penetratingly and widely so they can be understood and grasped by the masses. The series of new measures taken by the party and the government to push forward reform and construction must be convincingly explained in simple terms to the masses. New experiences created by the masses must be summarized and popularized; outstanding figures and their lofty spirits emerging from all fronts must be eulogized and propagated. The masses' increasing demand for spiritual civilization must be satisfied through all efforts. The multitude of problems arising in practice must be seriously studied and solved; ideological and conceptual problems pertaining to the readjustment of interests which crop up in the course of reform must be redressed and resolved; and the negative tendencies prevailing in social life must be overcome. Our efforts to push forward reform and opening up to the outside world and the modernization drive requires China to better understand the rest of the world and the rest of the world to better understand China. All these facts point to the importance of propaganda and ideological work. We can accomplish great things as long as we pay great attention to various problems, and we must not overlook them in any way. We must intensify our efforts and must not slacken them one iota; we must keep on improving and upgrading, and we must never stand still. In the 15 years since the implemenation of the policy of reform and opening up to the outside world, propaganda and ideological work have played important roles of emancipating the mind; renewing people's concepts; unifying the thinking and action of the whole party and the people; helping to maintain a stable and united social and political situation; mobilizing and giving play to the masses' enthusiasm, initiative, and creativeness; and of promoting the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization construction. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the CPC Central Committee, following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and affirming the results of propaganda and ideological work, has adopted a series of measures to rectify the phenomenon of "one hand being relatively tough while another one is relatively soft." Since the convening of the 14th CPC National Congress, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front have made great efforts, done a tremendous amount of work, and have achieved new progress in the areas of theory, journalism, publishing, cultural and arts, foreign propaganda work, and in helping to build the contingent of propaganda and ideological workers. On the basis of investigation and research and after summing up experiences and new practices, we have developed a basic idea about carrying out propaganda and ideological work in the new situation and have further defined the basic guidelines and principles, as well as the primary tasks and work arrangements. Now that the general policy guiding propaganda and ideological work has been set, the key lies in implementation, in doing our work in a down-to-earth manner, and in continuing to summarize our practical experience and to advance in a pioneering spirit. 2. The Fundamental Guidelines and Primary Tasks of Propaganda and Ideological Work Our party needs correct theoretical guidance and a unified ideological basis to lead and unite the people of all nationalities to carry out reform, opening up, and modernization construction. Our party is the vanguard of the working class with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding thought. Marxism is a branch of science whose root is deeply implanted in practice and which develops constantly in practice. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics deeply reflects the objective law of our country's socialist construction, realizes fully on the will and wishes of the party and the people, inherits and develops Mao Zedong Thought, and is the Marxism of contemporary China [dang dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yi 3981 0108 0022 0948 4104 7456 0344 1835 0031 0034]. This theory is the spiritual weapon of the whole party and the people of all nationalities and our powerful ideological weapon to score reform, opening up, and modernization construction victories. In the past 15 years, it was exactly because of the guidance provided by this theory that our socialist undertaking has opened a new historical phase; that the economic construction, people's lives, overall national strength have all reached new heights; and that we have scored achievements that have attracted worldwide attention; it was precisely because of the guidance provided by this theory that the cause of the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics has stood rigorous tests and achieved thriving development under the changeable international situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental principle guiding all party work. The propaganda and ideological front must firmly adhere to this basic guideline and use it as a guide in all of its work. Only by doing so can we ensure a correct orientation in propaganda and ideological work and the successful accomplishment of all our tasks. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has shown great concern and attention to working on the propaganda and ideological front. He has proposed a series of far-reaching and important ideas on the importance, policies, principles, and major tasks of propaganda and ideological work; the building of a force for this work; the party's leadership over the work; and more. These important ideas not only adhere to the CPC's consistent stand, but also include many new contents and demands for the situation and tasks in the new period. They are important component parts of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and are of extremely significant importance to guiding propaganda and ideological work and strengthening the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. All party members, particularly leading cadres at all levels and comrades engaged in propaganda and ideological work, must earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, further enhance their consciousness and steadfastness of conducting prapaganda and ideological work well, and strive to carry out this theory in actual work. The frontline of prapaganda and ideological work is long and the tasks are arduous. We should adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, closely center around the central work of economic construction, conscientiously do a good job in all kinds of work, and vigorously promote the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization. Currently and for the foreseeable future, we should emphasize four aspects of the work. A) The most important task of the propaganda and ideological front is the persistence in arming the entire party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The 14th CPC National Congress proposed arming the entire party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is a strategic mission with far-reaching and fundamental significance. The fulfillment of this strategic mission will push the party's theoretical and ideological level as well as its leading and ruling ability to a new height. Over the past year or so, particularly since the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the release of the central authorities' decision to study it, the study of this theory has been on the upsurge. Generally speaking, however, such a study is still preliminary. Party committees at all levels should further understand the extreme importance, urgency, and protracted nature of the work to arm the entire party with this theory and truly do a good job in organizing and guiding party members and cadres to study it. While continuing to run study courses for principal leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels, cadres with party membership at and above the county and regimental levels should receive training in stages and in groups within two to three years. In the course of studying, we should read Comrade Deng Xiaoping's original works seriously to comprehensively, systematically, and accurately master the gist and essence as well as grasp the basic standpoint of his works. Departments of propaganda and ideological work should coordinate well with departments concerned to carry on a thorough and sustained study among the entire party. Comrades in departments of propaganda and ideological work should play a leading role in studying theories, so the study can be conducted more thoroughly and the theory applied more satisfactorily. In the meantime, we should emphatically do a good job in publicizing and studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should make full use of the media, such as newspapers, radio, television, and publications, to publicize this theory in depth and educate our people and youth. We should sum up and spread the studying experiences of the broad masses of party members and people in a timely manner. The five bases for studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, established in the Central Party School, State Education Commission, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, PLA National Defense University, and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, should play a backbone role in studying in depth significant theories and practice in the course of reform and construction, establishing questions for study, concentrating their efforts, and accomplishing a number of highly valuable research achievements. The educational sector should compile teaching materials concerning the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics which will serve as the main contents for political courses in schools. B) We must persist in implementing the party's basic line and in properly guiding public opinion. While performing various tasks, for a century we should unwaveringly abide by the party's basic line that regards economic construction as the central task, that upholds the four cardinal principles, and that persistently promotes reform and opening up. The propaganda and ideological front must strictly adhere to the party's basic line; must properly perform its own tasks; and must carry out effective propaganda and ideological tasks to mobilize people and further align the minds and actions of the entire party and people across China with the party's basic line. To fully understand the actual situation and to properly guide public opinion under the guidance of the party's basic line are very important tasks performed by the party's propaganda and ideological front. Presently the number of China's newspapers and periodicals is enormous. Radio and television networks cover the entire country. By sending daily messages to the broad masses of people, the mass media are influencing their minds and behavior at all times regardless of where they are. When public opinion is guided correctly, people are united with high spirits; when public opinion is misguided, grave consequences follow. Positive and negative experiences have shown us that guiding public opinion is extremely important. Leading cadres of party committees at various levels, propaganda departments, and news publishing units must have a strong sense of responsibility in properly guiding public opinion. To correctly guide public opinion, it is important for us to correctly understand the actual situation; to improve our concept on the overall situation; to persist in properly publicizing the party's line, principles, and policies; and to resolutely maintain political unity with the party Central Committee. We should carry out our work with the objective of constantly enhancing the central task of economic construction; we should lead the masses to utilize their enthusiasm and creativity in deepening reform, in opening up wider to the outside world, in developing the socialist market economy, and in accomplishing various modernization tasks. We should make major efforts to reveal the fact that socialist undertakings with Chinese characteristics have been developing and bringing about changes day after day, and should enthusiastically praise the masses of people for their lofty character and splendid accomplishments in changing the world and in creating a new life. We should pay attention to investigating and studying actual public opinion and the masses' actual thoughts and concepts; we should actively express the views and proposals of the broad masses of people in an effort to strengthen the supervision over public opinion. The supervision over public opinion should aim to help the party and government improve their work, to resolve actual problems, to foster unity among the people, and to safeguard social stability. When delivering propaganda reports, we should pay attention to properly handling the relations among reform, development, and stability as well as the relations between local and overall situation; should uphold materialist dialectics; and should avoid partiality and oversimplification. We should strictly abide by the discipline governing propaganda. Party newspapers and journals as well as state news agencies, radio, and television stations should actively publicize the party's views in an effort to play a key role in properly guiding public opinion. Our stress on properly guiding public opinion is in line with our emphasis that departments and units in charge of publicizing public opinion should be creative in their work. The prerequisite that they uphold the correct policies, newspapers, journals, and radio and television programs should be boldly creative and should strive to form their own styles and characteristics. Persisting in properly guiding public opinion means creating a type of public opinion conducive to further reform and opening up, and to the establishment of a socialist market economy and the development of social productive forces. It means creating a kind of public opinion which helps strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system; which encourages and inspires people to make arduous efforts and to blaze a new trail for the country's prosperity, people's well-being, and social progress; which helps people distinguish between right and wrong, uphold truth, good, and beauty, and resist falsehood, evil, and ugliness; which promotes national reunification and unity; and which helps to bring peace of mind to the people and social and political stability. C) We must strengthen ideological work to raise a new generation of well-educated and self-disciplined people with lofty ideals and moral integrity in order to expedite the building of a socialist spiritual civilization. Raising a new generation of well-educated and self-disciplined people with lofty ideals and moral integrity is the basic objective of building a socialist spiritual civilization. Centering around this objective, we must strengthen ideological and ethical education centering on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism among the masses, especially young people; must carry out education in the spirit of plain living and hard struggle, and the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift; and must carry out education on professional and social ethics, on the basic national situation, and on basic legal knowledge. We should be good at doing ideological work among the masses. Heightening the masses' awareness and encouraging them to work hard to achieve their fundamental interests is our party's heirloom not to be discarded under any circumstances. While we have achieved some success in doing ideological work in recent years, some localities and departments have ignored and slackened their efforts in this regard, and we must attach great importance to this problem. Ideological work is work for the entire party. Not only should it be done by propaganda departments, but also by party committees at all levels and grass-roots party organizations of enterprises, rural areas, schools, and neighborhoods. Executive departments, trade unions, communist youth leagues, and women's federations at all levels also have the responsibility to carry out ideological work among the masses. Currently we must attach great importance to guiding the people, particularly young people, to foster correct ideals, convictions, world outlook, and concepts of life and values; to oppose money worship, nihilism, and ultra-individualism; and to resist the inroads of decadent capitalist and feudalistic ideas. To keep pace with the requirements of the new situation, we should, on the basis of inheriting the fine traditions, carry out ideological work by making full use of the mass media and cultural facilities and in ways which the masses readily accept and welcome. We must be good at guiding the masses to pay attention to democracy and to respect, understand, and care for each other. We should use ways which can attract many people to take part, to educate themselves, to discuss issues on an equal footing, and to make criticism and self-criticism. We should pay attention to differentiating levels, keep in mind the different characteristics, combine demands of the advanced levels with demands of the broad strata, and merge ideological education with cultivation of proper conduct. Propaganda and ideological departments should pay attention to summing up their experiences in carrying out ideological work among the masses, popularize the work of exemplary units, and make constant efforts to upgrade our ideological work in society. D) We must adhere to the course of serving the people and socialism, uphold the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought content, foster the main theme, and bring about a boom in socialist literature and art. Upholding the principles of serving the people and socialism and of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend are basic requirements for producing spiritual works and an important guarantee for the prosperity of propaganda and cultural undertakings. Fostering the main theme and advocating diversification reflects in a concrete manner the orientation of serving the people and socialism as well as the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Fostering the main theme means, under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of the party's basic line, vigorously advocating ideas and spirits conducive to fostering patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; conducive to reform, opening up, and socialist modernization; conducive to national unity, social progress, and the people's well-being; and conducive to seeking a happy life through honest labor. Fostering the main theme so that our spiritual works are in line with the people's interests can promote social progress and can satisfy the people's growing spiritual and cultural needs is the main idea of developing propaganda and cultural services and creating a boom in socialist literature and art. Effective policies and measures should be adopted to vigorously support the production of intellectual products reflecting the main trend of the era. Each year a number of outstanding movies, dramas, and works in the fields of music, dance, art, and literature which attract the people's interest should be created. Intellectual works which reflect the main trend of the era should not only possess healthy ideological contents but possess varied, lively, and refined artistic expressions which are strongly attractive and influential and are highly competitive in the market for cultural products. Social life is rich and varied, and the people's intellectual and cultural needs are also varied and come from different strata. All intellectual products which serve to educate and enlighten the people and which give them recreational and aesthetical enjoyment should be welcomed and encouraged. Excellent nationality cultural products, refined artistic works, and highly valuable academic works should be supported and protected. Efforts should be made to develop such undertakings as the press, publishing, radio, films, television, literature and art, and the social sciences as well as to improve cultural work in communities, villages and towns, enterprises, and school campuses. We should increase investment in the field of propaganda and culture so as to improve the condition for developing propaganda and cultural undertakings. The production of intellectual products is a complex working process. Therefore experts, scholars, and literary and art workers are required to give play to their personal creative spirit. We should respect and cherish their hard work, persist in emancipating our minds, seek truth from facts, adhere to the "double hundred" principle, and strive to create a good environment and atmosphere which encourages explorative and creative activities. In academic research we should encourage free discussions of different points of views and schools of thought; in artistic creation we should encourage free development of different styles and forms. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Literary and art workers who are responsible to the people must always gear their works to the needs of the masses. Artistically they should strive to further improve their works, avoid creating crude works, conscientiously bear in mind the effects on society created by their works, and do their best to provide the people with their best intellectual products." I hope comrades engaged in the production of intellectual products will make constant efforts to enhance their ideological and professional level and create more intellectual products which stimulate people's enthusiasm, enhance the masses' fighting will, tighten the national cohesiveness, and invigorate all sectors of society. In this way, our propaganda and cultural undertakings will be able to further prosper and flourish. In the course of carrying out propaganda and cultural work and promoting socialist spiritual civilization, I want to reemphasize three issues. First, it is necessary to give priority to social benefits [she hui xiao yi 4357 2585 2400 4135]. Economic and social benefits should be integrated on the basis of this basic prerequisite. The question of economic benefits has really cropped up as the socialist market economy continues to develop and as the production and circulation of intellectual products are closely linked with the general laws governing market operation. Good economic returns will help the development of propaganda and cultural undertakings. At the same time, it is necessary to realize that the value of intellectual products which have a special property different from that of material products is more importantly reflected in social benefit. The economic returns of some intellectual products may be small, but the products play a big role in promoting the development of productive forces and all-round social progress. In propaganda and cultural work we should always make social benefits our highest criterion. When economic benefits contradict social benefits, we should consciously subject economic benefit to social benefit. Second, it is necessary to adopt a scientific approach in dealing with our traditional national culture and cultures from the outside. Having experienced many vicissitudes of life, our nation has created a brilliant Chinese civilization in the history of mankind and developed a traditional culture of great vitality. We should do a good job in inheriting this valuable cultural heritage, discarding the dross and selecting the essence. We should conscientiously study and draw on the achievements of civilization of various countries in the world and be good at assimilating what is good from the cultures of other countries and nations to develop our culture. In stressing the inheritance of cultural heritage and learning from other cultures, our purpose is through these two means to closely integrate our traditional national culture and the essence of foreign cultures with the fine traditions and revolutionary spirit which took shape in the long years of revolution and construction by the people under the leadership of our party, and to make constant innovations on the basis of new practice to build and develop a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics. Third, it is important that we build a spiritual civilization and strengthen its management. Building a spiritual civilization includes management, and management can in turn promote the building of a spiritual civilization. Strengthening and improving management will provide an effective guarantee for developing propaganda and cultural undertakings and prospering the cultural market. We should make great efforts to promote the prosperity of cultural undertakings and produce more spiritual products loved by the masses. Meanwhile, we must not be oblivious to erroneous and unlawful things. On the major issues of principle the propaganda, ideological, and cultural departments must adhere to principle and take a clear-cut stand on what should be advocated, what can be allowed, what should be limited, and what should be opposed. The masses are very resentful of those things which negate the party's leadership and the socialist system, disseminate corrupt thinking and decadent sentiments, spread feudalism and superstition, play up sex and violence, and endanger our cause and harm people's physical and mental health, especially the young people and children. We must not let those things spread unchecked. We should see that many problems in our management belong to contradictions among the people. In our work, we must adhere to the party's principles and policies, do things strictly in accordance with the law, and pay attention to management and work methods. Regarding propaganda and cultural undertakings -- including the law of the development of a socialist cultural market -- there are still many things to learn. We should seriously study and actively explore related matters, sum up our experiences, improve and strengthen management system, and raise our level of management. To make propaganda and cultural undertakings prosperous and build a socialist spiritual civilization, we should formulate a plan for development. We have now established a three-step development goal for economic development, and have also had a basic framework for the reform of the economic structure and the establishment of a socialist market economy. The building of a socialist spiritual civilization touches various sides and is an engineering system. A resolution in this respect was adopted at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 12th CPC National Congress. On the basis of our achievements, we should now carry out deep-going investigations and studies, strive to formulate an overall plan, and establish progressive goals and specific measures for the building of a spiritual civilization within two to three years according to the new situation. 3. We should make efforts to strengthen and improve the party's leadership over propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the overall situation in our undertaking to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all levels must attach great importance to this task; they must strengthen their leadership and earnestly shoulder responsibility in this regard. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: "While building a high-degree material civilization, we should also raise the scientific and cultural level of the entire nation; develop an elevated, rich, and colorful cultural life; and build a high level of socialist spiritual civilization." He has also stressed: "In promoting the four modernizations, we must attach importance to both material and spiritual civilization and must not just pay attention to one side." We must do a good job in building both material and spiritual civilization, and only when there is both material progress and cultural and ideological progress can there be socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should solemnly place before the entire partythe question of giving equal emphasis to two fronts and doing well in both; we must place the question high on the agenda of party committees at all levels. We should make it clear that the responsibility for a region's or department's propaganda and ideological work and progress in promoting spiritual civilization lies primarily with its party committees. Party committees at all levels, and their principal officials in particular, must conduct in-depth research and investigation, sum up experiences, provide careful guidance, and make supervision and inspection to improve propaganda and ideological work. Some of the work requires coordination from various sides, and party committees must make unified arrangements and must study and coordinate their actions. Party committees and governments at all levels must constantly introduce the current situation, tasks, principles, and policies to propaganda, cultural, and educational departments as well as help those departments understand the progress of reform and construction so as to facilitate their respective work. We should consider the propaganda of the reform of cultural undertakings as important work, make overall arrangements, and actively promote such work. The propaganda of the reform of cultural undertakings should suit the need of the work of the development of a socialist market economy and of the entire cause of socialist modernization. It should be in accord with the requirement of building socialist spiritual civilization and with the law of the development of propaganda work and cultural undertakings. Through reform of the management system, we should change government functions, straighten up relations, simplify administration, raise efficiency, and strengthen the vitality of propaganda work and cultural undertakings. We should attach importance to strengthening the institution [zhi du hua 0455 1653 0553] and standardization of propaganda and cultural work, and increase the formulation of necessary laws, rules, and regulations. Building a contingent of propaganda and ideological personnel who are politically sound, professionally competent, and upright in work style serves as an organizational guarantee for the successful execution of propaganda and ideological work. Party committees at all levels should demonstrate concern for this contingent in politics, ideology, work, and daily life and do a good job in building it. The key to strengthening the building of this contingent lies in successfully building its leading body. In accordance with the policy of making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age, better educated, and professionally more competent and the principle of requiring both ability and political integrity, we should assign to important leading posts on the propaganda and ideological front cadres who uphold the party's basic line, well versed in Marxist tenets, and possess a strong sense of political responsibility and an awareness of the cause. There is a large collection of intellectuals on the propaganda and ideological front. We must conscientiously implement the policy of respecting knowledge and talent. We must strive to create a democratic, lively environment in which people can cooperate in unity and with an ease of mind. We must bring into full play the intelligence and wisdom of the vast number of intellectuals on this front so that they will find their way to distinction. We must particularly help young talented people to grow up faster and sounder, and we must gradually bring up in force experts in various field who will make an impact at home or even internationally. As for those making outstanding contributions, we must especially care for and treasure them. We should establish different kinds of award which reflect our nation's scientific and cultural achievements and are deemed as a high honor in society. The propaganda and ideological front shoulders a heavy and difficult burden. We must treat comrades on this front with understanding and vigorously support them. While setting stricter demands on them, we must not demand perfection. We must ardently help them sum up experience and raise their standards. Propaganda and ideological workers must strive to study theory; learn about socialist market economy, science and technology, and history of literature, music, and fine arts; and acquire a basic understanding of the development of Chinese and world cultures. They should go down to the grass-roots levels, to go deep among the masses, and to go into the realities of life so that they can draw nourishment from the creative and history-making activities of the masses to replenish and improve themselves. No good works can be accomplished nor successful propaganda and ideology work can be carried out if one removes oneself from reality and the masses. There is a galaxy of talents on the propaganda and ideological front. The vast number of comrades on the propaganda and ideological front are loyal to the cause of the party and the people. Working diligently and conscientiously, and willingly bear the burden of office, they did a tremendous amount of work and made important contributions to publicizing the party's basic theory and line, to promoting reform, opening up, and modernization, and developing socialist spiritual civilization. Practice has proved that this contingent is very dedicated and possesses a strong fighting capability. The party Central Committee trusts it and the party and people have high expectations of it. In the new period, the contingent shoulders an important responsibility. It is hoped that everyone will, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, work vigorously to make the country prosperous, keep forging ahead with all our energy, and make every effort to raise propaganda and ideological work to new heights. Comrades, our modernization involves a historical process which centers on economic construction and during which the socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual civilization will develop simultaneously. By upholding the party's basic line and not wavering in it for 100 years and through the efforts of several generations, we can definitely basically accomplish socialist modernization and win the great victory in building socialism with Chinese characteristics by the middle of next century. Let us unite as one and forge ahead steadfastly and courageously toward this goal!
