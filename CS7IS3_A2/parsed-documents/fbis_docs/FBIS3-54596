By putting conditions before the talks, Pakistan had already made its intentions clear that for the time being it is in no way interested in normalizing relations between the two countries. However, the warning given by Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali during his visit to Uzbekistan that a war may break out in South Asia cannot only be described as fuel to keep the controversy alive. The statement has been given under a well-planned policy which aims on the one hand to keep public opinion in Pakistan with the government, and on the other to inform the comunity of nations that if it did not keep in view the Pakistani interests, the situation may well get out of control. As reported, the Pakistan foreign minister during his stay in Uzbekistan has drawn a blueprint of nuclear war in South Asia. He has threatened that if the Kashmir controversy is not settled in line with Pakistani interests, India and Pakistan may go to war for the fifth time and that nuclear arms may be used. The threat, perhaps, is given to underline that a desperate Pakistan can resort to anything at its disposal. It is true that in terms of international diplomacy such threats can only be described as childish, but it cannot be fully ignored in view of the the way Pakistan has been constantly hurting Indian interests. By assisting terrorists in Punjab and Kashmir, Pakistan has only shown its hostile attitude against India. Pakistan was also behind the bomb blasts in Bombay last year. Evidence has often come to light about Pakistan's encouragement of communal violence in various places in India. Hence, the Pakistan foreign minister's threat should be taken seriously, not because we should be afraid of Pakistan's so-called nuclear capability, but because of the fact that Pakistan has launched a diplomatic offensive against India. We are capable of confronting Pakistan's military might and this has been proven many times in the past. Today, however, the need is not as much about displaying our military strength as showing diplomatic skill and capability. Our biggest need today is to clearly define our objectives and put them before the world in no uncertain terms. This is all the more imperative if the world is to view the Indian stand in the right perspective regarding Kashmir. We have to make it clear that Kashmir is an integral part of India and that we are ready to take all steps to defend our territorial integrity. We also must explain to the world how normal life has been disrupted in Kashmir due to Pakistani-sponsored terrorism. The way Pakistan is abetting terrorism is no less than any war by itself. In such a situation, India not only has to make its stand clear, but it must categorically state that its policy objectives are not surrounded by a mist of uncertainties. Our attitude should not reflect a lack of self-confidence. This is essential to project our stand to the world community. We also cannot ignore the fact that countries like the United States want to view Kashmir issues from the Pakistani viewpoint. This is why it is necessary that we become more active on the diplomatic front than in the past. While on the one hand it is essential to make it known to Pakistan that India cannot be cowed down by threats, on the other it is also essential to explain to world opinion that Pakistan's stand regarding Kashmir is not only illogical, but dangerous as well. The language of threats being used by Pakistan may well be childish, but it is also full of dangerous consequences. The Pakistan Government could resort to any adventure to strengthen its position within the country. This is why it is all the more necessary that we clearly define our stand regarding Pakistan and avoid ad hoc policies. Vacillation will create doubt about our polices which will weaken our stand. Our aim should be clear and our sight straightforward.
