At the same time the Bosnian Serb leader appealed to Butrus-Ghali to speed up these negotiations. In a letter to Butrus-Ghali, a copy of which was forwarded to TANJUG today, Karadzic recalls that the Bosnian Muslims refused to talk about the UN administration of Sarajevo at the last round of Geneva talks. Therefore, according to him, the Serb side believes that the UN Security Council resolution ought not to precede negotiations on that issue in Geneva. "Otherwise, a solution which would be unacceptable for any one side could create obstacles for the peace process." Karadzic said that "the peace process in Sarajevo is proceeding according to plan," and that the Sarajevo model, if successfully applied in the future, could serve as a useful model for other parts of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. "The cease-fire which is currently in force has been the most successful of all those agreed in Sarajevo," the president of the Srpska republic concluded.
