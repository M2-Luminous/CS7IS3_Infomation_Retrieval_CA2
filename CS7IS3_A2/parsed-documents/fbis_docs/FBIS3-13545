Following that, Israeli forces shelled the al-Hamra farm and the area around Qal'at al-Shaqif, where the resistance has positions, using 155-mm shells, as our correspondent in the south reported. The Israeli shelling was accompanied by warplane and helicopter overflights of the region; the planes dropped flares. Two Israeli helicopters raked the valleys of the al-Hamra farm and the area near the attack, for which Hizballah claimed responsibility. There were no reports of casualties. Earlier, Israeli forces sporadically shelled the hills of Iqlim al-Tuffah, particularly Jabal Safi, Luwayzah, Mlita, and Sujud.
