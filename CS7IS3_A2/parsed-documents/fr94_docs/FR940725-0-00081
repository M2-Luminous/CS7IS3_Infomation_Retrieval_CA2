FR940725-0-00081 FR940725-0-00012 In this notice of final rulemaking action, EPA is announcing its approval of the control measures, excluding the permit limits for Purina Mills and Electron Corporation, contained in the June 7, 1993 Denver PM 10 SIP and subsequent submittals noted above for their limited purpose in strengthening the SIP. Four sources/source categories were identified as contributing to the PM 10 nonattainment problem in Denver and, therefore, were targeted for control in the SIP revisions. Control measures were developed for the following area sources: residential wood combustion, street sanding and sweeping of paved streets, and mobile sources. In addition, controls reducing emissions from stationary sources were also developed. EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for PM 10 emissions reductions in the Denver PM 10 nonattainment area: (1) Colorado Regulation No. 4 which regulates residential wood burning; (2) Colorado Regulation No. 16 which sets sanding and sweeping requirements; (3) the federal tailpipe standards, which provide an ongoing benefit due to fleet turnover and Colorado Regulations 12 and 13 which were developed independently from the PM 10 SIP but are included because of their particulate emission reduction benefit; and (4) Colorado Regulation No. 1, which provides stationary source emission control regulations for particulates, smokes, carbon monoxide and sulfur oxides. A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions and their associated control measures (including available control technology) can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Denver moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP (58 FR 66326). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that the control measures on which EPA is taking final action on today serve to strengthen the existing SIP by advancing the PM 10 air quality protection goal of the Act. As noted, EPA is finalizing the control measures contained in Colorado's June 7, 1993 SIP submittal and subsequent SIP submittals for the Denver PM 10 nonattainment area, excluding the permit limits for Purina Mills and Electron Corporation which will be acted on at a later date. This action is explained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 66326&hyph;66334) and associated TSD. IV. Final Action_Limited Approval This document announces EPA's final action on the limited approval rulemaking proposed at 58 FR 66326. As noted elsewhere in this action, EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed action to approve the control measures for their limited purpose in strengthening the existing SIP. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulation No. 13 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1513&hyph;1515), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for the State of Colorado. The notice proposed approval of an oxygenated gasoline program. The formal SIP revisions were submitted by the State of Colorado on August 6, 1990 and November 27, 1992. (The November 27, 1992 revision supersedes the August 6, 1990 submission. EPA mentions the August 6, 1990 submittal as historical information. EPA is taking action on only the November 27, 1992 revision.) The revisions included amended versions of Colorado's Regulation 13. These regulatory changes were adopted by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission. A more detailed analysis of the state submittal was prepared as part of the proposed action and is contained in a TSD dated September 25, 1993, which is available from the Region VIII office listed in the Addresses section of this document. Other specific requirements of the oxygenated gasoline program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the proposed rulemaking and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the proposal.
