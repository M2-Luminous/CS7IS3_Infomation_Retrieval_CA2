It will be an economic, political, and moral disaster if these ministers meet to discuss lifting the Arab boycott without daring to discuss the racialist Arab, Islamic, and Western boycott of sisterly Iraq and the war of annihilation launched against its people, their bread, medicines, and security. How did things get so bad? How did the U.S. and Western disdain for the nation reach the point of asking it to lift the boycott on the enemy and tighten it on a sisterly country? How do the Arab League states meet in Cairo without remembering the tragedy of the Iraqis who, thanks to this league and under its pan-Arab flag, the first instigative resolution against them was adopted without hearing the voice of the honorable Arabs which warned that this resolution was against the whole nation and targeted the nation's dignity, wealth, present, and future. We were pleased with the reference to the continued Western pressures on Libya, but we wonder why no reference was made to the Western war of annihilation launched against the Iraqi people? We were pleased with the reference to the Libyan flexibility in dealing with the Western pressures, but we wonder why no reference was made to all obligations fulfilled by sisterly Iraq and the flexibility it showed, which did not convince the brother rather than the enemy, and did not convince the friend rather than the foe? What we hope to see is something concrete to show respect for the blood of Ramadan's martyrs in the Ibrahimi Mosque, and a conviction by all that the Iraqis, Palestinians, Libyans, Sudanese, Somalis, and all other Arabs are Arabs who should be treated with the same standards -- that is if we have the free will to do this and can make an independent decision. What we hope is that some people would be ashamed before God, homeland, nation, and history when we hear talk about lifting the boycott on the enemy and do not hear whispers about lifting the boycott on the brother, although hundreds of Iraqis are martyred by famine, disease, and horror, while this enemy is not affected by our boycott because all Westerners support it, based on all their hatred of us and racism in dealing with us. What is the use of thinking about whether or not to amend the Arab League Charter if this is not preceded by a change in what is in the hearts of some of us, especially concerning the Arab peoples suffering from tragedies and disasters due to the pan-Arab and religious positions of some of us?
