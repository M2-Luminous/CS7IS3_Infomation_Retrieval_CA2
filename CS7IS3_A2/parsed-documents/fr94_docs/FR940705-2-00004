FR940705-2-00004 FR940705-2-00003 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;549&hyph;813] Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Canned Pineapple Fruit From Thailand AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Alley or Lori Way, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5288 and 482&hyph;0656, respectively. Initiation of Investigation The Petition On June 8, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form from Maui Pineapple Company, Ltd. and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. Petitioners filed supplements to the petition on June 14 and 20, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioners allege that imports of canned pineapple fruit from Thailand are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Petitioners have stated that they have standing to file the petition because they represent interested parties as defined under section 771(9)(C) and (D) of the Act, and because the petition was filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E) or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, such party should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Scope of Investigation The product covered by this investigation is canned pineapple fruit (CPF). For the purposes of this investigation, CPF is defined as pineapple processed and/or prepared into various product forms, including rings, pieces, chunks, tidbits, and crushed pineapple, that is packed and cooked in metal cans with either pineapple juice or sugar syrup added. CPF is currently classifiable under subheadings 2008.20.0010 and 2008.20.0090 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). HTSUS 2008.20.0010 covers CPF packed in a sugar-based syrup; HTSUS 2008.20.0090 covers CPF packed without added sugar ( i.e., juice-packed). Although these HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope is dispositive. United States Price and Foreign Market Value Petitioners based U.S. price (USP) on average unit values derived from U.S. Customs IM&hyph;146 import statistics. To calculate U.S. price, petitioners made deductions for foreign inland freight. Petitioners used Thai home market delivered price quotes provided by a market researcher to calculate foreign market value (FMV). According to petitioners, there is no difference in quality between the CPF sold in the Thai and U.S. markets. To calculate FMV, petitioners deducted an amount for home market inland freight expenses, and then converted the net price to dollars using contemporaneous exchange rates from the Federal Reserve. The margin alleged by petitioners is 138.48 percent. If it becomes necessary at a later date to consider the petition as a source of best information available (BIA) in this investigation, we may review more thoroughly all of the bases for USP and FMV in determining BIA. Initiation of Investigation We have examined the petition on CPF from Thailand and have found that it meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(a). Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of CPF from Thailand are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. International Trade Commission Notification Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the International Trade Commission (ITC) of this action and we have done so. Preliminary Determination by the ITC The ITC will determine by July 25, 1994, pursuant to section 733(a)(1) of the Act, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of CPF from Thailand are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a)(2) of the Act, a negative ITC determination will result in this investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b). Dated: June 27, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
