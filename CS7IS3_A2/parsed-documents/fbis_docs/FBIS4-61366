The document has been signed by the leaders of practically all regions and republics of the Russian Federation, many political parties, trade unions and religious denominations. Analysts expect that more signatures will be added to the agreement. President Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff SERGEY FILATOV talks to our correspondent Vasiliy Kononenko about the difficulties the preparation of the accord involved. Corr.: What made the Civic Accord necessary? Sergey Filatov: The amnesty declared by the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) gave an impulse to the work on the document. It was obvious that the amnesty was a purely political move, which pursued aims that had nothing to do with stabilization in Russian society. We had immediate evidence that this was true - signs of a fresh confrontation and total mistrust of authority. And that came after we had got through a tremendous ordeal and were at last ready to adopt a new constitution. The president gave his first message to parliament, and the government announced its program. Those documents were expected to provide a basis for conciliation in order to overcome the crisis. So we the presidential team started wondering if, at this time of constant surprises, it is possible to put an end to confrontation, which not only exhausts society psychologically but brings to naught economic reforms. It is largely for this reason that crime has been rampant in Russia, and foreign business began to be afraid to make investments into the Russian economy. So the president and his closer associates came to the conclusion that there was a need for a document on social conciliation in a broad sense. Corr.: How did the work on the document proceed in concrete terms? S.F.: Yeltsin set himself the aim of putting an end to political punchups and making the principal parties talk to each other. At first, potential participants were chosen for such consultations representing political and public organizations that have support in various social strata. It was decided to put Academician Boris Topornin - not an official but an influential academic - at the head of a team drafting the text of the document. Then it was suggested that round table discussions be held on some concrete aspects of further work. The text had to be constantly improved. Sometimes this led to scandals. For example, one of the State Duma members, without seeing the final version of the accord, accused its authors of playing a dirty game. Corr.: What was the essence of the principal disagreements? S.F.: There were three main points of difference. First of all, we argued about what the document was to be called, an agreement, a declaration, a memorandum, a charter, or an accord. Then there were objections because the text of the document was similar to that of the Russian Constitution. Then there was the problem of carrying out the accord and monitoring its implementation. In the course of consultations, the sides decided to set up a conciliation commission. But now we believe that even that commission should be controlled by a group of top officials to take care of particularly grave conflicts. There were probably three main causes of agitation. The first was the attempt of Valeriy Zorkin, former chairman of the Constitutional Court, to overtake the president's initiative. The second was the ultimatum made by Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, who said there could be no conciliation in society before the policy of reform was abandoned, the social system changed, and many people removed from the present leadership. And the third was the split in the State Duma during the debates on the accord. The president then held an urgent meeting. There was no panic: we already had a rough picture of the alignment of forces throughout the country. And on that basis we came to the conclusion: most of the influential movements were in favor of the accord, while the resistance on the part of some parties would be compensated for by support on the part of the trade unions. I was sure nothing would go wrong at the final stage, because quite soon, after a new law on elections came out, a presidential election campaign would start, and Russians would evaluate the candidates on the basis of their attitude to the Civic Accord. FATEYEV: CONFLICT IN OSSETIA NEEDS NEW APPROACHES The Ossetian-Ingush dispute may seem trivial to those who know the history of Russia and the USSR only superficially. However, even though the two nations are small, the dispute may threaten the unity of Russia. Interfax's Yuriy Sheyn interviewed VALERIY FATEYEV, 48, member of the Federation Council, member of its Security and Defense Committee and Deputy Economics Minister. He headed the Federation Council's commission that visited the Northern Caucasus recently. Corr.: North Ossetia's President Akhsarbek Galazov said in parliament that the Federation Council's Northern Caucasus commission lacked insight into the region's problems. Valeriy Fateyev: As the commission stayed in the Northern Caucasus we met with the leaders of three republics there, Galazov of Northern Ossetia, Aushev of Ingushetia and Dudayev of Chechnya. We had talks with representatives of interest groups, political parties and religious confessions. We also conferred with the leadership of the provisional administration in the conflict area. We attended a meeting of the Military Council and discussed the regional problems with officials of the power ministries operating in the area. All the military and political issues were discussed. We discussed ways to normalize the situation with the top officials and field commanders of the Industry Protection Board. The delegation visited a refugee camp, talked with displaced persons in Ingushetia, met with the families of Ossetians and Ingush. We wanted to know the opinion of common people who are victims of the conflict. For several days the delegation shared in the activities of the Ossetian-Ingush reconciliation commissions to understand the mechanism of their operation. We also met with the local Cossacks. I think that our commission has studied the situation in depth. Corr.: Did you see documents that could shed light on the root causes of the conflict and ways to put an end to it? V.F.: All field data and maps of what happened in September and October 1992 were made available to the commission. We learned about the industries, economics and finances of the republics, talked to experts and top official of ministries, obtained data on migration and destruction of homes. We studied press reports and testimony of witnesses. Corr.: Was any information made available to your commission in Moscow? V.F.: Unfortunately, numerous matters have not been clarified. Some documents were contradictory, some were in archives. The commission had Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko sign requests to the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, Defense Ministry, the National Security Council and the Interior Ministry for more documents. We asked for and obtained data on sales of weapons in the conflict area and analyzed data on the stationing and movement of troops during the conflict. Archives of the USSR Supreme Soviet since 1992 were studied. Some of the documents we obtained were signed by Stalin, Kalinin or Beriya. True, we could not possibly obtain and analyze all the relevant documents. Corr.: What conclusions did the commission make? V.F.: In my view, the roots of the conflict are not territorial or ethnic or religious or historic. The most important issue is power, the ability or otherwise of the authorities to enable people of any confession, ethnic origin and time of stay in the area to live side by side in peace. The officials who made a political evaluation of the tragedy had to be guided by this requirement rather than by what is apparent in lower echelons of authority or is in the mind of the common Ingush or Ossetian. The federal authorities should rise above specific details and tackle the overriding issues, above all the ability of the authorities to handle the situation. The mass media described what happened in Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia variously as genocide, ethnic cleansing, war and conflict. The central authority cannot rely on such definitions. Human rights must be the overriding consideration and so the central authority should concentrate on what should be done to have life in the area return to normal rather than on what happened there. Incidentally, it is still happening because houses are destroyed, people killed, hostages taken and acts of terror committed. The federal authorities should not evaluate the situation by the number of people killed. If 1000 were killed at the peak of the conflict and then as few as 10 died monthly, the central government should not close its eyes on the killings, otherwise one could believe that the death of one person is a tragedy and of tens of people is statistics. Corr.: What is the situation in the region now? V.F.: I am saying that the authorities of Northern Ossetia continuously violate human rights and are in breach of law and order. This is the briefest possible description of what is going on there. You will have remembered that the conflict flared up and developed within Northern Ossetia and acts of violence were committed against its population. As a result ethnic Ingush population had to leave their homes. Now it is essential that they return. That's the long and the short of it. The issue is, however, being made unduly complicated. In particular, the Ingush Republic is being dragged into the talks. But it did not even exist at the time when the conflict erupted and the Ingush had to flee Northern Ossetia (IF Note: It was part of the Checheno-Ingushetia). Accusations are levelled at (Ingush President) Ruslan Aushev. But what has he to do with this? The problem is in Northern Ossetia. We have to thank Aushev for giving the shelter to the ethnic Ingush who fled Northern Ossetia. We can only think of asking him to help bring the refugees to where they used to live give them a three day supply of food. Everything else is up to Northern Ossetia, I think. What kind of talks can be held? Who should talk to whom? The republic is Ingush but this does not imply that its leaders should enter talks about the return of ethnic Ingush to their homes in Northern Ossetia. I was the head of the Smolensk Region administration (IF Note: in the West of European Russia) which borders on Belarus. If an ethnic conflict involving Belarussians [Belarusians] occurred there and people were forced to leave their homes, would I have to negotiate with my counterpart in Belarus? To me it sounds absurd, speaking mildly. Above all, if I represent the authority throughout an area and not the interests of some ethnic group, I have to prevent any conflict. If it does happen, it is my problem. As an official in power I must have the refugees return, apologize to them and provide normal life for them. If it is short of cash, the region should apply to the federal government for it but never drag its neighbors into the matter. In short, I see two causes of continuous human rights violations in the Northern Caucasus. The first is the inability of the North Ossetian authorities to provide law and order and peaceful coexistence of people in its territory. The second is inconsistency and incompetence of the federal authorities who are likely to make decisions for expediency, neglecting the interests of small nations and rely on the use of force in resolving conflicts. Corr.: Why did some members of parliament accuse you of partiality? V.F.: Our conclusions resulted from what we learned from the sources I mentioned. The conclusions could not be entirely impartial but the commission was as unbiased as it is humanly possible when it suggested remedies. We as (ethnic) Russians have no national or family or religious ties in that area. Besides, the commission members were well-trained to discuss and analyze the situation and make decisions. Above all, we understood the danger of allowing the situation to continue as it is. Some media accuse me of being pro-Ingush. So does North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and some other political figures. Others think, however, that my policy is pro-Ossetian. My position is pro-Russian because peace in Russia will not be stable unless there is peace in every republic and area. The accusations that Galazov levelled at me are explained by the fact that the commission pronounced a judgment on the performance of the North Ossetian authorities. His case that the sources of information our commission used were irrelevant has no leg to stand on. This is the reason why Galazov did not attend the parliamentary discussion of the essence of our report. Corr.: When you spoke of inconsistence and incompetence of federal authorities, did you mean the provisional administration in the conflict zone. V.F.: I meant the central authorities. In particular, the central authorities passed a decree on political and territorial rehabilitation of the nations that fell victims to reprisals but the decree provided no mechanism of carrying this through. Forcible movement of whole nations hundreds of kilometers away from their homes into another social medium was unprecedented at this scale. (IF Note: Stalin ordered deportation of the Ingush people to the Siberia and Central Asia in March 1944 because they allegedly collaborated with the Nazi troops who never entered Ingushetia. It was not until 1957 when the Ingush were allowed to return home. By that time the borders of North Caucasian republics were not what they had been before the deportation). Corr.: The Federation Council will not meet until the end of May. Do you think its work was effective. V.F.: I will speak of its effectiveness only in the matter we have talked about. Last January the Federation Council receives a presidential decree ordering another extension of the emergency rule in the Northern Caucasus. The upper house decides - rightly, I think - that it cannot rubber stamp decrees, especially so because emergency has been in place for nearly 18 months without any tangible results and the refugees have not returned home. Because the Federation Council had never dealt with the conflict, its deputies thought that they could impartially sort it out and help ease the tension by saying what they found. A commission is set up which goes there and drafts advice on the situation. The time comes when a decision has to be made. The upper house heard the commission but there was no voting on its conclusions. The council did not tell the commission to formulate a draft. Nor was a political judgment pronounced by the upper house even though it was made in my report. A decision was made to continue the hearings and set up a commission which could attend the National Security Council meeting where the issue will be discussed. The Federation Council proved to be incapable of anything better than this. Then its members left for home. It is after this that a Russian servicemen was killed and numerous hostages taken by both sides in the conflict. The conflict was scheduled to be discussed by the National Security Council in March but it was not until late April that this happened. On April 4 a decree extending the emergency rule is sent to the Federation Council. This document is not good at all. It was worded in Vladikavkaz, the North Ossetian capital, and signed in Moscow. I told the deputies that the decree could not be approved because it would deprive the Russian troops of their rights and disable the administration. Nonetheless, the decree was approved in a voting by secret ballot. I think that some members misunderstood the situation while others voted so to promote their own political interests. Some probably allowed themselves to be talked into voting so. Corr.: What steps could lead to normalization of the situation? V.F.: I think that emergency rule should be imposed throughout Northern Ossetia because its authorities are incapable of coping the crisis. Under the emergency rule, the executive power in the area will be vested in central authorities and their representative bodies in Northern Ossetia while the Northern Ossetian legislature will be suspended. IF Note: The Federation Council has recently approved a presidential decree placing a few more settlements in Northern Ossetia under emergency rule. The Russian prime minister has signed an ordinance extending the powers of the provisional administration head in some areas of Ossetia and Ingushetia. Our commission also suggested helping the new Ingush republic in the setting up of bodies of authorities. They should not be built along the group, clan or family lines but should include capable local people and knowledgeable financiers, economists and lawyers from the Russian Federation. These people should not go there as exiles or for a brief stay there but must have solid social guarantees and have homes there so that they could bring their families with them and make a good job of helping Ingushetia. If they decide to stay in Ingushetia, so much better for that republic and the whole of Russia. If they return to ethnic Russian areas, the country will still benefit from their stay in Ingushetia because they will become more experienced experts. This kind of training was used in the former USSR and was not so bad. We need such people in ministerial positions rather than the yesterday's pseudo- democratic demagogues. Furthermore, I think that the Federation Council must set up a standing commission to monitor the situation in the conflict zone. Finally, Moscow must start talks with the Chechen Republic immediately. These are the conclusions and proposals the commission made after it had seen the situation first hand.
