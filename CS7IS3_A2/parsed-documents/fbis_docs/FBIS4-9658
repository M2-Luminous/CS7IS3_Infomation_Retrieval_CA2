Three of them have expressed their opinions on the nomination of Zedillo Ponce de Leon. [Begin recording] [Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate for the National Action Party] By reason of the public posts that Dr. Zedillo and I have held, I have been in direct contact with him. I consider him to be a respectable man and politician. Now that the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] has appointed him to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio, may he rest in peace, I once again have an opponent. [Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, candidate for the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party] I imagine he must be good because he has a long history of public service. When I was in jail back in 1966, Zedillo was one of the students from the Polytechnic Institute who participated in a march called The Path for Freedom, that demanded my freedom. At that time, I was a member of the National Association of Democratic Students. Ernesto Zedillo has a good record. He is going to be a great opponent for us. [end recording] For Jorge Gonzalez Torres, candidate of the Mexican Green Ecologist Party, the selection of Ernesto Zedillo as new PRI candidate represents renewed hopes for democracy in our country. When asked about the PRI nomination, Gonzalez Torres pointed out that the voters will decide on Ernesto Zedillo's nomination on 21 August. He added that Luis Donaldo Colosio's death should not be used as sentimental blackmail, and votes should be cast in a reasonable and not emotional manner.
