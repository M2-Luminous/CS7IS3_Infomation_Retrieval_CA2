Thus runs a letter from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which was distributed today as a General Assembly and Security Council document. "On 20 May 1994, the Supreme Rada of the Republic of Crimea adopted a decision on re-enforcing the constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992. This act is aimed at changing the legal status of the autonomous republic as a component part of Ukraine," it indicates the document points out. Having described these actions by the Crimean parliament as "a violation of the Constitution of Ukraine," A. Zlenko stated that "a threat is thereby being created to peace and stability in the region and in Europe as a whole." The minister expressed the hope that "the UN secretary general will personally show understanding and support" for the actions of the government of Ukraine in "averting the possible negative consequences of the anti-constitutional decision adopted by the Supreme Rada of Crimea." In the event of a deterioration in the situation, Ukraine reserves the right to take all the necessary measures to provide for the territorial integrity of the state, the document stresses.
