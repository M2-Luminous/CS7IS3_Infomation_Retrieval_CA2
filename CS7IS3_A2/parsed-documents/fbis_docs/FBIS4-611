Mr Kriel, who is NP [National Party] premier candidate for the Western Cape, was referring to an article published in a Cape Town newspaper about an ANC commission of inquiry into money collected by Mrs Mandela for the social welfare department, which has gone astray. "This is the kind of person the ANC is asking you to vote for. I want to make an offer to the ANC. They should approach the South African Police and they will find out who took the money. Any organisation that finds funds have gone missing goes straight to the police, they don't hold commissions and then say it is a pity details have been published. People want to know the truth so they know for whom they will be voting on April 27. If money goes missing from the organisation even before they are in power, what is going to happen if they come to power? The ANC cannot even govern a township properly and yet it wants to govern the country."
