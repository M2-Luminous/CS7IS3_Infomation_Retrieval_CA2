Pooling the wisdom of the masses, everyone suggested ways and means to defend and construct the border and promote border stability and prosperity. Representative Rosi Usul said border-stationed troops are the main strength protecting border stability. They undertake the glorious mission of providing a guarantee of safety for economic construction of the autonomous region. We must strive to enhance troop independence, inceasingly improve fighting strength, consolidate national defense, have a clear-cut stand opposing separatism and disorder, and firmly uphold the unity of the motherland and social stability. We must continue to do a good job of supporting the government and cherishing the people, and sustain and develop the overall good situation of Xinjiang's unified army and government, soldiers and civilians, and national minorities, "breathing together, having the same fate, heart to heart." Yibulayin Sulaiman [0122 0008 2139 7299 5685 0171 3341], Hu Zongyao [5170 1350 1031] and other representatives who came from stations in the poor southern border areas believe that stationed troops have an unshirkable responsibility to promote the economic and cultural development of poor areas. In recent years, the southern border troops wholeheartedly worked for the masses. They help villages strengthen grass-roots party and government work, actively participate in public affairs, rush to emergencies, provide disaster relief, prevent and cure illnesses, plant trees and reforest, and contribute funds to help studies. They have input a great amount of human and material resources to train various technical personnel in stationed areas. Represenative Li Laitong [2621 0171 7906] introduced various armed forces' successful methods of helping the poor in science and technology support. He suggested that in military areas troop support for the poor should be suited to the new conditions of market economics. In opening up and widening avenues to help the poor, we should gradually move towards a large scale of one village or town from one family or household and from purely supporting the poor with personnel or material aid to doing so with integrated personnel, finances, material, and science and technology. Improve the capacity of rural areas to move away from poverty to wealth on their own. Representative Li Peidong [2621 1014 2767] from the border defense troops indicated that border defense troop PLA officers and men, garrisoned in lofty and snowy mountain ranges, struggling arduously and sacrificing unselfishly, resolutely create a good and safe social environment for the stable development of the autonomous region.
