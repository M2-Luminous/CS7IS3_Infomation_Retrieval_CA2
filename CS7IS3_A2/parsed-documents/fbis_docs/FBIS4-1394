During a visit to a polling station in Soweto, he told Sontie Maseko that strong action was being taken to prevent bombings. [Begin recording] [De Klerk] The police will act very firmly. They have taken all the precautions to assure that this spate of bombs will be limited, and that the people behind it will be apprehended. Some progress is being made, we must not interfere with the investigation, but you have our assurance that the investigation is carrying on full blast and that they have a very, very good strong team on this, and I'm sure we will have success. [Maseko] All eyes are on South Africa. Now what does this do to our international image? [De Klerk] Well, obviously it's bad to our international image, but a good turnout, with a very high percentage poll, which is already apparent we will get, and the peaceful election will far outweigh the negative image. It will prove that we are dealing here with a small lunatic radical fringe, and that the overwhelming majority of all South Africans are committed to peace, and that this country is now departing on a new voyage towards prosperity and peace for all its people.
