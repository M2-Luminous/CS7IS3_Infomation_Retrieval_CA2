But as is cleared up now, the failures in power supply were and are stipulated by more serious reasons connected with a poor organization of labour, irresponsibility and loosening discipline of those dealing with as well as other shortcomings in the work of the coal mining enterprises. According to the Mongolian television, at the major heat and power stations of the city there is the coal stock left only for a few days so they are trying to make use of them as much longer as possible which means that the current practice of cutting of the power supply for several times a day would be continued for a uncertain period up to a normalizing of the coal mining.
