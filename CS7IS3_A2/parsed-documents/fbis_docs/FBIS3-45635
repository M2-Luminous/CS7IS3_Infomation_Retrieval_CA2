The decision was made recently by the State Council, China's cabinet, in a bid to ensure a stable environment for the overall reforms this year. It also underlined the leadership's concern that mounting inflation that might lead to unrest. An eight-point package demands that local authorities and regional price departments step up control and administration of prices while strictly implementing the central authorities' policy of setting price ceilings, Chinese sources told The Hongkong Standard yesterday. The package, decided by a national emergency meeting on price controls following price rises for grain and staple foods late last month, stipulates that: Price increases for railway transport and electricity by localities should not be higher than those previously set by the State Council. Scheduled reform measures that may send prices up should be suspended. Subsidies on certain products set by the central government should not be reduced. A price limit should be reimposed by regional governments and local departments on some daily necessities, staple foods and major products if prices soar to levels that consumers cannot stand. Protection prices for grain purchasing set by the local government should not be lower than those set by central government. Administration of fees for education, medical services and other government services should be strengthened. A price information network and a price recording system should be set up, and regular price reviews should be conducted by local price departments and results be reported to the State Council. Efforts must be made by regional governments and relevant departments to ensure a stable market during the Lunar New Year and create a favourable environment for deepening reforms. The moves appear to roll back many of the sweeping reforms worked out last year following the Communist Party's decision to embrace a capitalistic market economy. Local analysts expressed concern about Beijing's decision but said the impact on Hong Kong would be limited. K.L. Wong, an economist at Sun Hung Kai Research, said the move would affect regions in different ways. "The decision is quite important to the people in northern China because they have suffered most from inflation." Benjamin Chan, senior economist at the Bank of East China, did not think the moves were major setbacks, saying they were necessary to stabilise prices. The economists agreed that the impact of the move on Hong Kong business would be limited. State-run media and senior Chinese officials have recently joined a growing chorus in expressing fears that the current economic reforms may lead to spiralling inflation and social unrest. Premier Li Peng warned that rapid strides in price reform would cause instability and the fast pace of freeing controls in 1994 would continue only as long as consumers could bear the inevitable inflation. The government reimposed controls on the price of grain and other staple foods in late December, after watching them soar 30 to 40 per cent in a month. Top Chinese economic officials promised yesterday to push inflation below 10 per cent this year, despite mounting inflationary pressure. But they warned regional authorities of the possibility of social instability as a side-effect of China's economic reforms. Meanwhile, President Jiang Zemin has called for reasonable pricing in the consumer market because it affects people's living standards and social stability, the China Daily reports in today's issue.
