FR940318-0-00243 FR940318-0-00024 III. Provisions of the Rule A. Activities for Cost Recovery EPA is setting in place a mechanism by which, under phased-in implementation, the Agency shall recover its full annual operating costs by the end of the fifth year. By means of the fees established in this final rule, EPA intends to recover a portion of both direct and indirect costs for the various activities conducted under both the RMP and RCP programs. Direct costs include personnel benefits and salaries, travel, equipment costs, and contractor expenses. Indirect costs are those resources, outside of direct program costs, used to manage, oversee, and provide counsel to program offices. These include costs such as those incurred by EPA's management, administrative, policy, and research staff. Indirect costs also include overhead costs, such as utilities and rents. In this rule, EPA sets fees to partially recover operating costs for the RMP and RCP programs. The Agency is initially setting fees at partial cost recovery levels in this rule in response to concerns expressed in comments about the negative impacts that proposed full-cost recovery fee levels would have on the participation of organizations in the proficiency programs. However, EPA is authorized by section 305 of the TSCA to recover its full operating costs. Therefore, the Agency shall adjust user fee levels each year over the next five year period to ultimately recover all of its annual costs to operate the proficiency programs. The period of time between the promulgation of this rule and the establishment of full cost recovery fees should enable the radon industry to adjust gradually to the burden of paying fees, thus maintaining sufficient radon measurement and mitigation service capacity to meet consumer demand and, at the same time, assuring some level of recovery of EPA program costs. The mechanism used for setting fees for each of these programs is to calculate their average costs, which are defined as the total cost of the activities of the programs divided by the expected number of participants in the program. In the proposed rule, EPA indicated an intent to charge fees that were lower than the average full cost to EPA for the RCP program and the classroom and field radon training courses for the first year of fee collection. EPA no longer offers the classroom and field radon training courses and therefore, will not specify a fee for these training courses in this final rule. Subsequent to publication of the proposed rule, EPA added individual proficiency elements to the RMP Program. Because TSCA requires EPA to impose fees on all persons applying for a proficiency rating, an annual fee for this portion of the program is included in this final rule. Specific activities for cost recovery for each program are described below. A detailed description of costs and how they were calculated is presented below in section V of this preamble, entitled ``Economic Impacts'' and in the Economic Impact Analysis of the Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993. 1. National Radon Measurement Proficiency Program The costs for this program include both direct and indirect costs, such as salaries and equipment, and a proportion of indirect costs. Direct costs include printing, mailing, and processing applications; calibration, exposure of detectors and measurement analysis; notification of results; update and maintenance of the data base; and, preparation of the proficiency report. Indirect costs include management and supervisory costs. EPA's total cost for the RMP program for Fiscal Year 1992 was estimated at $1.6 million. As of October 1991, EPA had listed approximately 1,200 primary device applications and approximately 1,000 secondary firm applications. If the RMP fees were set at a full cost recovery level in the first year (as considered under Option 2 of the Economic Impact Analysis of Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993), the fee for a primary device application would be about $1,825 per application, and a fee of $250 would be assessed for each secondary firm applying to the RMP program. The difference between the fees for primary devices and secondary firms reflect differences in EPA's costs to process each type of applicant through the RMP program. 2. Individual Measurement Proficiency The costs for this component of the RMP program include both direct and indirect costs, such as salaries, and a proportion of indirect costs. Direct costs cover exam administration, periodic updates, proficiency reports, and data base management. Indirect costs include management and supervisory costs. The total cost of the individual proficiency component of the RMP program in Fiscal Year 1992 was estimated to be $435,000. As of October 1991, it was estimated that approximately 1,500 individuals would participate in the individual proficiency program in FY92. The full cost recovery fee for this program would be about $290 per individual. 3. National Radon Contractor Proficiency Program The costs for this program include both direct and indirect costs, such as salaries, and a proportion of indirect costs. Direct costs cover such activities as periodic updates, exam administration, proficiency reports, and data base management. Indirect costs include management and supervisory costs. The total cost for the RCP program was estimated to be $552,000 in fiscal year 1992. Estimated participation in this program is about 700 as of October 1991. The full cost recovery fee for this program would be about $790 per individual. B. Fee Schedule The Agency had to weigh a number of factors in establishing the following fee schedule. On the one hand, EPA is committed to ensuring a sufficient number of proficient radon measurement and mitigation organizations and individuals are available for consumers. On the other hand, EPA is authorized to assess fees to recover its costs associated with operating the RMP and RCP programs.
