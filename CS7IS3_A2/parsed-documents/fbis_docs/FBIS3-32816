Until a few weeks ago President Gaviria enjoyed a prestige and popularity not very common for a president so close to the end of his term. He was way ahead, perhaps too far ahead. In less than a month his radiant image has dimmed noticeably. The airplane episode [in which musicians traveled on government aircraft] and the Juanchaco problem -- the disappointment ["Juanchasco" -- play on Spanish word chasco] -- has eroded presidential credibility. Paraphrasing the latest vallenato [Colombian folk dance] tune, one could say that the bottom has fallen out of Gaviria's popularity. The truth is that it is regrettable. But one could see something of the sort coming. I hate quoting myself, but 15 days ago I warned in this column that one got the impression that the president was slacking off certain affairs and that it was not advisable to let go of the reigns of power in a country as unpredictable as ours. Among other reasons, this is because there is nothing so fickle as public opinion about a president and any negligence in an area sensitive to public opinion can wipe away any prestige in a matter of days. The affair dealing with the presidential airplane -- one of those slips that public opinion tolerate less and less from politicians and presidents -- has taken a back seat in the face of the Juanchaco affair following the unanimous decision by the State Council to request the Chamber of Deputies Accusation Commission to investigate the president's conduct. This is how a white lie, the negligent and light treatment of a potentially explosive topic, became a crisis of state in a delicate legal-political process that can end up as a trial against the president by Congress for violation of the country's Constitution and national sovereignty. If the country is spoken to clearly and frankly on the presence of U.S. military units in Juanchaco and if the people are told directly why they are here or even told that they are here to help us fight drug trafficking and terrorism, I am sure that a very positive current of opinion would have been generated in favor of the arrival of the corps of engineers military battalion. But when trivial explanations or artful subterfuge are resorted to, when legal entities are bypassed for the sake of commodity or ease, and when contradictions and inconsistencies begin to appear, public opinion starts to become distrustful and critical. The fact is that nobody, even if they are in total favor of the U.S. military presence, likes to be told half truths or have the pill sweetened. Openness is what was lacking right from the start. Such a fashionable concept was totally absent, especially in the statements of many high-ranking government officials who forgot to apply it when they should have remembered it the most. The closest presidential advisers are to blame in this regard. Perhaps they have been too naive, dull, or slow, or they are simply inexperienced. The lack of a more open and honest attitude with the public during difficult moments has affected the Gaviria administration on other occasions. The blackout, Escobar's escape, and the presidential plane incident have been situations in which Colombians got the impression that they were being cheated. It is true that every time this impression has become general, the president has faced up to things and has called news conferences to clear any doubts. But it is always difficult to erase the initial bad taste of knowing that someone was trying to deceive you. This said, I should add that I believe the Juanchaco situation is being blown out of proportion. It seems as though we are being invaded militarily by an enemy foreign power. But anything is possible in a country where more value is given to the form than the spirit of the law. We should not forget either the repeated tensions between the Executive Branch and the State Council, whose statement will create a difficult political situation for the president, particularly because we are in an electoral campaign toward the end of an administration. This is the time in which all opportunisms emerge, new opposition members sprout, and everywhere the most unsuspected defenders of national sovereignty appear. The electoral use of the Juanchaco episode should not convince anyone. Its political use is too obvious and clumsy. That the campaign against the "yankee invasion" is being led by those who are encouraging the terrorist destruction of our economic infrastructure -- which is truly vital for our sovereignty -- is just another depressing chapter in this electoral chauvinism. It is sad, ironic, and certainly unfair that a good and capable president must suffer all these hardships toward the end of his mandate. Everything indicated that Gaviria would finish his presidential period with flying colors. However, instead of being carried out on people's shoulders through the big door, he suddenly ends up gored in the infirmary. The reason behind this is that this mad bull called Colombia charges without warning and gores treacherously. That is why it is always advised to take the bull by the horns without letting go for a minute until the next bullfighter comes along -- never before then.
