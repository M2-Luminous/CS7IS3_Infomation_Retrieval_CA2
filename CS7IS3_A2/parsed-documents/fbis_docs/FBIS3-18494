This facility is to be built and operated by private companies. According to a government spokesman, the plant is supposed to be built in Louisiana. The German-British-Dutch company Urenco is involved in the project. The goal is to slightly enrich uranium in the plant by using the so-called gas-ultracentrifuge method, which is already being applied by Urenco. The fuel rods are intended for light-water nuclear power plants on the U.S. market. The framework agreement adopted by the Cabinet ensures that the operation of the facility will observe the nuclear nonproliferation treaty on the nonproliferation of weapons-grade material and that the safety measures of the International Atomic Energy Agency are taken into consideration. According to the spokesman, the facility is exclusively intended for the peaceful use of nuclear material.
