After listening to reports on the second stage of the debt solvency and opinions from the Finance Ministry, the Vietnam State Bank, the State Planning Commission, the Interior Ministry, the Supreme People's Organ of Control, the State Economic Arbitrators, and the State Finance and Monetary Council, the prime minister concluded as follows: The second stage of the debt solvency is a burdensome and very complicated issue. If it is not satisfactorily settled and quickly accomplished, its bad effects will be multiple. Therefore, the second stage of the debt solvency must be urgently conducted, solved, and basically concluded in 1994. In executing the second stage of the debt solvency, the government has mobilized a moderately large force of cadres. However, after more than one year, the task has still not been concluded. This is partly due to the complicated and difficult characteristics of the second stage. But on the other side, it is also due to the lack of regular checks, encouragement, and guidance from different organs from the central to local levels, including the Standing Central Steering Committee for Debt Solvency. They still wait for the government to solve the bad debts. This is a great shortcoming of leaders of all echelons and levels. Therefore, it is necessary to solemnly review this responsibility. In executing the second stage, the Standing Central Steering Committee for Debt Solvency must coordinate with related ministries and sectors to compile the necessary legal documents before presentation to the government for issuance to create a basis for the debt solvency committees at all levels to carry on their work. These documents must cover thoroughly all requirements and working principles. All objective and subjective causes of bad debts must be considered carefully in line with the related structure and policies in effect when the debts were raised. At the same time, we must be very strict in cases where violations have been intentionally committed or committed due to irresponsibility. We must classify each debt group for suitable measures. Debts among active state-run enterprises must be solved quickly, with proper attention paid to index adjustment and loan interests. We can provide some capital to create conditions for the debt settlement. Loans between active state-run enterprises with inactive or dissolved state-run enterprises, other organizations, and individuals must be separately listed before applying resolute and final measures with clear instructions to reclaim the money or settle the debts with assets, capital, land, or goods. In these cases, we must establish the responsibility of each sector, level, and individual, including administrative measures and legal proceedings against incumbent officials. After that, debts will continue to be collected. The rest of the debt which is unable to be collected will be considered for subsidy from the government. While doing this, the responsibility of every sector and echelon must be clearly established to restore order and discipline in the state mechanism and purify the contingent of cadres, especially the cadres who manage the state finance and assets. In dealing with debt solvency, the responsibilities of both sides must be established. Causes for prolonged debt must be defined by the debtors and favorable conditions must be actively created so that the debtors can repay their debts. Reasons from both sides, debtors and creditors, must be established for better dealing. In the implementation process, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet stressed the organization management of the debt solvency committees at all levels. If necessary, their power must be increased so that they can work better with other sectors and echelons. The number of specialized cadres sent to the standing debt solvency groups must be reviewed. A necessary number of cadres must be retained to carry on the work. After receiving instructions from the cabinet, the CSCDS will hold meetings with 10 provinces with acute problems in their debt solvency and with some key ministries and departments to execute the second stage of the debt solvency.
