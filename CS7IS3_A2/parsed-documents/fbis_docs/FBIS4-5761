This signifies a modification of the past concept of "calling for NTT to be responsible for the next-generation communications infrastructure." The Communications Policy Section is working at a rapid pace in concluding its work on the "Plan for a Japanese edition of the Information Infrastructure," a so-called Japanese Information Infrastructure (JII), in competition with the National Information Infrastructure (NII) proposed by Vice President Gore. The plan examines 21st century concepts such as who will build the optical fiber cable network and at what pace? Seminars concerning multimedia are being held actively by coalition party Diet members such as those belonging to the Shinseito, Japan New Party and Sakigake. The Information-Communications Working Section of the government's Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, chaired by Prime Minister Hosokawa, will promote JII from the standpoint of deregulation. It seems that we will see a rush of new policy launchings concerning multimedia at the sacrifice of existing projects. MOPT officials such as Kanichiro Aritomi, chief, Policy Section, Communications Policy Bureau, does not conceal his sense of crisis in saying, "There is a need to organize a major joint government-industry project to catch up with the United States which has established a lead in this area." However, the seed for the information super highway concept created in the United States, in reality, originated in Japan. The concept was originally born as the Visual Intelligent and Personal (VI&P) Communications Services launched by NTT in October 1990. The service envisioned the laying of optical fiber cables in homes by the year 2015 and the provision of television shopping and remote medical treatment through television images. It envisioned all of the elements now addressed for the multimedia society. Those sources engaged in the VI&P plan admit, "The concept involved a degree of `pie in the sky.'" The original plan called for linkage of "40 percent of households" to the optical fiber network, but when the plan was announced it gave the impression that "all households" would be connected to the network. That took place when Japanese industry was believed to occupy a superior position under Japan-U.S. competitive situations. When Senator Gore learned of Japan's plan to connect Japanese homes to optical cable systems, he sensed a strong feeling of crisis. Critical U.S. sensitivities were jolted by "Japanese pie-in-the-sky concepts." Both JII and VI&P are scheduled for completion in 2015, but it was not mere coincidence that this is the case. In January 1993, immediately prior to assuming the vice presidency of the United States, Gore energetically asserted in a speech at the University of California at Los Angeles that, "If the United States should command leadership in the information-communications area, we can increase domestic employment, rebuild our exporting competitiveness and once again export products to Japan and Latin America." Quick action was taken in announcing U.S. government action plans in September 1993 and submitting NII-related legislation in January 1994. Now, the ball thrown by the United States bounced back into the Japanese court as a "government-industry crisis." Surprised by the developments in the Gore plan, the MOPT announced that, "optical fiber cables will be linked to households by the year 2010, five years earlier than originally scheduled." Amidst a heated exchange of conceptual statements concerning this area which involved government prestige and the exchange of statements like a ping pong ball, we witnessed the rapid spread of enthusiasm for multimedia based on exaggerations and misunderstandings. Professor Hirobumi Takahashi, former NTT official and currently on the staff of the Integrated Information Faculty of Kansai University, points out, "Even the goal of 2015 was in doubt, but the U.S. NII concept inspired Japan into taking action." However, there are crucial differences between the United States and Japan. Board member Norio Murakami of Japan DEC states, "The United States has three systems which it can use to build its next-generation infrastructure, whereas Japan has only one available system." The three systems available in the United States are based on cable television (CATV), Internet, and the major communications firms. CATV firms, servicing 57 million households with a market penetration rate of 60 percent, have launched experiments to tie into communication systems. The world's largest computer communications network, known as Internet, is in the process of adapting computer imaging services. The AT&T long-distance carrier, AT&T born as a result of the split up of AT&T in 1984, and the seven regional telephone companies are in the process of devising a variety of new highly functional services under the pressure of competition. The ultimate goal for each of these three services is the same. That goal is embodied in multimedia communications providing for the integrated transmission of alphabetical and numerical data along with images and voices. On the other hand, in the case of Japan, urban multichannel CATV subscribers total just over 1 million, while personal computer modem connections total 2 million--incomparably fewer than in the United States. Comparable figures exist only in the area of telephone services provided by NTT. Differences between Japan and the United States are vast. That is why we must assume bold policies which will nurture the competitive strength of and stimulate competitiveness on the part of NTT. The European Union (EU) requested the chief executive officers of the 19 leading European communications firms to prepare a European Information Infrastructure (EII). A plan patterned after the U.S. NII is scheduled for submission by June. Even Europe has started action to make up for lost time after seeing moves made by Japan and the United States in building information infrastructures. International infrastructure competition is assuming a colorful start in connection with NII, JII, EII, and multimedia.
