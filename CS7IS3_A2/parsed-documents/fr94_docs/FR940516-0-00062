The equipment or systems, if employing synchronous transmission techniques, conform to one of the ANSI or ITU&hyph;T approved standards or recommendations for ``SONET'' or ``SDH''; f. Measuring, test or repair equipment controlled by 5B01.c or 5B02 and controlled spare parts remain under the supervision of the licensee or the licensee's designated representative; g. The licensee or the licensee's designated representative have the right of access to all the equipment or systems and may carry out inspections; h. Upon the request of the Office of Export Licensing, the licensee must carry out inspections to establish that: 1.
