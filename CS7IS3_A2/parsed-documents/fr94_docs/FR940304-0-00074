FR940304-0-00074 FR940304-0-00019 Historically, Ochrosia kilaueaensis has been collected on the northern slope of Hualalai and on the eastern slope of Mauna Loa. There is one known extant population located at Puu Waawaa on State-owned land and consisting of an unknown number of individuals (HHP 1991q1, 1991q2). This species typically grows in koa- and 'ohi'a- or lama-dominated Montane Mesic Forests at elevations between 2,200 and 4,000 ft (670 and 1,220 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, HHP 1991q1, 1991q2, Wagner et al. 1990). Associated species include 'aiea, kauila, Gardenia brighamii (nanu), and Psychotria hawaiiensis (kopiko) (HHP 1991q1). The major threats to Ochrosia kilaueaensis are competition from alien species such as fountain grass, browsing by feral goats, fire, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single existing known population (Bruegmann 1990, CPC 1990). Gray (1862) named Plantago pachyphylla var. hawaiiensis and P. pachyphylla var. hawaiiensis subvar. gracilis based on specimens collected on the island of Hawaii during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841 and by Remy in the 1850s, respectively. Leveille (1911) published P. gaudichaudiana based on another specimen from the island of Hawaii. In 1923, Pilger raised the taxon to specific rank, resulting in P. hawaiensis, and also published a new variety, var. laxa (Pilger 1937). The specific epithet refers to the island where the plant grows. In the current treatment of the genus, only P. hawaiensis is accepted (Wagner et al. 1990). Plantago hawaiensis of the plantain family (Plantaginaceae), a perennial herb which grows from a stout short stem, has thick, leathery, narrowly oval or oblong leaves located at the base of the plant which measure 3 to 8.7 in (7.5 to 22 cm) long and usually 0.6 to 1.3 in (1.5 to 3.2 cm) wide. The flowering stalk is 7.9 to 35 in (20 to 90 cm) long and is topped by a spike usually 5.9 to 9 in (15 to 23 cm) long. Each upward pointing flower, subtended by a single bract 0.08 to 0.1 in (2.1 to 2.6 mm) long, has a four-lobed calyx 0.06 to 0.09 in (1.6 to 2.2 mm) long and a trumpet-shaped corolla about 0.04 in (1 mm) long. The capsule, 0.1 to 0.2 in (2.6 to 4 mm) long and projecting from the calyx, opens to release four to six dull black seeds about 0.04 in (1 mm) long and winged on one end. This species is distinguished from other endemic and naturalized species of the genus in Hawaii by its perennial herbaceous habit; its thick leathery leaves; its upward pointing flowers; and its capsules which project from the calyx (Wagner et al. 1990). Historically, Plantago hawaiensis was found only on the island of Hawaii on the southern slope of Mauna Kea; the northeastern, southeastern, and southern slopes of Mauna Loa; and the western slope of Hualalai. Today, the species is known to occur on the Humuula Saddle, in the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, and near the Keapohina Upland on privately and State-owned land. The four extant populations extend over a distance of approximately 14 by 4 mi (23 by 6 km). There are no more than 10 known individuals (HHP 1991r1 to 1991r6). This species typically grows in boggy conditions in Montane Wet Herblands or in Montane Dry Shrublands dominated by koa or 'ohi'a trees of short stature, or sometimes in lava cracks, at elevations between 5,900 and 6,400 ft (1,800 and 1,950 m) (HHP 1991r1, 1991r2, 1991r4, 1991r6, Wagner et al. 1990). The major threat to Plantago hawaiensis is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations. Portulaca sclerocarpa was first collected during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841 and was named by Gray (1854). The specific epithet refers to the hardened capsule.
