FBIS4-23610 "drafr113_a_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-113 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Heavy Fighting Continues in Kigali; Massacre Reported Heavy Fighting Continues in Kigali; Massacre Reported Rebels Maintain Siege Around Gitarama AB1206173594 Paris AFP in English 1647 GMT 12 Jun 94 AB1206173594 Paris AFP English BFN [By Annie Thomas] [Text] Kigali, June 12 (AFP) -- Rebels from the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) heavily shelled the capital Kigali Sunday [12 June] while maintaining their siege around Gitarama, the strategic town where the interim government has set up its headquarters. Major Jean-Guy Plante, spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), said interim Prime Minister Jean Kambanda was still in Gitarama although interim President Theodore Sindikubwabo and several ministers had left the city earlier in the week. He said officially, Sindikubwabo and his entourage are to spend about a week in northwestern Gisenyi before returning to Gitarama, located 50 kiLometres (30 miles) south of the capital. The mainly Hutu interim government established its headquarters in Gitarama last month after the Tutsi-dominated RPF began to close in on the capital. The rebels since then have taken control of areas south of Gitarama and on Saturday opened a new front to the northwest of the town. A well-informed military source meanwhile said that "tons and tons of munitions" have been reaching the rebel headquarters in Milundi in the last three weeks, enough to allow the RPF to continue fighting "for another year." The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said government troops were also probably receiving weapons and munitions, without which they could not continue fighting back. He did not name the country where the weapons originated. UNAMIR officials would neither confirm nor deny the report, which if proven true would constitute a violation of a UN weapons embargo imposed on May 17. "I have no information on this subject," Plante said. Five rounds of UN-brokered peace talks aimed at ending the interethnic conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives since April 6 have so far proven fruitless. Another round of talks is to begin Monday with leaders from both camps expected to participate. Military sources said it is unlikely the rebels would agree to lay down their weapons before capturing Gitarama, which is strategically located, and would mark a symbolic victory for them. The RPF is also demanding a stop to ongoing massacres of civilians in government-held territory. Despite pressure by the international community, the carnage has persisted unabated with the RPF also accused of executing its opponents. The rebels meanwhile have continued making gains on the ground and on Sunday shelled Kigali, which is still held by government troops. Four shells landed near the Red Cross hospital in Kigali, where government troops have placed heavy weapons. Previous shelling of the area killed two local Red Cross employees. Two districts where government troops massacred Tutsi refugees in recent days were also being targeted by the rebels over the weekend. The UN has said it is powerless to try and evacuate other refugees trapped in the region. Rwanda plunged into an ethnic bloodbath on April 6, after a plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi was apparently shot down, killing both leaders.
