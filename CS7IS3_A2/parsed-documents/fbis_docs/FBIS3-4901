"We are not obligated to show the country schedule to the U.S. side, and we have not done so," a ministry official said. The vernacular daily KUNGMIN ILBO quoted Economic Planning Board and Agriculture Ministry officials as saying that the country schedule was given to the United States even before it was revealed domestically. Seoul had waited to reveal the schedule to GATT headquarters until after the major trade negotiators -- the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union -- handed in their plans. Officials here were analyzing the U.S. country schedule and initially agreed that revision of the original draft was unnecessary. They said Seoul may present its schedule as early as Thursday.
