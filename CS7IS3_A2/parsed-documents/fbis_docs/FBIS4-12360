General Joseph Hoare, commander of the U.S. Central Command, arrived in Cairo on a secret visit. He was followed by General Klaus Naumann [name as published], German chief of staff, whose visit was announced. AL-SHA'B has learned that the U.S. official's talks in Egypt dealt with broadening the scope of participation in the Bright Star maneuvers to include, in addition to Egypt and the United States, Germany, Britain, and France. Following Egypt's approval, the German official came to put the final touches on what had already been agreed upon regarding his country's participation in the maneuvers. Germany hopes to gain from these exercises training expertise in the face of the Islamic movements in North Africa. According to information, Egypt's approval to increase the number of Western states participating in the exercises was conditional on the participation of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Egypt also wanted the exercise to be general and not directed at facing any regional threat, unlike the previous Bright Star exercises, which were directed against what was called the Libyan threat! Explaining the benefits that the participation of Germany, France, Britain, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in these exercises could provide, the Egyptian side claimed that it would stress the continued reliance of the Western allies on Egyptian facilities! It will also enable Egypt to get better acquainted with the combat methods of the advanced states and allow the military commanders from the participating states to get together, which could convince the United States of the importance of Egypt's participation in safeguarding Gulf security! This step, officials claim, will prompt the United States to supply Egypt with its military needs. AL-SHA'B has learned that Britain's participation in the exercises depends on resolving the problems related to the naval training protocol signed by Cairo and London. The British insist that the British military personnel training on Egyptian territory not be subject to Egyptian law and refuses reciprocal treatment for Egyptian military on British territory.
