FR940930-1-00058 FR940930-1-00016 34. Are there other performance requirements that should be considered in addressing the safety hazards of electric shock in EVs as a result of a crash or rollover, or during repair or maintenance? If so, please describe them. Possible Requirements for Conversions After First Sale to Consumers In the case of EVs converted after first sale to a consumer, where the ``make inoperative'' requirements apply, it may not be practical to test for electric shock safety through a crash test since this would destroy the converted vehicle. Design oriented requirements may be more appropriate. Comments are requested on possible approaches for EVs with a GVWR of 4536 kg or less, and all EV school buses regardless of weight. 35. Please provide the information requested in Questions 27&hyph;34 above, as it applies to EVs converted after the first sale to a consumer. 36. Are there other design requirements that should be considered in addressing the safety hazards of electric shock in EV conversions as a result of a crash or rollover, or during repair or maintenance? If so, please describe them. EVs With GVWR Greater Than 4536 Kilograms In this section comments are requested in response to items 20 through 36 above, as they apply to original equipment EVs and EV conversions with GVWR greater than 4536 kilograms, excluding EV school buses. These include transit buses, intercity buses, trucks, and other heavy vehicles. NHTSA requests information on this group of vehicles separately, since there may be potential electric shock hazards, and possible solutions, which are unique to such heavy vehicles. 37. Please provide the information requested in Questions 20&hyph;36 above, as it applies to EVs with a GVWR greater than 4536 kg, excluding EV school buses. 38. Are there unique safety hazards among EVs of this size and type? Should these types of EVs be regulated for electric shock hazard in a crash or rollover, or during repair and maintenance? If so, how? C. Other Other information on EVs is requested for both original equipment EVs and EV conversions of all sizes, addressing hybrid electric vehicles, standards and guidelines, EV populations, charging, batteries, and starter interlock performance, as follows: Hybrid Electric Vehicles 39. Are there unique safety problems presented by hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) relative to electrolyte spillage or electric shock? An HEV is one which can operate on electric power, another fuel such as gasoline, or both. Are there any unique safety problems which could occur when both fuel sources are being utilized? Are there other potential safety problems which should be considered relative to HEVs, or EVs equipped with range extenders? Please discuss.
