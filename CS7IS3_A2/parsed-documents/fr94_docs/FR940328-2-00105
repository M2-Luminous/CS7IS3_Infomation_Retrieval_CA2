FR940328-2-00105 FR940328-2-00059 Tax on Certain Imported Substances; Filing of Petitions AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the acceptance, under Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, of petitions requesting that tetrahydrofuran and 1,4 butanediol be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Publication of this notice is in compliance with Notice 89&hyph;61. This is not a determination that the list of taxable substances should be modified. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing relating to these petitions must be received by May 27, 1994. Any modification of the list of taxable substances based upon these petitions would be effective October 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments and requests for a public hearing to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (Petition), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The petitions were received on December 27, 1993. The petitioner is E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. The following is a summary of the information contained in the petitions. The complete petitions are available in the Internal Revenue Service Freedom of Information Reading Room. Tetrahyrofuran HTS number: 2932.11.00.00 CAS number: 109&hyph;99&hyph;9 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals methane and acetylene. Tetrahyrofuran is a liquid produced predominantly by the reaction of acetylene (derived from methane in natural gas) with formaldehyde made by air oxidation and dehydrogenation of methanol (derived from methane in natural gas) producing the intermediate butynediol which is in turn reacted with hydrogen (derived from methane in natural gas) to produce 1,4 butanediol. The 1,4 butanediol is ring closed using an acid catalyst to produce tetrahydrofuran. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 2 H 2 (acetylene) + 3 CH 4 (methane) + 0.5 O 2 (oxygen) + 2 H 2 O (water) c C 4 H 8 O (tetrahydrofuran) + 5 H 2 (hydrogen) + CO 2 (carbon dioxide) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 58.7 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $5.28 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for acetylene of 0.40 and a conversion factor for methane of 0.97. 1,4 butanediol HTS number: 2905.39.10.00 CAS number: 110&hyph;63&hyph;4 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals methane and acetylene. 1,4 butanediol is a liquid produced predominantly by the reaction of acetylene (derived from methane in natural gas) with formaldehyde made by air oxidation and dehydrogenation of methanol (derived from methane in natural gas) producing the intermediate butynediol which is in turn reacted with hydrogen (derived from methane in natural gas) to produce 1,4 butanediol. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: 3 CH 4 (methane) + C 2 H 2 (acetylene) + 3 H 2 O (water) + 0.5 O 2 (oxygen) c C 4 H 10 O 2 (1,4 butanediol) + 5 H 2 (hydrogen) + CO 2 (carbon dioxide) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 51.3 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $4.20 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for methane of 0.77 and a conversion factor for acetylene of 0.32. Dale D.
