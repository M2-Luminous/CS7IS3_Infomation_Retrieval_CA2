Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi and the forthcoming signing of the treaty between Georgia and Russia have become the subject of discussion at the meeting in the Foreign Ministry between A. Kozyrev and leaders of the North Caucasus republics. They expressed their critical attitude toward the draft treaty. Meeting with some of the participants in the meeting, our correspondent asked them to explain their position. Akhsarbek Galazov, president of the Republic of North Ossetia: "I believe that Russia should not sign any treaty with Georgia until there is a political settlement of the problem of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. If a treaty is signed clearly determining the fate of these two republics and they finally receive a political settlement of their problems -- I am wholly in favor. "I believe that South Ossetia should be recognized as a republic and that through the joint efforts of Georgia and Russia an economic basis should be placed under that decision, that the regions which were in fact seized should be returned to South Ossetia and all refugees should return. "Second, and that is perhaps the main thing, we are also in favor of Georgia's integrity. But it will not be preserved as a single state unless the Georgian people's leaders realize that they must consider realities. After all, in fact Abkhazia and South Ossetia are now outside Georgia. To ensure that they are part of Georgia they must sit down with them at the conference table, sign a treaty, and satisfy their peoples' demands to the maximum. "All questions existing today in the North Caucasus cannot be examined only within that region. The Caucasus is united and its division into the North Caucasus and the Transcaucasus seems to me utterly artificial. At the meeting at the Foreign Ministry there were statements in which Georgia was called the aggressor, with whom a treaty cannot be signed. And indeed, it did after all in fact perpetrate aggression. Seeking to drive non-Georgians out of South Ossetia, Georgia seized the territory of what was then still an autonomous oblast. "As for Abkhazia it was artificially joined to Georgia back in Soviet times and Georgia also perpetrated aggression against Abkhazia using the national extremists' forces. And we believe that today Russia should not sign a wide-ranging treaty with Georgia. The problems of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are closely, directly linked with Russia. Nearly all the North Caucasus republics, krays, and oblasts took part in the defense of Abkhazia. And what happened in Abkhazia has found a response in Adygeya, Karachayevo-Cherkesiya, Krasnodar and Stavropol krays, and Kabardino-Balkariya.... "And surely South Ossetia's troubles cannot be viewed in isolation from North Ossetia? Any shot in the south echoes in North Ossetia. For the fourth year now not a single kilogram of food, not a single tablet or tube of medicine has reached South Ossetia from Georgia, nor have necessities been arriving. South Ossetia is supplied via North Ossetia and is in fact maintained by Russia. So surely Russia cannot sign a treaty until the problems of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are settled?" Magomedali Magomedov, chairman of the Republic of Dagestan Supreme Soviet: "Before discussing the draft treaty we were not familiarized with it in advance. I believe that as a whole the treaty is aimed at establishing normal mutual relations between Russia and Georgia. But we are worried by the position of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and we said that agreements with the Georgian leadership should be reached on these issues, that is these questions should not be bypassed when concluding a treaty". Vladimir Khubiyev, chairman of the Karachayevo-Cherkess Republic Council of Ministers: "I think that reason will nonetheless triumph and a political solution will be found for ensuring these republics' peaceful coexistence and the rights of each republic should be as they are determined by the peoples themselves -- of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Georgia. Now is not the time when someone can be switched to someone else's subordination and when a big nation can dictate its will to a small people. I know the opinion of the Abkhazians -- both the ordinary citizens and the leaders. They all, down to the last person, favor independence. In what form is another question."
