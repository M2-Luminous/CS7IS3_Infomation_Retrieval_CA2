On his last day of activities, the Mexican president was the main speaker at the forum's morning session. In his speech he pointed out the need for greater North-South coordination in matters related to technology, industrial production, and monetary and fiscal policy. He stressed that since 1990 the world has been changing, and, in turn, Mexico has decided to be bold in promoting its international trade policies. This is why it stepped up the negotiations on NAFTA which was implemented on 1 January. Salinas said: "Faithful to its diversification policy, Mexico has already signed a trade agreement with Chile and has made progress in similar projects with Colombia, Venezuela, and the Central American nations." He also stressed the reform process undertaken by his government in recent years, and he pointed out the importance of fitting together economic, political, and social reforms. "This means achieving economic efficiency with social justice," he noted. At the forum, Salinas de Gortari also made reference to the events taking place in the Mexican southern state of Chiapas, indicating it is a local problem in a region that suffers extreme poverty. He asserted that to resolve this conflict "wrong methods used in other parts of the world in the fifties and sixties and even in the seventies will not be used." Although it is true that there are economic and social inequalities in Chiapas, the Zapatist National Liberation Army revolt "is not an Indian revolt but, rather, it is a trained revolt, prepared and led by a group that upholds a radical ideology." After taking part in the World Economic Forum, the Mexican president concluded his working visit, which even included a series of interviews with diverse international personalities. Salinas de Gortari met with a group of important businessmen at an event organized by the Mexican Investment Council, led by its president Jaime Alatorre. Salinas de Gortari also met with Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto with whom he took up both nations' bilateral relations. They also discussed in a cordial fashion other issues of common interest. During his meeting with OECD Director Jean Claude Paye, he discussed the world economic outlook, the evolution of the Mexican economy, and the process Mexico must go through to join that organization, slated for the second half of 1994. President Salinas de Gortari also met with Switzerland's Foreign Minister Flavio Cotta, during which the economic and political process in Europe was analyzed. He also held a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on the Middle East peace process. He also met with Leon Brittan, head of the EC Trade Commission, with whom he discussed the process of European integration as well as Mexico's economic and trade relations with that region. At the conclusion of his activities at Davos, the Mexican president traveled to Zurich to board the Mexican Air Force's TP-01 "Presidente Juarez" presidential plane to return to the Mexican capital where he is expected to arrive tonight.
