FR940302-0-00018 FR940302-0-00007 PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION 29 CFR Part 2647 RIN 1212&hyph;AA38 Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability AGENCY: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's regulation on Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability (29 CFR part 2647) establishes procedures under which covered multiemployer pension plans may adopt rules, subject to PBGC approval, for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability, and establishes standards for PBGC approval of such rules. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 directs the PBGC to prescribe such procedures and standards. The amendment allows covered multiemployer pension plans to develop their own rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability, and also provides less restrictive time limits on employer' applications to plans for abatement of complete withdrawal liability. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ralph L. Landy, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026; (202) 326&hyph;4127 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 4203 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'' or ``the Act''), sets forth the circumstances under which an employer is deemed to have completely withdrawn from a covered multiemployer pension plan. The amount of complete withdrawal liability is calculated under section 4211. Section 4207(a) requires the PBGC to provide by regulation for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability in the event that an employer that has withdrawn from a plan subsequently resumes covered operations under the plan or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan, to the extent that the PBGC determines that reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability is consistent with the purposes of ERISA. Section 4207(b) requires the PBGC to prescribe by regulation a procedure and standards for the amendment of plans to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability in the event that an employer that has withdrawn from a plan subsequently resumes covered operations under the plan or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan, to the extent such rules are consistent with the purposes of ERISA.
