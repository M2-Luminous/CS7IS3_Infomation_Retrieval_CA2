Mr. 'Arafat told the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva that he would hold further talks with the Israeli foreign minister, Shim'on Peres, in the Egyptian capital, Cairo. However, Israel has played down hopes of a final agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule. The Israeli prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, said time was needed to overcome differences, while one official said an accord could be weeks away. Mr. 'Arafat said on Monday [31 January] that a total agreement had been reached at talks in the Swiss resort of Davos, but that Mr. Peres asked for more time to study details of the text. In his speech to the Human Rights Commission he said the Palestinians were still suffering abuses in the occupied territories.
