The export quota, first imposed in fiscal 1981 amid growing friction between Japan and the U.S. over auto trade, is set at 1.65 million vehicles for fiscal 1993. But since fiscal 1987, Japan's car exports to the U.S. has fallen short of the quota, as Japanese automakers were boosting production at U.S. plants. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is to make a final decision on whether to eliminate the voluntary restraint after consulting with domestic automakers and reviewing ongoing bilateral trade talks on autos and auto parts, the sources said. As the "Big Three" U.S. automakers are regaining the competitive edge from the Japanese, their executives have voiced support for scrapping the export quota, despite stalled bilateral talks on auto and auto parts trade. Under the so-called framework negotiations, Tokyo and Washington remain at odds over the numerical targets demanded by Washington, but rejected by Tokyo, to measure progress in market opening.
