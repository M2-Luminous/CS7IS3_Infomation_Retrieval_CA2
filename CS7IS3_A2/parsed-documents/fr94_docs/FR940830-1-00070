FR940830-1-00070 FR940830-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 94&hyph;70; Notice 1] RIN 2127&hyph;AF35 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Door Locks and Door Retention Components AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 206, Door Locks and Door Retention Components , by extending and expanding the standard's existing side door requirements to the back doors of passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 4,536 kilograms (kg) (10,000 pounds (lb)) or less, including hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, and passenger vans. The purpose of the standard's requirements, which currently apply only to side doors, is to reduce the likelihood of occupants being ejected from vehicles in real-world crashes. A recent agency study indicates that each year there are nearly 150 fatalities in which an occupant is ejected through rear hatches, tailgates, and other back doors of these vehicles. This proposal seeks to reduce the number of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from such ejections by extending and expanding Standard No. 206's requirements for door locks and door retention components to back doors. Given the differences between side doors and back doors, the agency is proposing minor modifications in the performance requirements and test procedures to make them appropriate for back doors. DATES: Comment closing date: Comments on this notice must be received by NHTSA not later than October 31, 1994. Proposed effective date: The agency is considering an effective date of the first September 1 that occurs following a two year period beginning with the publication of a final rule in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbers set forth above and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 5109, Washington, DC 20590. Docket room hours are from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.
