However, this decision is directly linked to the adoption of a U.N. resolution on the el-Khalil tragedy, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said upon the completion of his working visit to the Middle East. The minister was to make a brief stopover in Rome last night, but did not do so on weather conditions. His plane made a short landing in Genoa. According to the reports of ANSA news agency, the minister summed up the first results of his Israeli visit, where he had a series of intensive consultations with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and the Tunisian visit, where he met PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat. In the opinion of Kozyrev, Israel and the PLO "showed an example of political responsibility and courage by deciding to resume the dialogue". It is necessary that the U.N. Security Council shows the same responsibility and adopts a resolution to denounce the events in el-Khalil in the immediate future, said Kozyrev. If the political aspect of the problem is settled, there will only technical details left. "So, the sooner the Security Council adopts the resolution the better," he said. As for the place and date of resumed negotiations and the level of delegations, they will be fixed by the interested sides. "We will accept any their decision to the effect and if requested are ready to offer assistance," said the Russian foreign minister. Kozyrev described as "very inspiring" the Israeli-PLO decision and said "it was more dramatic for Yasir 'Arafat". As for Kozyrev's negotiations with the PLO leader, they "were sincere and constructive". Kozyrev said he plans to meet U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher in Vladivostok on his way to Russia from China in order to discuss "their possible assistance to the Mideast negotiations at the current stage as the process co-sponsors".
