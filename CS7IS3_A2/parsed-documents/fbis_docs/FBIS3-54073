Is it to stall an Iraqi offensive for a few days, pending the arrival of aid from the allies, or to be a match for the enemy and inflict defeat on it? [Al-Mu'min] Relevant studies have been made and endorsed by the government. We are in the process of building a highly trained and technically advanced force with the potential of deterring aggression on Kuwait. We do have connections in the Gulf and wider Arab spheres, as well as with allies and friends. [Yasin] The way Kuwait has diversified the sources of its arms purchases leads one to believe the contracts were awarded to reward the allies for their role in the liberation of Kuwait. How much of a role does politics play in Kuwait's arms purchases? Were previous purchases something of a reward? [Al-Mu'min] The choice of one weapon over another is determined first and foremost by our defense requirements, as well as by quality. Without a doubt, the political factor does come into it, albeit only marginally. [Yasin] You are concentrating on sophisticated weapons in pursuit of quality. How do you think you can offset the deficit in manpower qualified to absorb complex military technology? [Al-Mu'min] We are indeed after such technologically sophisticated weaponry to make up for a deficit in manpower. I do not think, however, that the lack of personnel is that much of a problem. We conducted a survey, and it emerged that the human resources can be made available. We are now looking into how to institute incentives for a voluntary enlistment in the military. We need all the help we can get from the Kuwaiti people. Needless to say, joining the ranks of the military amounts to a career that may come in handy once a conscript is released from service. Compulsory service and reservists together make up a good percentage of the military's requirements for personnel. It is also possible to recruit civilians for bureaucratic duties in the rear lines. [Yasin] What are the ultimate military and political objectives you seek from the military training with the allied forces? [Al-Mu'min] The most important objective we seek from military training is to upgrade Kuwaiti military efficiency in general, with an emphasis on dealing with foreign military forces to gain experience and establish joint coordination on the command level, taking into consideration the experiences of Desert Storm. [Yasin] Has Kuwait benefited from the competition between the countries that export weapons? How this has taken place? [Al-Mu'min] Yes, and this style is used to open the door for competition between various countries in the field of military industry. This competition encourages the companies to present their best offers. I cannot define specific fields in which Kuwait benefited from this competition, but this is something possible during the field experiments and through armament offers to Kuwait. [Yasin] What military systems have been adopted by the Kuwaiti Army to ensure maximum benefit for the three fighting services when there is a need? [Al-Mu'min] The current systems reflect the importance of cooperation between the three fighting services. This was emphasized during joint training. Systems on the command level were worked out, and there are representatives of each force in all other forces. [Yasin] Iraq can produce a 150-km range missiles. How can this striking power, which is capable of hitting deep into Kuwait, be confronted? [Al-Mu'min] We can confront this threat through taking a host of negative and positive precautions. The negative precautions are represented in security precautions and improving warning systems. As for the positive precautions, they are represented in being equipped with weapons able to deal with the Iraqi missiles, and we do not hide this objective. [Yasin] The sea is seen as a main area from which Kuwaiti security can be penetrated. What stage has the process of reconstructing the Kuwait navy reached? [Al-Mu'min] The naval force's plans were decided after the naval force conducted studies on its needs to carry out its duties. The studies are in an advanced stage of evaluation, but selecting boats and ships is more complicated than selecting other weapons. Deciding their specifications needs more time, but we have to take into consideration the protection of our waters and maritime borders. [Yasin] Today is the third anniversary of the start of the liberation war, Desert Storm. What are the beneficial lessons of this war? Are these lessons being translated on the level of Kuwaiti military action?
