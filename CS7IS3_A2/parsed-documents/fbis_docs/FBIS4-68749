The greatest increases in prices for foodstuffs were registered in the Urals and East Siberian regions (1.8-2.2 percent) and Kaliningrad Oblast (3.3 percent); food prices remained at practically the same level in the Volga region. Prices for nonfood items went up most in the Central region and West Siberia (2.3-2.8 percent), while in East Siberia they remained practically unchanged over the week. Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the consumer market were as follows (percentage of the preceding date): 04/05 04/12 04/19 Average daily price rise April March Consumer goods 102.2 102.7 101.6 0.32 0.27 and services including: foodstuffs 101.4 101.2 101.3 0.19 0.20 nonfood items 101.9 102.4 101.9 0.28 0.34 for-fee 111.9 118.4 103.5 1.65 0.45 services for the population Since the beginning of the month prices have risen by 6.3 percent, including for foodstuffs--by 3.7 percent, nonfood items--by 5.4 percent, and for-fee services for the population--by 36.5 percent. Foodstuffs. Since the middle of March weekly price increases with respect to foodstuffs have become perceptibly smaller and amounted in Russia as a whole to 1.3 percent as compared to 3.2 percent in January-February. In April the rate of price increases for basic foodstuffs in nonorganized trade was almost twice as high as that in organized trade. Over the period 12 to 19 April prices in nonorganized trade rose by 2.1 percent, and in organized trade--by 1.1 percent. Price changes by main categories of food products are shown below (percentage of the preceding date): Total Including: in organized in nonorganized trade trade All food products 101.3 101.1 102.1 including: Meat and meat 101.2 101.0 101.7 products Fish and fish 100.4 100.4 99.7 products Milk and milk 101.4 101.2 102.8 products Eggs 100.7 100.8 99.9 Sugar 100.0 100.0 100.4 Bread and bakery 102.0 102.0 - products Cereals and 102.9 102.8 105.3 macaroni items Vodka 100.7 100.7 100.0 Potatoes and 103.2 102.9 103.7 vegetables In organized trade, similar to preceding weeks, vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate: prices for onions, beets, fresh cabbage, and carrots rose by 4-9 percent. Prices for some varieties of macaroni items, cereals, and bread and bakery products increased by 2-6 percent. There has been practically no change over the week in prices for meat, butter, vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, vodka, and potatoes. Since the beginning of the month prices for macaroni items, cereals, salt, fruit, and vegetables have increased by 8.5-13 percent; milk and milk products--by 4.9 percent; meat and fish products--by 2-2.6 percent. The average level of prices for sugar, eggs, and vodka changed insignificantly. Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases in nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh produce: for onions and garlic--by 11-13 percent, fresh cabbage and carrots--by 5-7 percent. The rate of price rises with respect to meat products increased somewhat in April (1.7 percent). Since the beginning of the month prices for these products have increased by 5 percent. Prices for milk products and eggs remained practically unchanged. The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs increased over the week by 2.1 percent and as of 19 April amounted to 46,900 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured a factor of 4.4; the highest cost was registered in Magadan (R126,200), the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R28,500). In terms of consumer basket cost, Moscow and St. Petersburg and Moscow ranked 32d and 40th among 132 monitored cities (R51,600 and R49,900 on a monthly basis). Nonfood Items Since February prices for nonfood items have been rising at a somewhat higher rate than those for foodstuffs. Over the elapsed week of April gasoline prices rose more significantly--by 5 percent. Prices for garments, knitwear, fabrics, and footwear rose over the week by 1.9-2.3 percent. Price rises with respect to cultural and household goods and tobacco items were insignificant (0.5-1.4 percent). Since the beginning of the month prices for main categories of nonfood items rose by 4-6 percent. For-Fee Services for the Population There were no significant price increases with respect to for-fee services over the elapsed week. Fees for consumer services increased by 2-3 percent; the cost of rail transportation, communication services, and sanitariums and resorts increased by 1.3-2.5 percent. Since the beginning of the month rates have increased almost 1.4-fold. Intercity train fares doubled, and rents in municipally owned apartments increased 1.5-fold. Electric power rates and notary fees changed insignificantly. Industrial Production. Over 17 days of April 1994, of the 163 most important categories of products counted in periodic reports, average daily production, as compared to the corresponding period of 1993: --increased with respect to eight items, (including metal-cutting machine tools with numeric program control, city telephone cables, video cassettes, school notebooks, pencils, and tea), or 5 percent of the total number; --decreased with respect to 149 items, or 91 percent of the total number; as compared to the corresponding period of March 1994: --increased with respect to 86 items (including coking coal, diesel fuel, steel, finished rolled metal, mineral fertilizer, synthetic ammonia, tires for trucks and agricultural vehicles, large electric machinery, alternate-current and low-power electric motors, self-propelled cranes, woodworking machine tools, freight railcars, automotive graders, buses, truck trailers and semi-trailers, tractor hitches, friction-free ball bearings, paper, matches, high-grade asbestos, cement, rolled roofing and insulation materials, decorative ceramic tile, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, electric vacuum cleaners, electric irons, radio receivers, tape recorders, bicycles, motorcycles, silk fabrics, nonwoven fabric-type materials, hosiery, coats and short coats, light coats, jackets, suits, dresses, slacks, shirts, skirts, footwear, meat, butter, high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese, canned meat and milk products, cereals, macaroni items, and vegetable oil), or 53 percent of the total number; --decreased with respect to 71 items, or 43 percent of the total number; Based on the dynamics of production of the most important varieties of industrial output, it is estimated that average daily production in industry over the elapsed period of April 1994 amounted to 74 percent of that for the corresponding period of last April. Output of main categories of industrial products over 17 days of April 1994 is characterized by the following data: Produced over As % of corresponding period (in 17 days of terms of average daily April 1994 production) of April 1993 March 1994 Electric power--billion 41.1 93 85 kw-hr Oil, including gas 13.2 82 98 condensate, million tonnes Natural gas, billion 30.0 98 97 cubic meters Coal, million tonnes 11.9 85 98 Steel, million tonnes 2.2 80 110 Finished rolled ferrous 1.7 81 112 metals, including destined for export, million tonnes Steel pipe, thousand 86.7 30 68 tonnes Large electric 127 57 168 machinery, units Metal-cutting machine 169 29 94 tools, units Passenger cars, thousand 36.3 77 92 units Tractors, thousand units 0.8 16 83 Chemical filament and 7.9 43 93 fiber, thousand tonnes Mineral fertilizer 410 83 136 (recalculated as 100-percent nutrient), thousand tonnes Automotive tires for 1.0 52 110 agricultural vehicles, motorcycles, and motorollers, million units Commercial timber, 2.6 61 77 million cubic meters solid wood Lumber, thousand cubic 439 70 89 meters Paper, thousand tonnes 111 78 114 Cement, million tonnes 1.5 76 116 Roof slate, million 41.2 22 68 standard tiles Construction brick, 318 68 91 million units of standard brick Rolled roofing and 18.2 63 169 insulation materials, million square meters Fabrics, total, million 96.5 67 93 square meters Hosiery, million pairs 14.3 72 106 Knitwear, million units 7.5 65 99.1 Footwear, million pairs 2.5 44 125 Television sets, 78.5 48 75 thousand units Radio receiving devices, 24.2 28 110 thousand units Refrigerators and 109 72 112 freezers, thousand units Electric vacuum 29.0 24 120 cleaners, thousand units Washing machines, 75.3 41 114 thousand units Meat, including 70.8 72 108 subproducts, category I, total, thousand tonnes Whole-milk products, 281 80 99.0 recalculated as milk, total, thousand tonnes Butter, total, thousand 15.0 64 118 tonnes Granulated sugar, 43.4 56 124 including quantities produced from customer-supplied material, thousand tonnes Over the elapsed period of March 1994 there was no production of drop forges with numeric program control, processing centers, gantry cranes with the lifting capacity of eight or more tonnes and automotive platform-mounted cranes, bulldozers, and trolley buses. Agriculture. Agricultural Producers Production Plans for 1994 Before the beginning of spring field work (as of 1 March of this year), statistical organs jointly with the Center for the Current State of the Economy under the Government of the Russian Federation conducted a survey of intentions of 1,117 agricultural enterprises and 1,510 peasant (private) farms on 20 territories of the country on the subject of production of agricultural output in 1994. The surveyed farms account for 5 percent of agricultural land in the country and represent all the main soil and climatic regions of Russia. The results obtained show that the surveyed agricultural enterprises intend to keep the planting of grain crops and sunflower at last year's level, and to reduce somewhat the planting of sugar beet (by 9 percent) and vegetables (by 5 percent). No expansion in the planting of fodder crops is planned. The gross yield may be negatively affected by the shortage of mineral fertilizer, and with respect to some crops also that of planting material. As of 1 March of this year, mineral fertilizer stocks at all surveyed enterprises as a whole amounted to no more than 30 percent of need. In animal husbandry, a slower rate of herd reduction is envisaged with respect to all varieties of livestock except sheep. The survey showed that peasant (private) farms, which have a lower level of material and technical support, show greater economic flexibility and intend to increase by 5 percent the planting of grain crops, particularly the planting of sugar beet and vegetables, while leaving sunflower planting at last year's level. The area they plan to use for planting of fodder crops is envisaged to increase by 15 percent. In animal husbandry farmers plan to increase the herd of main categories of livestock by the end of the year, especially the herd of swine. The selective survey program included evaluation of enterprises' financial and economic status. Almost 90 percent of surveyed agricultural enterprises believed that their financial and economic situation had worsened in 1993, and only 5 percent of enterprises said that it had improved. The overwhelming majority of enterprises (97 percent) appraised the state of animal husbandry as average or bad, and only 3 percent considered it good. The appraisal of the state of plant-growing was somewhat better: 61 percent of enterprises consider it average, 32 percent--bad, and 7 percent--good. Only 4 percent of surveyed agricultural enterprises believe that their situation will improve in 1994; 78 percent are convinced that it will get worse. Peasant farms view their situation in 1994 in a somewhat more optimistic light: One-quarter of them believe that their financial and economic situation will improve; however, one-half of farmers believe that it will get worse. Animal Husbandry In the first quarter of this year as compared to the analogous period of 1993 the volume of sales of livestock and poultry for slaughter declined at all categories of farms by an estimated 10 percent, production of milk--by 11 percent, and eggs--by 6 percent. At agricultural enterprises, which are the main producers of animal husbandry products, the volume of meat and milk production decreased by 15-16 percent, and eggs--by 6 percent: (in thousand tonnes) First quarter 1992 1993 1994 Livestock and poultry 1,860 1,609 1,346 sold for slaughter, live weight as % of preceding year 78 86 84 Gross milk yield 6,790 5,893 4,982 as % of preceding year 80 87 85 Production of hen 8,189 7,284 6,844 eggs--million units as % of preceding year 92 89 94 Production of animal husbandry products on personal plots remained approximately at the level of the corresponding period of last year. The decrease in the size of the livestock herd is occurring mainly at agricultural enterprises, where the pace of horned cattle and swine herd reductions has stabilized at the level of 10-13 percent as compared to the corresponding month of last year, and cows--at 6-7 percent. An especially significant decline has occurred in the herd of sheep and goats (by 21-23 percent). as % of corresponding date of 1993 For reference: as of 1 April On 1 Jan On 2 Feb On 1 Mar On 1 Apr 1993 as % of 1992 Horned 89 89 89 90 91 cattle Cows 94 93 93 93 93 Swine 87 87 88 87 85 Sheep and 79 78 77 77 84 goats The remaining stocks of fodder at these enterprises as of the beginning of April of this year amounted on average to 6 quintals of feed units per standard head of livestock, as compared to 5.3 quintals of feed units by this time last year. In the first quarter of this year, 1.1 million tonnes of livestock and poultry (26 percent less than a year ago) were procured from agricultural producers for federal and regional food reserves, as well as 3.4 million tonnes of milk (22 percent less), and 5.5 billion units of eggs (9 percent less). At the same time, agricultural enterprises increased sales of animal husbandry products at farmers markets, through their own stores, the public catering system, and through barter operations. They sold 17 percent of the total volume of livestock and poultry, 4.5 percent of milk, and 7 percent of eggs outside the procurement network, as compared to, respectively, 11 percent, 2.7 percent, and 7 percent last year: (in thousand tonnes) Procured for federal and regional In addition, sold reserves by agricultural enterprises outside of procurement organizations in 1994 1992 1993 1994 Livestock and 1,679 1,458 1,076 217 poultry in live weight as % of 73 87 74 117 preceding year Milk 4,993 4,349 3,391 161 as % of the 71 87 78 132 preceding year Eggs, million 6,135 6,022 5,508 440 units as % of the 82 98 91 102 preceding year Sales of Fresh Produce By 28 March of this year agricultural enterprises sold through all distribution channels 17,500 tonnes of greenhouse vegetables (24,200 tonnes in 1993). Of this, 12,800 tonnes (73 percent of the total volume) were sold to procurement organizations, which is one-third less than last year: (in thousand tonnes) Greenhouse Including: vegetables cucumbers greengrocer items 1992 22.5 18.9 3.3 1993 19.9 15.8 3.9 1994 12.8 10.9 1.8 1994 as % 64 69 45 1993 Sales of these products through other distribution channels increased. Since the beginning of the year, 4,700 tonnes of greenhouse vegetables (27 percent of the total volume sold) have been sold at farmers markets, through their own stores, and the public catering system, as compared to 4,200 tonnes (18 percent) last year. The Farmers` Movement The process of creating peasant (private) farms in Russia is proceeding more slowly this year than last. Over three months of this year 7,300 new farms were set up (47,000 over the first quarter of last year) and by 1 April they numbered 277,300, with a total land area of 11.8 million hectares (43 hectares per farm on average). By the beginning of the spring campaign approximately 10.9 million hectares of agricultural land were at farmers' disposal, of which 7.9 million hectares were plowed land, or, respectively, 5.2 percent and 6.0 percent of the total area in the Russian Federation. Surveys conducted by the State Committee for Statistics indicate that farmers are in a difficult financial situation. Production and social infrastructure of peasant farms are extremely weak; there is no mechanism for implementation of measures of state support for farmers, and money allocated for these purposes frequently does not reach the intended recipients. To a considerable extent it was for these reasons that 4,100 private farms ceased operation in the first quarter of this year (2,500 over the first quarter of last year). On average, for each 100 new farms in the first quarter of this year, 36--as compared to 14 last year--went out of business. The dynamics of start-ups and disintegration of private farms by quarter in 1993 and 1994 are shown in the table (thousands of farms): Started over Ceased operations Increase over the period the period total per 100 newly started farms, units 1992 138.9 5.1 4 133.8 1993 101.3 14.1 14 87.2 including: I quarter 49.5 2.5 5 47.0 II quarter 31.6 3.3 10 28.3 III quarter 10.5 3.3 31 7.2 IV quarter 9.7 5.0 52 4.7 1994 I quarter 11.4 4.1 36 7.3 Capital Construction In the first quarter of 1994, enterprises and organizations of all forms of property on the territory of the Russian Federation utilized R12.3 trillion of capital investment from all sources of financing, including R6.9 trillion, or 56 percent of the total volume of investment, for construction of production facilities (60 percent in 1993). The investment dynamics are characterized by the following data: As % of corresponding period of For reference: 1993 preceding year as % of I quarter I quarter I quarter 1992 1990 1992 1993 1994 Capital investment 56 97 72 84 43 from all sources of financing--total including by facility type: production 52 99.3 63 77 35 nonproduction 64 93 89 97 61 State- and municipally-owned enterprises and organizations account for the greatest share (59 percent) of capital investment utilization in the development of the Russian economy. The structure of capital investment from all sources of financing by the form of ownership is shown below: I quarter 1994 For reference: 1993 as % of total Billion rubles as % of the total Capital investment by 12,294 100 100 enterprises and organizations of all forms of ownership--total including: state 5,533 45 53 municipal 1,722 14 13 mixed 3,038 25 20 private 1,721 14 14 public organizations 10 0.1 0.2 The main source of capital investment financing is enterprises' own resources; in the first quarter they accounted for R7.9 trillion, or 64 percent of the total volume of investment; means from the federal budget--R1.9 trillion, or 16 percent; and local budget--R1.4 trillion, or 12 percent. In the first quarter of this year capital investment in equipment, tools, and supplies comprised R1.574 trillion, or 52 percent of the corresponding period of last year, including R464 billion for equipment requiring installation (29 percent of the total volume). As of the end of the first quarter of this year, R3.955 trillion worth of uninstalled equipment requiring installation accumulated in warehouses in the capital construction sector, including R740 billion worth of imported equipment. In the first quarter of this year some production capacities and facilities were put into operation: 240 km of power transmission lines with a voltage of 35 kV or higher on the territory of Bashkiria and the Mari Republic, Maritime Kray, and Volgograd, Voronezh, Moscow, Rostov, Saratov, Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, Chelyabinsk, and other oblasts; 29 km of gas pipelines in Kursk Oblast; 83 km of intercity communication cables in Samara Oblast; 761 oil and eight gas production wells in Tyumen Oblast; and capacities for production of 20,000 cubic meters of wood-chip board and 12 million units of construction brick in Krasnodar Kray, 150,000 cubic meters of non-ore materials in Kemerovo Oblast, 13,500 cubic meters of prefabricated ferroconcrete components and items in Altay Kray, and others. The limit of state capital investment financed out of the federal budget for the implementation of measures aimed at elimination of the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster for 1994 is set in the amount of R578.1 billion (in forecast prices); in the first quarter of this year, R33.2 billion (in current prices) has been used for these purposes. As part of the "Chernobyl" program, 10,400 square meters of residential housing have been built (4.5 percent of the annual target), and a hospital for 25 beds (5.9 percent). In the first quarter of this year, R0.9 trillion in capital investment from all sources of financing has been used for development of the agro-industrial complex, which is half as much as last year. Investment of state-owned enterprises comprised 36 percent of total investment in the agro-industrial complex; privately owned--33 percent; and mixed Russian ownership--29 percent. Of this, R0.6 trillion, or 62 percent, was utilized for construction of production facilities. Only a few facilities for processing and storage of agricultural output have been put in operation. Over January-March of this year, capacities for production of 3.1 tonnes of bakery products a day were put on line in Moscow and Kurgan Oblasts, and for production of 95 tonnes a shift of whole-milk products in Kaluga, Sverdlovsk, and Tambov Oblasts. Of the most important agro-industrial complex projects not completed in 1993, the only production facilities that were put in operation in January-March of this year were production capacities at a canning plant in the city of Urukh in Kabardino-Balkaria and at the Rosvyanskiy repair plant in Kurovskoye settlement, Kaluga Oblast. In construction of social sphere projects, R5.4 trillion was used in the first quarter of this year, which is 11 percent less than the first quarter of 1993. The share of investment in the construction of nonproduction facilities is continuously increasing. In the first quarter of 1994, R3.1 trillion, or one-quarter of the total volume of capital investment in the national economy, was spent on housing construction. Residential housing with a total living area of 4.0 million square meters was commissioned, which comprises 95 percent of the January-March 1993 level and 50 percent of that in 1990: Million square meters of total area commissioned in as % of Proportion of January-March 1994 January-March 1993 total volume, % Total on the 4.0 95 100 territory of Russia including by enterprises and organizations that are part of: Russia's state and 2.3 85 58.7 mixed property including housing 0.2 65 4.7 construction cooperatives municipal property 0.6 84 15.9 private property 1.0 109 25.2 including 0.7 127 16.9 individuals building their own housing New apartments were received by 5,500 families of military servicemen, members of internal affairs organs, and persons due to be relocated from closed and stand-alone military bases. For them, 330,000 square meters of general housing were built, including 285,000 square meters in keeping with the plans of ministries and agencies that have military units. Construction of education and health care facilities over the elapsed period was not extensive. Enterprises and organizations of all forms of ownership built general education schools for 9,000 pupils, preschool facilities for 2,600 placements, hospitals with 1,674 beds, and ambulatory facilities for 1,960 visits a shift. Also put into operation were nursing homes for the elderly, disabled, and disabled children for 298 placements and orphanages for 100 placements. During the current year 94.3 km of operational running water networks were put on line on the territory of Russia, or 81 percent of the level of January-March 1993; 24.2 km of sewage lines (73 percent); 19.6 km of heat distribution pipes (111 percent); and 836.5 km of gas pipes (94 percent). Construction organizations of all forms of ownership on the territory of the Russian Federation performed R8.5 trillion worth of contract work in January-March of this year, which is 24 percent less than over the corresponding period of last year. The volume of contract work performed by organizations of different organizational-legal forms is characterized by the following data: Volume of contract Proportion of total volume of work contract work performed (%) performed, % of construction-erection capital trillion total work repairs rubles Total for 8.5 100 76 17 contract organizations including: state 2.6 30 67 27 municipal 0.1 1 51 43 joint-stock 5.4 63 80 13 lease 0.4 4 78 14 As of the end of the first quarter customers had not paid for about 50 percent of the work performed over that period. In state organizations the share of such work comprised 44 percent, joint-stock--50 percent, and leased--55 percent. Adherence to the Timetable of Passenger Trains and Aircraft In air transportation in the first quarter of this year the number of actual flights declined by 15 percent as compared to the analogous period of last year. The number of aircraft arriving late declined from 24 percent to 22 percent. About 1 percent of scheduled flights were canceled or not carried out. Adherence to the timetable of aircraft arrival at flight destination by different types of air service is characterized by the following data: Number of Proportion of Average delay, delayed flights, late arrivals in hours thousands total number of scheduled flights, % All types of service 26.6 22 3.7 including: international 3.0 26 3.3 domestic 11.8 28 3.8 local 11.8 18 3.6 More than half of the domestic flights of the Vnukovo Airlines company arrived on average 4.6 hours late; of those carried out by enterprises under the umbrella of the Kamchatka regional civil aviation administration--60 percent, with an average delay of 7.7 hours; of the Far East regional administration--49 percent, 8.1 hours; of the Domodedovo production association--45 percent, 8.3 hours; and of the Mineralnyye Vody production association--42 percent, 2.7 hours. On rail transport of the Russian Ministry of Railways, in the first quarter of this year 111,400 passenger trains (not counting suburban) arrived at their final destination--2 percent less than in the first quarter of 1993. The number of late trains comprised 4 percent of the total number of arrivals as compared to 6 percent over the corresponding period of last year. Average delay time was 1.4 hours (1.3 hours in the first quarter of 1993). The greatest proportion of late trains was registered at the Kaliningrad (52 percent of all arrivals on that railroad), North Caucasus (9 percent), and Moscow (8 percent) Railroads. The greatest delays were noted in train arrivals at destination stations of the East Siberian (average delay--2.5 hours), Kemerovo (2.3 hours), Moscow, Baykal-Amur (1.8 hours), Sverdlovsk (1.7 hours), and South Urals (1.6 hours) Railroads. In March of this year the number of departures of suburban trains declined as compared to January of this year by 5,400 (2 percent). On the West Siberian Railroad 1,300 (13 percent) fewer trains departed; October Railroad--1,100 (3 percent) fewer, and Far Eastern Railroad--1,100 (25 percent) fewer. Delays were registered in the departures of 1,900 (1 percent) suburban trains. Average delay was 25 minutes. The greatest delays in suburban train departures were noted on the Kaliningrad, Gorkiy, Northern, South-Eastern, Volga, Sverdlovsk, Kemerovo, and South-Urals Railroads (average delay in departures was between 28 and 54 minutes). Urban Passenger Transportation Services for the Population Currently 1,357 cities in the Russian Federation have a bus service, 113 cities--ground electric transportation, and six--subway. Urban transport (excluding taxicabs) serves 110 million passengers daily, which is five times as many as served by suburban and intercity transportation by all types of transport. Urban passenger transportation operates with great difficulty; the level of passenger service is declining, especially with respect to bus service. In 1993 the number of bus runs performed declined by 11 million, or 5 percent, as compared to 1992, and by 33 million, or 15 percent, as compared to 1991. The deterioration of transportation services is also indicated by the results of a selective survey conducted by statistical organs at the end of 1993 in oblast (kray, republic) centers of Russia. Of 23,000 respondents, three-quarters noted that the operation of urban public transportation has become worse. Their opinion is supported by comparing it with the data received as a result of analogous surveys conducted by statistical organs in 1989 and 1990. The average time spent commuting to work (school) increased by 8 percent (from 40 minutes in 1989 and 1990 to 43 minutes in 1993). The proportion of passengers who spend 40 minutes to one hour, or more than one hour, commuting is high: 30 percent and 19 percent of respondents, respectively (in 1989--27 percent and 16 percent, in 1990--29 percent and 17 percent). Considerable time is spent waiting for rolling stock to arrive. Because of greater intervals in the schedule of city transportation, one in four streetcars and trolley bus passengers and one in three bus passengers have to wait for more than 20 minutes at the stop (in 1989, respectively, one in 11 and six minutes, and in 1990--one in six and four minutes). Of total number of passenger using a corresponding type of transportation, waited at the stop for transport to arrive, % 4 minutes or 5-9 minutes 10-19 minutes 20 minutes less and more Bus 1989 9 38 36 17 1990 5 29 39 27 1993 3 22 37 38 Trolley bus 1989 20 44 27 9 1990 12 39 33 16 1993 8 32 37 23 Streetcar 1989 22 46 23 9 1990 13 40 31 16 1993 12 33 32 23 The average waiting time at a bus stop is 16 minutes, trolley bus--14 minutes, and streetcar--13 minutes. The highest number of passengers waiting for buses at bus stops for more than 20 minutes were noted in Saransk, Maykop, Vladivostok, Astrakhan, Ulyanovsk, Yakutsk, Orenburg, Blagoveshchensk, Nalchik, Kaliningrad, Tver, Barnaul, Kyzyl (56-76 percent of passengers surveyed); for trolley buses--in Magadan, Groznyy, Saransk, Tyumen, and Vladivostok (53-100 percent); streetcars--in Tver, Groznyy, Voronezh, and Ufa (50-60 percent). Greater concentration of riders on rolling stock creates additional inconveniences for passengers. Overcrowding of rolling stock during rush hours was noted by 86 percent of passengers using buses to commute to work (school), 82 percent of trolley bus users, 67 percent of streetcar users, and 53 percent of subway users. The main cause of such a situation is underutilization of the carrying capacity of the rolling stock. In 1993 more than half of ground passenger transportation remained unused daily in Astrakhan, one third--in Kaluga, Smolensk, Tambov, Samara, Stavropol, Nalchik. Kemerovo, and Blagoveshchensk. Half the buses and streetcars and one-third of the trolley buses were idle in Moscow and Tomsk. More than one-third of trolley buses were not sent on route runs daily in Elista, Magadan, Yakutsk, and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, where they are the only available kind of urban passenger transportation. More than half of idle time is caused by repairs because of the great wear and tear of the stock. In common carrier automotive transportation, almost one-third of buses have been fully depreciated, and more than 10 percent of trolley buses and streetcars are being utilized beyond the term of their useful life. The unsatisfactory technical condition of the rolling stock is causing a decline in the regularity of scheduled runs in passenger transportation. In 1993, 85 percent of urban buses ran on schedule, 92 percent of trolley buses, and 90 percent of streetcars. However, in a number of cities regularity of service was considerably below that: More than one-third of scheduled bus runs were not made in the city of Moscow, in Vologda, Voronezh, Kursk, Astrakhan, and Kaliningrad Oblasts, Khabarovsk Kray, and the Republics of Tuva and Chuvashia. One in three scheduled streetcar runs were not made in Ufa, Tomsk, Tver, Lipetsk, and Astrakhan. One in five trolley bus runs were canceled in Abakan, Barnaul, Vladikavkaz, and Tula. There has been no improvement in transportation services for people working second and third shifts, 88 percent of whom use urban passenger transportation after work and only 6 percent--their own enterprise's buses. Dissatisfaction with the operation of urban transportation at night was expressed by 69 percent of surveyed bus passengers and more than half of trolley bus and streetcar passengers. The survey showed that no work is being done to make transportation route grids more convenient for the population. As in previous surveys, only 46 percent of passengers surveyed do not have to change lines in commuting to work (school); 34 percent make one change, 17 percent--two, and 4 percent of passengers--three or more changes. One-quarter or more passengers have to change lines twice in commuting to work (school) in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Abakan, Novosibirsk, and Cheboksary. Passengers experience a certain discomfort in using urban transportation because of lack of information on stops. Practically all passengers of buses and trolley buses, in response to the question as to whether the drivers announce the names of stops, answered "sometimes" or "no." Only one in six streetcar passengers answered this question affirmatively. The survey conducted by statistical organs revealed passengers' opinion on measures that would help improve the operation of urban passenger transportation. Among them were: maintaining schedules (noted by 32 percent of respondents), shortening intervals between runs (27 percent), modernizing the rolling stock (22 percent), opening new routes (11 percent), and restoring canceled routes (8 percent). Migration Processes The migration-caused increase in the population of the Russian Federation over last year exceeded 430,000 persons and was the highest in the postwar period. The migrant flow was distributed as follows: Total, thousand Including: persons urban areas rural areas Arrived--total 925.3 566.9 358.4 including from countries of: near abroad 922.9 565.3 357.6 far abroad 2.4 1.6 0.8 Departed--total 495.2 380.8 114.4 including to the countries of: near abroad 379.3 304.0 75.3 far abroad 115.9 76.8 39.1 The high positive migration balance is mainly the result of reductions in the number of Russians moving to near abroad countries. The number of such emigrants was 380,000, which was 1.7 times less than in 1992. Those moving to Ukraine numbered 190,000 as compared to 342,000 in 1992; to Kazakhstan--63,000, as compared to 94,000, respectively; to Belarus--47,000, as compared to 64,000; to the Transcaucasus states--15,000, as compared to 62,000; and to other states--64,000 as compared to 85,000. As before, the population of Russia grew mainly due to the arrival of inhabitants of Central Asian states, the Transcaucasus, and Kazakhstan: They accounted for two-thirds (619,800 persons) of the total number of migrants to Russia. The number of those who have left the place of their former residence not of their own volition among all arrivals increased: In 1993 Russian Federal Migration Service offices registered as refugees and forced migrants 234,000 persons, or one in four immigrants. A negative balance persisted in the interstate exchange between Russian and far abroad countries, Belarus, and Ukraine. Russian emigration to far abroad countries exceeded somewhat the level of previous years. As compared to 1992, 10,900, or 11 percent, more persons received permission to move abroad permanently from MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] organs, bringing the total to 115,900 persons. As a result of a decline in the outflow of population to Belarus and Ukraine, Russia's migration losses dropped to 13,000 persons as compared to 170,000 in 1992. In developing the data on foreign migration, information was received for the first time on the gender, age, and education level of migrants. It showed that as a result of population migration the country got 105,000 more children under 16, 261,000 more persons of work-capable age, and 64,000 more persons of retirement age. Migrants' distribution by age differed as compared to the structure of Russia's population at the beginning of 1993 in that the former had a higher share of work-capable contingents (60.7 percent as compared to 56.5 percent) and a lower share of persons above work-capable age (14.9 percent as compared to 19.8 percent, respectively). The distribution of migrants by gender was more even: There are 928 women per 1,000 men, with the average indicator for Russia being 1,131. Among the immigrants, 18.6 percent had a complete or incomplete higher education; among the emigrants--respectively, 19.5 percent (22.8 percent of the number of those who left for far abroad countries, and 18.6 percent of those destined for near abroad countries). The share of persons with such education in the entire population of Russia was, according to 1989 census data, 13 percent. About 28 percent of migrants had secondary vocational training (19 percent according to the census).
