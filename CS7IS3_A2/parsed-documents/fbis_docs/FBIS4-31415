Peter Weiss, [chairman of the] Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]: It has become apparent that extremists on both sides are incapable of reaching a compromise. In its final form, the bill was in conformity with the most important objections to the original draft that had come from the opposition, while, at the same time, respecting the recommendations of the Council of Europe. After the elections, the bill will have to be passed anyway in approximately the same form in which it is now. Preference was given to preelection tactics because the opposition wants to use the signposts as one of the main themes in its election campaign. A single vote was missing for the bill to be passed. The ability to strike a compromise and to realistically assess the situation should have been demonstrated also on the part of the Hungarian parties. It depends on the political judgment of members of the coalition and also of the MKDH and Coexistence representatives whether political stability in the country will be thrown overboard because of the wave of emotions that has artificially arisen in connection with this law. Pal Csaky, MKDH: I assess the outcome of the vote as nonobservance of coalition agreements. Independent Deputy Kaliska, who is supposed to be a member of the government coalition, put forward proposals for changes that made the bill's passage problematic. Even deputies representing the government parties voted for these changes. The MKDH deputies all voted in favor of the bill's passage, while three Coexistence deputies did not endorse it because of the two proposals for changes made by Mrs. Kaliska. We are going to raise this problem at a meeting of the Coalition Council, and it could very well happen that this will be the last meeting of the Coalition Council for us. It is still premature to say whether we will continue supporting the government. However, the nonpassage of the bill will have serious political consequences. Ludovit Cernak, National Democratic Party: Personally, I supported the bill because it seemed to be a compromise and also because Deputy Kaliska's proposals passed, which prevented the possible defamation [dehonestacia] of the names of communities named after Slovak national revivalists. The failure of some deputies of the Hungarian coalition to support the bill surprised me. Thereby, they actually deprived themselves of the argument for the Council of Europe that there was insufficient will in the National Council of the Slovak Republic to adopt this law. Jan Carnogursky, Christian Democratic Movement: The nonpassage of the bill is unfortunate because it has only made matters even more complicated. Slovakia will have to deal with it again. Apparently, this will happen only after the elections. The reason for the failure to pass the bill was, in my opinion, the exclusion of communities named after Slovak historical personalities from the bilingual regime. Three Hungarian deputies did not vote for the bill because of this. However, some coalition deputies did not vote for it, either. This will not directly influence the functioning of the coalition, but it will complicate the government's position. [passage omitted]
