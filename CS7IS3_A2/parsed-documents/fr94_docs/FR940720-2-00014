FR940720-2-00014 FR940720-2-00007 1. ``Indirect'' Equity Infusion Petitioner has named Dalmine S.p.A. (``Dalmine'') as the producer in Italy of the subject merchandise. Until 1989, Dalmine owned 51 percent of a subsidiary, Tubificio Dalmine Italsider S.p.A. (``Tubificio''). The remaining 49 percent was owned by Dalmine's parent company ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), which is a government-owned steel producer. In 1989, Dalmine sold its shares in Tubificio to ILVA. Petitioner alleges that in return, Dalmine received a cash payment from ILVA which should be treated as an ``indirect'' equity infusion. The reasons cited by petitioner are that (1) Tubificio was essentially a worthless company because it made losses in the three years immediately prior to the sale, and (2) the cash paid by ILVA served as an indirect pass-through of illegal subsidies received by ILVA. In previous cases involving the Italian steel industry, we have treated capital infusions into unequityworthy companies by government-owned holding companies such as Finsider S.p.A. (``Finsider'') and the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (``IRI'') as countervailable equity infusions. However, in those cases, the recipient companies were offering their own shares in exchange for cash. (See, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel from Italy, (`` Electrical Steel ''), 59 FR 18357 (April 18, 1994).) In the instant case, however, Dalmine sold shares in its subsidiary, Tubificio, to ILVA, Dalmine's parent and the other owner of Tubificio. ILVA's holding in Dalmine did not increase (absolutely or relatively) as a result of this transaction. Therefore, we do not view this as a direct or indirect equity infusion into Dalmine. Moreover, ILVA is not a holding company like IRI or Finsider, but an operating company. While the Department found in Electrical Steel and Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain Steel Products from Italy, (`` Certain Steel from Italy'' ), 58 FR 37327 (July 9, 1993), that ILVA benefitted from subsidies, those subsidies were allocated to ILVA S.p.A.'s operations and not to its subsidiaries. Beyond its simple claim that the cash paid by ILVA served as an indirect pass-through of illegal subsidies received by ILVA, petitioner has provided no basis for believing that ILVA was channelling government funds to Dalmine. On this basis, we are not including the ``indirect'' equity infusion in the investigation. 2. Secured and Unsecured Loans From Italian Banks Petitioner maintains that Dalmine was uncreditworthy from 1978 through 1992. According to petitioner, all secured and unsecured loans obtained by Dalmine from Italian banks during these years are, therefore, countervailable. Petitioner states that, while it cannot outline the terms of the financing provided, the loans are countervailable because they were provided at interest rates lower than the rates that should have been charged to an uncreditworthy company. Petitioner has not specified under which laws or programs the secured and unsecured loans are being provided, nor has petitioner provided information as to how this funding is specific to the steel industry ( see the petition requirements in ยง355.12(b)(7) of the Department's regulations). On this basis, we are not including the secured and unsecured loans in our investigation. 3. Debt Forgiveness in Connection With the 1981 and 1988 Restructuring Plans Petitioner claims that in Certain Steel from Italy, the Department found that Finsider (the government-owned holding company for the steel industry until 1989) benefitted from government assumption of debt in connection with the 1981 and 1988 restructurings of the state-owned steel industry. Because Dalmine was a subsidiary of Finsider in those years, petitioner alleges that Dalmine benefitted from the debt forgiveness provided to Finsider in connection with these restructurings. Regarding the 1981 debt forgiveness, the Department established in Certain Steel from Italy that Finsider assumed the debts of its subsidiary Italsider which we treated as a countervailable subsidy to Italsider. In the present case, however, petitioner has not provided any evidence that Dalmine benefitted from this debt forgiveness or that Finsider forgave Dalmine's debts.
