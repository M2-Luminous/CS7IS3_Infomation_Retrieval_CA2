FR940825-0-00103 FR940825-0-00016 (5) The recipient shall implement adequate maintenance procedures to keep the equipment in good condition. (6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. (g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, it may use the equipment for other activities in accordance with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original HHS awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of HHS's share in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the HHS awarding agency; such instructions must be issued to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern: (1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the HHS awarding agency an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of HHS share in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the HHS share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses. (2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the HHS awarding agency by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's share in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred. (3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient will be reimbursed by the HHS awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition. (h) The HHS awarding agency reserves the right to order the transfer of title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the awarding agency when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards: (1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing. (2) The HHS awarding agency may require submission of a final inventory that lists all equipment acquired with HHS funds and federally-owned equipment. (3) If the HHS awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of the inventory, the recipient shall apply the standards of paragraph (g)(1) of this section as appropriate. (4) When the HHS awarding agency exercises its right to order the transfer of title to the Federal Government, the equipment shall be subject to the rules for federally-owned equipment. (See ยง74.34(g)). ยง74.35 Supplies. (a) Title to supplies shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-federally sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment. (See ยง74.34(g)). (b)(1) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies. (2) If the supplies owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the HHS awarding agency. (3) User charges shall be treated as program income, in keeping with the provisions of ยง74.24.
