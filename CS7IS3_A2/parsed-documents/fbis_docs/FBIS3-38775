Social Democrat Goran Persson said the government should show some humility and promised that there would be a traditional Social Democratic budget as an alternative when the budget is submitted to the Riksdag. The government can expect a tough confrontation with the Social Democrats, especially on the subject of the high unemployment rate, which the government is considered to have accepted all too casually. Specific proposals regarding measures for creating jobs will be the main item in the SDP's [Social Democratic Party] financial bill two weeks from now. Minister of Finance Anne Wibble (Liberal Party) promised during the Riksdag debate that she would be interested in studying any of the SDP's proposals, saying she hoped it would not take a full four months to present them, as she said it did when Allan Larsson was the party's financial spokesman last year. She did not feel, however, that economic spokesman Goran Persson's talk about the SDP's usual solutions for creating jobs and faster growth inspired any hope. Irresponsible Expenditure SDP leader Ingvar Carlsson said at a news conference that it ought to be possible to convert the many billions of kronor that a 14-percent unemployment rate will cost into jobs. He also said that his party opposed the child care allowance, which he called an irresponsible expenditure of from 2 billion to 6 billion kronor whose only purpose was to hold the four-party coalition together. "Typically, they are choosing to cut back on the allowance for more than one child to make room for the child care allowance dictated by the KDS [Christian Democratic Party]," said Carlsson. He pointed out that the government's policy was characterized excessively by special party-political interests. "The Center Party is demanding subsidies for the farmers, the KDS is demanding the child care allowance, and the Moderates are insisting not only on tax relief for stockholders but also on more money for the police and correctional treatment," said the SDP leader, who avoided drawing attention to the Liberal Party's special interests. The various areas in which the SDP wants to save money were not revealed on Monday [10 January], which was reserved for attacks on the government's policy. But Carlsson mentioned the Armed Forces as one area where the Social Democrats think it is possible to achieve savings. Foothold The SDP's spokesman on economic affairs, Goran Persson, called the Bildt government's economic policy the biggest political failure of the postwar period because mass unemployment has gotten a foothold in Sweden. He rejected as pure falsification the government's promise to cut unemployment in half by the turn of the century. At the same time that he accused the government of cutting back the budget too drastically -- higher taxes, cutbacks in the construction industry, and selective purchase taxes -- he complained that the government had been unable to come up with any new proposals for savings that would reduce the budget deficit. Persson feels that Anne Wibble ought to show more humility now that she has the "answer sheet" regarding economic policy in her hand. Besides record unemployment and the continuing high budget deficit, he also criticized the fact that at 13.5 percent of GNP, the investment level is now at "the 1930's level." That puts Sweden in last place among the industrialized countries. Wider Gaps Johann Lonnroth of the Left Party criticized the government for widening the gaps in society with its tax reductions for the rich. He proposed a 5-percent tax hike for all upper incomes. He also brought up his party's old proposal to introduce a six-hour workday to bring unemployment down. He tried to get Goran Persson to say where he stood on his relations with the Liberal Party, but had to be content with reminding him that "you need us to tear up the tax on stock shares and in connection with the labor law." Lonnroth also called for radical new thinking aimed at creating new jobs in such areas as environment and education. Anne Wibble delightedly drew attention to the budget's unique appendix on the environment, but he dismissed it as being as good as worthless since it made no proposals and provided no funds. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |State Budget, 1994-95 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Revenues |Expenditures | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Item |Billions of kronor|Item |Billions of kronor| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other revenues |38 |Investments and s-|21 | | | |o on | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Income, property |63 |Debt service |85 | |taxes | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Statutory social |71 |Consumption |128 | |security contribu-| | | | |tions | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Value-added tax a-|187 |Subsidies |297 | |nd other taxes on | | | | |goods and services| | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Budget deficit |38 | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |531 |Total |531 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- New Democracy's Ian Wachtmeister insisted that he would be able to accept the child care allowance bill that the government is going to submit in February only if it is paid for out of the budget for family policy. He described the government's proposal to reduce the extra allowance for more than one child as a move by the government to placate New Democracy. That opened up the possibility of more cutbacks in family policy. The 82 billion kronor that family policy is already costing can be reduced even further, he said. He spontaneously mentioned time off to care for sick children. Certain Conditions New Democracy is also placing certain conditions on its acceptance of the unemployment insurance proposal that will be presented in March. Wachtmeister thinks it will be possible to influence the deadline for terminating unemployment benefits. Wachtmeister also wants to include in discussions with the government the question of a general basic security system so that the cost of the entire social security system can be met in the future. He outlined a tax-supported basic security system paying the same as the cash labor market assistance benefit, which the party has gotten increased to 245 kronor per day. Anything over that amount would be paid for by individual contributions. New Democracy said, however, that increasing the subsidy by 400 million kronor was "ridiculous," and it feels that cutting aid to developing countries in half would be more appropriate. New Democracy's financial bill will also call for cutbacks in refugee policy.
