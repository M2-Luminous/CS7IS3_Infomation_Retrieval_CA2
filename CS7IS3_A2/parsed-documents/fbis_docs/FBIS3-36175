In compliance with the Constitution, the houses of the Federal Assembly pass decisions by a majority vote from the total number of members of the Federation Council and deputies to the State Duma correspondingly in all cases except where the Constitution says otherwise, reads the president's address spread on Tuesday in the Russian parliament. When the houses passed the temporary rules, the notion "the total number of deputies" was interpreted as the number of effectively elected of each of the houses. In line with the Constitution, the total number of deputies in the Duma is 450 and in the Federation Council-- 178, while elected were 444 and 171 respectively. The interpretation of the notion "total number of deputies" as the number of the elected deputies suggests the recognition that the houses consist of a different number of deputies than that envisaged by the Russian Constitution. Thus the decisions of the houses cannot be considered constitutional, believes the Russian president. It follows that when the houses adopted their provisional rules, deputies violated provisions of Articles 95, 102 and 103 of the Russian Constitution, said Yeltsin. The presidential message says that the loose interpretation of the constitutional norms enables both houses of the Federal Assembly in the future to adopt laws and other decisions contrary to the requirements of the Russian Constitution. IF Note: In connection with the president's message, parliamentary observers note that the speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin had received 223 votes in his favor to become speaker. This means he was elected by a one vote majority out of the number of the elected deputies. The points made by Yeltsin virtually call into question the fact that Rybkin was elected constitutionally, which, some experts believe, could lead to a deterioration in the relationships between the president and the Duma. Meanwhile, at the Federation Council session Wednesday, deputies turned down the presidential amendments which proposed to count votes out of the total number of the Federation Council members, not from among those elected. If passed, such a decision would have meant the relieving of the chairman of the Federation Council and his deputies and the election of members of Federation Council committees.
