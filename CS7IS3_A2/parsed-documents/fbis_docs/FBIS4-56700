During a news conference for foreign journalists, Abreu stated that his country opposes any type of unilateral action in Haiti, and has called for rapid action by the OAS for an in-depth study of the crisis being experienced by the Caribbean nation. The meeting that has been called for today in Washington by the Permanent Council of the OAS, at the petition of Uruguay, is the first concrete action to be carried out after reports were disseminated in the U.S. press regarding a possible unilateral U.S. military action. Asked about the international community's possible lateness in acting against the problem that arose after the coup d'etat against constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is currently in exile in the United States, Abreu stated that Uruguay backs the Governor's Island Agreements that were signed in 1993, and does not want the situation to deteriorate. OAS actions will be based on the latest reports and proposals made by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, whose members will once again visit Haiti to determine the seriousness of the deterioration of individual rights. The Commission will visit the island between 16 and 20 May, and its members will meet with Haitian personalities and citizens. The foreign minister stated that his country is promoting the "political receptiveness to beginning to work more profoundly for a diplomacy that attempts to prevent a unilateral armed action, which would cause a deterioration in the situation and would favor no one." "Uruguay is a jealous defender of nonintervention, and is willing to work for and support all leads toward a solution," the foreign minister stressed. Abreu acknowledged that up to the present time there has been no success, but he insisted that "armed unilateral intervention is not the solution." The foreign minister reported that he has the support of Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia after rapid telephone conversations with his colleagues and with the Mexican Embassy to evaluate the matter and to prevent a possible unilateral armed intervention. "Our country will support every lead toward a solution that is undertaken within the bounds of international law and by competent organizations," the minister said. The Uruguayan foreign minister summed up his position by indicating that in view of the seriousness of the Haitian crisis it is urgent that it be "discussed within an atmosphere of preventive diplomacy." "Uruguay does not support individual action, but does support multilateral action," he stressed. Uruguayan diplomacy indicates that the reactivation of and new dimensions for the OAS will be a fundamental step in resolving the Haitian crisis. "The principles of nonintervention and self-determination are not negotiable," the foreign minister insisted, in explaining how the work to promote "preventive diplomacy" will be carried out.
