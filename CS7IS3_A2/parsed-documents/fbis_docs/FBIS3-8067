During a news conference, the Srpska republic president said Russia's complete involvement in efforts to settle the crisis and the establishment of a balance of forces in the international scene were of paramount importance. "Russia," said Karadzic, "is returning to the international scene not to confront the West, but as a very active factor in the process of seeking a solution to the crisis." Asked whether a new concrete initiative can now be expected on the part of Russia in connection with the conflict in Bosnia, Karadzic said the Russians "will act in coordination with the others." He also said at least two of Russia's moves -- the settlement of the crisis in Sarajevo and the opening of Tuzla airport -- have surprised Western circles. "It seems to me that Russia gained considerable advantage points on the basis of which it can now take part in the efforts to resolve the crisis on an equal footing. I expect and I suppose that meetings will now take place in Moscow similar to the ones in Washington," said Karadzic. Commenting on the Washington agreement, Karadzic said it was still being analyzed in the Srpska republic and it was not yet certain whether the agreement was being drawn up to the detriment of Serbs or it was a partial step toward peace. "If they form a joint state, we also have to take care of our territories and borders. They have to be easy to defend in the event our neighbor becomes hostile," Karadzic stressed. "In principle it is not good that America has taken over the UN's role and it has replaced international institutions with the great ambition to work out an agreement only between the Croats and Muslims," Karadzic said. He added: "I am afraid that America is losing yet another opportunity to show itself to be impartial. Therefore, the impression that it is biased and that it is against Serbs is being confirmed." He specified that the next step by the Srpska republic would be to strengthen peace on all front lines in order for negotiations to take place in the best possible atmosphere, and that the Srpska republic would not allow the formation of a Croatian-Muslim coalition and their joint state at the Serbs' expense. Talking about the decision to open Tuzla airport, Karadzic said the Serb side had never opposed the opening of the airport for humanitarian purposes, and the deal agreed with the Russians ensured that the airport would not be abused.
