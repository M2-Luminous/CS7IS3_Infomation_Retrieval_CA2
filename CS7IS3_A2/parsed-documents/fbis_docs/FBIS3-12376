They said that "a limited number of al-'Amaliqah Brigade soldiers were on their way to al-Razi Hospital in the town of Ja'ar to collect the body of a colleague of theirs treacherously killed by soldiers from the Madram Brigade camp, when they were intercepted and fired on by an armed group in front of the hospital. Brigade member Hazzam 'Ali Musayli was wounded." According to other reports, tanks and howitzer artillery units from the YSP's al-'Anad camp have moved in the direction of the areas of al-Milah, al-Hubaylayn, and al-Dali' in the province of Lahij "to occupy the old partition positions and prepare to besiege the forces of the (northern) 2nd armored brigade stationed in the area of al-Milah in Lahij." "Informed sources" in Aden have been quoted as saying that at dawn yesterday 12 tanks tightened their siege of the central security battalion in the Radfan camp in al-Sawlaban (Aden).
