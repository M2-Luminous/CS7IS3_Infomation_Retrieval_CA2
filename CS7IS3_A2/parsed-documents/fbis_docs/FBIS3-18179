FBIS3-18179 "drweu039_q_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 TURKEY Officials React to Motion NC2702125194 London Kanal-6 Television in Turkish 1700 GMT 25 Feb 94 NC2702125194 London Kanal-6 Television Language: Turkish Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] Eight RP [Welfare Party] deputies who had signed an anti-Ataturk parliamentary motion have withdrawn their signatures. (Oyke Semdiler), a member of the Great Unity Party, had already made such a decision. The motion still carries the signatures of Hasan Mezarci [the sponsor of the motion], Melik Firat from True Path Party, and two DEP [Democracy Party] deputies. Hasan Mezarci could be expelled from his party [Welfare Party]. The administrative council of the RP parliamentary group consigned him to the group's disciplinary committee. Sevket Kazan, deputy leader of RP parliamentary group, said that since the day of his election Mezarci has been acting in violation of party discipline. Sevket Kazan said that despite verbal warnings, Mezarci continued to act in ways that eroded the party's public image and that is why he was sent to the disciplinary committee by unanimous vote. In the meantime, Hasan Mezarci's motion, which called for the rehabilitation of those who were executed for trying to assassinate Ataturk in Izmir, was rejected in Parliament even without submitting it to normal procedure. Vefa Taner, deputy speaker of Parliament, said that a motion that demeans and incriminates Ataturk and Parliament cannot even be considered. Hasan Mezarci drew reactions from everybody, from ordinary people to the president. The most interesting reaction came from the presidency of the General Staff. The General Staff spokesman made the following one-sentence statement: The Turkish Armed Forces cannot accept as its counterparts those who hold such perverted ideas. President Demirel described attack on Ataturk as a subversion and provocation. [Begin recording] [Metin Corabatir] President Demirel said that an attack on Ataturk would very much disturb me and the Turkish people. Indicating that raving souls always have enmity for Ataturk, Demirel said that these things are being done to undermine peace in Turkey, and those who are doing such things will eventually realize that they are simply in a daze. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said the following while leaving the parliament: [Ciller] We were deeply grieved that an Erzerum deputy was involved in this. The Administrative Council of our parliamentary group met yesterday and we asked the Disciplinary Committee to definitely expel this deputy from the party. This is our stance. Let our people rest assured we will oppose anything that opposes Ataturk. Our state is great and lofty, and will continue to walk the path charted by the lofty Ataturk. [Corabatir] ANAP [Motherland Party] leader Masut Yilmaz described the deputies who signed the motion as people holding perverted views. [end recording] [passage omitted] SHP [Social Democrat Populist Party] leader Murat Karayalcin described Hasan Mezarci's anti-Ataturk statements as part of a plot being hatched by forces opposing democracy. During his Istanbul tour today, Murat Karayalcin said that for a long time now secular institutions in Turkey have been facing serious difficulties. [Begin recording] [Fatma Korunoglu] Is Turkey being dragged into something with Mezarci's statements? [Karayalcin] That is what I am trying to discern. We are already in a tense situation. We have been experiencing a number of incidents one after another. These could be planned or coincidental; that is not important. But, these incidents, coming one after another, are further exacerbating the tense election atmosphere in Turkey. These are certainly the plans and actions of the antidemocratic forces and circles. We must realize this, and must be able to assess very well the consequences that might result. [end recording] [Announcer] On his election bus, Karayalcin also referred to coup rumors. [Begin Karayalcin recording] Apparently, there are people who need to hear the word "coup." They are trying to extract other meanings from my statements. They say: He is saying there will be a coup; let him reveal the names of those who want to make a coup. I replied, saying that I do not know these circles, and I would have revealed them had I known them. But, again I cannot interpret these incidents in any other way. That is, I see all these attacks, bombings, murders, and statements as the work of forces outside the pale of democracy. [end recording]
