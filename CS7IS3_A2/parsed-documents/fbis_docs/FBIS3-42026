Leading experts in the nuclear missile sphere--Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of a Russian Defense Ministry main directorate; Major General Anatoliy Svetikov, first deputy chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff Operational Directorate; Major General Anatoliy Lukyanov, deputy chief of the Russian Defense Ministry International Treaty Directorate; and Boris Gorobets, spokesman for the Ministry of Atomic Energy--answered journalists' questions. They all revealed the complexity not only of the military-political, but also of the military-technical aspects of the problem of the nuclear potential in Ukraine and once again underlined not only the political significance of the tripartite agreement on eliminating these weapons, but also the considerable contribution it makes to strengthening nuclear security--provided that the matter is resolved positively. Col. Gen. Yevgeniy Maslin reminded the press conference that it is a question of around 1,300 warheads [boyegolovka] for SS-19 and SS-24 missiles and 600 air-launched cruise missile warheads [golovnaya boyevaya chast]. The general said that this arsenal causes most profound concern in Russia. The point is that the state of these warheads is still deteriorating. The warranty periods of most of the munitions' components are expiring and they are not undergoing the requisite technical maintenance, while maintenance personnel lack the requisite level of both theoretical and practical training. The complexity of the situation is indicated not least by the fact that three warheads were recently delivered to Russia from Ukraine in a preaccident state. Our country does indeed have the technology to dismantle and salvage the nuclear munitions, but time is pressing on. It is no coincidence that it was specifically said during the summit meeting that the first consignment of 200 warheads must arrive at Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy enterprises for elimination within the next 10 months. Nor has Kiev's desire for material compensation been forgotten--in exchange for the aforementioned first [consignment of] 200 warheads Ukraine will receive 100 fuel assemblies for nuclear power stations from Russia. Further payments are to be determined. If that does not seem enough to Ukraine, it was said at the press conference, the following legitimate question arises: Perhaps Ukraine does not want to part with its nuclear arms, contrary to its own declarations? The press conference did not overlook the problem of mutual nontargeting of strategic nuclear missiles, enshrined in the Moscow declaration signed by Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton. When asked by your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent whether this clause contravenes the status of nuclear weapons as a means of deterring an aggressor (as in the ``Basic Provisions of Russian Federation Military Doctrine'') Generals Anatoliy Lukyanov and Anatoliy Svetikov replied that our nuclear arsenal does of course retain the functions of deterrence and intimidation. The fact that the missiles will not be targeted at the United States and Russia respectively in everyday life, a sign of the new quality of the partnership relations between the two countries, is another matter. Since the missiles nonetheless remain on alert duty, we can always resume the possibility of their combat use if necessary.
