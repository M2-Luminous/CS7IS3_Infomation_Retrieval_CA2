Kolesnik, people's deputy of the Republic of Tatarstan, under the rubric "The Deputy's Tribunal": "Mutually Advantageous Trade Is the Best Policy"] [Text] I must write about the significance of the Treaty between Tatarstan and Russia since its consequences extend not only to Tatarstan and Russia. Analysis of it is important, and from a purely utilitarian standpoint, so is analysis of the practical possibilities for Tatarstan to realize its economic sovereignty. Of course these possibilities are not unlimited. On the one hand, our own base must be prepared in order to realize them. On the other, we must consider what we can really do and what is more important to us. I must certainly mention that before the Treaty was concluded, our potential to maintain foreign ties was very limited. When it was signed, we received a legal base, and that is important not only to us but especially to partners in contracts. What we can and cannot do in accordance with the Treaty in the area of foreign ties is precisely what our analysis is devoted to. I must say that in the process of negotiations (and I was a participant in them), the Russian side admitted but by no means agreed to recognize the possibility of Tatarstan's independent foreign-economic activity. But now the Treaty stipulates Tatarstan's participation in international relations and the opportunity to establish relations with foreign states, conclude with them agreements which do not contradict the Constitution and international obligations of the Russian Federation, the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, or the Treaty, and participate in the activity of the appropriate international organizations. So, Tatarstan has the right to conclude agreements but not a treaty with foreign states, which in fact restricts the range of its foreign activity to economics and trade. In addition, these agreements, we point out, must not contradict, first, the Constitution of the Russian Federation, secondly, its international obligations, and, finally, the Treaty itself. Such an entry is read, first, as "not affecting the sovereignty and integrity of the Russian Federation"; second, the sides are guided by clearly defined norms fixed in international treaties and other agreements of Russia; and third, Tatarstan has the right to enter international relations only on questions under its jurisdiction. And, in concluding agreements, our republic does not have the right to deal with questions of the international relations of the Russian Federation as a whole, or with questions of war and peace. The last, according to the Treaty, is under the jurisdiction of the RF [Russian Federation]. In practice this means that we can conclude primarily agreements of an economic character. This is reflected even more definitely in the agreement between the governments of Russia and Tatarstan on questions of foreign-economic activity. There the following are classified as exclusively under our republic's jurisdiction: concluding foreign-economic agreements with subjects of foreign federations and administrative-territorial formations of other countries; concluding trade-economic agreements with foreign states; attracting state, bank, and commercial credits and loans guaranteed by the Republic of Tatarstan Government and monitoring their use; forming and monitoring the use of the Republic of Tatarstan currency fund; formulating and conducting a policy to attract foreign investments to the republic's territory; offering state guarantees to participants in Tatarstan's foreign-economic activity; participating in the work of international economic and financial organizations and organs; receiving aid from foreign partners and using it; offering credits, loans, and aid to foreign partners; creating free economic zones on the republic's territory. So does the Republic of Tatarstan have the right to participate in foreign policy relations? The Treaty does not directly restrict this activity and it says that the republic "participates in international relations," but only outside the limits of the powers of the Russian Federation as a whole. In this way, our republic is considered to have a broad range of foreign-economic activity. And the sides have apparently agreed that the best policy is mutually advantageous trade. But to be precise, Tatarstan has been given complete freedom of action on its territory under the condition of full responsibility for it (guaranteed by the Republic of Tatarstan). But foreign policy activity is subordinated to the interests of foreign-economic activity and entails a set of questions to be resolved jointly with the Russian Federation. In accordance with the agreement, the following are included in those questions: protecting Tatarstan's economic interests and its enterprises and citizens abroad, which really means Russia's representing our republic's interests in the courts or arbitration tribunals of third countries; regulating payment-accounts relations with foreign states, which indicates the need for Tatarstan to follow the procedure for mutual settlement of accounts established by Russia for the particular foreign state; establishing a trade-economic regime in relations with foreign states and international trade-economic and currency-finance organizations--this means jointly establishing a regime in trade for countries with which Russia has not defined such a regime and following the established regime in places where it was defined earlier; licensing Tatarstan's investments abroad, and with joint jurisdiction that means Russia's controlling our republic's investments. In other words, this means foreign policy on questions of economics, finances, and trade handled by Tatarstan jointly with the Russian Federation. Overall one can conclude that the provisions of the Treaty and corresponding agreement have finally fixed de jure what the republic tried to achieve so persistently throughout the entire negotiation process. But I must mention that it is hardly wise to be content with that. Among other things, it is not clear how "coordination of international and foreign-economic ties," which is classified among jointly executed powers, is going to be carried out. For, as analysis of the Treaty and the agreement shows, they do not envision a coordinating mechanism. On its territory the Republic of Tatarstan is under its own responsibility in executing the entire list of powers, under the condition that these actions satisfy the provisions of the Treaty and the international obligations of the Russian Federation. Or here is another feature. Agreements concluded by Tatarstan must not contradict the Russian Federation's international obligations. Hence, we must know Russia's trade-economic policy in detail and systematically study the very respectable volume of its trade-economic agreements and treaties. Of course, we do not have to do this, but then we are forced to entrust this expert study to someone else. This means that in foreign-economic activity Tatarstan may prove not to be self-sufficient. All this points to the persistent need to formulate a state foreign-economic doctrine of Tatarstan which takes into account Russia's policy in different regions of the world. Against the background of the unstable political interests of the present Russian Government, "coordinating" our interests with the Russian Federation will not be simple. Everyone knows very well that in economics, as in politics, incidentally, not all interests coincide. So we are obliged even now to intensively prepare cadres of specialists devoted to the republic's interests and able to figure out the stratagems of Russia's trade agreements and of the economic legislation of the countries which are our future partners. We certainly have to create a Department of Foreign Relations. The task of studying and monitoring Russian foreign-economic policy must be primary among the duties of this department.
