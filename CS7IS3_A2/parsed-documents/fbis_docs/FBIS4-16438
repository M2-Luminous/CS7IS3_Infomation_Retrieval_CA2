[Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I am glad that our country's political leadership has made a correct step in this regard. For the first time in the four months since the State Duma' started working, we can react positively to President Yeltsin's steps on his refusal to go to Brussels to sign the document which is called the Partnership for Peace program. Lovely words -- Partnership for Peace -- anyone would think, but in fact it is an ideological trap. The more paper we sign, the more European and international structures we climb aboard, the more we will be taken by the throat and forced to implement documents they create. [end recording] [Kuznetsova] There was a short silence and then Vladimir Zhirinovskiy tackled the Serbian question. [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I am fully on the side of the Serbs. The Serbs are victims of aggression. What is happening in the Balkans today is a scenario for the gradual annihilation of Russia. The Americans are (?trying it out) on a small region. Just like the Russians in Russia -- the former USSR -- so it is with the Serbs in Yugoslavia. [end recording] [Kuznetsova] A statement was made that henceforth the party will use the title Zhirinovskiy's Party, since Boris Fedorov, the leader of a new political formation, called it the Liberal Democratic Union of 12 December.
