"We are ready to accept a permanent and unconditional ceasefire," Rabbani told journalists at the Presidential Palace. Rabbani added he hoped the "other side" would follow his lead on the ceasefire, stop their bombardment of the city, and open the highways for free passage of relief food supplies to Kabul. Just before Rabbani emerged from lunch with Mestiri three artillery rounds crashed into the neighbourhood, but apart from this there was an unusual but welcome calm in the capital. Mestiri heads a UN delegation which will spend three days in the capital talking to Afghan leaders in a bid to end the current three- month long factional fighting which has killed and wounded more than 15,000, driven hundreds of thousands from their homes and destroyed vast tracts of the city. Rabbani's chief rival Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar has demanded the president's resignation as a precondition for a negotiated peace settlement but Mestiri said he did not discuss this with Rabbani. "This point was not included in our negotiations," Mestiri told AFP. Mestiri's departure from the Presidential Palace was blocked by a small group of placard-waving children demonstrating for peace. Exiting from his limousine Mestiri spoke with two young Afghan girls who handed him their written demands. "I know all the children in Afghanistan want peace," Mestiri said, before driving off to the Intercontinental Hotel for his next meeting, with provincial peace delegation leader Jallaloddin Haqani. The pistol-packing Haqani said all sides in the factional fighting had agreed on the point that the military option was null and void. However, 200 kilometres (120 miles) north of Kabul fighting raged between the forces of Rabbani's commander-in-chief, former defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, and Hekmatyar's military ally, Uzbek warlord General Abdol Rashid Dostam. The fighting is around Dostam-occupied Qelagai, where massive amounts of ammunition and large numbers of Masood troops are being trucked daily in preparation for an attack against the strategic centre of Pul-e Khumri, half an hour's drive further north. UN sources said there was a possibility that observers might be sent to Kabul to monitor the situation but ruled out the military role of Blue Helmets as peace-makers.
