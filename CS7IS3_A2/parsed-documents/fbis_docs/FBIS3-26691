This will cause Hong Kong to lose as much as 2 billion dollars. The Hong Kong Government is seizing the time to study other channels. It is learned that the cause of the delay is that departments of the Hong Kong Government underestimated the time needed for construction. The estimate of the Hong Kong Government was based on past experience, including that of the No 7 and No 8 container terminals in Kuai Chung and Tsingyi Island, which took about five years for design and construction. Therefore, the construction of the first container terminal on Lantau Island is also based on 5 years and is estimated to be completed and put into operation around the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997. However, upon further study of the design of No 10 container terminal, it has been found that the project on Lantau Island is more complicated than those in Kuai Chung and Tsingyi Island. Two more years is needed for the project; that is, at the earliest it can only be completed by the end of 1998. The Hong Kong Government has estimated that the delay for two years in the construction of the container terminal No 10 will cause Hong Kong to suffer an economic loss as much as 2 billion dollars. If the No 9 container terminal, on which the Chinese side has not yet given its approval, cannot be gradually put into service by the middle of 1996 as originally scheduled, but has to be delayed for two years, the two container terminals will cause Hong Kong to suffer a total economic lose of 4 billion dollars. Moreover, the loss caused by delay will not be confined to the first two years, but will continue to accumulate. This is because Kaoshiung in Taiwan, Singapore, and Yantian Port, the construction of which will soon be completed in Shenzhen, are close to Hong Kong and they will become powerful competitors. Because of the delay in the construction of the No 9 and No 10 container terminals, the navigation lines of some container ships can only be shifted to container terminals in neighboring areas. It is even more difficult to estimate the long-term economic losses of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Government has, based on the speed of growth of the container transport volume of Hong Kong, estimated that by the end of 1996 it will be necessary for the No 10 container terminal to be put into service before all the containers can be handled. This estimation is also based on the operation of No 9 container terminal as scheduled. The Hong Kong Government is seizing the time to study other ways, and plans under consideration include giving up the past practice of asking financial groups to reclaim land from the sea and build the terminal, and instead doing the work directly by the government itself. Another plan is to use sea sand to reclaim land from the sea. The tentative view of the Hong Kong Government is that the plan for the government to reclaim land from the sea and to do the construction work may not save time. Therefore, the feasibility of this plan is not great. On the other hand, the second plan may save as much as six months and may enable No 10 container terminal to be completed in the beginning of 1998. The Hong Kong Government will appoint, as soon as possible, consultant companies to study how fast the method of using sea sand to reclaim land can speed up the construction and to study if there is any other way that may save even more time.
