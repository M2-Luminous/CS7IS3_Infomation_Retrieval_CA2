FBIS4-27941 "dreas109_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Thailand Volunteers Start Trial of AIDS Vaccine Volunteers Start Trial of AIDS Vaccine BK0606052794 Bangkok THE NATION in English 6 Jun 94 p A5 BK0606052794 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [By Saowalakk Phumyaem] [Excerpt] Trials of an anti-Aids vaccine produced by a U.S. company will begin on 30 volunteers today, the first such tests in Thailand, a senior Red Cross official said. Prof Praphan Phanuphak, director of the society's Aids programme, said the volunteers will be inoculated with a synthetic protein which resembles part of the HIV virus and should generate an immunity to the disease. Praphan said the UBI-1 candidate vaccine is produced by United Biomedical Inc in the United States. The vaccine has been tested experimentally in China and Australia, and on animals and about 100 people in the United States. The human trials in Thailand, the first of a four planned programmes in developing countries, are under Prahpan's direction, with supervision by Thai Red Cross Society secretary-general Paen Wannamethi and Prof Supphawat Chutiwong, dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Chulalongkon University. The World Health Organization has approved tests of UBI-1 in four developing countries -- Thailand, Brazil, Uganda and Rwanda. Praphan said experiments overseas had shown the vaccine can build a resistance to infection by the HIV virus, the forerunner of Aids. The production process for the vaccine was easy and inexpensive. The programme has been approved by an ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkon University, and an Aids research committee at the Public Health Ministry. He said the trials are intended to determine if the vaccine can generate anti-bodies in the blood or a protein that can destroy the Aids virus in a test tube. HIV-free volunteers were selected in April from applicants aged 20-50 years old whose behaviour patterns mean they are not prone to HIV infection. Pregnant women were not selected. The volunteers, 25 men and 5 women, will be vaccinated three times in the first, second and sixth months. Their immune system will be checked eight months after the first vaccination. Praphan said the volunteers will be divided into two groups of 15 each. Only 12 will be inoculated with UBI-1 candidate vaccine and the rest will get a placebo. Some of the 12 will receive 100 microgrammes of the vaccine and the others 500 microgrammes, to enable a comparison of the effects. Those who receive the vaccine will all test "positive", but they will not actually be infected with HIV and hospitals could identify the difference. The volunteers are being provided with cards stating that their blood will test positive for two years after the end of the experiment. He said half of the 30 volunteers have a bachelor or masters degree and 70-80 per cent are frequent blood donors. About half of them have already donated their bodies to medical research once they die. The volunteers are from varying occupations. They include taxi drivers, soldiers, police, engineers, nurses, teachers, lawyers and a Buddhist monk. [passage omitted]
