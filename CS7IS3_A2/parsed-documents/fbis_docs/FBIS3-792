IFP Central Committee Executive member, Dr Ngubane, said in a statement: "As far as we are concerned, last Friday's deadline is immaterial as to whether or not we decide to participate in the elections". He said Inkatha had not missed the election boat, and would still decide whether or not to join the April poll. This decision was subject to negotiations on the modalities of international mediation in South Africa's constitutional impasse. Dr Ngubane also dismissed as "a lie" any suggestion that he was considering leaving the IFP and changing parties in order to fight the election. He said such a suggestion was aimed at sowing division in the IFP. "It is a lie that I have considered changing parties because last week's lapsed registration of candidates deadline has ostensibly resulted in the IFP being automatically disbarred from participating in elections. This is patent nonsense. Not only would I not consider leaving the IFP irrespective of our participation or otherwise, but as far as we are concerned last Friday's deadline is immaterial as to whether or not we decide to participate in the elections," Dr Ngubane said. Last week the IFP said it would not submit an election candidates list until there was international mediation on outstanding constitutional differences. Mediation would have to achieve amendments to the interim constitution, secure the position of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and rationalise the electoral process and timetables to ensure a free and fair election in which all parties could participate on an equal footing. The IFP indicated the deadline for the registration of parties and the submission of candidate lists could be changed by proclamation by State President F W de Klerk. The body governing elections, the Independent Electoral Commission, said at the weekend that the time was up for parties to join the poll because the ballot papers were already being printed.
