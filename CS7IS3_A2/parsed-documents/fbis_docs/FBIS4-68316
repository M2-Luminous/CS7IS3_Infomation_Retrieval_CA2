Commenting at the request of the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent on the possibility of the construction of a new domestic cosmodrome between the Amur and Zeya rivers, the governor of the Amur Oblast, Vladimir Polevanov, had no idea, it seems, what effect his affirmative response would engender. The issue centers on the creation of a unique testing ground from which heavy-lift launchers such as Proton, Zenit, and even Energiya would be able to place in orbit virtually any space vehicle. Whether the far reaches of Russia will become the space "New Vasyuks" is a question that, more than anything else, depends on money. But the position of the leadership of the oblast is pragmatic and therefore, on the outside only, appears immovable. The project -- if, of course, it is carried out -- will bring into the weak economy of the Amur region large capital investment, will create new jobs, and will raise the prestige of a poor far eastern province. The opposition has its own radically opposite point of view: the idea is bad, and the site itself won't hold up to criticism. You'll recall how three years ago, in this same place, in the Amur region, a project almost as large and of an international nature was successfully frozen. At that time, when the first administration of the Amur Oblast was still in office, the plan called for throwing up an automobile/train bridge across the border-running Amur, near Blagoveshchensk. Now the third administration is in office. But everything is still the way the dacha holders across whose plots the transcontinental highway was to be built decided long ago it would be. The bridge isn't being built, even though there is even a special decree of the Government of Russia to have it done. Won't the new project, which also has an international significance -- China and Japan have already shown their interest in it -- meet the same fate? Before it even came about, the project divided scientists, specialists, and residents of the region into two camps. The opponents of the Russian Baykonur are facing an entire social committee created to protect the future cosmodrome. Newspapers boldly manipulating the "public vote" are drawing horrible scenes of massive catastrophe. The far easterners are predicting a global apocalypse: the stages from the spacecraft that are launched will start falling on the heads of the Amur residents, and the jarring of the soil will cause earthquakes, which will cause the Zeya Hydroelectric Station reservoir to fill up to the brim, and the water will break the dam, and every living thing for hundreds of kilometers around will perish. But the local residents are responding calmly to the gloomy predictions, and no one is running out of the places where the construction is supposed to be. Just the opposite -- people are declaring their readiness to work on Russia's future launch complex. A purely economic factor is at work: getting permanent, high-paying work and joining the ranks of contractors for a project that has state-level status means resolving the issue of one's own well-being, not to mention survival. Judging from everything, that's how the situation was sized up by the group that makes up the Amurstroyproyekt joint-stock company, one of the first to proffer its services to the military. Why the military? The fact is that the new Russian cosmodrome is expected to be built in places in which, until only recently, the military were the main dramatis personae. The missile units, closed to journalists and concentrated in the forests and knolls near the Amur section of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, all went under the name of Svobodnyy-18. Not far from Svododnyy were the "articles" with nuclear entrails. Missiles without warheads were, the military say, launched from the silos there on a regular basis, and nobody had a problem with that, because, they say, nobody knew about it. Thanks for the disclosure, especially since it comes from someone who should know. From, for example, the strategic missile forces division commander, Maj.-Gen. Aleksandr Vinidiktov. In doling out information to the press, he told about how, today already, they -- the military -- are literally being assaulted with requests that they employ machine operators from nearby settlements. They're taking many of them. The residents themselves of the town of Svobodnyy-18 are divided about the possible transfer to the aegis of the military-space department. Most of the officers, who often work without pay, are for it. Space to them is not just some abstract world -- it's a means of achieving strictly earthbound goals. The facility, my conversation partner assured me, presents no serious danger. the nuclear weapons that used to be in the military units (those missiles have been removed from the military's possession) represented a much greater threat to the entire region. But the issue of the construction of a far eastern cosmodrome is not yet settled. Having studied the circumstances, specialists have acknowledged that Svobodnyy-18 is one of the best places in Russia to build a space launch complex. In fact, it won't even be a cosmodrome, but rather the main center for testing and adapting space systems. Again, that's if it ends up there. One thing is certain and indisputable: there won't be any nuclear testing in that center. Despite the encouraging last phrase of the professional missileman, the decision won't be an easy one for Moscow or Blagoveshchensk to make. Local patriots suggest that the Russian Baykonur be built wherever is best, but not on the Amur. Of course, one can't tackle such a grandiose project, one that is capable of attracting the attention of the world community, without performing in-depth analysis, above all ecological analysis. But what's also indisputable is the fact that the fate of a facility that is strategically important for this power can't be decided by a simple vote. By the way, in America, they built a cosmodrome in a resort state, Florida, on the basis both of national interests and local interests. But this issue, I repeat, is a state issue and isn't to be resolved as if it were otherwise. In fact, we're not Florida.
