"There is a lot of trepidation to say the least," said one officer. "It is a very major, in-depth review and will impact dramatically on all serving personnel." Servicemen fear their military status may mean that, unlike the police, they have no redress. The review, announced at the weekend by the Chief of the Defence Staff, will take about a year, starting in the spring. It will be conducted by an independent chairman and up to five independent members, yet to be named. It is described by the Ministry of Defence as a major review of "service career and manpower structures, and terms and conditions of service." This is taken to include such issues as the extent of unaccompanied service for married men -- for example in Northern Ireland -- overseas allowances and subsidised schooling. The review has been launched in the context of a three-year efficiency drive to meet Treasury demands for further cuts in the defence budget.
