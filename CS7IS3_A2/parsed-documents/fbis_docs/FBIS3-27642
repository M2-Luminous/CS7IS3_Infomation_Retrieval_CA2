That day, the plane took off from Changsha at 0928 and flew over Fuzhou at about 1020. At that moment, hijacker Lin Wenqiang, carrying a fruit knife and an "explosive," forced the crew to open the door to the pilot's compartment, demanding that the plane fly to Taiwan. He threatened to stab the pilot to death with the knife and to blow up the plane if the pilot did not obey him. In order to guarantee the safety of the passengers and the plane, the crew accepted the hijacker's demand. Now, Lin has been detained by the Taiwan police. Lin's wife, stepmother, and two children have returned to the mainland on the same plane. What kind of person is Lin Wenqiang? Why did he hijack a plane to Taiwan? The official answered this reporter's questions. According to the investigation by the mainland public security organs, hijacker Lin Wenqiang, male, was born on 2 June 1958. He originally was a peasant in Huangshi Village, Baizhong Township, Minqing County, Fujian Province. In 1982, he managed the Wufengqiao ceramic tile factory, but the factory did not achieve good business results owing to poor management. He transferred the factory's management contract to other people in 1992. At that time, he owed banks 7,470 yuan and owed the workers more than 70,000 yuan in wages. In July 1992, Lin went to Changsha, in Hunan, and undertook the management of the ceramic workshop at the Changsha fuse factory. As the quality and quantity of the workshop failed to meet standards, Lin's management contract was suspended by the factory in July 1993. Then, together with some people, Lin undertook the management of the household electrical appliance sales department of a labor service company. As Lin took away more than 2,200 yuan of sales income, the other partners stopped cooperating with him. These consecutive business failures made Lin unable to repay his increasing debts. He borrowed an armed police officer's uniform from an officer's wife on the pretext of taking photos for fun. He then used forged certificates and passed himself off as an armed police officer in order to board the plane he planned to hijack. The official stressed: The frequent occurrence of hijacking incidents between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is not accidental. This is related directly to the Taiwan authorities' policy for handling such criminal cases. Although the Taiwan authorities take certain legal actions against hijackers, the punishments are too lenient for such a serious crime, and the hijackers are not sent back to the mainland. Although the Taiwan authorities take certain legal actions against hijackers, the punishments are too lenient for such a serious crime, and the hijackers are not sent back to the mainland. This has abetted some lawless people in making the desperate move. Facts demonstrate that if the hijackers are not sent back, there will be no peace in the air above the straits. It is hoped that the Taiwan authorities will consider the safety of civil aviation and of passengers' property, and will assume a realistic attitude to promoting the conclusion of an agreement on returning hijackers between the two sides of the straits, thus thoroughly eliminating the crime of hijacking.
