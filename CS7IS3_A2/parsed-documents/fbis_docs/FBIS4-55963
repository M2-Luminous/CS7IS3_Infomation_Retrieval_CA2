The spokesman said there were indications the fighting near Tesanj, a Moslem-held town, "could represent a significant increase in offensive actions" by the Bosnian Army. A UN spokesman meanwhile said two Serb tanks had fired on Bosnian army positions within the UN-imposed heavy arms exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. The tanks reportedly "fired from Mazovici, just inside the total exclusion zone." UN military observers also reported "heavy shelling and fighting" around Maglaj, another Moslem town 15 kilometres (10 miles) south of Tesanj. A spokesman surmised the fighting was "a possible attempt by the BiH (Bosnian Army) to gain ground west of the Maglaj pocket." Further north, Brcko, under Serb control, had Monday experienced a second consecutive day of shelling believed to have been launched by Moslems. "There were 10 impacts recorded last night in Brcko," a UN spokesman said. "We have seen some significant shelling into Brcko and this is largely believed to be the shelling of the BiH side into the town." Unconfirmed reports suggested the shelling was designed to cut electricity supplies to Brcko, situated in a corridor linking Serb- held territory in Bosnia and Croatia to Serbia proper. Exchanges between Serb and Croat forces were also reported at Orasje, a Croat pocket of land northwest of Brcko. Elsewhere, Bosnian troops shelled the northern Serb-held town of Doboj during Tuesday afternoon, causing damage, Belgrade's TANJUG news agency said. Doboj, with its population of 20,000, is an important regional rail hub. TANJUG said five people were injured in two rocket attacks on the town Monday.
