The peasants there have written a "New Song of Yitao" and sing it everywhere. "New Song of Yitao," praising the blood-and-flesh ties between our party and the people, is both thought-provoking and inspiring. The rural primary party organizations are the party's important foundation for accomplishing its rural work. The great changes of Yitao Township have shown to people that the party's rural principles and policies are in line with the people's aspirations. So long as there is a leader who is ideologically correct, displays a good work style, and has the courage to pioneer, the enthusiasm of the masses will be aroused, their strength will be pooled, and a poor village can quickly improve its situation. (end of editor's note) [passage omitted] Yitao is an old revolutionary base area on the lower reaches of the Yishu He and it is named after Zhu Yitao who was a native here and a revolutionary martyr. After liberation, the cadres and people here made great efforts to develop production and Yitao was once very famous in the Chang Jiang and Huai He region. However, some cadres here changed their work style several years ago. They indulged in eating and drinking extravagantly and squandering pbulic funds. They also wantonly collected fees and fines and wantonly apportioned expenses and work among the people. There was a strong resentment among the people. During a visit here two years ago, the reporters heard the villagers sing a song: "Yitao peasants oppose 'three wanton practices'" [passage omitted] The lyrics of the song was written by Sun Zhonghua, a villager of Wandui Village of Yitao Township. [passage omitted] The reporters visited all villages in the township and saw that many villagers were living in shabby thatched huts and some of them did not even have food in their home. So, the reporters truthfully reported to the departments concerned Yitao's serious problem, the peasants' plight, and their song. After General Secretary Jiang Zemin heard about the song, he issued an important instruction on improving the situation of Yitao. The Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee was determined to solve problem for the "number one poor township." [passage omitted] In 1992 spring, the Shuyang County CPC Committee appointed Chen Xueping, a young cadre, to serve as the secretary of the Yitao Township Party Committee. Chen Xueping is a "trouble-shooter." [passage omitted] The township party committee deems it an important task to reduce the peasants' burden. In 1993, the peasants' burden was reduced by 710,000 yuan. [passage omitted] The party committee also helped raise funds, successfully built 10 electric pumping stations and 500 auxiliary projects, and turned 35,000 mu of dry land into rice paddies which ensure stable yields despite droughts or excessive rains. [passage omitted] In 1993, Yitao Township, with industrial and agricultural output value exceeding 120 million yuan, became the first township of the "100-million-yuan category" in the county.
