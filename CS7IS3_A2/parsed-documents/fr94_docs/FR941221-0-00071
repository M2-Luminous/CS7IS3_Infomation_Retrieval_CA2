An owner that gives preferences to elderly families and reserves units for non-elderly disabled families in accordance with this section also shall select applicants among each respective group in accordance with the Federal preferences contained in ยง884.226. Projects under National Housing Act programs and receiving section 8 assistance may be subject to preferences in addition to those contained in ยง884.226 which also must be applied in selecting applicants among each respective group. (h) Prohibition of evictions. An owner may not evict a tenant without good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620). PART 886_SECTION 8 HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS PROGRAM_SPECIAL ALLOCATIONS 11. The authority citation for 24 CFR part 886 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437a, 1437c, 1437f, 3535(d), and 13611&hyph;13619. 12. Section 886.329a is revised to read as follows: ยง886.329a Preferences for occupancy by elderly families. (a) Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families. (1) Election by owners of eligible projects. (i) An owner of a project involving substantial rehabilitation and assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section. (ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an ``elderly project.'' ``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older. (iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if: (A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as ``non-elderly disabled families'') is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or (B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families. (iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election. (2) HUD approval of election not required. (i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.
