Head of the Chernobyl AES shift Oleksandr Yelchyshchev informed the INTERFAX-UKRAINE Agency that the leak amounts to two cubic meters per hour. He pointed out that this has not led to a change in the radiation situation in adjacent buildings. According to him, the water leak does not constitute any special danger. O. Yelchyshchev also stressed that such incidents are "a disease of all atomic plants of this type." * * * As reported yesterday [14 June] by Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Supervision, at the second power unit of the Chernobyl AES, beside the main system for adding water to the decay tank, where there were 480 cassettes, three additional ones have been prepared. Collection and purification of water that percolates through walls and ceilings of several chambers adjacent to the decay tank have been organized. The radioactivity of this water is about 1.0 microcurie per liter. It is mainly due to the presence of cesium. A program has been elaborated for locating the leak, and work is based upon that program. In particular, 420 nuclear cassettes have been taken out of the tank.
