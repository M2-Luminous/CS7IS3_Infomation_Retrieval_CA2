The open letter of the collective published by local press says that because of the blockage of payments between the two countries. The plant just as an energy complex of which it is part, cannot provide itself with nuclear fuel and reserves of technological equipment. The situation is aggravated by the fact that many workers and employees get a discharge and leave for Russia as civic, language and other problems of skilled personnel are not being solved. Nuclear specialists believe that the stoppage of the plant threatens to paralyse enterprises of the eastern Caspian Basin. The supply to cities and villages of technical and drinking water received by desalination will be stopped. The very stoppage of the fast-neutron reactor can lead to unpredictable consequences. There are no effective projects for its stopage and conservation.
