The statement also stresses that the presidential elections pose no contradiction to Ukraine's laws and constitution and are held in full compliance with the law "On division of powers between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine." In the Republicans' opinion, this was also confirmed by Ukraine's Ministry of Justice in reply to a query whether Sevastopol had the right to take part in these elections. The Sevastopol branch of the RPK said that the measures taken by the government and president of Ukraine to restrict Crimea's powers and the rights of the people of the autonomous republic may become the last straw which will spark off a big fire. If the Crimean people, who will be electing their president, see the expression of their will ignored, "we will have to appeal to the world community, specifically, to the United Nations," the statement says.
