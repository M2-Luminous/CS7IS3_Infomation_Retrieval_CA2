Belgium has always felt close to these countries. Are you yourself satisfied with the proposal? [Claes] Yes, because I do not see any alternative to the U.S. proposal. We must continue to reject any fatalistic approach to Moscow. The immediate integration of several Central European countries would not only mean redrawing the areas of influence and a dividing line a few hundred kilometers further east, but would, above all, amount to an acknowledgement that these countries are in danger and that they must be protected against a danger coming from Moscow, and that we do not believe that those who want to complete the democratization of Russia have any chance of success. While in fact Russia could be one of the principal partners in a policy for stability in Europe. Also, the Polish, the Czechs and others should not believe that it is sufficient to simply enter the antechamber and wait for the door to open at a certain moment. It is also up to them to prove that they are ready to make the efforts, to give the necessary guarantees to enter gradually into the NATO family. And from a practical point of view, it would be naive to believe that it is possible to apply overnight the guarantee of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to an additional four or five countries. To do so, you must take all the required military precautions and reorganize NATO. For a number of reasons, I therefore believe the "Partnership for Peace" to be the right approach. But this does not mean that the Russians have a right of veto. Quite the contrary. While, just a few weeks ago, we gave ourselves quite a lot of time to pursue a step-by-step strategy towards membership without any fixed deadlines, if present political developments continue in Moscow and the worrying signs increase, we will no doubt have to speed up the move towards integration within NATO of those Central European countries which satisfy the required conditions. [LE SOIR] What worrying signs? [Claes] Firstly, the election results. Then the very clear attitude of the progressives, Gaydar, Fedorov and others, who have left the government, not to mention the antics of Zhirinovskiy. There are also doubts at the economic level. I am referring to the most recent stance taken by the IMF which has banged its fist on the table saying that we cannot continue to apply the programs if the other side do not play strictly to the rules. [LE SOIR] Is this a position you share? [Claes] Yes. There are limits to everything. There is no point in making great efforts, and I support such efforts, if there are not the basic conditions guaranteeing a minimum of success. There is a point at which the IMF must show its teeth. Then there are the statements made by Mr. Kozyrev, who is in fact a personal friend. When he speaks of Russia's near abroad it makes you pause for thought. If you then also take account of what is happening in Byelorussia, and the election results in Crimea, you see an accumulation of elements which could result in a more pronounced destabilization which would oblige us to speed up the move towards integration within NATO. [LE SOIR] What could Europe's attitude be toward aid to Russia? [Claes] We have adopted a very clear and expansive policy. A few days before leaving for Moscow on 11 November, we gave a mandate to the Commission, which was soon to lead to the signing of a partnership agreement providing very substantial aid and with the ultimate aim of creating a free trade area. It is not the Commission's fault that this agreement remains unsigned today. Like the IMF, the European Union must also demand that certain principles be included in the agreement, such as the respect for human rights and regulations prohibiting the policy of dumping. [LE SOIR] The Americans are asking the Twelve to further open up their markets to the countries of Central Europe. Is it not true that at the same time as it proposes association agreements, the European Union is closing the door to these countries' principal exports? [Claes] The European Union imports 80 times more from these countries than the United States does. It bears the largest share, virtually gigantic in fact, of aid for Central and Eastern Europe. The European Union and the Twelve together provide more than 70 percent of aid for these countries, Germany making by far the greatest effort. We don't therefore need lecturing. Admittedly, for economic reasons, combined with the very serious recession in the EU with more than 17 million unemployed, we are still obliged to protect some very sensitive sectors and products. Go and explain to the workers at Boel that we must open up our borders to iron and steel products from the East without any conditions and no antidumping guarantees. [LE SOIR] Do you not fear that Germany will be tempted to play a more autonomous role in Central Europe? [Claes] It is genuinely difficult for Germany to do right. Either it subscribes fully to a policy defined by the European Union and it is criticized for failing in its duty as a global economic power with respect to Central Europe, or it tries to do rather more and it is accused of drawing back from a commitment to Europe and carving out a role for itself as leader of Mitteleuropa. I myself have every faith in the intentions of German politicians, whether in government or in opposition. They are true Europeans who have understood that it is preferable, in order to avoid any risk of history repeating itself, to further integrate Germany in the construction of Europe. Also being pragmatists, they have understood that the challenges are so great that even a giant such as Germany is not able to confront them alone. Zaire -- Putting the Agreement Into Practice [LE SOIR] Does the agreement that has just been concluded in Zaire mean that there has been a true reconciliation? [Claes] Unfortunately, it is too early to reply in the affirmative. We have reached an agreement on the merger of the assemblies and on the principle of a government of reconciliation led by a member of the opposition. However, we have already had so many surprises. We must wait for this agreement to be put into practice. I hope that this will be done in the coming days or weeks. If the agreement stands up, the state of decay in which Zaire finds itself is such that an extraordinary effort will be needed from the international community to create the conditions needed just to get things off the ground in a country which is in the process of falling apart. The World Bank has just closed its office in Zaire and the IMF has issued a very clear warning. [LE SOIR] Is it not a paradox that the international financial institutions are pulling out of the country at the very time when things are looking promising again? [Claes] That shows the despair of these institutions and this country's lack of credibility. No one believes in miracles any more, even if we do need one. Having said that, these institutions will again be ready to cooperate in seeing that the agreement is implemented once some concrete evidence has been put on the table. What I am afraid of is that from the start we will get caught up in a vicious circle. The authorities in Zaire are going to demand aid to get the ball rolling again while the international bodies will firstly ask for proof of good will and that the agreements will be respected. Belgium will be called upon to play a leading role, together with Paris and Washington. We have not reached that stage yet, however. [LE SOIR] For the time being, has there been any change in Belgium's attitude? [Claes] No, none. [LE SOIR] Were you surprised by the reports issued by the American State Department and Amnesty International on human rights infringements in Zaire? [Claes] No. Belgium generally has reasonably reliable and authentic sources in Zaire. I find it rather hard to believe the figures that we have received in certain reports but we are not surprised by the actual facts of the matter. We have known for some time that the country is on a slippery slope from this point of view. That is why, in our declarations, we first talked of the rights of man even before we could speak of democracy.
