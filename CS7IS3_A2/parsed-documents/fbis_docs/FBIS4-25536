The resolution says: The DPRK, as a party to the "treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons," failed to carry out the main part of the IAEA's safeguards agreement and prevented the IAEA from inspecting its nuclear facilities to check the history of the reactor fuel rods and to determine whether the nuclear materials produced by its reactors have been diverted to other uses. The resolution called on the DPRK to cooperate fully with the IAEA Secretariat and to guarantee the IAEA access to all the documents and places concerned. The resolution says that the IAEA has decided to stop its nonmedical aid to the DPRK according to Section C of Article 12 of the IAEA Charter. The representatives of the 35 member countries of the Board of Governors, including China, attended the meeting today. The Chinese representative pointed out during discussion: "The ultimate objectives in settling the Korean nuclear issue should be to ensure the denuclearization of the peninsula and to safeguard peace and stability there." "Losing one opportunity to carry out a technical inspection does not mean that all safeguard and supervisory opportunities and all the hopes to settle the nuclear issue have been lost." He said that the key point at present is that all parties concerned should calm down, make solid efforts, and leave some leeway for solving problems, rather than create an impasse. The Chinese representative said: It is difficult for China to support the resolution. First, past experience proves that adopting a resolution is not a constructive move, and it will inevitably worsen the atmosphere, intensify contradictions, and create new difficulties in settling the Korean nuclear issue. Second, the suspension of technical aid to the DPRK, as mentioned in the resolution, is in fact a kind of sanctions. China is extremely worried about the possible serious consequences of such an action. The resolution sponsored by 18 countries including the United States, Japan, France, and Russia was adopted by vote toward the end of the meeting. Twenty-eight countries voted for it, and one voted against it, while four countries, including China, abstained. Two others did not participate in voting. The meeting of the Board of Governors opened on 6 June. With the Korean nuclear issue being its main topic, the meeting has been followed with interest by all countries of the world.
