The Russian prime minister pointed out in reply to a question asked by ITAR-TASS that "today, Russia and Belarus have not only come up close to the merger of their monetary systems, but to the deepening of economic integration in the CIS framework." Chernomyrdin pointed out that the creation of the single rouble space between the two countries has a mutually advantageous character, adding that "none of us is seeking to gain any advantage at each other's expense". The prime minister declared that "by signing today's statement, Russia does not encroach on Belarusian sovereignty. The document is aimed at deepening the coordination of our activities in the economic sphere and this is the principle followed by the whole Europe in its development." As a result of Russo-Belarusian talks held in the building of the Russian Government on Wednesday, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich signed an agreement on trade and economic cooperation in 1994. Vice-premiers of the two countries, Aleksandr Shokhin and Vladimir Zalomay, signed an agreement on supplies of Russian natural gas to Belarus and the construction of a system of gas pipelines on the Belarusian territory.
