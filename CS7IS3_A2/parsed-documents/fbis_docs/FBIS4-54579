According to the message, the presence of the former sovereign would have guaranteed civic and moral peace as well as the spiritual peace that the country needs in order to come out of self-doubt, discouragement, and fear. Considering that the unjust decision on his exclusion -- a decision taken more than 40 years ago by the leaders of the communist coup d'etat -- is also upheld at the highest state levels today, Mihai of Romania announces that he does not want to lose hope and, along with the Christian formula of Christ Is Reborn, adds: It is high time that your patience should bear fruit. The message continues, quote: My fate is in your hands. It is up to each one of you whether I can return home. The time has come that, after sacrifices and suffering, we should be again together, for our fatherland's revival. In connection with the message sent by Romania's former king on the Holy Easter holidays, a message which contains several references to his cancellation of his visit to Romania, the Romanian spokesperson was authorized to state the following: As announced, the Romanian Government has expressed its regret that the invitation it has sent to the former king -- for the first time since the abolition of the monarchy -- to pay a private visit to Romania on the occasion of the Holy Easter holidays this year was not met with an appropriate response, despite the fact that the government has shown itself ready to ensure the proper organization and development of the visit. Unfortunately, the former king's message clearly reveals the true reasons for his refusal to accept the government's proposals, which were made in the context of strict observation of the country's constitutional provisions. The real aim of the visit, as it resulted from the text of the message, was to create conditions for his comeback on Romania's political scene, something which directly contradicts his previous statements, whereby the former king said that he wants to pay a private visit and does not challenge the constitutional order. Moreover, the message contains inciting calls, capable of disturbing the public quiet and law and order in the country, the communique points out. The government intends to exert its prerogatives, by strictly observing the principles and norms of the rule-of-law state, as sanctioned by Romania's Constitution, in order to ensure a climate of quiet and public order, which are so necessary for the further democratization of our political and social life. Therefore, the government cannot accept -- in any form or under any pretext -- such actions, which may jeopardize the constitutional order in the country. The government is firmly determined to treat any future intent of the former king to visit Romania in the same way, only on the basis of a clear commitment by the latter to observe the constitutional order in Romania.
