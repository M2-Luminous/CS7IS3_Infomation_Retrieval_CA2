The statement said the commissioner of police had information that police officers in Maseru will not go to work. He knew this at 6 o'clock in the evening last night. The statement said during discussions the commissioner received written complaints from the police. It said this morning those complaints were tabled before the defense commission, which urged the Ministry of Home Affairs to table them before the cabinet. Most of the requests had already been presented to the Ministry of Home Affairs by the commissioner of police. Following the decision made by the cabinet, a committee was established to look into their requests. The committee ended its work last week and its findings will be announced soon. The ministry therefore appeals to the police officers who were not carrying out their normal duties to return to work, as their requests were being attended to. Meanwhile, the strike by police initially reported in Maseru this morning has spread to other districts of the country, and in Maseru looters took advantage of the situation and emptied some of the shops situated at the old bus stop. The looted shops include bakers and hypermarkets, prompting their owners to call members of Security Lesotho to quell the looting. Members of the Lesotho Defense Force also arrived at the scene to put the situation under control. Other districts affected by the strike are Mafiteng, Leribe, and Butha Buthe. In Mafiteng the work stoppage began this morning, when a notice saying there were no services was mounted at the gate of the Mafiteng police station. Police officers who normally assist at the district secretary's office also did not turn up for work. In Leribe the police said they began the strike after receiving word from someone who said he was calling from the police headquarters in Maseru informing them about the strike. The news spread to the Butha Buthe police and they also joined the action.
