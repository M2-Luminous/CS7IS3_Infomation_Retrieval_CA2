The document notes that "regrettably, some forces used the celebrations of the 49th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War and the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Sevastopol for provocations and extremist statements against Ukraine and its Navy." "Some admirals and officers of the Black Sea Fleet ever more loudly voice their readiness to violate the integrity of the current borders, and the position of the Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin, who recently said unequivocally that `the fleet is a power and should not be touched,' makes them confident of their full impunity," the statement points out. The Military Council of the Ukrainian Navy regrets that "such a position prevails today in the power structures of Sevastopol and Crimea."
