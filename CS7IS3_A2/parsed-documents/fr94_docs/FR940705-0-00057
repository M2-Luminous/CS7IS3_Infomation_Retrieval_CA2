FR940705-0-00057 FR940705-0-00005 Amendment of CFR A. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. , imposes certain requirements on federal agencies (including the Commission) in connection with their conducting or sponsoring any collection of information as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act. The amendments to rules 1.55, 33.7 and 190.10 do not change the burdens associated with those rules. The groups of rules of which they are a part have the following burdens: Rule 33.7_(3038&hyph;0007) Average Burden Hours Per Response_50.32 Number of Respondents_190,197 Frequency of Response_Occasionally Rule 190.10_(3038&hyph;0021) Average Burden Hours_0.35 Number of Respondents_802 Frequency of Response_Occasionally No additional burden is associated with the amendments to rules 33.7 and 190.10. The burden associated with the group which encompasses rules 1.55, 180.3 and rule 1.65 is: Rules 1.55, 180.3 and 1.65_(3038&hyph;0022) Average Burden Hours Per Response_613.26 Number of Respondents_4295 Frequency of Response_Occasionally No additional burden is associated with the amendments to rule 1.55. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. ยง601 et seq. , requires that agencies, in proposing rules, consider the impact of these rules on small business. In this connection, the Commission previously has determined that FCMs and Commodity Pool Operators should not be considered small entities for purposes of the RFA. 27 With respect to IBs and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs), the Commission has stated that it would evaluate within the context of each proposal whether all or some IBs and CTAs should be considered small entities, and if so, that it would analyze the economic impact on them of any rule. 28 Because the proposed amendments to the Commission rules discussed herein will not result in any significant additional burdens to the above mentioned registrants and may in practice result in a reduction of certain existing burdens, the Commission believes that the proposed rule amendments will not have a significant economic impact on such entities. Therefore, pursuant to section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. ยง605(b), the Acting Chairman of the Commission certifies that these proposed rule amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 27 47 FR 18618 (April 30, 1982). 28 Id.
