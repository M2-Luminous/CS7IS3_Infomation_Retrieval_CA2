Army General Rasim Delic, chief of staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, and Viktor Andreyev, chief of the UNPROFOR civilian sector for Bosnia-Herzegovina, also attended the talks. General Rose complained about the increase in the number of attacks on UNPROFOR by both sides. President Izetbegovic said that our policy is full cooperation with UNPROFOR, and that everything will be done to provide them with normal conditions for work. He stressed that the cease-fire had to hold on the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and not partially, as it suits the aggressor. Military observers for the monitoring of the cease-fire should be deployed in a reciprocal fashion on both our and the aggressors' side, but the presence of the aggressor's liaison officers on our territory is unacceptable. General Rose said that intensive work was under way in Gorazde to solve the problems with the return of the population to their homes in the zone within 3 km. Asked by Rose about the possibility of extending the cease-fire for another four weeks, President Izetbegovic said that this would depend on the progress made in the political negotiations.
