Let us recall that the last attempt to save peace on the territory of former Yugoslavia was the initiative of Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kiro Gligorov, president of Macedonia, on forming a confederation of south Slav states. The greater state appetites of Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman, and the desire of the citizens of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia to break free from the Belgrade Bolshevik hegemony then came into direct confrontation. The former Yugoslav People's Army was used as the fiercest defender of such a hegemony, simply because it was the only guarantor of the high standard of living for its officers and of the high budget earmarked for the Army. The war criminal Radovan Karadzic, if this is his idea, is too late in starting to think independently, and if he is still a mere mouthpiece for Milosevic's ideas, he is then offering us one more deceit, the umpteenth prison of the South Slav peoples. After they themselves broke up the now already former Yugoslavia, after hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in war, after expelling, displacing, or forcing the emigration of more than 2 million people, after destroying the economies of all these states and everything that people painstakingly achieved over years, the value of which is estimated to tens of billions of dollars, they now realize they cannot live without us. They have realized this even before, but they expected to achieve their domination with force, arms, and the sowing of fear. Along with the fear, they have sown hatred, distrust, and evil. Just as the force and all the weapons they have stolen from us failed to help them, just as they have not managed to frighten, conquer, or destroy us, they also failed to implant hatred or to force us to answer crime with crime. We are ready to build confidence among people and nations -- in fact, we have never given it up -- and we are going to build it. However, in doing so we must be careful, at least not to form a union with those people who initiated genocide and made a large part of Serbian people commit it, or at least not oppose it. We could even try with somebody else and somebody different. In August 1992, there was an initiative for a confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Croatia. Had a true military alliance between those states been established then, Serbian fascism would have already been defeated and the conditions created for establishing confidence among peoples and states, and even for establishing the principles of a possible confederal agreement. However, somebody who has several times already saved Milosevic's fascism from a complete defeat, as Tudjman has done, deserves equal suspicion, and his initiatives also.
