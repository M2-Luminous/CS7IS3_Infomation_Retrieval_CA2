What is more, some people are beginning to say that the privatization process is too slow and inefficient. Are these allegations true? [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] First of all, the Ministry of Ownership Transformations has no power to exert any kind of pressure on state enterprises to force them to choose the privatization path sooner rather than later. Nor does it have any interest in doing so. The decision rests first and foremost with the work forces of the firms in question. On the other hand, more than half of all enterprises in Poland are currently in the process of various kinds of ownership transformations. These processes include liquidation, restructuring, completion of privatization schemes, bankruptcy procedures, and transfer of the assets of certain firms into the administration of the State Treasury Agricultural Property Agency. [Winiarski] How does Szczecin Voivodship rate against the background of your statistics? [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] Unfortunately, our region is hardly up with the national leaders. This is because ownership-transformation processes are being carried out at no more than just over 20 percent of firms that were originally set up by the voivoda or by central administration agencies. Even so, whereas we note relatively significant progress in the latter category, the group of enterprises dubbed "voivoda's firms" represents a minor proportion of enterprises currently undergoing privatization in the region. Since the beginning of 1991, transformation operations have been initiated at 71 firms, including 44 from the voivoda's "stable" and 27 administered centrally. Only one-third of the total number have actually been privatized. A dozen or so collapsed, and the rest were liquidated because of their poor financial condition. Four firms were sold to individual private investors, and several more entered joint-stock companies based on foreign capital. All in all, out of the total of 211 state enterprises, 95 were not included in any ownership-transformation processes at all. Just under one-third of all of the enterprises were transferred to the administration of the State Treasury Agricultural Property Agency. [Winiarski] What form of privatization is currently most popular with work forces? [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] The most popular privatization model at present is leasing. Almost 75 percent of firms undergoing privatization choose that particular option. The decisive factors here are work forces' desire to become joint owners of the assets of their own enterprises, accompanied by mistrust of any new outside owners. We currently note a dangerous phenomenon whereby economic analyses are commissioned "to order" by enterprises from outside "consultancy firms." Instead of telling the truth, which is frequently brutal, they go out of their way to prove the correctness of the firms' choice of this or that particular privatization model. This might later turn out to be a very dangerous practice when it becomes apparent that the firm is unable to meet market demands and has no funds with which to meet the lease payments. We have such a situation now with the Regional Land Reclamation Enterprise, whose financial condition brings into question the original decision to privatize it in the leasing system. [Winiarski] But surely someone must have approved that original decision.... [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] Our agency notified the ministry of a number of reservations about the documents we were presented with at the time, but the work force's determination eventually persuaded the minister to make that decision. Our agency has relatively limited powers of intervention in ownership-transformation processes. We are merely an opinion-formulating organ, and we vet documents from the formal and legal angles. Of course, we can formulate a negative opinion, but that does not necessarily mean that a determined firm will not be able to have its way. [Winiarski] A new type of ownership transformation is being introduced now, in the shape of the National Investment Funds. Is this form of privatization attracting much interest? [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] In 1992, when the project was first announced, three firms expressed an interest. Last year, another five firms joined them. At the moment, talks are under way with several more candidates eager to participate in this form of privatization. These are not impressive numbers, but that is also because a considerable number of firms are still poorly informed about the details of this new venture. [Winiarski] How would you assess the present condition of the privatization scene in Szczecin Voivodship? [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] A measure of comfort may be derived from the fact that, for example, last year the Szczecin voivoda did not have to make even a single decision to liquidate an enterprise on grounds of poor economic condition. However, this does not mean that there are no such firms at all. There are, but they are making every effort to survive. In many cases, it is obvious that administration by a board of commissioners would be an insufficient rescue measure that would only serve to prolong their slow death even more. Liquidation processes designed to precede privatization have been carried out successfully in seven firms. This may not be much, but it is still the best result we have noted over the past three years. However, on the whole, there is still too little activity in a significant number of enterprises that ought to be restructured. Szczecin Voivodship is a region with a somewhat exceptional structure. Huge areas are still in the hands of the State Farms, and, in these, privatization is proceeding very sluggishly. There are also a considerable number of enterprises whose privatization would require truly long periods of time and really comprehensive economic analyses. Nevertheless, even those processes could and should be speeded up a little. The trouble is that it is not within our sphere of competence to do the speeding up. A proportion of enterprises should be liquidated and sold as soon as possible. This is because they survive not by carrying out their statutory duties but, for instance, by subletting the land and the property they administer. On the face of it, their financial situation appears not too bad, but the State Treasury could still gain a lot by privatizing those firms. The phenomenon is rather widespread, and it should be opposed by individual enterprises' respective founding agencies. For the time being, any such opposition is not making many inroads. However, the reluctance to make appropriate decisions is also underpinned by the fear of inflation and can be seen as partly justified. Nevertheless, the time for radical decisions will be coming soon.
