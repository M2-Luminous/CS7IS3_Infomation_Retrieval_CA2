"Russia's view that it had `strategic interests' in relation to its `near abroad' and it would not give up what has been fought for for so much, is different from the contents of the declaration signed at the summit of Russia and the USA," Malk said, adding that this should still be a cause of anxiety for other countries. "The world expects Russia to present an explanation as to its attitude towards other states," he stressed. At the summit of the USA and Russia both sides talked about the fact that no divisional lines should be drawn in Europe, Malk said, stressing that calling some states "near abroad" means in itself drawing divisional lines.
