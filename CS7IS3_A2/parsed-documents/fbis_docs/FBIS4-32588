Welcome Mr. Lake!] [Text] President Clinton's announcement about his intention to appoint Mr. Joseph Edward Lake as new U.S. ambassador to Albania arrived at a time when political analysts had already come across signs of change in the U.S. stance toward the Albanian opposition and particularly its largest force, the PS [Socialist Party]. Such signs were contacts established in our country by representatives of the Republican and National Democratic Institute, and several interviews, comments, and analyses of the "Voice of America," which, in stark contrast with the past, began mirroring our reality, with our political developments, the course of our government-opposition relations, and the State Department's report on the situation of human rights and political freedom of the opposition in Albania in 1993. However, the basic arguments in support of this belief were the thaw, after a long winter, in relations between the U.S. Embassy in Tirana and the opposition parties, several meetings between its staffers and PS leaders, and Mr. Ryerson's presence at a news conference on the Nano affair. In fact, it was not the first time that Mr. Ryerson's presence or absence, and a number of other public activities in his capacity as U.S. ambassador, had become the topic of discussion and interpretation, ranging from truth to conjecture, from naivete to presumption. None of the analysts or observers denied that his role in Albanian political developments over the last three years had been obvious, and this had been possible not only because he was the top diplomatic representative of the U.S. superstate, but also because of the intimacy that he created with certain circles. However, when it came to evaluate his influence, assessments varied to the extreme opposites. Though these factors only acted like yeast in giving shape to opinions, today, for certain purposes, they are decisive, reaching even to a point of vesting Mr. Ryerson's personality with powers that nobody could possibly possess alone, even in his important position, for the following reasons: 1. Whatever Mr. Ryerson's origins as a U.S. citizen, U.S. interests are sacred to him, since, as a U.S. Administration employee, he is legally obliged to defend them whereever they exist, and as an official in foreign service, he has the responsibility to maintain the system of meeting these interests when the system is working, or build one and put it into operation wherever it is lacking. After a gap of 45 years, Mr. Ryerson as the number one U.S. diplomat in Tirana, had the task of installing in Albania a system that could enable the implementation of U.S. policy toward or regarding our country. Within this framework, not only did his past undertakings in Albania become clearer, but it can also be explained why, in certain cases, he had to break with the usual conventions of his rank. Today there is no need to speak of U.S. interests in eradicating communism, even in Albania. Nor is it worth repeating our politicians' conclusions, explaining why the PDSH [Democratic Party] was the only Albanian political force that could accomplish such a task. Albeit transcending the limits of his diplomat's status, Mr. Ryerson's busy activities in the run-up to the parliamentary elections of 1992 in actual fact reflected the truth regarding trust toward such political forces that could simultaneously carry out the "eradication of communism," and pave the way for the furthering of U.S. policy in Albania. Thus, Mr. Ryerson "helped the PDSH to conquer Albania," while individuals or groupings within this party guaranteed the implementation of the U.S. strategy in our country. In a nutshell, the extremely natural functioning of the official scheme of Albanian-U.S. relations, to which Mr. Ryerson made his own contribution, is expressed in President Berisha's words: "The United States and the U.S. institutions and Government, directly or through their missions in Tirana, have been very close to us from the very first moments of the democratic movement, and have supported us unequivocally ever since." This is also expressed in the conclusions drawn by foreign analysts and observers, who, apart from branding Berisha's regime as pro-United States, also emphasize Albania's absolute dependence on Washington. Along the same lines is Mr. Ryerson's participation in various rehabilitation ceremonies, particularly in reburials, or in activities to honor former pupils of the Harry Fultz Technical School, and so on. In essence it expresses also the U.S. commitment morally to reward various Albanian citizens not only for their anti-communist activities, but also for the services that they have previously rendered for the United States. In Albanian Canon Law, without referring to history, the roles of Host and Guest are closely related to each other. The guest is greatly honoured and respected; he has pride of place in the house, but the host is responsible for every transgression or harm that the guest might commit while under the host's hospitality. Nevertheless, as masters of Albania until the next elections, the Albanian people have chosen those politicians to whom they gave their votes on 22 March 1992. 2. At a election meeting in March 1992, in the city of Korca, Mr. Ryerson is supposed to have said: "If the PD wins, all the Communists will be out of a job." If his actions and presence were the epicenter of analyses of the U.S. stance toward Albania's political forces, these words were used as a refrain by the majority of those who had certain reservations about Mr. Ryerson. If you analyze the words in detail, you find concentrated in them the dilemma between the man and the official, between duty and reason, and how it was properly solved. It is another thing that the Albanians swallowed this warning message only when the PDSH, after gaining an absolute majority of votes, approved Law 24/1, which sanctioned the newly commenced administrative reform. It is not that "the great U.S. policy has understood its preposterous interference in Albanian politics"; this shuffling of U.S. ambassadors in Albania follows the natural course of U.S. diplomatic procedures. The time that it was announced is yet another argument in favor of the analysts' views. Within the framework of U.S. pragmatism, it shows that the policy is actually at the stage of working out tactics in accordance with the constant strategic purposes. They are enriched with new elements, or new tactics are being prepared to effect the "metamorphosis of Albanian opinion on the United States," and to be adequately prepared for future developments inside or engulfing Albania from without. Every biographical study of the new ambassador to Albania would lead you to these same conclusions. The news about Mr. Lake's appointment, who gained his doctorate at Texas Christian University, reached Albania (a member of the Conference of Islamic Countries, whose Christian population, catholic and orthodox, and their religious institutions enjoy a "special care" evinced by the churches of neighboring countries) at the same time as the U.S. media announced the establishment of the International Protestant Church as the newest international church, based in Tirana. The new ambassador will certainly be welcomed by his fellow countrymen, who for some time have been engaged in activities in Albania as representatives of various religious sects. Who is Mr. Lake? Mr. Lake is a former director of the U.S. State Department's Operations Center, where he worked closely with the White House and other departments in the same year when the collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe was projected and actually took place. He is a highly qualified specialist with a "successful career" and "great experience" in East Asia and the Pacific in general, and on China in particular. Mr. Lake is preparing to take up his position in Tirana at a time when analysts foresee that the left wing is likely to come to power, when they observe that China's interests in Albania have remained constant, and when our present decision-makers have by necessity already understood the philosophical importance of the saying "Make as many new friends as you like, but do not forget the old ones!" and are, albeit with certain reluctance, trying to act accordingly. The former Number Two of the U.S. Embassy in Sofia is waiting for the Senate's approval to take up his new post in Albania, where, according to observers and politicians, a "Bulgarian scenario" is being implemented. At the same time analysts insist that the "Albania-Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]-Bulgaria corridor," as a "programmed policy," is part and parcel of the U.S. strategy in the Balkans. While waiting to settle himself on the western edge of this segment, Mr. Lake is learning Albanian, as he learned Chinese and Bulgarian. Ambassadors come and go. Although acclaimed as the mastermind of their respective embassies, they are nothing more than tiny particles in the huge mechanism that sets in motion the open policies worked out in state chancelleries. It is the Albanians themselves who have made Albania in the past and will make it in the future. With the help also of the United States, Europe and.... Enough of "enemies from East to West," but not to the point of, say, turning your back on Europe for the sake of the United States, or flying off toward the Islamic region, or overturning obsolete chests to obtain outdated schemes of ethnic-religious rows with neighbors, or brushing aside China.... In Western policy, the principle of "more relations, fewer problems" has gained the status of an axiom, and therefore Albania will survive only by giving everyone his due place. Ambassadors come and go, and even if they speak Albanian, it is not their mother-tongue. A happy old age and retirement, Mr. Ryerson! Welcome Mr. Lake! [previous sentence in English]
