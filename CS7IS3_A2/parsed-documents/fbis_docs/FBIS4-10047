Well, as part of Giron-94 in the city of Havana, NTV carried an illustrative report on this matter of confronting crime in the city of Havana. Let's listen to that report: [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] There were 40 sacks containing a detergent the nation has earmarked for recovering hard currency [para la recuperacion de divisas]; hard currency that becomes raw materials for producing cleaning products very necessary for society's consumption. Thus, this was a theft that conspired against the citizenry's basic solutions, and one by means of which seven individuals would enrich themselves, had they managed to get the 500 kg of detergent into the underground market. But the police stopped them and returned the 40 sacks that exited through the factory doors without any documentation to the (Sergio Sierra Cabrera) Factory, formerly known as the (Sabatez) Factory. The accused, Esteban Rodriguez Talaveras, Victor Manuel Valdez Gonzalez, Armando Luis Ploche Torres, and Angel Llane Mendez, took advantage of negligence in the production area to move the merchandise, which they left hidden in the stockroom until it was put into a closed vehicle, which exited the plant through the gate, without being searched by the guards. [passage omitted] It was the job of Jose Dabian Ramos, Edilberto Rodriguez Bote, and Lazaro Ruiz Cutino to sell the product on the underground market. The police seized the merchandise from them at a private residence in Cerro Municipality. The matter does not appear to be over, for surely the enterprise (Suchel) [name as heard] has a control system that should prevent anyone from diverting resources. For that reason, the investigation continues. [end recording]
