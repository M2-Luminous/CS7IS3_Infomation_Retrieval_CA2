FR940630-2-00045 FR940630-2-00039 Common Carrier Regulatory Fees June 20, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the payment of regulatory fees in 1994. If you hold authorizations in any of the common carrier services, excluding space stations and earth stations, you should carefully review this Public Notice. A separate Public Notice for space station and earth station licensees is available. Who Must Pay Regulatory Fees in 1994 Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in 1994. This Public Notice concerns only the following Common Carrier regulatees: interexchange carriers, local exchange carriers, competitive access providers, cellular and public mobile (part 22) licensees, domestic public fixed radio (part 21) licensees, international public fixed radio (part 23) licensees and providers of international bearer circuits. Why the Commission Must Collect New Fees The new requirement to collect annual regulatory fees was contained in Public Law 103&hyph;66, ``The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.'' These new regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, will be used to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public service, international and policy and rulemaking activities. The new fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or other authorization from the Commission. When Fees Will Be Due Fee payment due dates vary by category within the common carrier services. Payments must be received by the Commission by the dates shown below in order to avoid a 25% late penalty. When paying for fees in more than one category below, the consolidated fee payment is due on the latest date the individual fee payment would be due.
