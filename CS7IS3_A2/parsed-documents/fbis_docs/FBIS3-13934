The most notable theory to describe this change was that of U.S. thinker [Francis] Fukuyama, who said that "the world is witnessing the end of history through the triumph of Western liberal capitalism and its social, intellectual, and political values and the collapse of communist and Muslim ideologies." Your eminence, after the collapse of the USSR some people said it was the end of history. How do you assess such international theories? Where does Islam stand on this? Where do the Islamic movements stand? [Nasrallah] He who proposes the theory that we are approaching the end of history and considers the failure of the communist experiment in the USSR a victory for liberalism and capitalism is free to do so from his own perspective. However, when we assess these developments objectively, or at least from our own perspective, we reach a different conclusion. We agree with this theory as far as it means an end of history in one particular aspect. We disagree on the rest. If there were only two ideologies in the world, leaving no room for a third ideology, we might regard the collapse of one as a victory for the other. However, in the presence of other international ideologies professing to be able to build a civilization, the failure of the USSR's communist experiment does not necessarily signify a triumph of capitalist philosophy. The Islamists also consider, from their perspective, that the Soviet failure is a triumph for Islam and Islamic ideology. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] You have pointed out that the USSR's collapse was a common victory for Islam and capitalism, if one may so describe it. Nevertheless, what distinguishes Western society is the issue of liberties and human rights. A major erroneous belief to which some people adhere is that the Islamists fail the liberty test. It is said that the Islamists, unlike Westerners, oppress others. The Salman Rushdie issue and the killing in Algeria are seen as major difficulties for Islamists in connection with liberties. What is your opinion? [Nasrallah] To give a relativist answer to this question, we must divide it into two parts. The first deals with the West's presumed military power and strong position on human rights, liberties, and similar matters. The second part is connected with the Western accusation that the Islamists will abolish liberties and leave no room for an alternative opinions if they come to power. Regarding the first part of the question, I certainly do not acknowledge that the West is strong on the human rights issue. When it speaks of human rights, it is referring more to slogans than to facts. Liberties have no intrinsic value to the West but are merely slogans and arguments exploited for the furtherance of the Western countries' major interests. To use an example, the West is rallying behind Salman Rushdie under the slogan of human rights but at the same time is willing to slaughter an entire nation if it stands up and demands self-determination, which is, after all, a very basic human right. [passage omitted] Let us move to the second part of the question: Western power today is not intellectual but political, military, and economic power. Even this power is now buffeted by crises. Theoretically, any Islamist can simply stand up and declare that Islam is the religion of liberties, that it allows freedom of worship, and that it opposes compulsion in religion. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Do you think other governments in the Arab and Islamic world will deal with the Islamists in the way the governments of Egypt and Algeria are now dealing with their Islamists? Will our turn come in Lebanon? Should we draw a conclusion from the Airport Bridge massacre [reference to Lebanese Army's shooting of several Hizballah demonstrators on 13 September 1993]? What is your opinion? Will the Islamists, in case they come to power, allow any other group to try to change Islamic rule by democratic means, or are we going to then say: This is God's government and none may go against it? [Nasrallah] The prevailing phenomenon in the Islamic world today is the suppression of Islamists. Egypt and Algeria are constantly in the news because the authorities there have failed to destroy the Islamic movement. Very ugly repression is occurring in other Islamic countries as well. In some of them, such as Tunisia and Iraq, the Islamists are oppressed almost to an unimaginable degree. Merely belonging to a certain party in those countries is enough to earn one the death penalty. In the Arab Maghreb the Islamists are brutally suppressed. In some countries the Islamists have remained steadfast, in others they have weakened. In what direction will we move in Lebanon? We cannot give definite answers. Of course, the United States does not want to suppress all voices in Lebanon; it wants all pro-Israeli and pro-U.S. voices to be strengthened and given all kinds of freedom. It seeks to deny Lebanon's option to be a part of this nation. [passage omitted] Are we about to face suppression? Judging by the rulers' mentality, I say yes; but taking into account the Lebanese people's demographic makeup and enlightenment, I say it will not be easy for the rulers to do this. [Correspondent] Will the Islamists allow, in a Western-like democratic spirit, their opponents to try to bring down an Islamic government in a democratic election? Will the Islamists accept this? [Nasrallah] If some forces can persuade a nation that an Islamic government is not worthwhile, then I do not believe that such a government can stay in power. A minority cannot impose an Islamic government on the majority. This is corroborated by historical events, except in those cases when the opposition to Islamic governments was corrupt and bolstered by force of arms. You spoke about your theory that Islamic thought might triumph in fact and theory at the end of history. Alternatively, we can see that many Islamic governments rose and fell throughout history, meaning that they were not the ultimate theoretical and practical solution for those societies. In the past, circumstances were different; even the Islamic governments that were established did not attain the level that we judge to be the proper level of Islamic rule. To use a specific example: When 'Ali [Bin-Abu-Talib, the fourth caliph] was martyred and a peace treaty was concluded between his son Hasan and Mu'awiyah [Bin-Abu-Sufayn, the fifth caliph and first Umayyad ruler], government in the Islamic lands was transformed into an autocratic, hereditary, and tribal rule. Islam was not part of that government. We do not allow anyone to judge Islam by the example of the Umayyads, the Abbasids, and all those who came after them. We cannot regard them as examples of Islamic government. In the troubled past, weak governments arose. Today there is an Islamic state with a great government. It is the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was not established by a triumphant family or tribe but by a nation of 40 million. They are 60 million now. This is an Islamic state that can serve as a foundation and pillar of world Islamism. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Perhaps a major cause of our society's backwardness and weakness lies in the socioeconomic factor. This problem persists, although Islamic writers have for dozens of years been writing books and delivering lectures on the applicability of Islam as a solution to this problem, particularly as Islam is concerned with social matters. When faced with realities, some Islamic movements have failed to offer economic and social remedies. Despite the reassurances we hear about the situation in Iran, countries established on Islamic lines have not succeeded in extracting themselves from the turmoil of the international economy. Iran is not sure whether to adopt a centralized or a market economy and is directly or indirectly subject to the dictates of the international market. It faces numerous economic problems and deals with usurer banks. Where are the Islamic economic projects that can deal with these problems? How can these problems be solved? [Nasrallah] We must give the Islamic experiment a chance to prove itself before we judge. So far it has not had such a chance. Sudan has been subjected to attrition in the south since Islamic rule was established there. Furthermore, the Islamic movement inherited a very poor Sudan that continues to face embargoes and constant pressures. Therefore, we cannot say that its economic experiment has failed because it has not yet had an economic experiment. The Sudanese people are still trying to catch their breath and assert themselves despite the crises that are constantly created for them. As to the Islamic Republic of Iran, a new well-planned policy was pursued after the eight-year war. During the war years, the Iranian economy basically sought to prevent the country's collapse and for this reason it was geared to development, services, and consumption. Some development projects were specifically established to offer quick services to the people to enable them to face the war conditions. After the war ended, the Iranian Government had an important chance to install a new economic experiment. [passage omitted] Islam outlines general economic principles and guidelines, leaving specific programs and detailed plans for the nation's leadership. The Islamic government in Iran faithfully adheres to these principles and is looking for the proper plan to establish a vibrant economy, drawing on the lessons it learned from the country's problems and taking possible future dangers into account. It is seeking a strong economy that will fulfill the standards of social justice, liberty, and property. In this context, it had a first five-year plan and a second five-year plan. The latter is now bearing fruit. [passage omitted]
