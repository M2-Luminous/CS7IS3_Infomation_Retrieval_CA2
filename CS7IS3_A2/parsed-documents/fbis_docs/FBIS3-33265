During the ceremony to transfer the EPS installations located at kilometer marker 20 of the road to Masaya to the Environment and Natural Resources Ministry, EPS Chief Gen. Humberto Ortega said yesterday that the Military High Command is not planning to reestablish the SMP in the country. Here is what Gen. Ortega said: [Begin Ortega recording] It is not enough to disarm. An effective program is necessary to permit the disarmed individuals to earn a livelihood and gradually rejoin the country's life through employment in order to increase their standard of living and live decently. Disarmament is not enough for peace to exist. We must all work to overcome the high levels of inequality and poverty and to prevent the concentration of capital in the hands of a few people because that will always create a big gap between the few who have everything and the many who have nothing. Those are the real roots of violence that might come in the future. [end recording]
