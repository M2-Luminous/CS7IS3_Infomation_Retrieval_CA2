The MP's voted for 100,167 million leva in revenues, 133,836.6 million leva in expenditures, and a deficit amounting to 33,699.6 million leva. Revenues are up some 30 million leva, expenditures nearly 35 million leva and the deficit 6 million leva from last year. To pass the budget by the end of February, the MP's worked through the week-end and held a 12-hour extraordinary sitting today. They voted to raise the revenue figure to 100,167 million leva, up 280 million leva from the cabinet-sponsored one. The margin will be covered by revenues from special extrabudgetary accounts. The expenditure figure has been raised to 133,836.6 million leva, up 300 million leva from the first reading. More money will be allocated to research institutions, the Bulgarian State Railways (the national railway carrier), to extrabudgetary funds, etc., yet most figures were not changed. A total of 18,859.1 million leva have been voted for defence and security. Some 6,350 million leva have been budgeted to subsidize money-losing producers, the import of coal for domestic users, etc. The legislators voted for a social security budget of 58,151.7 million leva, including 52,804 million leva from social security tax and a government transfer of 5,347.4 million leva. The increase from last year amounts to some 20 million leva. Government departments get 42,411.9 million leva. Parliament, the President's Office and the cabinet will take cuts of 35 million leva, 5 million leva and 15 million leva from the original draft figures. 40 million leva of that money will be reoriented to health, 10 million leva to the Unions of War Veterans and the Blind, and 5 million leva to the Agency for Bulgarians Abroad. The Defence Ministry budget is set at 11,600 million leva, the Interior Ministry budget at 5,600 million leva and the National Intelligence Service budget at 131.6 million. A total of 3,900 million leva is allocated for the needs of health care and another 7,500 million for education. The subsidies to be extended to the municipalities amount to 18,243,596,000 leva. The report on the utilization of the 1992 national budget, which figured in the bill, was not put to the vote after the MP's backed Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's proposal to exclude it from the debates. "This is the most constricted budget for the past four years and it will have a lot of adverse effects," Parliamentary Budget Committee Chairman Ventsislav Dimitrov said on the behalf of the Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) parliamentary group. He stressed the disparity between the SDS stand on the state financial policy and the views of the parliamentary majority on this matter. According to MP's of the SDS, the unfeasible macro-economic framework is most likely to fail the budget within mid-1994. The SDS cannot assume the political responsibility for the budget, Mr. Dimitrov also said. Speaking on the behalf of his parliamentary group, Mr. Nikolay Koychev MP of the Bulgarian Socialist Party hailed the passage of the 1994 national budget in the last day of February. Last year it (the budget) was passed in June, Mr. Koychev recalled. According to the BSP parliamentary group, this is the only budget this country could have. The MP's of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) and the New Union for Democracy (NSD), too, backed most of the texts in the 1994 national budget bill. The NSD, however, denounced the procedure on the passage of the budget and said it should come only after a wholesale national policy on the economic reforms has been considered. "I hope that the Cabinet will disprove the pessimistic predictions about the 1994 budget," Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov said after the passage of the 1994 budget bill.
