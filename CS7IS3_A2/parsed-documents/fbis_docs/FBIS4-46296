On Monday, the Chechen Foreign Ministry circulated a statement which lays the blame for such a policy on the Russian authorities. The attempt on the life of President Dudayev on May 27 was merely the latest terrorist act carried out by the Russian special services over the three years since the Chechen state came into existence, says the statement. [passage omitted] "Under the cover of democratic rhetoric, the Russian leadership is undermining the sovereignty of Chechnya," says this document. "All this is taking place amid reports about forthcoming talks between Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev, although the Chechen leaders have not received any official proposals," says the statement. The Chechen authorities believe that the actual plans of the Russian leaders boil down to "backstage contacts between Russia's high-ranking officials and dubious figures, who have compromised themselves by anti-democratic actions in the Chechen Republic," says the document.
