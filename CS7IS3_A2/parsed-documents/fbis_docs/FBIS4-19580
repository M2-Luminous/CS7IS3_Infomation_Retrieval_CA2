Everything suggests that they will stay there permanently." This has been claimed by the European spokesman of the Kurdistan National Liberation Front (ERNK), Kani Yilmaz, in an interview with DIE PRESSE. Yilmaz is currently in Vienna to hold talks with Social Democratic politicians. The ERNK is a political umbrella organization of the radical Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). Yilmaz repeated the offer submitted by PKK leader Ocalan to the government in Ankara to end the fighting and seek a political solution. "We do not want any more bloodshed. We want a public discussion of the rights of the Kurds in Turkey." The Turkish Government has not yet replied. "It continues to pursue the old policy aimed at ignoring our existence." Asked about earlier demands for an independent state, Yilmaz stated that the Kurds do not insist on a separatist solution by all means. "It would also be possible for us to achieve freedom within the existing borders." Referring to the attacks on tourist centers, Yilmaz pointed out: "Tourism is a source of foreign exchange for the military. We call on the tourist not to support this policy with their trips." These attacks are being carried out by individual persons, by supporters, Yilmaz claimed.
