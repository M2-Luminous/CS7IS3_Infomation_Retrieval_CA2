The fate of the mass execution grounds in Uzdol, Maljin, Doljani, Trusina, Grabovica, and Mostar has befallen the village of Krizancevo near Vitez. According to well-informed sources close to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], 50 of the 53 Croats abducted by Muslim fundamentalists in Krizancevo last week were brutally murdered while three are prisoners in a Zenica jail. A mass grave containing the remains of 35 massacred Croats has been found in Preocica while another one located in no-man's-land between the Muslim forces and Croatian Defense Council units contains the bodies of another 15, the statement says. The Muslim Army is still refusing to allow international organizations and UNPROFOR access to the area between Krizancevo and positions held by the 3d Corps of the Muslim Army, where the Muslims had carried out the massacre. The liaison officer of UNPROFOR's British battalion today informed the command of the Vitez operational zone that the spokesman for the Muslim Army's 3d Corps had declared that some 15 bodies of Krizancevo villagers could be found near the separation line and that another 35 were buried in a mass grave near the Muslim village of Preocica between Vitez and Zenica. The liaison officer failed to disclose any details about the crime but added that the head of the European observers and representatives of the International Red Cross were still trying to obtain the 3d Corps' permission to carry out an on-the-spot investigation.
