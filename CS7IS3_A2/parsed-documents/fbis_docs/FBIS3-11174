Fathers and bishops, even some of those identified as belonging to the progressive wing, with ties to the PT, denounced the platform's points involving abortion, contraception, and homosexual relations. Juazeiro da Bahia Bishop Jose Rodrigues, a representative of the progressive wing that openly supported PT candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during past presidential elections, condemned the platform. He believes the two issues will cause a great "deterioration" in Lula's candidacy. The bishop noted: "The PT wanted to be responsive to these minority groups, but ended up alienating the majority." He added: "The people, in general, do not approve of these proposals." The PT is not actually proposing the regularization of abortion or of marriage between homosexuals. The platform merely proposes "the establishment of regulations for the performance of abortion under safe conditions, through the public services." Concerning unions between homosexuals, the PT wants "proposals for legal changes guaranteeing the rights of married homosexual couples concerning civil marriage contracts, social security, partition of goods, and inheritance."
