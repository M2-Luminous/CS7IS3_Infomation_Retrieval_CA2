It added that a changed Labour Party deserved to be taken seriously. The economy is moving into a "new era" in which the main priorities are to "structure and shape the recovery," said Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general. He said business must also adapt to the changing political scene, fundamental shifts in Labour policy and the impending emergence of a new Labour leader. The director-general spoke against the background of a reassuring assessment of key economic trends from the CBI's quarterly distributive trades survey. The survey, published yesterday, showed the rate of sales growth in UK shops slowed slightly in May, yet remained ahead year on year. Subdued activity in the high street continued to disappoint retailers who have been seeking a strong upsurge for four years, but have yet to see their expectations fulfilled. Activity in the wholesaling sector remains brisker, but Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said there was no sign that stocks were being built up in expectation of a surge in high street spending. Rather, retailers most vigorous customers appeared to be industrial concerns. Sales on garage forecourts, meantime, were weaker than expected. Mr Whittaker said: "Overall, sales for the time of year remain average, although there has been little change since the start of the year." He said that tax rises which took effect in April, "do not appear to have had any real impact on high street recovery." Mr Davies, speaking to the British Printing Industries Federation, said it was now accepted that the UK was out of recession, but in advance of official earnings increase figures, to be published by the Government today, he stressed again the danger to the recovery from wage inflation. At the same time, Mr Davies insisted business must recognise a changed Labour Party under a new leader. While the CBI's statement is far short of any endorsement for Tony Blair, it is significant both in terms of business attitudes and the ability of the frontrunner for the party leadership to appeal successfully to areas beyond the Labour Party. Mr Davies said it was likely that business would be facing a Labour party unemcumbered by baggage from its periods in government and with a set of economic policies very different from those of the past. He said there were aspects of the new Labour programme business did not like, including its support for the social chapter, the minimum wage and legislation on company board structures. In spite of these, he said: "It would be churlish not to recognise the Labour Party has changed in important ways, and is offering a set of policies which at the very least deserve our attention."
