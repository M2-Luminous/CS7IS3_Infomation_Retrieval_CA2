FR940921-0-00102 FR940921-0-00016 52. Section 86.127&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), (b), (d) introductory text, (d)(2) and (e), to read as follows: ยง86.127&hyph;96 Test procedures; overview. * * * * * (a) * * * (1) Gaseous exhaust THC, CO, NO X , CO 2 (for petroleum-fueled and gaseous-fueled vehicles), plus CH 3 OH and HCHO for methanol-fueled vehicles, plus CH 4 (for vehicles subject to the NMHC and OMNMHCE standards). * * * * * (3) Evaporative HC (for gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled vehicles) and CH 3 OH (for methanol-fueled vehicles). The evaporative testing portion of the procedure occurs after the exhaust emission test; however, exhaust emissions need not be sampled to complete a test for evaporative emissions. (4) Fuel spitback (this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles). (b) The Otto-cycle exhaust emission test is designed to determine gaseous THC, CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , NO X , and particulate mass emissions from gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles as well as methanol and formaldehyde from methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, while simulating an average trip in an urban area of 11 miles (18 kilometers). The test consists of engine start-ups and vehicle operation on a chassis dynamometer through a specified driving schedule. A proportional part of the diluted exhaust is collected continuously for subsequent analysis, using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi sampler. * * * * * (d) The evaporative emission test (gasoline-fueled vehicles, methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled vehicles) is designed to determine hydrocarbon and methanol evaporative emissions as a consequence of diurnal temperature fluctuation, urban driving and hot soaks following drives. It is associated with a series of events that a vehicle may experience and that may result in hydrocarbon and/or methanol vapor losses. The test procedure is designed to measure: * * * * * (2) Running losses resulting from a simulated trip performed on a chassis dynamometer, measured by the enclosure or point-source technique (see ยง86.134; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles); and * * * * * (e) Fuel spitback emissions occur when a vehicle's fuel fill neck cannot accommodate dispensing rates. The vehicle test for spitback consists of a short drive followed immediately by a complete refueling event. This test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. * * * * * 53. Section 86.130&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b), to read as follows: ยง86.130&hyph;96 Test sequence; general requirements. (a) (1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. The test sequence shown in figure B96&hyph;10 shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the standards set forth. The full three- diurnal sequence depicted in figure B96&hyph;10 tests vehicles for all sources of evaporative emissions. The supplemental two-diurnal test sequence is designed to verify that vehicles sufficiently purge their evaporative canisters during the exhaust emission test. Sections 86.132&hyph;96, 86.133&hyph;96 and 86.138&hyph;96 describe the separate specifications of the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence. (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. The test sequence shown in figure B96&hyph;10 shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the standards set forth, with the exception that the fuel drain and fill and precondition canister steps are not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. In addition, the supplemental two-diurnal test and the running loss test are not required. (b) The vehicle test for fuel spitback during fuel dispensing is conducted as a stand-alone test (see ยง86.146). This test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. * * * * *
