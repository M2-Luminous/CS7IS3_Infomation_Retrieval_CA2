A well-known American reporter revealed that this was a question he wanted to put to U.S. President Bill Clinton if the opportunity arose. It is a good question and one directly linked with the truly sensational agreement which, contrary to expectations, Moscow, Kiev, and Washington have managed to acheive, proposing to turn Ukraine into a nuclear-free zone. The reporter did not particularly philosophize about his question. The terms of the agreement -- even now that its text has been published -- clearly leave a lot unrevealed: Some aspects will need detailed explanation, and it is not ruled out that modifications will be required "in the course of business" [v rabochem poryadke]. It is becoming clear from the discussions with the Americans who accompanied the President that Washington was just as hasty a partner in this deal as Kiev -- although for entirely different reasons. It was Washington, insofar as we understand it, which insisted that the Russian and Ukrainian delegations conducting the talks in the U.S. capital postpone their return home 5 January in order to use the time to intensify the search for a solution to outstanding problems. The delegations tarried, but when Clinton left Washington for Europe on Saturday 8 January he still had no confidence that the deal would go ahead, although he had been told that there had been "a certain amount of progress." The deal was struck on Monday, 10 January -- that was when the U.S. ambassador in Moscow and the leader of the U.S. ambassadorial mission in Kiev informed the State Department and the Clinton team touring Europe that Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk had initialed the agreement reached by their delegations. Why was Clinton in a hurry? Among the explanations we have heard the most rational is the simplest -- over the past few months the problem of preventing nuclear arms proliferation has been top of his personal agenda and personal list of priorities. The U.S. President saw Ukrainian nuclear disarmament as his most realistic chance to take the first and most most substantive step in this direction. If such an agreement were reached it would, moreover, be another foreign policy triumph for Clinton -- the second following the reconciliation between Israel and the PLO. Such a triumph would not be out of place for the President at a time when he faces growing scandals at home -- scandals which many are already comparing to Nixon's Watergate. Achieving this goal on his personal agenda was made considerably easier for Clinton by the fact that, Ukraine, as one of my interlocutors put it, was by then "pretty much ready -- it had virtually doomed itself to isolation in the international arena, as demonstrated by Clinton's refusal, widely trumped by the Washington White House, to visit Ukraine during his tour of the former Union, and to restrict himself to Moscow and -- a particular blow to the Ukrainians -- to Minsk." Kiev clearly understood that going further down the road which Ukraine had followed since essentially refusing to ratify START I would mean depriving the country of Western aid. The agreement to get things moving opened up some nice prospects for Kiev -- in the form of an extension of aid not so much through bilateral channels as through the channels of international organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Moreover, Washington could not fail to notice the personal ambitions of Kravchuk, who has an undoubted interest in gaining genuine recognition from the international community and achieving the standing of a statesmen with whom you can "do business." One other point -- the Ukrainian lobby, which is very strong in those states of America which play a key role in the presidential election, was exerting very great pressure on the Washington White House to ensure that Ukraine was properly treated and certainly not dealt with on a lower footing than America's relationship with Belarus. That was the backdrop against which the search for a compromise was accelerated. Very substantial people were involved on the American side -- the man in charge was Strobe Talbott, number two at the State Department; the team also included Lynn Davis, another under secretary of state, and Nick Burns, a leading specialist on the former Union at the National Security Council. Tactically, the U.S. delegation's job, which met with understanding from the Russian delegation, was based on creating additional incentives for Ukraine in the shape of firm guarantees of economic and financial aid and help in contacts with international departments where the United States traditionally wields great influence. A key factor was, as sources put it, Washington's readiness to respond appropriately to Kiev's longstanding concern that, in giving up its nuclear weapons, it would be exposed to the threat of a strike, say, from the East, from Russia. Formerly Washington had avoided any pledges on this score, apart from quite simply referring to the fact that Ukraine's accession to the nonproliferation regime would automatically give it the guarantees it wanted. Kiev was not satisfied with this and insisted on more. The proposal to join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program will, as Washington explained to Kiev, satisfy its longstanding wishes and demands. Admittedly, there immediately arises the question about a hypothetical war over the Crimea which the American reporter would have liked to have asked the American President. But, alas, there are plenty of other questions too.
