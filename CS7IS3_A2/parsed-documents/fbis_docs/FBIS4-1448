He added that the situation on the ground would nevertheless be watched closely and that the decision would be continually re- evaluated. "On the basis of the situation on the ground we have no reason to think that voting will continue tomorrow," he said. He had been informed on Thursday morning that the IEC was satisfied with the progress of the poll -- and that the extension of voting days was not considered necessary. When pressed on the possibility of an extension, he replied that as matters stood at present, he foresaw no such possibility.
