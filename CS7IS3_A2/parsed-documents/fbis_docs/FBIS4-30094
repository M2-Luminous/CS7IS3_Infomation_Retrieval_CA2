Recalling that U.S. Forces are planning to stage a joint commanding exercise with the "Self-Defence" Airforce of Japan at the airforce base in Florida, the analyst says: All the military moves are grave acts of carrying the situation of the Northeast Asian region including the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain. The analyst notes: It must not go unnoticed that the military collusion between Japan and the United States is being tightened when the United States and its followers are intensifying as never before their hostile moves to stifle the DPRK over its "nuclear issue". The United States is advertising that the survey and selection of the bases of the Japanese "Self-Defence Forces" were "merely selection of shelters." But, in actuality, it is related to the preparations for a new war in Korea. As everyone knows, the United States is massing its forces around the Korean peninsula, and Japan is frequently staging joint military exercises with the United States. These are very dangerous acts driving the situation in the Northeast Asian region to the brink of war. The Korean people and other Northeast Asian peoples will not remain an onlooker to the acts of the United States and Japan aggravating the situation in this region. The U.S. and Japanese authorities must renounce their military collusion and wild ambition for domination of Asia, as demanded by the Asian people.
