Kozyrev is expected to help promote the existing Sino-Russian relations, said Igor A. Rogachev, Russian ambassador to China, here this afternoon. Rogachev, in an interview with XINHUA, said that Kozyrev's China tour, which will take place from January 26 to 29, is the first visit made by the Russian foreign minister outside the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) after the re-shuffle of the Russian Government. He revealed that Kozyrev and the Chinese side will discuss bilateral relations. Meanwhile, he said, the two sides will also confer on regional and international issues of mutual concern as well as briefing each other on the respective domestic situations. Facts over the past years show that the two countries can conduct very good cooperation in many major international issues, he recalled. The ambassador noted that both countries are carrying out reforms. And the Russian foreign minister will travel to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in south China's Guangdong Province during his stay in China. He went on to say that Russian-Chinese relations in all fields have enjoyed smooth development since Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited China in December 1992. In the economic and trade field, he said, the total trade volume of the two countries last year hit 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 30 percent over 1992. About 80 percent of the trade were conducted through over 20 ports along the Sino-Russian border, and the two governments would sign an agreement concerning ports during Kozyrev's trip to China, he said. Moreover, the two countries also have conducted good cooperation in science and technology, the ambassador noted.
