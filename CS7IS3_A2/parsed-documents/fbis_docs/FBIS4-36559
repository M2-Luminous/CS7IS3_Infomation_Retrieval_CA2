Abu-Salih, who is heading his country's delegation to the OAU Foreign Ministers Council meetings in Tunis, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that, "no matter how we describe the phase Sudanese-Egyptian relations are experiencing, we in Sudan believe that we must overcome minor things and move toward the major and sublime aim of restoring relations between the two countries to their normal course in the interests of the two peoples who have existed in the Nile Valley for thousands of years." Dr. Abu-Salih attributed the strain in relations between Sudan and Egypt to "the lack of mutual trust between the Sudanese and Egyptian sides. Thus we must work sincerely to restore trust between the two sides." The Sudanese foreign minister stressed that "a serious bilateral dialogue is the only way to build strong and sound relations between Egypt and Sudan." He said optimistically and confidently that, "whatever the problems, we are confident that we will work to restore our relations to their normal status in which the Sudanese and Egyptian people see their common destiny." Asked about his country's support for extremist movements, the main cause of the strain in relations between Sudan and the countries suffering as a result of this phenomenon, Abu-Salih said, "We are against religious, and even nonreligious, extremism. We advocate moderation and believe that many of the accusations leveled at Sudan in this connection are absolutely baseless." He added that his country "is seeking to lay the foundations for serious action among all the Arab states in order to move toward solidarity and to secure all the factors that serve the security and stability of all the peoples of the Arab and African regions."
