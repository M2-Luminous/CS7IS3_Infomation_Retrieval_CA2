Details are in the following report by our political affairs correspondent: The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee this evening concluded its second round of talks at the Foreign Ministry. In statements to reporters, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, said: [Begin recording] [al-'Anani] In fact, our talks were very serious and candid. The issues were discussed in detail in order to arrive at tangible, practical, and implementable steps that people can feel. Therefore, at this stage, we will meet again tomorrow morning and perhaps tomorrow afternoon and even on Friday morning so that we can arrive at decisive results, because this is the purpose of these talks at this level. We are also taking into consideration that people are awaiting tangible results, which require very serious and clear talks that define the frameworks and practical steps. We both agreed that if we do not arrive at such results, then we will not have met the people's expectations. [Reporter] So, Mr. Abu-Ahmad [al-'Anani], are there any pending issues between the two sides? [Al-'Anani] We are discussing all issues that are of importance to both sides, especially at this stage. [Reporter] Did the discussions focus on specific issues? [Al-'Anani] Of course, we discussed many basic issues, including economic and banking issues, issues that deal with the negotiations on water, evacuees, and refugees, the Jerusalem issue, as well as the need to coordinate stands on these issues and others that deal with the transitional phase and what is currently being negotiated in this regard to serve the two parties' interests. We, of course, have joint interests and what harms the Palestinians harms us and what benefits our brothers and kinfolk in the West Bank and Gaza Strip benefits us here in Jordan. [end recording]
