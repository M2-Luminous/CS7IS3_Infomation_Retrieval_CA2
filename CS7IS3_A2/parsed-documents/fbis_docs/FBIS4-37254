In statements he made to the MENA correspondent in Damascus, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad stressed that his supporters are the victims of this bloody conflict between the sons of the Yemeni people. He said that he is very pained by the reports by press agencies and international and humanitarian organizations on the tragic situation in Aden. President 'Ali Nasir was commenting on a recent newspaper report that former leaders from South Yemen are involved in the fighting against the YSP so as to rehabiliate themselves and avenge the incidents of January 1986 that led to his ousting from his position. The former south Yemeni president held some parties in the Yemeni leadership, which he did not name, responsible for the political and military conflict in Yemen. He stressed that there must be a return to dialogue and a cease-fire, that the Yemeni leaders have to abide by the spirit of the Pledge and Accord Document, and that they have to deal flexibly and realistically with the UN envoy's endeavors. He reiterated that he will not assume any responsibility in Yemen while there is fighting or secession, adding that the problem is a political one, not a military one.
