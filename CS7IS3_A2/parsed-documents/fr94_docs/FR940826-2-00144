FR940826-2-00144 FR940826-2-00073 [Release No. 34&hyph;34562; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;39] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to a Security Application Fee for The PORTAL Market August 19, 1994. I. Introduction On June 22, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (``NASD'' or ``Association''), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``ACT'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend The PORTAL Market Rules, Schedule I to the NASD By-Laws (``PORTAL Rules''), to add a security application fee with respect to securities submitted for designation in The PORTAL Market. 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34297 (July 1, 1994), 59 FR 35398 (July 11, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. II. Description of the Proposal The present proposal amends the NASD's PORTAL Rules to add a security application fee that would be charged to PORTAL participants who apply to the NASD so that, when appropriate, a security may be designated in The PORTAL Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., operates The PORTAL Market for the quotation of securities that are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), or are securities that are treated as if restricted. 3 In order to qualify for inclusion in The PORTAL Market, a security that is restricted or treated as if restricted must be eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, 4 be in negotiable form, and be assigned a CUSIP or other security identification number that is different from any identification number assigned to any unrestricted securities of the same class. Designation of a security as a PORTAL security permits the security to be assigned a CUSIP number by Standard & Poor's Corporation and be cleared and settled through the Depository Trust Company. 3 Part II, PORTAL Rules, provides that to qualify for initial designation and continued designation in the PORTAL Market, a security shall be either a restricted security, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, or a security that upon issuance and continually thereafter only can be sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, Rule 144A, or Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or sold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4 and not involving any public offering. 4 This provision requires that the security meet the ``fungibility'' and ``information delivery requirements'' of Rule 144A(d) (3) and (4) under the Securities Act. Pursuant to section 2 of the PORTAL Rules, any PORTAL participant may submit an application for security designation. ``PORTAL participants'' include PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL investors. The first two categories of PORTAL participants are required to be brokers and dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15 of the Exchange Act and members of the NASD. The third category of PORTAL participants are institutional investors that are not members of the NASD that meet the definition of ``qualified institutional buyer'' under Rule 144A. The PORTAL Market has processed over one thousand applications for designation as a PORTAL security. The NASD has operated The PORTAL Market since its initiation June 1990 without the imposition of any fees on users. Under the present proposal, the NASD will adopt a filing fee of $2,000 per security application submitted plus $200 for each security identification symbol assigned after the first symbol. The fee for each security identification symbol is being established because many private offerings involve securities that are sold in multiple tranches, each of which is treated as a separate security that is assigned a separate identification symbol, even though they are part of a single private offering. The NASD believes the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee will assist The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. to cover continuing costs associated with the operation of The PORTAL Market, including significant costs associated with the processing of security applications. The processing of security applications for The PORTAL Market requires an immediate review of all applications, as private placements are usually on a very short time schedule. Such review must ensure that the security meets all of the requirements in Part II of The PORTAL Rules, as discussed above. Given the efforts required by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff, the NASD believes that the fees as proposed are appropriate. III. Commission's Findings The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, 5 which requires that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the Association operates or controls. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change equitably applies a filing fee to all applications submitted by PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL qualified investors for the designation of securities in The PORTAL Market. The Commission believes the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee is reasonable in that it should assist The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., in covering continuing costs associated with the operation of The PORTAL Market, including significant costs associated with the processing of security applications for the The PORTAL Market. 5 15 U.S.C. ยง78 o &hyph;3 (1988). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 6 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;39) is approved. 6 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
