However, despite the Wall, the Cold War, and the bipolar world I realized even at that time that Germany was a country with industrious people who work hard, and would, therefore, emerge as an important factor in the world at some time. I see that this is happening now. I have come to Germany to discuss the international situation with the chancellor, with a particular focus on Kashmir and Bosnia. In addition, I talked with him about closer cooperation in the field of industrialization. I explained the overall situation to him, because Pakistan has an agreement with the IMF and the World Bank and has now embarked upon a solid economic path. In this connection, I expressed my interest in Hermes guarantees to the chancellor. You see, German companies have invested so much in Russia -- without success. Now they should invest in Pakistan -- with far more success. The World Bank has called Pakistan one of the seven most important capital markets of the future, and there are enormous possibilities, in particular in the fields of energy and communications. [Koydl] Let us come to Bosnia. A few weeks ago you visited Sarajevo together with your Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller. [Bhutto] The most important thing is to lift the arms embargo against the Muslims as soon as possible. For me the issue is not so much that Muslims are being killed in Bosnia, even though I, personally, find that very painful. Rather, the issue is that people are dying there. Above all, it needs to be made clear that aggression does not pay off, that the aggression of the Serbs does not pay off. Therefore, the embargo against Bosnia must be lifted. [Koydl] Regarding a more intensive involvement by German industry in Pakistan, one precondition would be that Pakistan release more money for civilian development. So far, your country has had to spend about 70 percent of its budget on national security. One reason for that is the conflict with India over Kashmir. [Bhutto] This is correct. One of the reasons why Germany was able to grow was that others took care of its security needs. We have to do that ourselves. We have waged three wars, our country was divided -- eastern Pakistan turned into Bangladesh -- all because of Indian aggression. India is our neighbor, and because India does not get on well with any of its neighboring states, we have had to spend more than we wanted on our defense. Therefore, we have suggested to India talks on various topics -- from Kashmir to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons to missile systems and balanced troop reduction. Unfortunately, the entire matter has ended in a stalemate because India refuses to discuss seriously the problem of Kashmir. [Koydl] In the United States opinion seems to be changing regarding the issue of Kashmir. Does the United States not support Pakistan's position now? [Bhutto] I do not see this as a change in opinion. The United States just describes the legal situation correctly when it calls Kashmir a disputed territory. The area is still disputed because India has so far prevented the implementation of the UN Resolution demanding a referendum for Jammu and Kashmir. However, I do not share the view of other states that urge us toward a bilateral solution with India. Bilateral talks have not shown any results for more than 40 years. Therefore, we believe that we should now try multilateral paths or mediation by a third party. [Koydl] Who could act as a mediator? [Bhutto] We would be pleased if the United States were to act as a mediator. However, we would also be pleased if Germany played this role. Any country that has good relations with India and Pakistan could take over the role of honest broker. [Koydl] Did you broach potential mediation by Germany in your talks with Chancellor Kohl? [Bhutto] The chancellor was very worried about the situation on the subcontinent. However, I do not want to give any details; it is the business of my foreign minister to present this in appropriate diplomatic language. [Koydl] The United States also seems to have given in regarding the supply of F-16 combat planes to Pakistan, the delivery of which was stopped because of the Pakistani nuclear program. [Bhutto] It would be precipitate to speak of giving in. The situation is extremely complicated. We can say this much: There was a dialogue with the United States, which was supposed to sound out how we could improve bilateral relations. We see these F-16's as part of a purchasing contract. We paid for them. Therefore, we either want the planes or our money back. However, the delivery was suspended by a law adopted by Congress that prohibits any aid to Pakistan. Therefore, it will not be easy to find a way out. However, we believe that the Clinton administration is tackling the problem of nuclear nonproliferation in a more balanced manner. This administration is advocating the reduction and elimination of these weapons at the regional level, without picking out just Pakistan. This change is to be welcomed. [Koydl] The reason for the problems with the United States is the Pakistani nuclear program. Last year your predecessor Nawaz Sharif told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "We do not have any nuclear bomb, nor will we build one." Is this statement still correct? [Bhutto] Let me put it this way: We could have had a nuclear weapon, but we decided against it. It is quite different whether one does not have nuclear weapons because one cannot build them or whether one does not have any even though one could build them. We do not have any nuclear weapons because Pakistan is generally committed to a policy of nonproliferation. And even though India has detonated a bomb, Pakistan has shown enormous restraint by not carrying out a nuclear test, not exporting any technology, and not producing any fissionable material. We believe that Pakistan's sensible and peace-loving attitude in this matter should be recognized and rewarded. It is also extremely important for peace and security in the world that this is recognized and rewarded. [Koydl] During your visit to North Korea last December you defended each nation's right to nuclear technology. [Bhutto] The purpose of my visit to North Korea was not to discuss nuclear proliferation or nonproliferation. I visited North Korea, which Pakistan has had relations with for a long time, because I was in China and, therefore, it was simpler from the logistical point of view, to go to North Korea at that time than at another time. We discussed many different material issues, such as cheap housing construction, but not the proliferation of nuclear technology. [Koydl] But your words that any nation has a right to nuclear technology were quoted most often. [Bhutto] I am indeed of the opinion that any nation has a right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, absolutely. I have been someone who is aware of the environment since my time as a student. At that time I collected old newspapers and recycled them. In particular because I am convinced that the treasures of nature must be preserved, I also think that nuclear technology, which is clean and environmentally compatible, must provide us with electricity. On the other hand, I am strictly in favor of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and, therefore, I would like to see a balanced regional solution. Pakistan cannot take any unilateral steps on the subcontinent, because we have had three wars in the past. It is difficult for Pakistan to keep pace with conventional armament in India. Therefore, our only security and our only guarantee is the nuclear technology that we have acquired -- even if we have not developed it to the point to which we could develop it and do not intend to do so -- unless our survival were at stake. [Koydl] Then you are clearly in favor of extending the Nonproliferation Treaty next year? [Bhutto] On an equal basis. [Koydl] What do you mean by that? [Bhutto] This means that it must not be that some countries are included and others are excluded. I want a just solution for the Nonproliferation Treaty, not one that is basically discriminatory. [Koydl] Could you explain this in a bit more detail. Who discriminates against whom? [Bhutto] I am only saying that there should be one nuclear policy for all the world and not two different nuclear policies.
