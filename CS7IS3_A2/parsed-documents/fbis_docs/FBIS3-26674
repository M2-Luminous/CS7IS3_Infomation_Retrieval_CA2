Hosokawa indicated that Japan would view such moves as violations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but said he was not frightened of possible retaliatory strikes. "I very much hope the U.S. will refrain from such action," the prime minister said at a news conference before his departure for Tokyo. Hosokawa, who arrived here Thursday [10 February] night for a two-day visit, held the first summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday, but failed to reach a trade agreement. Clinton criticized Japan for unwilling to open its market to U.S. goods. "It is better to have reached no agreement than to reach an empty agreement," Clinton said. Clinton invited Hosokawa and his wife to breakfast at the White House today to demonstrate that failure of trade talks would not affect the friendly relationship between the U.S. and Japan. Afterward, the President told reporters that no further trade discussions were conducted at the breakfast meeting and that "it was a totally social visit." But he said that "we just have to examine what our next steps will be, and we will be turning to that next week." Hosokawa didn't think the failure of the agreement will lead immediately to U.S. trade sanctions against his country. The prime minister said Japan would not drop its resistance to "numerical targets" which the United States has demanded, aiming at cutting Japan's giant trade surplus. Hosokawa insisted that "we will not modify our position in that regard," although the Japanese leader will be returning empty-handed from the U.S. summit meeting.
