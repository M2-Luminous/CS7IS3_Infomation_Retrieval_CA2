Thus, we can represent the 100-years old social democratic values with a renewed force. The MSZDP, the party of society, wants a Hungary, -- where the state serves the interests of society and individuals, -- where the basic human rights are respected, everyone is free to practice his religion, and, at the same time, state and church are separate, -- where religious, ethnic, cultural, or other minorities cannot be discriminated against, -- where the equality of women is not only true on paper, -- where citizens' equality of opportunity prevails in education and culture, and participation in health and welfare provisions is ensured, -- where the burden of taxation is justly shared and people can live in security, -- where Eastern-Central European countries that are striving to establish democratic societies and welfare market economies can implement mutually advantageous cooperation, -- where those forms of ownership that are most efficient from the economy's and society's point of view exist side by side, and the state does not interfere in the economy, -- where the state accepts the obligation for ensuring education, culture, health, and welfare provisions, -- where tax and customs allowances are given to those enterprises that create workplaces, and unemployment is fought through retraining and further training, -- where modern agricultural production is done in cooperatives and farms, -- where socially controlled privatization is accomplished with the participation of the employees, -- where the influx of foreign capital helps technical development and the creation of workplaces, -- where the state, local governments, and society institutionally ensure the reduction of natural and environmental damage, -- where strong trade unions ensure the interest protection of employees, -- where the real value of pensions is preserved through legal guarantees, -- where the material subsistence level is guaranteed by a social insurance system that includes all citizens, -- where young people beginning their working life can acquire dwellings through preferential loans.
