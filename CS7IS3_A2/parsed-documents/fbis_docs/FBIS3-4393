Gao Dezhan stressed: At present, leaders at all levels in Tianjin and the suburban counties, and relevant departments should find out problems in spring farming, formulate measures, go to the grass roots to render service and do practical things, and guarantee a steady increase in summer grain and the annual agricultural production. Gao Dezhan and Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing committee of the municipal party committee and secretary general, made use of the time on Sunday to inspect Gangtian Motorcycle Company-- a village- run enterprise in Haihewan Village in Shuanggang Town--with simple means of transportation and few people in their company. They highly praised Gong Shiquan, chief manager of this company, for his outstanding achievements in successfully running a plant to make the village prosperous, and urged him not to forget agriculture while grasping industry, and made redoubled efforts to grasp the project related to grain and vegetable production. Gao Dezhan and other leaders also travelled to the families of Zhao Yonglin and his brother--two crops cultivation households in Shuanggang Village--to ask them about the cultivation situation, marketing, and income in cultivating vegetables under plastic sheets. After that, they visited an exclusively foreign-funded enterprise-- Bokelai Daily Necessary Company, Limited--and Nanyanxiang Jingjing Decorating Lamps Company, Limited. Braving the sudden cold spell in spring, Gao Dezhan also travelled to Datianli of Beizhongtang Village in Shuangya Township to inspect its preparations for plowing. He learned from the village cadres about the situation of plowing, irrigation, and the storage of seeds and chemical fertilizers, and asked in details about the income, living, and farming enthusiasm of peasants. During a forum with district and township cadres, Gao Dezhan pointed out: This year we should act in line with the demand of the party Central Committee and the State Council on further strengthening agricultural and rural work, comprehensively develop the rural economy, and strive to increase the income of peasants. He put forward four specific demands: 1) Pay Attention to stabilizing and increasing the output of grain, cotton and oil- bearing crops, actively develop the nonstaple food project, actively readjust the agricultural structure, including the planting and breeding industries, and develop high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming. This year the increase in the total agricultural output value should be higher than that of last year and must not be lower than the national average level of increase. 2) Actively develop township enterprises, accelerate the development of tertiary industry and of individual and private enterprises, develop diversified undertakings, comprehensively invigorate the rural economy, and ensure that the increase in the total product of the rural society will not be lower than that of last year. 3) Further strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the rural areas, accelerate the building of well-off star villages, do a good job in comprehensive management of public security, and turn more townships and villages into civilized, prosperous, and stable new rural areas. 4) Try by all possible means to increase the income of peasants, raise their living standards, and through economic development, strive to increase the financial revenue of suburban counties, and strengthen the momentum for developing township enterprises. Gao Dezhan pointed out: To implement all tasks in the rural areas, leading cadres at all levels should further enhance their ideology and understanding and fully recognize the foundation status of agriculture; firmly cultivate the idea that when the rural areas are stable, all sectors will be stable and when the rural areas are prosperous, Tianjin will also become prosperous. We should pay great attention to rural work and agricultural production, and promote comprehensive rural economic development and social progress. Gao Dezhan stressed: A year's plan will start in spring. At present, it is time for making plowing preparations. We must seize this opportunity and concentrate energy on making preparations for plowing. He said: At present, there are many difficulties lying ahead in agricultural production, the drought situation is serious, the prices of some agricultural means of production have been raised, and leading comrades of some localities have failed to pay full attention to agricultural production. Leaders at all levels must recognize the grim situation in agricultural production and pay great attention to it. March is a period of crucial importance for our municipality to make preparations for plowing. Districts and counties charged with agricultural production tasks must urge their cadres at all levels, from the party committee to the government, to take action to combat drought to protect the seedings of winter crops, to reap a bumper harvest of summer grains, to strive to achieve good harvests during the whole year, and to achieve highly efficient and good-quality production of nonstaple foods, such as cotton and oil-bearing crops. It is necessary to grasp all spring plowing tasks, including the preparations for seeds, chemical fertilizers, and agricultural chemicals, popularization of science and technology, and technical guidance. Meanwhile, we should conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among peasants and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in spring plowing. All localities should assign the responsibility to all levels and make all levels and the peasant households to assume responsibility over each plot of land. Gao Dezhan stressed: Relevant departments in Tianjin and in suburban counties and leaders at all levels should further change work style, and should not be content with a general call. They should find out problems in spring plowing, formulate measures, go to the grass roots, render service, do practical things, and ensure that this year's agricultural production and rural economic development objectives will be fulfilled. Gao Dezhan encouraged the masses of cadres in Jinnan District to fully use their own advantages and favorable conditions, advance in a pioneering spirit, and invigorate Jinnan.
