He went to 134 Rakovski Street [Union of Democratic Forces-SDS headquarters] to hear with his own ears, face to face, what the blue [SDS] leader thinks, and of course, in order to be heard himself. In a state with democratic traditions dialogue is the most direct way to the truth. Videnov was not confused and he selected that way. Regardless of how arrogantly Mr. Filip Dimitrov behaves, the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] has shown that it is a party of clear words. After all it was the BSP and no one else that initiated the famous roundtable four years ago. It was precisely this roundtable that confirmed that the BSP is not afraid of dialogue. In this context the visit to 134 Rakovski Street was not an incident or a casual whim. It is a part of a deliberate course of behavior that has already helped up with our hesitant steps in democracy. The reaction to Videnov's appearance at the SDS headquarters was not only stormy but also varied. Every interested politician is trying to view it, interpret it, and use it in accordance with his own interests. If you read DEMOKRATSIYA you can see how much speculation can be squeezed in one article, the irresponsible nature of which is evident not only regarding relations with the political opponent, but also regarding the SDS's own interest. If you read the declaration of the Civic Alliance for the Republic you will understand what certain political forces fear. It appears that the Bulgarian political arena is still not prepared for normal, albeit unexpected, meetings. Torn by suspicion, our society constantly seeks something sensational or secret, and that confuses it. Certain irresponsible journalists, who prefer fantasy to truth, contribute to this situation. Unfortunately, Videnov's visit to the SDS headquarters, which lasted 90 minutes, created confusion in certain BSP circles. Responsible figures in the BSP regarded the visit as irresponsible. They tend to see the visit as a compromise serving the interests of the other side. This is wrong and it must worry us not only because it breeds suspicion, but also because it evokes alarm as a position. Already at the 14th Congress, which created the BSP, it was loftily declared that the BSP will be a party of dialogue, political contacts, pluralism, and cooperation in all issues of democratic development. Zhan Videnov was simply putting this statement into effect. He went to Filip Dimitrov not in order to make compromises or create intrigues, but to study the other side's position and express the BSP position on certain issues. Those issues are of national interest, and this relieves Videnov of any hesitation he might have had about the meeting. It is precisely in this element that those who were confused by the meeting could not grasp the scope of the political task, and they therefore became confused. What is amazing is that some of those who became confused have never declared their opposition to dialogue as the essence of socialist policy. On the contrary, they often themselves participated in contacts with different political forces. Rejecting or not understanding Zhan Videnov's initiative is one of the many typical mistakes that certain people allow in their thinking. They often place their own political ambitions above the political interest, or what is worse, in principle they prefer confrontation to the complex but purposeful gambit. We have often been able to convince ourselves that confrontation builds up self- esteem, but it does not trace a new road. It might improve our self-esteem in our own eyes at a given moment, but it can never ensure our success. Indeed, the great drama of the SDS lies in its unwillingness to understand this simple truth. Why should we be the victims of the same mistake? The dialogue Zhan Videnov proposed to our political opponent does not undermine the BSP's prestige in any way. It only shows that the BSP is the calmer and wiser political force and that in the name of the great public interest it is prepared to talk with everyone, even those who deliberately refuse to take our real name into consideration. It is time for all those who formulate the BSP's policy to understand that a bold and unconventional move in relations with others is better than the traditional fear of surprises. Surprises are a part of the political "theater," and those who create or welcome them win points in the political game. Zhan Videnov's visit must be assessed on merit from this point of view. He did not go to the SDS headquarters to seek prestige, as DEMOKRATSIYA wrongly alleges, but to demonstrate prestige and to show our society that the BSP has no fear of expressing its opinion to anyone. This is more than useful at the beginning of the 1994 political season. Tomorrow Filip Dimitrov will find it much more difficult to cheat and maneuver, because he already knows what the Socialists think not only about the situation within the SDS itself, but also about the Presidency, the cabinet, the work of parliament, the budget, the Election Law, the future elections, the Supreme Judicial council, and many other issues that should be resolved soon. Things were expressed in a clear and open manner without any maneuvering. Speculating with the issue is harmful. If speculations nevertheless emerge, they will not change anything. The BSP can be calm about the outcome of the meeting. It will not complicate its position in society in any way. On the contrary, it will only confirm its sober attitude toward all issues discussed. I will again stress that a policy of dialogue is better than a policy of covered cards. The purpose of the meeting was not to demand sacrifices from anyone, pressurize individual political forces, or preserve the status quo. It was a meeting for a typical exchange of information. Therefore, no one need imagine that there will be unexpected changes in the political landscape. The poles remain. Nevertheless, it is better for everyone that the poles hear each other before they engage in their regular parliamentary and extraparliamentary snowballs fights. After all, sometimes such fights can be avoided for the sake of the common national tranquility. This article could end here if the Presidency had not expressed its opinion. Like certain political leaders, Dr. Zhelev hastened to say that he did not like the meeting between Zhan Videnov and Filip Dimitrov, and that the meeting was prompted by some "severe crisis" in the BSP and the SDS. We cannot speak for the SDS, but on behalf of the BSP we must say that the president is alarmingly wrong, or is simply not aware of the realities, or is a victim of his own imagination. There are many things in the BSP, but no trace of a crisis. There are different opinions and assessments of issues, even ideological disputes, but for the time being at least there is nothing serious that could jeopardize the monolithic character of the party. It is and will certainly continue to be the biggest and strongest Bulgarian political party. As a former member of our party (and may the president forgive us for reminding him of this), Zhelyu Zhelev knows very well that we, Socialists, have a sense of responsibility and duty even when we quarrel. We were not born yesterday and will not disappear tomorrow. Unlike his blue ideas, our ideas have roots and a future. Therefore, if he wants to be just, let him not confuse his wishful thinking with reality. Otherwise he will err, and his post is such that the smallest error could place him in a very uncomfortable situation. The BSP is a sufficiently mature party and knows precisely how to overcome its own weaknesses. Therefore, the crisis the president invokes is not in the BSP, but somewhere else. Perhaps somewhere near him, but let us not pursue this. The gentleman is smart enough to answer this for himself. And so an absolutely normal dialogue between two political forces is causing serious excitement in Bulgaria. This is at once wonderful and alarming. It shows that society has great expectations, but its nerves are rather weak. We still have not achieved the psychological balance we need. Suspicion still is stronger than confidence. However, let us not despair. We need time. Many more meetings and talks are necessary for us to realize that it is better to talk to each other than pass each other like deaf people. In this sense Zhan Videnov has DUMA's support, as well as the support of all those who regard his political initiative as positive.
