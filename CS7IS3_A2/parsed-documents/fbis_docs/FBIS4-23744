Yesterday, the two-thirds quorum failed to materialize. But the surprise came from Brussels this afternoon. Herve de Guelink reports: [De Guelink] Zairean Parliament Speaker Mgr Monsengwo and his first deputy, the Social-Christian Joseph Ileo, are in Brussels. In a joint communique, both refused to endorse what is going on at the Zairean parliament at the moment. They in fact think the election of a prime minister by the parliament is contrary to the new Zairean constitution which came into force on 9 April. It took months of bargaining between the opposition and the allies of President Mobutu to agree on this document. The speaker of the parliament and his deputy, Mgr Monsengwo and Joseph Ileo, have therefore refused to endorse what they consider as illegal and they have appealed to President Mobutu to fully respect the new constitutional act of transition.
