Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told reporters on Saturday that the President viewed Hosokawa's resignation as relating solely to the domestic affairs of Japan and that it should not have any repercussions on bilateral ties with Indonesia. Suharto, according to Murdiono, expressed his wish that Japan would soon overcome its domestic political problems and elect a new prime minister. "The leadership change in Japan is not going to affect the politics and government of that country," Murdiono said, echoing the President. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas, also voicing confidence that Indonesian-Japanese ties will remain unaffected, stressed on Saturday that it is only the prime minister who has resigned, and that the government will remain. Japan is Indonesia's main trading partner and also its largest source of foreign aid. The two countries in recent years have tried to expand their bilateral ties to include other aspects, most notably culture.
