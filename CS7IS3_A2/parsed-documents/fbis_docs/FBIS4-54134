The operation organized and commanded by the great leader President Kim Il-song in May, 1939, was one of the operations of advance into the homeland which recorded a shining page in the history of the Korean people's anti-Japanese revolutionary war. The late 1930s was the darkest period in the Japanese imperialist rule (1905-1945) over Korea. In those days the Japanese imperialists launched a large-scale "punitive" offensive with the mobilization of forces hundreds of thousands strong, calling the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) "a cancer" in the fulfilment of their plan of aggression on the continent. They also destroyed grass-roots organizations of the association for the restoration of the fatherland and other revolutionary organizations and arrested and killed many people at random. The Korean revolution faced a temporary difficulty. President Kim Il-song worked out a plan to advance a large unit into the homeland with a view to actively breaking through it and leading the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle to a high tide. A large-scale spring counteroffensive was waged in late April and early May for the preparation of advance into the homeland. The main unit of the KPRA attacked Qiujiadian, Shiwudaogou, Banjiegou and other strategic vantages of the enemy along the River Amnok one after another, winning a great victory. The historic operation of advance into the homeland was started on May 18. President Kim Il-song, who marched into the homeland across the River Amnok, leading the main unit of the KPRA, reached Mupo on May 21 via Chongbong, Konchang, Pegaebong and Lake Samji. He called a meeting of KPRA commanding officers at the camp in Mupo and issued an order to advance to the Musan area. On the 22nd, the main unit of the KPRA liberated the extensive area of Mt. Noun around Sinsadong and Singaechok. Reaching the Sinsadong area, leading the eighth regiment and the guards company of the command, President Kim Il-song made a historical speech "let us rise up vigorously in the anti-Japanese struggle to hasten the liberation of the homeland" before Sinsadong people. That day, the KPRA completely wiped out the pursuing enemy on trucks. The battle on the Taehongdan plain, the climax of the operation, took place on the 23rd. The Japanese imperialists sent a huge force to the Musan area in an attempt to check the advance of the KPRA into the homeland. President Kim Il-song unfolded an operation to annihilate the enemy on the plain and brought the battle to a victory with superb guerrilla tactics. Hundreds of the Japanese imperialist aggression troops were killed or wounded in the battle. The operation of advance into the Musan area ended in a great political and military victory of the KPRA. It fully demonstrated the outstanding commanding art of President Kim Il-song and the invincible might of the KPRA and brought about a constant upsurge in the Korean revolution as a whole with the anti- Japanese armed struggle in its center.
