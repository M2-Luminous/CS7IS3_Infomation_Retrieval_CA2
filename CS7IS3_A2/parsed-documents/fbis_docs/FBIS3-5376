The decision, announced on Thursday by Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, is aimed primarily at cutting Japan's huge trade surplus with the US. This is not the first time that Washington has decided to threaten sanctions to extract concessions from Tokyo. In 1989, it used the same law against Japan to boost its exports in wood products, satellites and super-computers. Presumably, the US believes that it can prevail again without having to act on its threat of retaliation. Under-Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten has said that Washington will be aggressive in seeking to increase its exports and open up the markets of its principal trading partners. Commercial interests, he added, had never been so important as they are now to US foreign policy. Granted, Japan has been slow in taking steps to give foreign competitors a fair chance in its market. This has caused growing frustration in the US, which ran a trade deficit of US$60 billion with that country last year. But reviving Super 301 is a retrogressive step. As the secretary general of Gatt, Mr Peter Sutherland, remarked, it is misguided and dangerous. Instead of acting unilaterally, which will make the US open to charges of unfairness, Washington should be settling its disputes through multilateral mechanisms under Gatt. Unilateralism also violates the agreement reached at the Uruguay Round of trade talks last December. If it is applied to Japan, it can also be directed at other trading partners with which the US has trade friction. If this happens, it will undermine free trade, which must be preserved at all costs. Super 301 is perhaps meant to pressure Japan ahead of the market- opening measures it has promised to announce soon. But by resorting to it, Washington is taking the obvious risk of having to carry out its threat of sanctions if Tokyo fails to make an offer that it considers acceptable. Even if it retaliates selectively under that law, this will do considerable harm to both sides at a time of economic slowdown. It will also weaken their political and strategic ties, which are essential for the stability of the Asia- Pacific region. Handling their disputes outside multilateral forums also means that the situation could get out of control since they are democracies and, thus, vulnerable to domestic pressure groups and public sentiment. Fortunately, the procedures under Super 301 are such that it could take more than a year before Washington can activate punitive measures after it has blacklisted what it considers offending partners. There is no imminent danger of trade retaliation. But the issue must be resolved at the earliest to prevent tension from building up to a dangerous level. It is reassuring that President Bill Clinton wants to avoid sanctions, which he conveyed to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on the telephone before the law was announced. He has, nevertheless, put the ball in Japan's court without waiting for Tokyo to make its new offer. Thus far, Japan has been indecisive in responding to US calls for greater market access. Rifts within the ruling coalition have sapped its ability to govern effectively. Mr Hosokawa's failure to reshuffle his divided Cabinet raises the question whether he can act firmly to defuse tension with the US. He and his coalition partners must heed the lead that has come from the private sector. Toyota plans to import US car parts to observe a voluntary target of US$6 billion in 1996. Other Japanese car manufacturers are also expected to be forthcoming. But it is imperative that the US does not make patently unfair demands, such as managed trade, now that it has revived Super 301. As the world's pre-eminent economic power, it must act responsibly.
