According to local officials, the province met its target of gaining the capacity to produce an annual 930,000 tons of steel at the end of the Eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1991-1995) two years ahead of schedule. Last year's steel output represents an increase of 15.5 percent compared with the previous year. Gansu, regarded as one of China's most backward areas, abounds in iron ore resources. With the introduction of reform measures concerning labor, personnel and distribution, the initiative of workers in local iron and steel companies have been brought into full play, and the province's steel output has increased at an annual rate of 80,000 tons to 100,000 tons over the past three years. Economic results were also enhanced for three years running. Last year the province recorded 700 million yuan in profits and taxes from steel production.
