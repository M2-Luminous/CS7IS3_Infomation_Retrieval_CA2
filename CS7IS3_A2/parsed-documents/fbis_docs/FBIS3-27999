The Home Affairs Ministry and the Finance Ministry will jointly announce Saturday an outline of the program for the year beginning next April 1. Under the program, the amount of public works projects sponsored by local governments will increase 12 percent to 18.5 trillion yen for the fourth consecutive double-digit rise, the sources said. The projects are intended to help boost economic recovery. At the same time, local government bond issues will increase 40 percent to cover revenue shortfalls in local taxes and taxes allocated to local governments, they said. The shortfalls are expected because of the prolonged national economic recession.
