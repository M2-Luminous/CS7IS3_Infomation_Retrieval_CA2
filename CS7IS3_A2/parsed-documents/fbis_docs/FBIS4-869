According to Henri Ibrahim, prefect of the department, the four were arrested for inciting people to violence and tribal hatred. They are presently detained at the Diffa Gendarmerie Brigade headquarters. They had planned to attack the Maine-Soroa Subprefecture, to abduct the subprefect, and to demand the release of Tandja Mamadou, chairman of the National Movement of the Development Society-Nassara. The regional authorities, who were alerted, foiled the plot by arresting the ringleaders. A report we have just received says that in order to maintain social peace, the Diffa authorities have, as of today, banned all public gatherings and demonstrations until further notice.
