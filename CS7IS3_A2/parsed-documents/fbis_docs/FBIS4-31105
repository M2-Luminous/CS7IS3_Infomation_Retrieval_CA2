According to Deputy Speaker Peter Weiss, it was shown that extremists on both sides were incapable of reaching a compromise agreement. He went on to remark that the bill had taken into account all of the most important amendments, including those made by the opposition. Tibor Cabaj, deputy for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, said that sound reason had prevailed. According to him, the bill had not been well prepared, and, when amendments that had been submitted to improve it had failed to be incorporated, the way the opposition would vote had been quite clear. On the other hand, Vladimir Miskovsky, deputy for the National Democratic Party, was of the opinion that the amendments submitted had improved the bill to such an extent that it ought to have accommodated all tolerant people, both the Hungarian minority and the Slovaks living in the south of the country. Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement, saw the reason for the rejection of the bill in the fact that towns named after important Slovak figures had been excluded from the requirement to display bilingual signs. Pal Csaky, deputy for the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement-Coexistence, commented on the rejection of the bill by saying that the matter was serious and that the party would draw conclusions from the breaking of the coalition agreement. Arpad Duka Zolyomi, representing the same party, had envisaged that the coalition partners would ensure the implementation of the agreement reached in the coalition council. He said that it would obviously be necessary to hold discussions about further cooperation.
