The MAINICHI SHIMBUN quoted a senior U.S. official as saying that attacking North Korea's nuclear facilities would be very difficult, although President Bill Clinton and Defense Secretary Les Aspin had said they would not rule out military action against the communist country. The Pentagon has been looking into possible options, including a pre-emptive air strike, with the understanding that military action will be difficult if Pyongyang acquires nuclear weapons, the U.S. official said. But Washington came to the conclusion that it is impossible to destroy North Korea's nuclear facilities with missiles or bombs if they are moved underground, he said. Bombardment of reactors or nuclear fuel storage sites was ruled out as it is most likely to result in a release of radioactivity, he said. In addition, Washington had to consider the possibility of Pyongyang's retaliating and devastating South Korea, the MAINICHI observed. Seoul is a strong opponent of an attack and, considering all of the odds, a military attack on North Korea's nuclear facilities is highly unlikely, the newspaper commented. The Japanese daily noted there were calls for an air attack if the situation worsens from conservative U.S. congressmen and some military experts, but they lost ground with Washington's reaching this conclusion.
