Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, a leader of the Hamas deportees in south Lebanon, added that such a dialogue "will constitute a means for the Palestinian people, inside and outside, to avoid the calamities of the coming period, the self-rule period." Al-Zahhar doubted the seriousness of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's invitation to conduct such a dialogue, and said: I hope that the intention is not merely to hold a meeting." He urged the Palestinian factions "not to participate in this dialogue unless its objective is explained to them in advance." He called on the Palestinian leadership to formulate "a political program vis-a-vis the program of the opposition factions for retrieving full Palestinian rights." Al-Zahhar added that "many previous meetings with 'Arafat were just maneuvers in advance of participation in the ninth round of talks, which led to circumventing the issue of the deportees." A series of meetings between PLO leaders, headed by Yasir 'Arafat, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad failed to adopt a unified stance on the peace talks and the deportees' issue. Al-Zahhar vehemently denied reports that Hamas intends to participate in the self-rule elections. He said: We will neither take part in self-rule elections nor in self-rule institutions. He added: However, in the past we participated and will participate in every professional and popular elections that serve the Palestinian public, without any relation to the self-rule authority.
