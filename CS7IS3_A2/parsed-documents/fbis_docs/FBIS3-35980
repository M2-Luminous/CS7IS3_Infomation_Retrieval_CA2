According to him, "relations between the three CIS states will be implemented within the framework of the strategy and political course determined during the meetings of leaders of the Commonwealth and in bilateral agreements." If Belarus adopts a position toward Russia that differs from that under Stanislav Shuskevich, "the appropriate reaction from Russia will follow, too. And the same applies to Ukraine," Sergey Krasavchenko noted. The advent to power of Yuriy Meshkov, president of Crimea, who is a radical supporter of the peninsula becoming a sovereign entity "may complicate relations between Russia and Ukraine, if certain forces strive to draw Russia into the nascent conflict." However, he stressed, "there are normal, civilized, political methods" that may help avert confrontation. Recalling the statement by Yuriy Meshkov that he does not intend to seek Crimea's immediate departure from Ukraine and its annexation to Russia, Sergey Krasavchenko noted that "no major grounds for tension should arise."
