Talking to journalists, Kozyrev said: "We did not carry out the democratic revolution to continue maintaining the same policy and once again become a superpower jeopardising peace. This is absolutely out of question," Kozyrev said. He pointed out that objectively Russia was one of the biggest states in the world, but that it did not seek to return to a bipolar world. It wanted to fulfill its interests in practice through partnership, cooperation and good neighbourly relations. This role undoubtedly required an active independent foreign political line but not at the cost of confrontation, Kozyrev said. Responding to a question about mistrust of the Sarajevo residents towards Russian soldiers who should reinforce the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] units stationed in Bosnia Kozyrev described as absolutely unacceptable that the Moslems be backed up by the Islamic world, the Serbs by the Orthodox and the Croats by the Catholic churches. To set the 20th century world back to the time of religious crusades would be a catastrophic scenario, said Kozyrev. "We will not allow any such catastrophe to occur and will work for cooperation and a unified approach by all super powers," he added. He went on to say that the Bosnian leaders understood that it was necessary to advance towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict and that they were in favour of Russia's active role in the area, equal to that played by the other countries. Commenting on his ministry's activities in the new Russian Government, he said no changes had occurred there. On demands concerning his resignation, he said: "I do not dramatise them." He added that he frequently cooperated with President Boris Yeltsin and that as a result his work seemed easier to him.
