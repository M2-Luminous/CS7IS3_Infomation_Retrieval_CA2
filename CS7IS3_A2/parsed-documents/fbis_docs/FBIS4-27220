FBIS4-27220 "dreas104_a_94053" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Economic Index Surges Above `Boom-or-Bust' Line Economic Index Surges Above `Boom-or-Bust' Line OW3105065694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0618 GMT 31 May 94 OW3105065694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The government's key economic forecasting gauge surged above the boom-or-bust line of 50 percent in March for the third straight month, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Tuesday [31 May]. However, an EPA official downplayed the significance of the latest data and pointed to the need to see statistics making up the index in the coming months before deciding whether the economy is getting back on the recovery path. The index of leading indicators, designed to forecast economic trends three to six months down the road, rose to 90.9 percent in March from a revised 54.2 percent in February. The index was first reported at 45 percent for February. The upward revision reflects positive figures on a backlog for construction orders and business sentiment among small and medium- sized companies, which were not included in preliminary data. In theory, the EPA considers a reading above 50 as a sign that the economy will expand in the near future but a level below 50 as heralding contraction. The EPA remains cautious about painting a bright picture of the state of the economy, though, since two other indexes released together with the leading index contained negative findings. "Despite positive movements in the leading index, basic movements in the indexes reflect the fact that the national economy remains sluggish," the EPA said in a report. The index of coincident indicators, a measure of the state of the economy, stayed above 50 percent in March for the first time in two months, rising to 90.0 percent from a revised 30.0 percent in February. The index of lagging indicators, which gauges the economic performance in the recent past, fell below 50 percent for six months in a row, staying at 28.6 percent against a preliminary 0.0 percent in February.
