It will concentrate on gathering information that will enhance South Korea's competitiveness. According to CHUGAN CHOSON, a 30-page NSP publication "International Industry and Business Information Report," carries information about international business and trade, industrial technology, resource materials, energy, and environmental issues. The article pointed out that the high-quality information is gathered by NSP agents worldwide which is unavailable to other government agencies such as the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation [KOTRA]. Much of it comes from specialized magazines, technical journals, and newspapers where NSP agents are stationed. The publication also provides medium and long-range forecasts. The NSP printed approximately 500 copies of its publication and distributed it to government agencies, the Korea Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Korean Industries, and various economic research centers. The article reported that consumer response has been excellent and demand is so great that, beginning this month, an additional 170 copies will be printed. The NSP plans to pay special attention to disseminating information needed by small to medium-size businesses and regional university research centers. The article praised the NSP for this worthwhile service, the first of its kind in the agency's 33 years of existence.
