States and localities will be organizing their implementation of school-to-work systems around broad industry/occupational clusters. Accordingly, the Department is seeking to complement State and local effort by providing business related assistance focused around broad industry clusters. Thus, the Department is seeking applicants that can organize their efforts around broad industry groups that would at least include: Manufacturing, service, retail and wholesale trade, and finance, insurance and real estate. Within each sector, applicants must be able to demonstrate their ability to enlist the support of both leading edge companies and small and mid-size firms. In addition, applicants must indicate the major occupational clusters within each industry sector that the organization believes offers the greatest potential for inclusion in school-to-work transition opportunities programs. The Department is seeking to work closely with the applicant(s) that is selected for these partnership activities, but not to prescribe the methods the applicant will employ to accomplish the objectives laid out above. The Department recognizes that those applicants which have demonstrated the capability to deliver services have established methods and processes for reaching and supporting the employer community. Each applicant proposal for this section of the Statement of Work must include: 1. A comprehensive implementation plan for providing targeted assistance to States as they move forward to implement their school-to-work transition systems. Such plan must have specific actions what will be accomplished within the grant period. 2.

Complete drafts of these materials are to be submitted for review and, as necessary revision prior to publication/release. 3.

A plan for assessment of the incentives, both financial and nonfinancial, that will be required to recruit their members participation in local school-to-work opportunities programs, on a large-scale basis. B. Skill Standards The Department wants to promote the active involvement of business organizations in the development of national voluntary skill standards. Once established these standards are designed to meet the needs of the current and potential workforce, from high school dropouts to graduates of school-to-work. programs, from dislocated workers to workers progressing along a career path. Business participation and leadership in these activities is critical to achieving our major objectives of a common language of skill classification and a portable credential. Therefore, proposals submitted in response to this section of the Statement of Work should include a strategy, implementation plan and timetable for the following elements: 1. Marketing. To include information sharing, promotion and generate interest among the business community, broadly defined, of activities in this area and informing workers of the benefits of the system for enhancing their ability to enter or reenter the workforce or move up in a career progression; 2. Coalition Building. To prepare the business community for participation in voluntary partnerships encourage by the National Skill Standards Board to be established under the GOALS 2000: Educate American Act (this would include stimulating business participation as well as courting business partnerships with representatives from the education and training community, State and local governments, community-based organizations and organized labor); 3. Research. To draw the linkage between high performance work organization, skill standards and competitiveness gains, and to examine the connection between the human resource requirements of ISO 9000 and the Malcolm Baldrige Award using skill standards as a tool. C. Reemployment Program Activities Each year more than one-fourth of the workforce move to new jobs either to advance careers or to rebound from a job loss. The Administration plans a major investment to help experienced workers move from one job to the next to equip workers with skills needed for the new jobs of the future.
