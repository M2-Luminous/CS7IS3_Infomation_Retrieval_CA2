The White House made the announcement from Detroit where President Clinton is hosting a G-7 job summit. Boorda, 55, is currently serving as commander in chief of U.S. naval forces in Europe, and commander in chief of allied forces in southern Europe, where he is responsible for coordinating and planning NATO military actions over Bosnia-Hercegovina and in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. Boorda is a former listed man who is considered close to General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. Boorda, a native of Chicago, Illinois state, joined the U.S. Navy in 1956 when he was 18 after he dropped out of high school because of problems at home. Within six years, he rose to the rank of petty officer first class, serving primarily in naval aviation. In 1962, he was selected from officer candidate school under the seaman to admiral program, which ended several years later. His first sea tour as an officer was off Vietnam. In 1966, he, as a lieutenant, got his first command, the USS Parrot, a small coastal minesweeper with a crew of 43 and four officers, and it remains his favorite command. In 1971, after attending the U.S. Naval War College and obtaining a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Rhode Island, he assumed duties as an executive officer. From 1975 to 1977, Boorda commanded the USS Parraut and was next assigned as executive assistant to the principal deputy assistant secretary of the navy for manpower and reserve affairs in Washington, D.C. In 1983-1984, he served as executive assistant to the chief of naval personnel, deputy chief of naval operations for manpower, personnel and training. In December, 1984, he assumed his first flag officer assignment as executive assistant to the chief of naval operations, remaining until July, 1986. Kelso, 60, announced last month that he was retiring two months ahead of schedule because he had become the "lightning rod" for criticism of the Navy's handling over the past two years of the Tailhook sexual harassment scandal. Kelso is due to leave as chief of naval operations on April 30. As the top uniformed position in the navy, he is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
