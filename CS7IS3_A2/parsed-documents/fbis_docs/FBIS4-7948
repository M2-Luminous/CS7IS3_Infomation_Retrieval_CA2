The KDH is for loose cooperation of all the parties right of the centre, in particular the DS (extra-parliamentary), the National Democratic Party-New Alternative and the Party of Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, added Carnogursky, Slovak prime minister between 1991 and 1992. The KDH has also established contacts with "Knazko's followers" and "Moravcik's followers" who want to create the Slovak Democratic Union on April 23. Milan Knazko is a former Slovak Foreign Minister who heads the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR). Josef Moravcik, current prime minister, recently created the Alternative of Political Realism (APR). "National differences seem to be stronger than ideology," Carnogursky commented on contemplations of possible contacts with the ethnic Hungarian parties. However, he did not rule out cooperation with them because "apart from some aspects of ethnic policy our views are very close." "Bilateral meetings of the right-wing parties will continue and we would also like to stage a multilateral session this month," Carnogursky announced.
