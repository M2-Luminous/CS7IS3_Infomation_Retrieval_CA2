From the perspective of the People's Congress deputies and the Political Consultative Conference members who are taking an active part or a consultative role in government, what picture does this storm paint? No doubt, in this storm the anti-corruption campaign has produced outstanding results. Based on detailed data provided by Mijiti Kuerban, People's Congress deputy and Xinjiang's chief procurator, show that In 1993, the region handled 2,161 corruption and bribery and other economic crime cases; 933 cases were filed and investigated and 621 cases were tried and closed. The largest corruption case involved 1.89 million yuan and the largest bribery case involved 215,000 yuan. Thirty county- and section-level cadres were tried as criminals. This storm has shaken up the land north and south of Tianshan. In the meetings of the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference, anti-corruption and advocation of honest government is still a hot topic. At those meetings, we hear a lot of "jingles." What these jingles describe are not accurate summations; in many ways they may even be biased. But they nevertheless express what the people have in mind. They prove that corruption has not been swept away by the storm; the "hotbeds" that breed corruption have not been thoroughly sterilized; party-mass relations and cadre-mass relations need to be further reinforced and strengthened. We must not over-estimate the initial success of the anti-corruption campaign, nor should we under-estimate the dangers of corruption. According to People's Congress Deputy Matao Haiguoen, most prefectures and counties in the autonomous region are in financial red ink and are unable to come up with the money to fund education and health care and other undertakings, but they have the money to buy expensive cars and build fancy public buildings; some towns and townships are copying them. Some township government officials do not want 212 jeeps; they prefer luxury cars which do not even run well on bumpy country roads. They just want to show off. People's Congress Deputy Muheiti Manlike said frankly that today, leading cadres get new cars more often, and they get more expensive cars every year; they move every time a new house is built, but meanwhile some enterprises can't even pay wages, and the masses are very upset. The cadres' work-style must change radically; otherwise the gulf between the leadership and the masses will only widen. Rampant unhealthy tendencies make it difficult for honesty to plant a foothold. Without righteousness and honesty, corruption will inevitably run amuck. This is the philosophy lesson society has taught us as it develops. Abusing power for private gains, using money to buy power and using power to make money, money-worshipping, and hedonism are like "smelly tofu"--they smell bad to others but taste good to those who are enjoying them, and that is why these phenomena are hanging around like ghostly spirits. After this big anti-corruption storm, members of the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference will pay even more attention to creating an honest government. What is the crux of the problem? Jiusan Society's Xinjiang Autonomous Regional Party Committee spoke up before the Political Consultative Conference that the key to whether we can staunchly continue the anti-corruption and honest government campaign will depend on the Communist Party which is the ruling party. If the party members can discipline themselves and stay clean and honest, then the party's work style will be upright, and the anti-corruption and clean government campaign within the party will be a victory, and there will be hope for the nation's anti-corruption struggle. Jiusan Society's Xinjiang Party Committee even came up with three 14-article suggestions on fighting corruption. The deputies and conference members also reached the consensus that in attacking corruption and building an honest government, it is important to cure the symptom and the causes at the same time. We must link attacking crime, punishing corruption, and constructing a hard-working and clean government together. "It is not enough to rely on education alone to ensure honesty in government. We must have a healthy system of rules and regulations and legal measures to constrain and regulate behavior," said An Qingming [1344 1987 2494], People's Congress deputy. Members of the Political Consultative Conference advised that we must do something so that, one, the masses of public employees do not want to be corrupt (we can provide proper spiritual and material civilizations conditions); two, they must not be corrupt (we must amplify the legal system and supervision); three, they dare not be corrupt (we must impose harsh punishment and publicly expose them.) The People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference meetings happen to coincide with Secretary General Jiang Zemin's important speech against corruption before the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee's Central Advisory Commission. The deputies and the committee members are greatly encouraged, but at the same time, they also realize that anti-corruption is not a war that can be won in a single battle; rather, we must take one step at a time and do a thorough job and push forward in stages. But no matter what, the anti-corruption and honest government campaign will not be a perfunctory gesture, as feared by some deputies and committee members. This storm will not blow over soon.
