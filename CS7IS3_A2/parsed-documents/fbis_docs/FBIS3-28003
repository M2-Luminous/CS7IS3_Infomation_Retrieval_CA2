There are many non-zero-sum games in the North Korean nuclear issue and in inter-Korean relations, he said. In a zero-sum game, a gain for one side entails a corresponding loss for the other side. Addressing the opening session of the annual meeting of overseas mission chiefs on Wednesday, he said what the government must first consider in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue is the need to prevent it from worsening dramatically. In the short term, the government should aim at guaranteeing the transparency of North Korea's nuclear program. He also stressed the need for flexibility and patience in dealing with North Korea: "Even if North Korea earned time by use of delaying tactics (in its negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency on international inspections of its nuclear facilities), such time would not be of any help to North Korea's nuclear development program." Commenting on President Kim Yong-sam's internationalization policy, Han said it is aimed at increasing the global competitiveness of Korean products and enriching the people's spiritual and material life, adding, "you overseas mission chiefs should bear the brunt of this policy as the nation's outposts." Any stereotyped and predictable diplomacy should be transformed into a pragmatic, forward-looking and flexible diplomacy, he remarked. Attending the opening session of the meeting, which lasts until the weekend, were 49 mission chiefs stationed in Asia and North and South America. After the opening session, the mission chiefs discussed measures to attain peaceful unification of Korea, increased international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and promotion of South Korea for membership in the United Nations Security Council. The prime minister later hosted a luncheon for the mission chiefs at the Sejong Cultural Center, where he called on them to do their best in tackling security and trade issues.
