The tax office building in Via Manin has been chosen as the location. It is a beautiful building a few hundred meters from the Cerchia del Navigli that overlooks the municipal gardens. The news, that was foreshadowed yesterday by LA REPUBBLICA, was confirmed by Pagliarini, who is responsible for the budget. A spokesman of the same Pagliarini had in fact observed that it was "necessary for the ministry to open a branch in Milan." The reason is to be closer to the real economy, to the production center, and to the factories and offices of the North. The minister was more loquacious in the lower house during the evening. He joked that the Budget Ministry could be "transferred to Lametia Terme, maybe to the former SIR [Italian Resins Company] headquarters." Then Pagliarini added: "In exchange, the Interior Ministry and the Bank of Italy could be moved to Milan or at the most to Como." In short, a continuous stream of witticism. It is an ironic mood that spills over into enjoyment of being provocative. "We will move out of the splendid building in Via Venti Settembre, that houses the Budget and the Treasury Ministries and transform it into a beautiful museum like the Louvre or the Prado. It would not even be necessary to move the furniture. Giancarlo Pagliarini's desk is already there," the minister ironically added, "it is a pity that there is also the chair that belonged to Cirino Pomicino." Jokes apart, Pagliarini then confided that he was in favor of moving the economic ministries to the North. "However, it can only be a feasible project in the medium term," he specified, "let us say in about 10 years." As regards the people who work in Via Venti Settembre, "the problem can be resolved by freezing the turnover, and in any case by avoiding traumatic solutions." Vito Gnutti, who is responsible for industry, was more cautious. He also began by laughing: "What do you people from LA REPUBBLICA do? Are you mind readers?" [Lonardi] So you confirm the project. [Gnutti] It is a good idea to open a branch of the economic ministries in the North. I willingly accept the suggestion that your paper made. [Lonardi] So, Minister Gnutti, have you already chosen to house the Milan Industry, Finance, and Budget Ministries' offices on Via Manin? [Gnutti] In my dreams there is the hypothesis of opening some offices in the North. I repeat: You have read my mind. However, there have been no meetings on this subject with my colleagues, the other ministers. [Lonardi] Did you not meet Pagliarini for dinner at a restaurant in EUR [Rome suburb] a few evenings ago to celebrate the new government? [Gnutti] It may seem strange, but when we meet for dinner we do not talk politics. [Lonardi] However, you quite like the idea of opening a branch in the North. [Gnutti] I do not deny that at all. It forms part of our idea of a "network capital." [Lonardi] Could you explain this better. [Gnutti] Federalism can be understood in various ways. There is no law that says that all the ministries must be in Rome. Therefore, they could be scattered over various regions of the country. [Lonardi] Are you convinced that this is the best solution? [Gnutti] No, I like the idea of a "network capital." This means that the ministries must be as close as possible to the people. The risk to be taken is that of decentralization. [Lonardi] And then? [Gnutti] On the one hand, the offices must be where the people need them. Even in the South clearly, in Palermo rather than in Naples. [Lonardi] And on the other hand? [Gnutti] On the other hand, there is the solution offered by computer science, that allows offices to be connected in a "network," even if they are far apart. I will shortly be holding a meeting on the computerization of the offices here at the ministry. I think that this is a very important subject. [Lonardi] Let us go back to Via Manin. Do you not think that it is a suitable location for the Industry Ministry in the North? [Gnutti] If you really want to know, the UUPPICA [Provincial Offices of Industry, Commerce, and Crafts] offices at every chamber of commerce are already a branch of the Industry Ministry.
