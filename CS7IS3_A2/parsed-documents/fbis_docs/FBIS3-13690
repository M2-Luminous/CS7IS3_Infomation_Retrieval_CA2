The root causes of this conflict are so complex that numerous previous initiatives have failed to arrive at a peaceful settlement. We must not allow that to happen again, but let us all give peace a chance. Meanwhile, the long drawn out conflict has cost thousands of lives and led to immeasurable suffering for many more. I have always held the view that we in Africa must not remain passive and wait for outsiders to seek solutions for problems within our continent. Brothers: We ourselves should take an active role in finding solutions to problems in our continent whether they are political, military, economic or social. [Word indistinct] (?let) all of us assembled here today reiterate our commitment to the noble but difficult task of searching for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Finally and out of this initiative let peace come to the Sudan." At the end the meeting, a statement was released and read by Kenya's minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation, Mr. Kalonzo Musyoka: [Musyoka] "The IGADD committee met with His Excellency General 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir, president of the republic of the Sudan, and subsequently met the leaders of the two SPLM/SPLA factions, Dr. John Garang and Dr. Riak Machar, and conducted intensive consultations within itself and the parties concerned and agreed to launch the IGADD peace talks on the Sudan. The committee and the parties to the conflict agreed that pursuant to the mandate given by the meeting of the IGADD summit held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 6th and 7th September 1993, the negotiations shall take into consideration the previous efforts in search of a solution to the conflict, namely talks held in August 1989 in Addis Ababa, December 1989 in Nairobi, May-June 1992 and April-May 1993 in Abuja and May 1993 in Nairobi. The committee expressed serious concern at the continued human suffering, misery, famine and disease in the war-affected areas. It was agreed that the parties to the conflict shall allow access to relief agencies to ensure that relief assistance is delivered to suffering people in those areas. The committee also expressed deep concern that the long-drawn [out] conflict was a threat to peace and security in the sub-region. In reference to the stated commitment to the IGADD peace initiative, including their readiness to immediately embark on negotiations, the parties to the conflict agreed to send to the peace talks high-level delegations with full mandates to negotiate. The committee called upon the parties concerned to the conflict to exercise restraint and desist from escalating hostilities, including actions that might jeopardize the IGADD initiative, in order to create a conducive atmosphere for conduct of negotiations. The IGADD committee decided the standing committee of ministers of foreign affairs shall conduct the peace negotiations under the supervision of the chairman of the IGADD committee and directed the standing committee to start the negotiating process immediately. The IGADD committee further appealed to the international community to continue supporting the initiative. I thank you Your Excellencies."
