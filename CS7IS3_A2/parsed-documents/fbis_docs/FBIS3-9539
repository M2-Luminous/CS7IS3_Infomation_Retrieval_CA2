Thirty six percent thought it was not very urgent, while 21 percent saw no problem at all. 13 percent did not know. Among inhabitants of Moravia and Silesia, the figure seeing the issue as very urgent or urgent rose to 37 percent, while in Bohemia it was 26 percent. When the results of previous polls are compared, fewer and fewer people are seeing the problem of local government as urgent. In Bohemia, 24 percent want a system which includes a division on the level of the "lands" of Bohemia and Moravia-Silesia, while in Moravia 40 percent are for such a solution. Meanwhile, sixty-nine percent of the republic's inhabitants think there are far more important tasks at present than that of local government arrangements. 20 percent do not agree with this statement, and 11 percent do not know. Fifty-four percent said they still did not understand the problem, and 51 percent said they were not very interested. * * * Another IVVM poll, conducted between January 7 and 13 also among 885 respondents, asked people's opinions on other aspects of local government, including taxation. 58 percent said that if higher local administrative units were created that people would pay more taxes, while 21 percent disagreed and a further 21 percent did not know. If the higher local administrative units were formed, 58 percent thought that districts (the second tier in the present system) should be preserved, 26 percent thought they should not be, and 16 percent did not know. According to 44 percent, the most important thing was that Moravia did not pay for Bohemia, 39 percent did not agree and 17 did not know. The opinion that the creation of higher local administrative units would help central government to function better was expressed by 42 percent. 30 percent did not agree with this, and 28 percent did not know. Seventy-eight percent agreed with the statement that local government reform was only talked about and nothing was being done. 68 percent said they believed that politicians were not so much interested in the issue itself as in trying to reap political benefits from the problem. 63 percent said they believed politicians did not actually know which solution would be best. Thirty five percent said they thought the ODS [Civic Democratic Party] was holding up local government reform unnecessarily.
