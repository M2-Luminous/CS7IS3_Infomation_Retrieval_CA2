An NP statement on Sunday quoted news reports as saying some sales in this connection had already been approved by the Transkei cabinet. "This is exactly the kind of corruption which thrives under military dictatorships." General Holomisa should immediately and publicly state if these allegations were true and what his role was in the affair, the NP said. "If these allegations are true it will confirm our suspicion of massive abuse of power by the Holomisa government."
