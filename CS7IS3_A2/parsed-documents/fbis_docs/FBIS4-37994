Our brave Armed Forces confronted these [word indistinct] desperate offensive attempts which have not inflicted any worthwhile losses on our forces, but have caused losses among the innocent civilian population -- from among the children, women and old men -- as a result of the barbaric, random bombardment of the residential quarters. During today's battles, which continue even as we prepare this communique, the enemy incurred the following losses: the destruction of 12 tanks and three hostile military teams, and hundreds of dead and wounded among the enemy's ranks. Our forces' morale is high. God is Great.
