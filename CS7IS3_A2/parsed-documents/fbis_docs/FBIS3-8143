Entz, who attended an assembly of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH), pointed out discrepancies in statements by Premier Vladimir Meciar who speaks about his intention to conclude a peace agreement with Hungary on the one hand, but warns against the danger of Hungarian capital in southern Slovakia on the other hand. Entz said that improvement in Hungarian-Slovak relations was hampered mainly by the unwillingness of the Slovak Government and political parties to discuss common problems and to solve the status of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. He also met with Slovak President Michal Kovac with whom he shares "many" views, as he put it. He praised Kovac's open support for some demands of the Hungarian minority the fulfillment of which was also recommended by the Council of Europe when it was admitting Slovakia as its member last June. Kovac supports the Hungarians' demands for bilingual sign posts to be placed in communities with a mixed population and the use of Hungarian female surnames without the Slovak suffix -ova.
