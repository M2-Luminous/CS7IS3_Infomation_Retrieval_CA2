The news on the first channel of the French television that the Muslims committed the crime at the Sarajevo market sounds cynical. It arrived, as always, after everything [sentence as heard]. Russia has finally stepped on the international political scene and -- through offensive diplomacy at a very delicate moment -- stopped the militant West. The Russian initiative, whose author is President Yeltsin with his closest associates, would not have worked, of course, had it not been met with full cooperation by the Serb side. The triumph of Russian policy over the Western arms should not only be temporary. As a serious country with serious policies, Russia has now imposed on itself certain obligations. Does that mean there will be a new balance of power? Is this the beginning of a new era in international relations with the new -- that is, old -- Russian factor? According to CNN, 80 percent of the Russians in a poll opposed the bombing of Serb positions. Again, according to CNN, 60 percent of the Russians believe that an attack on the Serbs is an attack on Russia. The Russian Church also opposes air strikes against Serb positions. Patriarch (Aleksey) II said that even the thought of air strikes must be rejected. Of course, the Russian initiative contains the views of Serbia's policy, since -- as we could see -- Vitaliy Churkin, as Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, spent most of his time in talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. So Serbia and the Serb republic, or rather the Serb side, has been providing evidence of the continuity of their peace-loving policy. We will soon see whether the United States will use its influence on the Muslim side, not only at this time but also in the future. Izetbegovic promised that the Muslim artillery would also be moved and silenced. This is a promise that will mean nothing unless there is clear insistence on that by the international community, particularly the United States, as pointed out two days ago by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. The Russian minister stressed the obligations facing the Muslim side. Russia has done its bit, now it is the turn of the United States. The new peace negotiations will begin, no doubt, with new territorial demands by the Muslim side. All this has been staged for that reason, to strengthen the negotiating position of the Muslims -- from the event on the Sarajevo market to the threat of air strikes. The threat of sanctions against Croatia, of course, remain in the media shadow of these events. Croatia was told to withdraw its army from Bosnia by 17 February, as Butrus-Ghali reminded. However, it is hard to believe that Germany and its bloc, which is still very powerful, will allow sanctions to be introduced against Croatia. That would be yet another example of inconsistency and double standards of the international community toward the protagonists in the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Those who wanted to could have seen once again that had it been up to the Serb side, the war would have stopped a long time ago.
