FR940805-1-00054 FR940805-1-00013 Friday August 5, 1994 Part II Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs 25 CFR Part 10 Standards for Adult and Juvenile Detention, Community Residential, and Holding Facilities and Programs; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 150␣/␣Friday, August 5, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Indian Affairs 25 CFR Part 10 RIN 1076&hyph;AC80 Standards for Adult and Juvenile Detention, Community Residential, and Holding Facilities and Programs AGENCY: Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Indian Affairs is proposing to establish standards for governing Indian adult and juvenile detention, holding and community residential facilities and programs. The current detention regulations are over 20 years old and extremely limited. The proposed changes will cover all pertinent issues governing detention, holding and community residential services. The standards will increase the Bureau of Indian Affair's capability to provide Indian tribes the direction to administer constitutionally sound detention, holding and community residential programs. It will also provide the Bureau of Indian Affairs the key to prevent and combat potential lawsuits. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be directed to the Chief, Division of Law Enforcement, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1849 C Street, N.W., Mail Stop 1308, Washington, D.C. 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Warren LeBeau, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Telephone: 202&hyph;208&hyph;5786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Detention standards published in 25 CFR 11.305 have not been modified for sixteen years, do not address current detention problems, and are inconsistent with current acceptable detention practices and other regulations. They fail to address code compliance and related physical plant issues, and lack options to allow for alternative types of detention programs. The need for more detailed and contemporary standards has been intensified by the provision of funding for detention programs under Pub. L. 99&hyph;570. Earlier attempts to develop standards based on those of the American Correctional Association failed to address the specific issues and concerns of BIA and tribal detention programs. They were not tailored to meet the needs of a Native American population and did not reflect the environment in which BIA and tribal detention programs operate. As a result, these standards were not promulgated. Development of Regulations It is the policy of the Bureau to provide opportunities for input from those who will be affected by these regulations. A multi-agency task force was assembled to develop the first draft of these standards. The agencies represented included representatives from Division of Law Enforcement Central Office, Area Office Supervisory Criminal Investigators, Unit Criminal Investigators, detention staff, and Indian Health Service programs; the task force also included a member with prior experience in tribal detention programs. Additional internal reviews were conducted at the Area and Agency level. Interested parties are asked to submit written comments, suggestions and objections to these proposed rules. Supplementary Information The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed rule to the locations identified in the Addresses section of this document.
