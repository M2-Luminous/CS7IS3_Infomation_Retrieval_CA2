He expressed the hope that, in the years to come, all Hungarian deputies would adopt a more responsible attitude toward the 15 million Hungarians and would continue without disruption to implement the consolidated [jednotna] Hungarian policy. In the opinion of Duray, one can therefore "rightly expect that each Hungarian government will consider it its duty to support ideas formulated by the legitimate representatives of Hungarians living abroad, in the same way Antall's government did." In contrast to other ethnic Hungarian politicians, Duray addressed his congratulations to all parliamentary parties and not to the chairman of the victorious Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).
