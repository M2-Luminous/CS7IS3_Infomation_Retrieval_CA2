The chetniks knew that -- upon seeing the large number of killed and badly wounded people at the Markale market -- the U.S. Government would immediately hold an extraordinary session and that the demands by the international community for air strikes against the positions of Karadzic's Serbs would become more urgent. They not only decided to lob the shell on the place where most of the Sarelians gather, but they did it deliberately, following a detailed project concocted not in Pale, of course, but in Belgrade. So what was the real motive for this crime? This is the topic of today's editorial commentary. [Unidentified commentator] Some believe that this was a desperate move, as all the chetnik offensives have been crushed, and the Croatian Council in Sarajevo (has broken off ties) with Mate Boban, Karadzic's main ally in the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Others believe that this was an attempt to provoke our negotiators into giving up in Geneva. [sentence as heard] Others -- and most foreigners are in this group -- believe that this is the culmination of the psychological pressure exerted on Sarelians to give up further resistance. The majority of people, however, believe that this was really a manipulation with the Serbs, this time devilishly planned. Such a monstrous crime in front of the entire world community is meant to cut off any retreat that the forcefully mobilized youths in Karadzic's army might have, youths who have realized what a bloody mess they have been forced into. The message to them is: Try to go over to the other side. After such a crime, the Muslims will slaughter you. There is, of course, no need to mention that this shell, just like all the previous ones fired at Sarajevo, wanted to provoke hatred and retaliation against the Serbs who are Bosnian patriots, particularly those in Sarajevo. These Serbs have shown the world that coexistence is possible; the entire concept of greater Serbia collapsed on that. Analysts say that Milosevic, Karadzic, and the rest of their gang hate no one as much as they do these honorable and proud people. However, even though all these reasons stand, the main reason is of a political nature. Milosevic has promised the impoverished, hungry, and miserable Serbians that the sanctions will be lifted soon and that normal life will resume. Now he has to tell them that the worst is yet to come. Since the Serbian regime and their puppets in Pale will never voluntarily return the territories laid to waste through an act of genocide and give up new conquests and crimes, the tightening of sanctions is inevitable, while air strikes against their positions still remain a possibility. Try to put yourselves in the shoes of the Serbian rulers now when they have to explain to the people who is to be blamed for their catastrophic situation. Since the rulers of the fascist regime treat their subjects as if they were mentally retarded, their explanation is: Well, see, the Muslims have again massacred their own people and caused the wrath of the international community against the Serbs. That was how they explained the introduction of the sanctions. According to them, the sanctions had nothing to do with Serbia's aggression, massacres of defenseless people by the heavily armed Serb army, concentration camps, and the mass liquidation of camp inmates. According to them, the sanctions were imposed after the allegedly plotted massacre of one own's people on Vase Miskina Street in May 1992. The circle of lies, deceits, and crimes of the greater Serbian fascists is now closed, and the Markale market and the scene of the Vase Miskina Street massacre are near each other, very near. They are barely 100 meters apart, and they will be a monument to the evil, brutality, and corruption of this new type of fascism. Symbolically, this is an act much stronger than the burning of the Reich Stag and the false Polish attack on the German border post, as engineered by Hitler's Nazis.
