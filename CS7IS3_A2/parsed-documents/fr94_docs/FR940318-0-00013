FR940318-0-00013 FR940318-0-00003 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 264b [Docket No. R&hyph;0833] Rules Regarding Foreign Gifts and Decorations AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Final rule SUMMARY: Congress has permitted Federal government employees to accept from foreign governments gifts of travel or expense for travel taking place entirely outside of the United States of more than minimal value. The Board's Rules Regarding Foreign Gifts and Decorations provide that requests for Board approval of the acceptance of such expenses must be submitted to the Vice Chairman of the Board. The rules do not specify who should act upon such requests in the absence of the Vice Chairman, or in situations where the position of Vice Chairman is vacant. Accordingly, this rule will authorize the Board's Administrative Governor to act on requests for Board approval of these expenses when the Vice Chairman if unavailable.
