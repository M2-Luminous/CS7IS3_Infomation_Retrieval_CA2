FR940526-0-00017 FR940526-0-00007 There are approximately 150 producers of Southeastern potatoes under this marketing order, and approximately 60 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Southeastern potato producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period was prepared by the Southeastern Potato Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Southeastern potatoes. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of Southeastern potatoes, based on last season's crop of approximately 1,335,000 hundredweight. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. The Committee met April 20, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $11,000, the same as last year. Major expense items include $6,800 for Committee staff salaries and $900 for travel expenses. The Committee also recommended an assessment rate of $0.0075 per hundredweight, $0.0025 less than last season's rate. Planting for the 1994-95 crop season has not been completed. However, the manager estimates shipments will generate about $7,000 in assessment income. This, along with funds from the Committee's $15,000 reserve, will be adequate to cover the expenses incurred. Funds remaining at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal period should be about the maximum permitted by the order of approximately one fiscal period's expenses. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the fiscal period begins on June 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessable Irish potatoes handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
