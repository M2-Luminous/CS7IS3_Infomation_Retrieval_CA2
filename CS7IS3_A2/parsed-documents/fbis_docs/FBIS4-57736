It is entitled "FSLN Position With Regard to Relations With the U.S. Government." It does not say with the U.S. people but, rather, with the U.S. Government. The language used in the Program Commission's proposal is very selective. However, I believe that, in general terms, it essentially explains the positions we must assume in this new international situation and in this new era that people are now experiencing. Nicaraguans, not to mention Latin Americans, must be clear about the reasons for assuming an anti-imperialist position. It was not a coincidence that when the FSLN was founded, Carlos Fonseca proposed that it only be called the Sandinist National Liberation Front in the face of other proposals to call it the National Liberation Front and other names. When our founder and leader was asked why he wanted it to be called the Sandinist National Liberation Front, he explained that it was not only named after Sandino, who was a hero to the world, Latin America, and Nicaragua, but that it was also named after the anti-imperialist content of Sandino's struggle. In this way, we were recording, and recording forever, the anti-imperialist content of the Nicaraguan people's struggle. Years passed, and time and time again we relived a history of aggression from U.S. administrations. Nicaraguan history is basically a history of U.S. intervention. It is a history that produced Zeledon and Sandino and, to a great extent, produced the FSLN. The United States imposed Anastasio Somoza and his criminal dictatorship which lasted several decades, and, in turn, the Nicaraguans' revolutionary and popular struggle resulted from this imposition. We must ask ourselves: What kind of relations do we want with the United States? Do we want a relationship of enmity and confrontation? On the contrary, we want a friendly and harmonious relationship with the United States. Nevertheless, this friendly and harmonious relationship does not depend on us. It is important to remember that we are not ones who caused harm. Instead, we were the victims. It is important to remember that we never attacked the United States; it attacked us. It is not true that we can forget our history. He who forgets his history forgets himself. The essence of a people lies in their history. If we want to substantially improve our relations with the United States, we cannot forget the history of U.S. aggression against Nicaragua. [applause]
