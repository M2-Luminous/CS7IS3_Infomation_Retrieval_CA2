SUMMARY: The Commission, at the request of James Phillips, allots Channel 240A to Athens, Ohio, as the community's second local commercial FM channel. Channel 240A can be allotted to Athens in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles) east-northeast, at coordinates North Latitude 39&hyph;22&hyph;08 and West Longitude 81&hyph;58&hyph;42, to avoid short-spacings to Station WHOK, Channel 238B, Lancaster, Ohio, and Station WKWS, Channel 241B, Charleston, West Virginia.
