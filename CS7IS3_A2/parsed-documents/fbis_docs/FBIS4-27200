"I do not have any vengeance (against the LDP) at all. Such an option is possible," Hata told the House of Representatives Budget Committee. Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core party in the ruling coalition, was responding to an LDP questioner who urged the prime minister to consider the possibility of "forming a conservative coalition with the LDP" by giving up any vengeful feelings he may still hold toward the party. However, Hata quickly added his reservations over the proposal, saying, "if we put priority on forcing political stability alone, it would not change Japan's politics." Japan "needs to go through the process of devastating the vestiges of the (LDP's) long hold on power," he said. The premier made the comments as his minority government is facing a possible no-confidence motion by either the LDP or the Social Democratic Party that could scuttle his minority government. The minority coalition accounts for 178 out of the 511-seat lower chamber. Shinseito has a parliamentary strength of 61. If combined with the 206 LDP legislators, such a conservative alliance would hold 267 seats -- well above the majority. The mass defection of former LDP members who later formed Shinseito stripped the LDP of its majority in the lower chamber last June, putting an end to the party's 38-year grip on power. In a related development, Hata expressed his willingness to hold separate summit talks with the leaders of the opposition parties. "I am always ready. I am so even before or after the parliamentary passage of the (state) budget," he told a group of reporters in the Diet building.
