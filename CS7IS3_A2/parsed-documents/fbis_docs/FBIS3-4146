The 560 representatives passed a plan to remove cultural and religious obstacles barring women from participating in politics and encouraged women's participation in legislation and policy-making. The six-day meeting which ended Saturday also produced a declaration providing standards for free and fair elections. Such standards, the first the international community has ever defined, would serve as a basis for any national election and a guide for international observers. The parliamentarians also called on the international community to review the structure of the United Nations to give it a wider world role and more power to prevent conflicts. The meeting also urged all nations to commit to the cause of environmental preservation and the tightening of controls on hazardous waste. They also urged efforts toward the overall prohibition of the production of fissionable materials and nuclear testing. Burundi, Macedonia, the Comoros, Zaire and the Central African Republic became members of the Interparliamentary Union, enlarging its membership to 129 nations. The next session will be held in Copenhagen this September 12-17.
