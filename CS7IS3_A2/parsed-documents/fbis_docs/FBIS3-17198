Cities Refuse Expensive Goods"] [Text] The domestic food market has already reacted to the recent increase in import tariffs. In fact, there is no demand at the moment for the supply of food that is now much dearer and no one is in a hurry to conclude contracts on new terms. At the Moscow government food resources department I was shown tenders for the supply of food from a number of Russian regions. The suppliers instantly assessed the situation that arose after the Russian Government introduced higher import tariffs and they immediately jacked up the prices of the products they supply. Above all we are talking about livestock products. For instance, Smolensk is prepared to supply the capital with 100 tonnes of butter at 3,700 rubles [R] per kilogram, and then another 50 tonnes, but this time at R4,200; Vologda named more or less the same prices, while Voronezh raised butter prices to R5,000. The asking price of poultry has shot even higher -- 30 percent above the average world level. And this depite the fact that unlike imported chickens, which have been drawn and wrapped in cellophane, our suppliers can only provide partly drawn chickens, which will not keep for long. IZVESTIYA's own correspondents report that you find a similar situation in other Russian regions, with suppliers asking similar prices. But just as in Moscow, purchasing agents everywhere are in no hurry to buy food at those prices. Conclusion of contracts has been suspended everywhere. We can see why. In the first place, as the city authorities told our correspondents, at these prices the structure of supply and demand is bound to change, since the population's ability to pay is limited, so there have to be major adjustments in purchasing levels. Second, there are substantial stocks of food everywhere -- in inflationary conditions purchasing agents try to make these stocks as secure as possible, so now there is no need to rush into new contracts. Finally, everyone is very confident that the president will cancel or at any rate amend the decree -- its adverse consequences for Russian consumers are too obvious.
