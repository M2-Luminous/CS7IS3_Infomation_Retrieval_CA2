According to exact data, after pointing an automatic rifle at the chest of 21-year-old Albanian citizen Alfred Abaz Muco, a resident of Bubullime in Lushnje, a Greek soldier opened fire with no reason at all, causing his death. The note stresses among other things that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania protests this ugly and tragic act, pointing out that such actions impair Albanian-Greek relations, create an unjustified situation of tension, and run counter to international norms and statements by the Greek authorities. The note asks the Greek Government to give the necessary explanations about the circumstances of the event and take measures to condemn the culprits and prevent the repetition of such actions,which have occurred even in the past.
