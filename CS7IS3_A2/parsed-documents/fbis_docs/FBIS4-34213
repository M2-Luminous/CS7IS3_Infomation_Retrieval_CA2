"The Brazilian economic stabilization program meets the political and economic demands of openness and fiscal balance which are essential to correct the serious distortions caused by the high interest rate we are enduring," President Itamar said. In reply to those who say that the economic measures are aimed at helping Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy for president of the Republic, President Itamar took the opportunity to point out that the economic plan "is not aimed at short-term goals; it attempts to make the Brazilian people recover their confidence in the future." Meanwhile, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said during an interview that it is not enough for Brazil to follow a correct path to consolidate the economic plan. "The international environment should also be favorable," he said. Amorim today commented ironically on an article published in the Colombian press which stated that Brazil is the inflation champ in the American continent. He said: "That is so only until 1 July," after which he added that in two, three, or four months the situation of Brazil will be privileged. Amorim added that despite the high inflation, one-third of foreign investments in Latin America are invested in Brazil, even before the economy stabilizes. In his speech, President Itamar mentioned the government measures to make the state efficient. "The people and the government are united with the same determination. We no longer permit the antiethical behavior that threatened the foundations of civilian society," the president said. Franco said that the economic plan is entering a decisive stage and that it will soon establish a new macroeconomic standard in the country. During his speech, Itamar took the opportunity to enumerate the accomplishments of his administration during the past 18 months. He mentioned that the Brazilian GDP increased by 5 percent last year and that the same rhythm of growth will be maintained this year. Brazilian foreign trade is experiencing an unprecedented openness. "We abolished all the non-tariff barriers on imports; we reduced the average import tax from 54 percent to 14 percent." The president also mentioned the exchange reserves which amount to approximately $38 billion, the 76 million tonne agricultural harvest, and the 9.6 percent industrial recovery. He also mentioned the Brazilian foreign debt agreement with the international financial community. For Franco, "stability is not an objective by itself." He added: "The resumption of growth cannot be isolated from policies that comprise a social dimension." According to Itamar, the benefits of modernization should reach everyone. "Social exclusion, poverty, and hunger must be eliminated from our countries and the world, because the presence of these evils weakens our society and undermines international cohesion," he said. President Itamar also directly alluded to the 3 October elections: "During a pre-election period, which must yield important results for the future of Brazil, we are witnessing a process of political maturity among our citizens, with the certainty that democratic conviction will be the great winner in this electoral dispute," he said.
