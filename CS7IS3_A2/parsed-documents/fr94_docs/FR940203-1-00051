FR940203-1-00051 FR940203-1-00010 VA also found that the weight of the available evidence indicates that chemically-induced respiratory cancers manifest within a definite period following exposure, after which there is little effect from the exposure (Finkelstein M.M., 1991. Use of ``time windows'' to investigate lung cancer latency intervals at an Ontario steel plant. American Journal of Industrial Medicine 19:299&hyph;235). In our judgment, it is reasonable to assume that respiratory cancers due to herbicide exposure will show a risk pattern similar to other chemically-induced respiratory cancers, and we are proposing as part of our rule that respiratory cancer will be presumed service connected only if it is manifest within 30 years after exposure. The longest manifestation period noted for a respiratory cancer following herbicide exposure is about 30 years (Zach J.A., Suskind R.R. 1980. The mortality experience of workers exposed to tetrachlorodibenzodioxin in a trichlorophenol process accident. Journal of Occupational Medicine 22:11&hyph;14; Zober A., Messerer P., Huber P. 1990. Thirty-four year mortality follow-up of BASF employees to 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD after the 1953 accident. Occupational Environmental Health 62:139&hyph;157). If future studies indicate that this manifestation period is inappropriate, VA will amend it accordingly. We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a) and 3.309(e) to implement the Secretary's decision. This amendment is proposed to be effective the date of publication of the final rule, as provided by Public Law 102&hyph;4. 38 U.S.C. 1113 provides that where there is affirmative evidence to the contrary, or evidence to establish that an intercurrent injury or disease which is a recognized cause of any of the diseases for which presumptive service connection may be allowed under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1112 (i.e., chronic diseases, tropical diseases, prisoner-of-war related diseases, or diseases specific to radiation-exposed veterans), has been suffered between the date of separation from service and the onset of any such diseases, or the disability is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct, presumptive service connection will not be in order. Section 2(b) of public law 102&hyph;4 amends 38 U.S.C. 1113 so that its provisions also apply to the presumptive conditions associated with herbicide exposure under 38 U.S.C. 1116. Consequently, service connection for multiple myeloma or respiratory cancers based on herbicide exposure is precluded if there is affirmative evidence that establishes a non-service related supervening condition or event as the cause of the multiple myeloma or respiratory cancers, or the disability is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct (See 38 U.S.C. 1113). The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. The Secretary has determined that it is not feasible to allow the 60 day comment period referred to in section 6(a)(1) of Executive Order 12866 because a comment period of that length would prevent VA from complying with the statutory requirement to publish a final rule within 90 days of publication of the proposed rule imposed by 38 U.S.C. 1116(c)(2).
