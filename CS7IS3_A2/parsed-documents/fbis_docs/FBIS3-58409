He urged caution and was supported by Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who warned Britain was "not enthusiastic" about a policy of extending the threat of air strikes. Mr. Major's tone in the Commons appeared more cautious than when NATO leaders agreed to the Anglo-French proposal to threaten airpower to break the Serbs' refusal to allow a Dutch force to replace 300 Canadian troops in Srebrenica and reopen Tuzla airport. He said local cooperation from the three warring factions was vital if the aid operation was to succeed. This was a primary factor to be taken into account before deciding if any military action needs to be taken. "It is very easy to say that it is an easy decision and that all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or two and all is well," he said. "I have to say to those who readily advocate that course without careful thought that it may well not be a wise policy. It may be a necessary policy at some stage -- but it is a policy that should be entered into with very considerable caution." Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath issued a firm warning against air strikes, arguing they could suck Britain into the civil war and bring retaliation. "My own decision would be not to bomb," he said. However, the French were much more bullish, with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe warning NATO "meant business" when it pledged to open Tuzla airport and relieve the beleaguered Canadian peacekeepers in the Srebrenica Muslim enclave. French Defence Minister Francois Leotard agreed on a plan to reopen Tuzla with his Swedish counterpart Anders Bjorck as most of the troops in the city are from Sweden. UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali ordered a preliminary study of NATO's overt threat of air strikes if the Serbs continue to thwart the UN efforts in Srebrenica and Tuzla. He asked Yasushi Akashi, his special representative in the former Yugoslavia, to lead the study and report to a high-level meeting of UN officials in the Swiss city of Geneva on Monday. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] said senior military officials including the overall commander, French General Jean Cot, were analysing NATO's declaration and drawing up proposals to relieve Srebrenica and Tuzla with the help of air power. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was meeting the new commander of the 12,000 UN peacekeeping troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A spokesman at the Foreign Office described Mr. Hurd's meeting with Lieutenant-General Sir Mike Rose as "introductory." British defence officials said Britain's aircrews in the region were ready to go if the call to action comes. "We have been out there for a long time," said one official. "We are trained, highly capable and ready to respond to any decision to go." A powerful allied force of strike and fighter aircraft has been gathered at air bases in Italy and on carriers in the Adriatic. Britain has six Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard Invincible, nine RAF Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del Colle in Italy with three more available in the UK.
