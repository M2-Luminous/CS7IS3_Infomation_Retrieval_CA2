SOS!... SOS!..." rubric: "`I Do Not Want To Live in Somalia....': One Year Has Passed. What Has Changed?"] [Text] One year ago to the day, our newspaper published an article under this title, which discussed the importation of toxic waste to Ukraine. Western "toxic intervention" may entail terrifying consequences, of which the experience of countries such as Somalia or Romania testifies in particular. Oleksiy Kabyka, chief of the Project for the Prevention of Toxic Trade of the Ukrainian chapter of Greenpeace, continues the discussion of the subject. In January 1993, 230 tonnes of extremely dangerous, chemically toxic substances, which were declared as "construction materials" and "products of the chemical industry," were imported to Ukraine from Germany. These facts were revealed by the associates of the Ukrainian chapter of the international nongovernmental organization Greenpeace. The freight was shipped by the German companies Rimeks and Hannolora Zibrans to the address of the small private enterprise Podillya in Rivne. Rimeks is doing its semilegal business by exporting waste, various old chemicals, and chemicals unfit for use from the territory of the former East Germany to the countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS. Incidentally, of the three founders of the company which was established in June 1992, two, Serhiy Furs and Pavlo Shmaliy, were our countrymen. The amount of the contract came to 50,000 Deutsche marks. Under the contract, Podillya and Rimeks were to receive 25 percent of the profits each, and 50 percent was to be used to establish a joint venture. Doubts as to the conformity of the freight to declarations and contracts arose immediately after its shipment to Rivne. As Yudovich, the commercial director of the small private enterprise Podillya, stated, "We did not even have an idea that all of this, putting it mildly, trash would be delivered." Besides, it came out that part of the freight had not been declared at all--three drums (approximately 180 kilograms) of metallic mercury waste had been smuggled in. The Security Service of Ukraine instituted criminal proceedings precisely on account of the mercury smuggling. For three months, all freight was stored in the compound of the Rivne Avtotrans Enterprise. The liquid leaked from the drums and even dissolved asphalt. It came close to starting a fire during cleaning at a warehouse where dangerous chemical reagents were stored: White phosphorus, which was being stored together with other substances, self-ignited. In early May, the bulk of the freight was moved to the compound of a military unit. Some 10-12 tonnes of rusty drums with dried-up paint and varnish, old canisters, and containers for solvents and other chemicals were piled up in the open air. To reduce the stench at least a little, servicemen poured water on them daily, which washed the substances into the ground. The most toxic and dangerous part of the freight is being kept at a large warehouse, where drums are stored along with military materiel. A second case of self-ignition of chemical reagents has already been registered. Fortunately, there was no explosion or fire--the servicemen smothered the flames with sand and dragged the drum that had caught fire out of the warehouse. Drums with mercury and pesticides are still being stored in the compound of Avtotrans in containers. Following the discovery of dangerous substances among the freight, it became an urgent necessity to conduct a competent ecological expert review. Having grasped the entire danger after the previous inspection of the freight, Ukrainian Greenpeace resolved to conduct a more thorough review. It was carried out with the resources of a special radiological-toxicological laboratory and with the participation of professional German chemists from the scientific section of Greenpeace. The results indicated that the substances in question are indeed toxic (danger levels 1 through 3) and pose a danger not only to the health but also to the lives of people. The listing of the freight includes dozens of items, in particular chemical reagents that are stored in 87 drums and constitute the most dangerous part of the freight. This includes poisons such as sodium cyanide, arsenic and mercury compounds, and other extremely toxic substances. On the territory of Nikolayev Oblast, Greenpeace activists have revealed the locations of the storage and burial of toxic waste from Germany that was imported to Ukraine between 28 November 1992 and 15 March 1993 through Ochakov and Nikolayev. More than 100 tonnes of these dangerous substances were imported by the German companies Hayns Ryulikh Agency, Hannelore Zibrands, and, once again, Rimeks, to the address of the Nikolayev scientific-production association Pivdenagrokompleks and the Ochakov Opttorg under the guise of construction materials and chemical industry products. The substances in question were examined by a Greenpeace mobile laboratory. The results of the examination showed that these chemicals were unsuitable for any use, and that a considerable proportion of them were toxic and hazardous to human health. More than 10 people saw a doctor with symptoms of poisoning after using out-of-date paint which contained a considerable concentration of heavy metals. Eight drums with an unknown oily liquid were dumped and spilled in a forest stand close to the village of Solyani, Nikolayev Oblast. About 80 broken flasks with the depiction of a skull and crossbones were found at the same location. The grass and forest around had already turned yellow. In order to attract attention to these facts, members of Greenpeace, wearing gas masks and gray chemical protection gear, chained themselves close to the German Embassy, together with four drums carrying the danger sign, the inscription "Toxic," and the names of cities in Ukraine where dangerous substances imported from Germany have already been found. Similar surprises do not arrive only from that direction. An old American liner, the United States, whose structures hold close to 300,000 square meters of asbestos bulkheads and ceilings and about 143 tons of powder insulation from asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance, is currently moored at the port of Sevastopol, awaiting the final decision of a commission concerning its future. According to a plan of the ship's owner, Kakhraman Sadikogly, all dangerous materials on the ship, including asbestos, should be removed in Sevastopol. After the United States is cleansed, it will be returned to Turkey. Three weeks ago, this "floating coffin" was expelled from Turkey after protest actions by Greenpeace, local ecological movements, trade unions, and the government of the country. Turkey did not accept the ship, taking into account possible ecological consequences and the potential danger of asbestos removal work, which calls for special conditions to protect the health of the workers. The danger of asbestos, a needle-shaped crystal which may split into the thinnest of fibers, physically affects cells, which brings about cancerous diseases. Asbestos dust entering the lungs and the digestive tract is deposited there and brings about mesothelioma, asbestosis, peritonitis, and cancer of the pleura. Even contact with a person who has been working with asbestos is dangerous to those around him. The city authorities of Sevastopol, which already suffers from difficult ecological problems, are cynically preparing a slow death from cancer for the residents of the city. Measures to completely ban the use of asbestos are being taken in many Western countries, where the danger posed by it has been fully recognized. For example, Sweden and Denmark already have legislation that rules out any use of asbestos. According to even the Ukrainian standards, asbestos dust, along with hydrocyanic acid, are considered Class 1 dangerous substances. Greenpeace is demanding that the German Government and the owner of the United States take timely measures to take back from Ukraine the dangerous waste. Ukraine needs a complete legislative ban on the importation of waste from abroad in order to prevent such scandalous cases and problems in the future. When this article was ready to be printed, it became known that German toxic waste experts had finally arrived in Ukraine. They visited the locations of the storage of German waste in various regions of the republic and examined them. The conclusion drawn by the experts is that the waste should be processed locally, i.e., in Ukraine. Greenpeace does not agree with this, and demands that the waste be shipped back. On 17 November, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed the Decree on the Provisional Statute for the Issuance of Permits for the Importation of Recyclable Raw Materials and Waste Replacing Them to the Territory of Ukraine. The establishment of a catalog of the groups of substances and materials classified as dangerous wastes which will be banned from import to Ukraine is envisioned. This legislative act gives us hope that such incidents will be impossible in the future.
