The topic of their talks was the establishment of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. What are their impressions upon return to Mostar? Zdenko Vranjes has a report: [Vranjes] The Croat-Bosniak federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to get its government at a session of the constitutive assembly on 22 June in Sarajevo. The constitution is to be changed at that session in order to regulate the constitutional status of mixed cantons in the Neretva river valley and central Bosnia which have been agreed upon in Vienna. These are just some of the next steps to be taken in the pursuance of establishing the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. In order to provide complete protection of the Croat interests in all this, there should be maximum unity of the Croat deputies ought to exist. It is precisely for this unity that the Herceg-Bosna government assessed their talks with President Tudjman as exceptionally important. What did the Zagreb talks focus on and what are the results of the talks? This is what Ivan Bender, the president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna, is going to tell us: [Begin Bender recording] In the beginning it ought to be stressed that this meeting was organized while the delegation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was paying a visit to Zagreb on the occasion of Croatia's Statehood Day. Mr. Jadranko Prlic and Pero Markovic, chairman of the executive committee of the Croatian Democratic Union, led the delegation. A meeting like this one was necessary at this time as it had been felt that there were forces trying to disunite the Croatian deputies in the constitutive assembly in order to achieve their goals -- to wreck the continuity of the Croatian policy on the territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is interesting to stress that a majority of deputies were in attendance as we had taken all the necessary measures, and within the framework of all this we agreed what has to be done in the forthcoming period: First, we should stress again that the federation and its organization is closely connected with the establishment of the confederation with Croatia. This is a package. Because without the establishment of the confederation there can be no federation. This should be clear to all of us and it should be repeated that this is a package, that is, in practice, a kind of unity about which there should be no discussion on this occasion. Further, we should stress again, and we will do so in the capacity of deputies at a session of the constituent assembly of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that the bodies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia-Herzegovina itself are going to exist until the package which I have mentioned has been established. There can be no talk about the suspension of the government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, on the contrary it should further be strengthened until the federation and the confederation have been established, i.e. until some other bodies take over responsibilities currently discharged by the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. As for the next session of the constituent assembly which is to be held on 22 June, we have reached an agreement that we, within the Croatian Democratic Union, should carry out all the necessary preparations for the election of the government of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have agreed, as regards the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, actually the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, that the executive committee of the Croatian Democratic Union should prepare concrete solutions as regards the posts of ministers and deputy ministers.
