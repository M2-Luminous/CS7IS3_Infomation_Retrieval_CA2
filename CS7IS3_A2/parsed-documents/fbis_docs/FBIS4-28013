The "Ichi-Ichi line," the duo of Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, has played a "control tower" role of the coalition government. How will the Ichi-Ichi line react to this difficult situation? Also, was the formation of [parliamentary group] "Kaishin," which triggered the SDPJ's pullout, a miscalculation? We asked Mr. Ichikawa, who has just become the acting chairman of Komeito, to talk frankly about the future course of the chaotic political situation. The interview was held in Komeito's waiting room in the Diet building. Mr. Ichikawa said, while laughing: "At the meeting of presidents of the mass media, I said that one who becomes a president from a reporter is not good at conducting business because he has not gone through the hardships of sales and getting advertisements. I said this while especially looking at the face of Nabetsune (the nickname of YOMIURI SHIMBUN President Tsuneo Watanabe)." Mr. Ichikawa, who used to be managing editor of KOMEI SHIMBUN and had a very hard time not being able to sell advertisement, gave an impression that he takes pride in being familiar with both sides of the mass media. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Following your appointment as the party's acting chairman, is the next step the chairman's post? [Ichikawa] Oh no. It [my appointment] was not carried out as part of preparations for the next personnel changes at the November party convention. We just sincerely followed Prime Minister Hata's policy that, "if a party leader joins the cabinet, I want him to concentrate on his job as a member of the cabinet." I do not feel that I will be the next chairman, nor is there such an atmosphere within the party. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is strengthening the party's organization important for the present? [Ichikawa] Since the SDPJ left the Hata Cabinet, party leaders' entering the cabinet has become more significant. Then it is only natural that the secretary general stay within the party. Komeito has been promoting the reorganization of the political world early on, and is the first party to say that it does not matter if its name disappears. In addition, I was at the center of the electoral system reform. It is very irresponsible of me to join the cabinet while the [political realignment] plan is not completed. To say that there is no one other than myself [to do the job of political reorganization] may sound arrogant, but I think it is my duty to take responsibility for carrying it out. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] You did not know about the forming of "Kaishin?" [Ichikawa] Basically, I did not know about it because we were not asked to join the group. Since I have been saying the Diet dissolution and general election under the new electoral system should be fought by organizing a new new-party, I think the formation of a parliamentary group is necessary to that end. But, (immediately before Kaishin's establishment) there was a call from then Prime Minister Hosokawa regarding the group's formation, and when I made sure that "You have informed the SDPJ about the plan thoroughly," he answered, "the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] is responsible for obtaining agreement from the SDPJ, and labor unions and Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation]." [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What you were worrying about came true? [Ichikawa] Although those excluded (from "Kaishin") may feel unpleasant, the parliamentary group issue is trivial compared to destabilizing the political situation. I understand that there were various problems with the way the group was formed. However, it cannot be a reason (for the SDPJ) to leave the government. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you think the forming of the parliamentary group without informing the SDPJ was wrong? [Ichikawa] Both the SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger] say they are determined to oppose the idea of making a new new-party, and they will fight separately in an election under the new system. Because they say they want to form a coalition again if the parties win the election, it is not reasonable to discuss the issue of maintaining the coalition in relation to the issue of the parliamentary group before an election. Their judgment to agree with the LDP's no-confidence motion depending on the situation, is too much swayed by party interests. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is talk about canceling "Kaishin" among the DSP and the Japan New Party [JNP]. [Ichikawa] If the DSP is going to propose disbanding "Kaishin," it has to make clear its leadership's responsibility. Political responsibility is to be severely questioned. At least, the leadership of the DSP and the JNP will be held responsible. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] While process and time are important in politics, is not the Ichi-Ichi line rushing too fast? [Ichikawa] The LDP uses words like "high-handed" or "hardline" to try to split the ruling coalition party. The mass media is reporting that as something funny, which is totally different from reality. SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo said, "the Ichi-Ichi line does not exist in the meeting of coalition representatives. Everybody is involved in the decisionmaking." [The Ichi-Ichi line] is a false image made up by the mass media. The relationship between chairman and secretary general varies from party to party. When things go wrong, the Ichi-Ichi line is held responsible for everything while this difference is being neglected. For example, there is a party that is divided between the left and the right, while there is a party in which mutual understanding between its chairman and secretary general is lacking. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is also criticism of the Ichi-Ichi line's high-handed methods. [Ichikawa] The fact that both Mr. Ozawa and I were constantly on the sidelines making decisions as the ruling party gave the impression that we were taking the leadership. I think the criticism is the reaction against it. The mass media is to blame too. To make up for the insufficiency in its coverage, the press holds the Ichi-Ichi line responsible for anything it does not know. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of Mr. Ozawa's criticism of the mass media? [Ichikawa] Mr. Ozawa has a streak of shyness. That is why he tends not to talk about himself, and the mass media misunderstands him. Diet members do not talk the same way with reporters as they do with their colleagues. However, Mr. Ozawa speaks frankly. So if there is a bad reporter around him he could be caught (laughs). (Referring to the ASAHI SHIMBUN report that Ozawa said: "It does not matter with which woman you sleep," at the time of forming the lower house parliamentary group "Kaishin"). Nobody will think good of the content of Mr. Ozawa's remark itself. But, men in general say things like that a lot when they drink. Well, Mr. Ozawa murmured that as he was walking. Usually, it is a rule not to report that, and moreover, a reporter of the news agency that covered the news was not actually there. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] If the person who is moving the political world will not disclose his real intention easily, it is only natural to report what is as close as possible to his intention. [Ichikawa] I think it is a question of the press ethics of editors that a report based on secondhand information gets a four-column heading. I am saying that the news agencies lack a sense of ethics considering their public responsibility, and this is not meant to be a criticism of TOKYO SHIMBUN. I do not intend to defend the content of Mr. Ozawa's remark, but, I am saying there is a problem with the press' attitude. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Does not Komeito's pacifism stand and Mr. Ozawa's military expansion policy conflict? Also, there seems to be criticism from Soka Gakkai. [Ichikawa] That is your story. Saying that "Mr. Ozawa is for the expansion of the military" is wrong. To argue that Mr. Ozawa and Komeito are different by assuming Mr. Ozawa is an expansionist, without the grounds for saying so, is very prejudiced. I think Japan should advocate world security centering on the United Nations. However, there are differences between Mr. Ozawa and myself on the procedure for gaining public consensus. Mr. Takemura (leader of Sakigake) deliberately says that Mr. Ozawa's "normal country" vision is scary. Does Mr. Takemura have any plans for international contributions? Nonmilitary contribution is deceptive. Calling oneself by a neat name, such as SDPJ-DSP liberals or pro-Constitution liberals, while labeling others with a name that makes a bad impression is a really dangerous method. To talk seriously and firmly is regarded as "rigid," and someone who says things with an irresponsible vision is regarded as "soft." This is ridiculous. Politicians must compete using their brains. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] We heard that you gave an uncommon name to your dog. [Ichikawa] I tell my wife and kids that you cannot keep an animal unless you think of it as your child. Our dog is a female Japanese midget Shiba. Since she looks obedient, I named her "Naoko" [a name for girls that shares the morpheme "nao" with the word "sunao" meaning "obedient"]. She has a good personality, or shall I say "dog"-ality (laughter). Everything should be treated with great affection.
