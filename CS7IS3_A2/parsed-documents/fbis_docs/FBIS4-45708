Sauer: "Foreign Sales Support Duales System: 50 Percent of Packaging From "Yellow Ton" is Exported"] [Text][First para is editor's summary] VDI-N, Duesseldorf--The company Duales System Deutschland GmbH announced "Sales Quotas Exceeded." But closer inspection reveals that this result was only possible because of massive exports of used packaging. Experts are looking for clearer conditions for sales in Germany from the planned amendment to the packaging ordinance. On 1 March the environmental secretaries of the Laender were given extensive reading materials. Duales System Deutschland (DSD) presented them for the first time with the bulk flow documentation for the collection, sorting and sale of merchandise packaging. In the eyes of DSD managing director Wolfram Brueck the balance is favorable. Of 7.6 million tons of used packaging, 4.6 million tons were collected in 1993 through Duales System and an even 3.9 million tons were sold after sifting and sorting. According to Brueck, of 970,000 tons of plastic packages 29 percent were sold, while the packaging regulations require only 9 percent. Indeed, the high rate of sales for plastics really is a surprise. After all, in the previous year problems with plastic waste had brought Duales System to the verge of disaster. The Society for Plastics Recycling founded by DSD and by the waste management sector found a bungled situation: 80,000 tons of plastic wastes were piling up in the sorting plants with no processing capabilities to deal with them. The mountain grew at the rate of 8000 tons a week. The solution of the riddle: overseas sales. According to DKR chief executive Michael Scriba, a total of 225,000 tons of plastic wastes were exported in 1993. About 20,000 tons went to European Union countries, but the main sales region is Eastern Europe. Increasingly the Germans are collecting for China: the IPK for Paper and Plastic Usage GmbH in Sinzheim near Baden-Baden exported around 72,000 tons to the People's Republic in 1993. According to agent Dirk Gantzkow, the shipments went predominantly to a large factory in the city of Nanchang in the Chinese province of Jiangzi. In 1994 it is hoped to double the amount exported. "Without export possiblities for plastics Duales System would no longer exist," as Scriba freely admits. China is a particularly attractive location for utilization of plastics for two reasons. Wages are so low that intensive secondary sorting is possible. In addition, the consumers are very undemanding about the appearance and condition of plastic products, so that the sales possibilities for objects in daily use made of used plastics are practically unlimited. German and foreign businesses which want to process the DSD plastics have to be approved by the TUeV (Technical Control Board). According to Andreas Burkhardt of the TUeV for the Rhineland, in Cologne, 106 German firms and 107 foreign ones had been through an initial testing process by the beginning of the year and had obtained a certificate as DSD plastic users. Today the DKR has access to TUeV-tested and contractually guaranteed processing capacities of 510,000 in Germany and abroad. Although for the moment no bottlenecks are in sight, plastics remain the problem child for Duales System. Plastic packaging is a highly developed special product adapted to the protection and transport of a wide assortment of materials, but not to a trouble-free reuse. That is why the recycling costs for plastic are far higher than for other packaging materials. The leader of the Information Center for Packaging, Packaging Optimization and Environment at the Berlin Technical Training College, Dieter Berndt, estimates that only 15 to 20 percent of plastic packaging can be reworked into new products at a tolerable cost. In this regard, he says that the high utilization quotas cited by DSD are a questionable success. "An expensive field experiment is being performed on the population of the Federal Republic," Berndt criticizes. Berndt's colleague Marcus Thiele points out a "construction error" in Duales System itself. The sorting companies in the disposal economy are not paid according to the results of their work but according to the quantity put in. Thus there is no incentive to separate as efficiently as possible. Theo Becker, the managing director of BFI Disposal Technology from the business group RWE Disposal, complains that this is why the sorters also have no interest in improving the technical standards of their plants. At present the contents of the Yellow Sacks are divided roughly by hand at the 600 sorting stations of the disposal industry into the following categories: foil, bottles, cups and blisters, and foam packaging. The sizable residue, 46 percent, is made up of mixed plastics. BFI, in contrast, offers a technology which can distinguish individual products such as a certain mouthwash bottle using a multisensor system which sorts according to form, color, metal content, and infrared reflection. Given the current quality of sorted plastic wastes, buyers can only be found if a socalled utilization contribution is paid. These additional payments are so attractive that even in Germany a lively competition for DSD plastics has evolved. "If all the plans which utilization businesses in the DKR have proposed so far were to be put into practice, we would need two million tons of plastic packaging," Scriba notes. There is no shortage of ideas about how to manufacture substitute products for wood and concrete in horticulture and road construction from the problematic mixed plastics. But the market possibilities are often recklessly overestimated in the process. "The Federal Republic would have to be transformed into a plastic Legoland, covered with a thick layer of plastic paving stones--it would probably float," says Scriba mockingly. A process used by the Finnish company Suomon Muovikartonki Oy for working unsorted and uncleaned plastics into road surfacing appears very attractive. The shredded waste products are broken down by heating and used in the manufacture of asphalt, with bitumen as a binding agent. Five to seven tons of plastic waste could be incorporated in a road surface measuring 1 km by 8 m. using this method. The company claims that the plastic-modified asphalt is more durable than normal road surfaces. The Krefeld concrete block manufacturer Hans Klausmann likewise hopes to combine sand and plastics at temperatures from 150 to 200ï¿½ C to producing road construction materials. But Heinrich Els, an expert at the German Asphalt Association, finds the concept of using road construction as a method of disposal troubling. He says that asphalt is characterized by the fact that old road surfaces can be completely reused after appropriate treatment. "This should not be jeopardized by new additives." Which way the Green Dot will roll in the future will be determined in no small measure by political decisions. The Federal Environmental Agency is working on an amendment to the packaging ordinance which defines the possibilities for utilization of used packaging more precisely, but experts estimate that the amendment will not be passed before the elections. "The position is rather confused," Kai Fabig, spokesperson of the environmental agency in Hamburg, agrees. But packaging technology expert sees positive aspects to the situation: "Everything is fluid at the moment."
