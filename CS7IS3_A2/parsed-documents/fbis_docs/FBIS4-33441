The decision was adopted at a meeting in the Dominican Republic. Here is a report by Chelo Garcia: [Begin recording] [Garcia] There is concern that the ties between Latin American drug traffickers and gunrunners are getting increasingly closer. They work in teams and support each other. Sophisticated long- and short-range weapons of every caliber, mostly from Europe, are flooding Latin American black markets. The Latin American narcotics chiefs decided to make efforts to break this deadly alliance during the drug summit held in the Dominican Republic. [Colombian counternarcotics chief Colonel Leonardo Gallego] The most important things were the plans for new methods and means to strengthen this struggle against drug trafficking. [Garcia] It was also proposed at the drug summit that the Latin American countries form a single bloc of support to control drug cultivation, production, processing, and trafficking. They will also work shoulder to shoulder to prevent the use of aircraft, vessels, and ground transportation to supply materials that Latin American drug traffickers need to produce drugs.
