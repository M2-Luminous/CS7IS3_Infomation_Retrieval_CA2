FBIS4-32154 "dreeu119__a94006" FBIS-EEU-94-119-A Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Videnov Explains Differences With SDS Videnov Explains Differences With SDS AU2106091194 Sofia BTA in English 1627 GMT 20 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2106091194 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, June 20 (BTA) -- The Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) and the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), this country's major parliamentary forces, still differ radically about the way to go to possible early parliamentary elections, according to socialist leader Zhan Videnov, who spoke to the press after his meeting with SDS leader Filip Dimitrov. The decisions of the two forces' top-level forums about early elections this year were discussed at the meeting. The BSP holds that the question about elections should be raised in late summer or early in the autumn, when the government's term, for which it received a confidence vote, will run out, and it will have carried out its programme. For its part, the SDS believes the issue should be resolved without delay in the coming days and weeks, for which purpose a cabinet crisis should be precipitated, followed by the fall of the cabinet and elections in October. According to the SDS, the Electoral Law and the constitution should be amended only after the fall of the cabinet. "We set forth our position, namely, that it is difficult to discuss other matters before the government's fate is decided," Filip Dimitrov said. The BSP is eager to have early elections but not just now, he added. The Socialists' suggestion that the preparations for early elections should start in the autumn practically amounts to putting them off, Dimitrov said. These two approaches are hard to combine. Moreover, the SDS links a number of necessary steps, such as amendments to the Constitution, debates on a new electoral law or amending the effective one, with a guarantee for early elections, which they see exclusively in the fall of the government, Videnov explained. In his view, this is an extreme, unwise and unrealistic approach, to which reality will provide a corrective. Videnov believes that given the great difference in the views of the two major parliamentary groups, it is doubtful whether there will be fast guaranteed progress in a direction that would be of benefit to the country above all. The socialist leader presented to Filip Dimitrov an expert analysis of the minimum of work needed to be done on the Electoral Law. The analysis shows that it could not be done in a few days, Zhan Videnov said. Videnov told the press the meeting had been held by mutual agreement and had been under preparation for the last three or four months. Filip Dimitrov said the invitation to the meeting had come from the BSP leadership and the SDS had accepted it. It was attended by Ivan Kurtev, chief secretary of the SDS National Coordinating Council, and Krasimir Premyanov, Deputy Chairman of the BSP Supreme Council.
