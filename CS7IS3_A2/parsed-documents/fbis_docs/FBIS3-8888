Can one envisage an advance of the left wing as in Poland? [Popely] The domestic political situation in Slovakia has its particularity in the sense that the left essentially advanced in the months following the 1992 elections. A slowdown in the privatization process and, subsequently, a complete halt to this process are clear examples of this advance. It is hard to expect anything good or any clear development from the current situation. In my modest view, the situation will become even more complicated, and I do not exclude the possibility of a new and spectacular return of the current fallen prime minister, Meciar. And one should not forget that we are again facing elections. The only question is when these elections will be held. I think it would have been more fortunate if the Meciar Cabinet had continued for a few more months because, in that case, the entire society would have realized the true aspect of the country- and self-damaging Meciar policy. This way, however, Meciar has succeeded in creating a political situation in which, by escaping from it, he can live through the events of the coming months as a martyr. [Paizs] A situation has emerged now that the ethnic Hungarian political parties represent the political balance. In your view, will the political prestige of the Hungarian parties indeed increase in the chess game of the coming days and weeks? [Popely] That is true: The Hungarian parties represent the political balance today, but let me add that there is not a single opposition political force in Slovakia today that would be ready to regard the Hungarian parties as a serious factor. I think it is an illusion to expect a situation in which the Hungarians here can bring themselves into a serious political position with the formation of a new government, not because the Hungarians would refrain from participating but because every opposition Slovak party would lose popularity in the eyes of the Slovak voters if they cooperated with us. [Paizs] Is it possible that the Hungarian parties will obtain more than 10 percent of the votes in the next elections? [Popely] It is possible, but I do not regard this as a realistic figure. If the current electoral law remains in force, one that requires a threshold of 7 percent in the case of a coalition made up of two or three parties and a threshold of 10 percent in the case of a coalition made up of four, I think the chances for Hungarian political subjects to enter the Slovak parliament are endangered. Therefore, the best thing would be for all of the Hungarian political forces to run under one name, not in a coalition but as a single party, with the participation of all of the Hungarian candidates, either on the list of Coexistence or on the list of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement. In that case, they would have to achieve only a 5-percent threshold. One should not forget that, at the elections in June 1992, our success in reaching the 7-percent threshold depended on only 13,000 votes. [Paizs] What is your opinion about the spread of the left and the relations of the Hungarian political parties with the left? Is it possible that Peter Weiss of the Party of the Democratic Left will also have a mandate from the Csallokoz area? [Popely] This is quite possible, and even more than one mandate. One should not forget that there are two Hungarian parliamentary deputies in the Party of the Democratic Left. This party is expected to form an alliance with the Social Democrats and the Slovak Agricultural Party. The latter has a lot of people in the areas inhabited by Hungarians. It is to be feared that some of the former Hungarian members of agricultural cooperatives will not be steadfast enough, and they might vote for Weiss and his party under the spell of the promises of various social reforms. They deliberately "travel" around for Hungarian votes. It is no accident that one of the deputy chairmen of the Party of the Democratic Left is a Hungarian named Erzsebet Borza. This is the only Slovak party that has its own national minority concept.
