[Sarid] Clearly I was sad to learn last night of the decision to break off the Washington talks. I regret the decision but I cannot say that I was surprised. Already last Friday [25 February], the day of the massacre, it was obvious that such an event could not simply pass without leaving its mark on the talks. It was hard to imagine that it would just continue to be business as usual. Nevertheless, the fact that the talks are being halted is cause for a great deal of sorrow, frustration, and disappointment because, as has already been noted, the desire of this evil man, this Jekyll and Hyde, was to stop the talks and this is indeed happening. There is nothing worse than granting murderers what they want. [Paz] In your opinion, can we talk about long-term damage to the peace process this morning? [Sarid] I very much hope not. I therefore appeal to the Palestinian leadership to consider this period merely as a short time out, which will be followed by an immediate resumption of the negotiations. [Dan] What will bring them back to the negotiating table? [Sarid] Look, I do not demand anything of the Palestinian leadership that we have not already demanded of ourselves. The Israeli leadership has also faced extremely difficult challenges in recent weeks. There have been many terrorist attacks since 13 September, and we vividly remember each and every one of them. The familiar voices calling for a halt in the negotiations and the abandonment of the peace process were heard in Israel. Some new voices even joined in the chorus. We rejected these demands. It was difficult and painful. We had to clench our fists and bite our lips, but we nevertheless proceeded, and, I might say, even stuck to the peace process with more conviction and resoluteness. Now it is the turn of the Palestinian leadership to follow the example set by their Israeli counterparts. Our Palestinian colleagues are going through a tough period. I realize that these are difficult days and that they are very upset. This is certainly understandable and we will wait several days in the hope and faith that we will all return to Washington next week to continue talking because we have no other alternative. [Paz] Minister Sarid, one more question. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that Israel would make no additional concessions to the PLO in order to bring them back to the negotiating table. Is refusing to make any further concessions indeed the correct approach? Perhaps we should make some concessions to demonstrate our goodwill and improve the atmosphere? [Sarid] I have two things to say to that. One, I think that yesterday's cabinet decisions provide a good basis for the continuation of the negotiations. These very important and unprecedented decisions in my opinion indicate the government's readiness and commitment to confront the radical elements in Israel, control and restrain their activities, and if necessary even totally suppress them. That is one thing. Second, I would like to issue a warning about reopening understandings. Now they want to reopen the agreement because of what happened in Hebron. Tomorrow, God forbid, there may be another terrorist attack and this or that party will make additional demands to reopen and change things. There will be no end to this and the agreement will totally disintegrate. An agreement is not a zipper that one opens and closes at will. [Dan] But what will bring the Arab delegations back to the talks? [Sarid] A sense of responsibility and the lack of other alternatives. [Dan] Thank you very much, Minister Yosi Sarid.
