Idiz: "Refah's Foreign Policy Outlook"] [Text] As the success of Refah (the Welfare Party-RP) following Sunday's [27 March] local elections sent shock waves around the country, arousing fears among the overwhelmingly secular majority of the electorate which had split its 80 percent of votes among the various secular parties contesting the election, foreign diplomats in Ankara were busily trying to interpret what this startling victory by such an intensely pro-Islamic -- if not outright fundamentalist -- party meant in terms of Turkey's future. Asked during his press conference in Ankara, the day after it became certain that his party had taken the mayoral posts in Istanbul and the Turkish capital, about how the West should view his party's victory, RP leader Necmettin Erbakan said very openly that the fact that his party was coming to power was "a very important event for the whole world." "We believe that Westerners are clever enough to consider what is to their own interests. No one should act in a prejudicial manner... a bankrupt Turkey will constitute a weight for the West. But a strong and economically sound Turkey is good for the West as well" he said. "But compared to relations today our government will have one difference. The West, which today sees Turkey as a servant and issues its orders over the phone will have to think, what will Turkey say? when it is about to take any decision while we are in power" Erbakan added. Concealed in these words may have been an attempt at trying to reassure the West that it could have normal relations with a Turkey run by the pro-Islamic RP, provided it restrained its prejudices and treated Turkey with the respect that Erbakan believes it is not receiving today. But despite this attempt at reassurance, a defiance aimed at the West is, nevertheless, clearly and unmistakably discernible in the RP leader's words. Of course the RP is not in power today or anywhere close to it at the present time although it has expanded its popular base in these local elections. There are over two and a half years to go to the next general elections -- provided early elections are not announced -- which are due to be held in the fall of 1996, and the parties that lost out in Sunday's local elections have time to recover if they opt for sensible policies and leave behind the policies that have alienated them from the masses. There can be no doubt, however, that the RP will work day in and day out until those elections in order to build on its victory at these local elections which have indicated that it can command nearly 20 percent of the overall nationwide vote at the present time. Neither can there be any doubt that Sunday's results have placed this party firmly on Turkey's political panorama with an influence that it has not had in the past although it has been around since the late 1960's under one name or another. Given this fact it appears necessary to try and piece together what we know of the RP's outlook on relations with the outside world. Firstly there can be no doubt that it is intensely anti-West in its general outlook even though Erbakan is a German educated engineer. It has made this clear in the most open terms at every occasion that it has grabbed, and if it is now appearing to use seemingly conciliatory words of reassurance this is only the result of an unavoidable pragmatism dictated by circumstance. Thus, for example, Necmettin Erbakan has consistently been a strong opponent of the idea of Turkey ever becoming a member of the European Union. He opposed this idea when it was the European Economic Community, he opposed it when it was the European Community, and he opposes it now when it is the EU [European Union]. Neither has he wasted any opportunity to rub in what he terms "The West's refusal to admit Turkey in its midst after Ankara's full application to the EC and the "avis" [opinion] this received from Brussels. [no end quotation mark as published] Thus every time there is a rebuffing of Turkey by the West the RP has been delighted and has used it against the government. But this opposition to the West by the RP has nothing to do with intense nationalistic sympathies as might be assumed. It is has to do with the overall Christian character of Europe, a character which is seen as being at odds with the islamic world in an irreconcilable way. It must be kept in mind that what is predominant for the type of Islam that the RP ultimately represents -- although it is not convenient for its followers to admit this at the present time -- is not nationalism as such but the "Ummar," i.e., the "Islamic collective" which recognized no boundaries within its own borders. This makes the RP see its relations with other Islamic countries, especially those run by the all encapsulating Islamic judicial code, the Shari'ah -- as in the case of the oil rich Gulf states -- in a completely different light to relations with the Christian West. To accuse it of hypocrisy for criticising the current secular and Kemalist regime in Turkey of being attached to an un-Turkish Western lifestyle, while it itself is so attached to the "un-Turkish East" is in this sense irrelevant for the RP. It is irrelevant because for its followers the "Islamic East" is not "outside" or "abroad" in the way that the Christian West is. It is only an "extension" of Islamic Turkey -- or Islamic Turkey is an extension of the Islamic East. Another characteristic of the RP is that it is intensely anti- Jewish and anti-Zionist, but not in a racist anti-Semitic way. It sees the Jews, "with their seditious Zionism," and their state of Israel as "an instrument of the West which is like a piercing and sharp dagger stuck in the belly of the Islamic Ummah." As a phenomenon which is considered to have proved its "hellish enmity to Islam" in the pain and suffering it is said to be meting out to the Palestinians, the Jewish state is seen by many RP followers as something that must be eradicated at all costs because it is the embodiment of evil. Baruch Goldstein, who massacred praying Palestinians in Hebron, has in one sense done the Islamic ideologues in Turkey something of a service during their critical election campaign. Even where some Arab countries have come around to seeking means of a rapprochement with Israel, the RP will have none of this, seeing the recent accord between the Jewish state and the Palestinian Liberation Organization as a sell out of the Palestinian people. Considering PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat a traitor and an instrument of Israel, the RP is closer to the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] movement that it admires as a "people's movement" which it sees itself as also being. All this does not, however, cover some of the RP's contradictions in terms of its relations with the outside world and other countries. For example it will not have anything bad said about Saudi Arabia, from where it receives massive amounts of material and moral support, even though this country allowed itself to be converted into a massive aircraft carrier for the West during the Gulf War against Iraq, with the infidel male and female soldiers trotting up and down holy lands and doing Allah only knows what... Neither will Erbakan have anything bad said about Germany even if this is a country where there is a resurgence of xenophobia and fatal violence against God fearing Moslem Turks. In both cases the lowest common denominator, leading the RP leader to taking such a docile stance even though his basic Islamic philosophy should make him scream with anger, appears to be money. While he is known to harbour a secret admiration for Germany, where he studied as a young man and even worked as an engineer in Krupps, he knows this country is also a major source of income for his party from Turkish sympathizers working and living there. This is something that he would hardly want to endanger. Like Germany, Saudi Arabia is also a source of income which merits a blind eye to some inconsistencies such as this country's extremely close ties with the United States. Now that it has felt its strength based on popular support there is no doubt that the RP will want to make its views on a large number of issues known more vocally in the coming period. Its views on a host of foreign policy questions should also become more clear as it does so. What is certain is that everything it says to this end will be noted down fervently by all in a general attempt to understand where Turkey might head if the RP really did come to power one day.
