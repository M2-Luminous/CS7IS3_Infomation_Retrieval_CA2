At this point, Pawlak's government is in power three times longer than his prime ministership following the fall of the Olszewski government. We recall this incident not without reason. One can clearly see the continuation of the same political line: the tendency to obliterate divisions between the Polish People's Republic (PRL) and Poland as it is now, and a departure from all promises given during the election campaign. The defeat of post-Solidarity parties and the poor showing of the BBWR [Nonpartly Bloc in Support of Reforms], the presidential party formed in such a hurry, in the 19 September elections allowed the left to legally take power and form a government. It seemed to some people that one had but to look to see the slogan "All power in the hands of the people's councils" [a communist-era slogan]." There was no lack of people who scared others with the return of communism. Nothing of that sort happened because it could not happen. But it does not mean that nothing happened. The most important threat is not the return of a sinister ideology that is still claiming victims in the Balkans and the Caucasus but, rather, the final legalization of the succession inherited from the PRL. Erasing dividing lines between the thief and his victim, betrayal and patriotism, independence and subordination to a foreign power must sooner or later influence the country's defense and society's bearings. The Comrades Are Returning The first signal given to the owners of People's Poland that it was time to return to the scene was sent as soon as 26 October at the swearing-in ceremony of Pawlak's government in the Belweder [the presidential residence]. Leszek Miller, the representive of the "beton'1 [hard-liners] in the PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] (communist party), who is, together with Rakowski [Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the last first secretary of the PZPR], accused of illegal money dealings with the Soviets to finance the 1989 elections, became a minister. This could appear to be an incident--the price Pawlak had to pay because Kwasniewski was too weak to pacify Miller's supporters in his own party. Today, unceremoniously, Miller accuses Solidarity of illegally receiving money from the West. The fact that the attorney general is his colleague from the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] is of lesser importance. What is important, however, is that today there are many such Millers. They are in the government, in the central administration, and in the voivodships. The best example may be that of Ireneusz Sekula. This decision on the part of Waldemar Pawlak symbolically closes the period of transition that began after the 1989 elections. It would be hard to find a clearer political message for a population that was under communism for 45 years. Sekula, appointed president of the Main Customs Office, was, in Rakowski's government, responsible for the creation of a legal base that allowed for the enfranchisement of the nomenklatura, and he himself is today a beneficiary of that decision. Pawlak's government seemd to be saying, paraphrasing president Walesa, "Comrades, the time of pretending that we are not here is over," and "Take power into your own hands." In such a situation, should one be surprised that local apparatchiks of the coalition government are throwing out voivodes in order to take over their jobs? This process is not merely the replacement of one group of people by another. The clientele of the SLD and the PSL [Polish Peasant Party] [the two parties in the governing coalition] throughout the years has gotten so accustomed to sinecure and power that to try to stop this wave could cause mutiny in its own party ranks. From the perspective of local, presidential, and eventually parliamentary elections, the state interest must lose with the interest of the party. For this reason, Pawlak postponed the county (powiaty) reform, hoping to distribute these seats after succesful elections in June. This whole process is, in a way, completed with the return of higher security officials to the departments directly responsible for state security. The ridiculed and discredited idea of vetting has died, and it is doubtful that it will ever have another chance. Fortunately, there are no longer any Russian garrisons in Poland that served as centers for espionage. However, foreign press information that our country is an object of strong intelligence penetration confirms fears that foreign agents may still, in an essential way, influence the decisionmaking process in Poland. Cynical Treatment of the Electorate The slogan "It doesn't have to be like this anymore" [the main SLD election campaign slogan] turns out to be only a campaign promise. The SLD treated its own electorate rather cynically, while the PSL, often in good faith, was promising farmer paradise without consideration for what the state could deliver. Both of these parties do not know how to fulfill these declarations. That demagoguery ended soon after these parties won the elections, and the slightly embarassed Pawlak stated in the Sejm that he must continue the policy of the previous governments. It is good, obviously, that the government does not intend to destroy what the other governments accomplished during past four years. But what is troublesome is the fact that, in the programs and actions of Pawlak's Cabinet, there are no new ideas that would stimulate faster growth. In the explanatory statement to the draft budget law, there is no trace left of the preelection rethoric on the tragic recession, growth stimulation through higher inflation, radical changes in the exchange rate of the dollar, or increased emission of the currency in order to cover social expenses. On the other hand, the clearly visible tendency in 1993 of an improvement in the state of public finances greatly eased the way for the start of Prime Minister Pawlak's government. However, because the minister of finance came to the conclusion that further balancing of the budget by means of cutting expenses was not possible, budget revenues and outlays were enlarged. From the current year's tax law, we know whence the revenues are to come. Above all, those who voted for the left will pay for them: consumers and small businesses. "You wanted new people in power, so you have it," one would like to say, if it were not for the fact that here we are talking about the poorest layers of society. Who in Reality Has Power? Waldemar Pawlak seems to be aware of the danger of an outbreak of social discontent. The prime minister's expose just before the end of the year can be read as an expression of anxiety, that matters are not following the earlier forecast. This begs the essential question: Who in this Cabinet has the deciding voice? Already the battle surrounding the placing of people in certain ministries (when Waldemar Pawlak withdrew certain people from the list of names given to the president and replaced them with SLD names) proves that nothing of importance can occur without Aleksander Kwasniewski's approval. I do not claim that the SLD leadership fulfills the role of a Politburo in relation to Pawlak's government. However, there is no doubt that it is precisely this party [SLD] that makes the strategic decisions. The SLD consistently guards the interests of the PRL nomenklatura, which now has time for an undisturbed strengthening of its position in the economy. Taking over economic control of the country's economic life, which was allowed by the previous governments under the rulings of this present Cabinet, will result in broadening and such a strenghtening of the structures that no changes will be possible in the future. The fundamentals of privatization as proposed by Minister Kaczmarek constitute but one example of such a policy. The forecast of Lech Mazewski, associated with the liberal circles of the previous governments, that we are moving toward a South American type of capitalism, where a very narrow group of people control the whole economy, appears to be closer to realization. This will support the formation of a new arrangement on the political scene. In the new political configuration, there may be found liberals from the SLD, the KLD [Liberal-Democratic Congress], and UD [Democratic Union]. The process of rapprochement of former political adversaries will demand time and will depend on both the presidential elections and the behavior of the Solidarity groups now outside parliament. But the common economic interest, the similar liberal views ideologically, and the fact that they share the same electorate will lead to unity and ignoring biographical differences. The Force in Adapting Oneself The strength of Waldemar Pawlak's government is in accepting the strategy of accommodation. This government does not wish to antagonize either the opposition, the president, foreign relations, or the mass media, or even the church, whose support it seeks, wishing to create the impression that it is the only political force defending national traditions and Christian values. Such a strategy may bring success under the condition that it will not be necessary to seek support from the electorate. In the meantime, the presidential election will take place in two years' time [late 1995]; this election designates the time frame in which the government will have to account for its actions to date. In this time frame, the difference in PSL versus SLD interests will become clear. Both Aleksander Kwasniewski and Waldemar Pawlak dream about the Belweder. The altercations with Lech Walesa are thus unavoidable. Prime Minister Pawlak has no need to hurry. He is counting on the fact that time is on his side. He can wait--under the condition that the possible failure of the government will be blamed on the coalition partner [the SLD]. But Aleksander Kwasniewski has to play the same game. He looks after the businessmen but courts the electorate; he does not attack the church, but he pays careful attention to the activities of Barbara Labuda [UD deputy, who is outspoken in her support of abortion rights]. Both Pawlak and Kwasniewski have to keep in mind the fourth presidential candidate--without knowing yet who this person will be, other than Lech Walesa. How this game will end, it is hard to forecast at this time. If it is true, as Jacek Soska [PSL deputy] claims, that Waldemar Pawlak has no intellectual capacity at his disposal, his government is working not for him but for Aleksander Kwasniewski.
