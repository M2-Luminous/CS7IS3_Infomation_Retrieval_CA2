It Is Time To End It"] [Text] These words in the president's message to the Federal Assembly cannot fail to instill cautious optimism. Indeed, after three months of equivocation and hesitation, it is time to get down to business. Most inspiring of all was the president's unequivocal stance on inflation, which "is inflicting huge damage on the reform itself and on the quality of the lives of the population and the economy as a whole." "The crisis is insuperable in conditions of unchecked inflation," the president believes. After numerous dubious statements from individual government members and competing pseudoprograms, this is more than timely and should promote the cessation of fruitless discussions. The president's indication of the need to establish by the end of 1994 a level of inflation of 3-5 percent per month, which certainly hardly squares with the statements of the prime minister and the acting minister of finance, is a real sensation. Still tougher are the president's words concerning the verification of all actions of the authorities to ensure that they carry no inflation risk to the state. Otherwise, the president's direct intervention cannot be ruled out, up to and including the exercise of his constitutional powers. The president could not have expressed himself more uncompromisingly. Now the question arises: How will the government react? It has twice already postponed its session and more often speaks of inflation priority in terms of 10 or 15-18 percent by the end of the year. For the information of those who are interested: The president's guideline of 3 percent means a 40-percent growth of prices per annum, and the government's guideline, even at 10 percent (which is improbable), represents a more than threefold increase of prices. The difference is collossal. How are these incompatible guidelines to be squared? Inflation is a fundamental issue of reform. In order to crush it, political will and decisive actions to reduce expenditure are necessary. At the moment we are being offered an extremely dubious budget deficit of 50 trillion rubles [R], R19 trillion of which is proposed to be funded from external sources. I will not say any more about the budget's inflated tax revenue, but who can seriously expect to receive more than $10 billion from abroad? Or as much as R4.5 trillion in revenue through issuing securities? You can dress up the figures as much as you like, but not to that extent. Be sensible. Two months have passed, and all the Central Bank's credits for the first quarter have already been spent. On what legal basis will expenditure in March rest? When will the budget be presented to parliament, and how quickly will it be possible to adjust it to suit the president's wishes? In its current form, even if it is accepted as correct, it does not correspond even to inflation of 10 percent per month. Either the government will take decisive measures, or it will act against the president. Inflation can and should be stopped quickly. The investment process should be stimulated, and public savings encouraged. For this, political will and a ruthless battle against mismanagement, corruption, and incompetence are needed. People are needed who are capable of making decisions, accepting responsibility, and achieving results, and not simply beating their chests and saying: "We will never retreat." It is time to stop putting up with chameleons and lickspittles who sell their convictions with every new gust of the political wind. Meanwhile, they continue to drive out original thinkers and efficient people from the organs of power on ridiculous pretexts. The latest example is Kupriyanovskiy, chief of administration in the president's administration.... Of course, one man does not decide everything. But it is individual people in their sum who determine policy. The composition of the government is mirrored in policy. Today it is not clear who can, and who conscientiously will, implement the line denoted by the president. I do not agree with the description of the president's message as a party congress speech. Read the text carefully, and everything will become clear. The message contains a host of specific ideas on investments, payments, the standard of living, and agrarian and industrial policy. Quite a lot is said about the Central Bank, which is to be transformed into a federal reserve system, and about relations between the regions and the center. Most importantly of all, the message gives an objective analysis of the situation and the progress of reform in the last two-and-a-half years. There are many references to specific mistakes, inconsistency, and economic policy becoming dependent on political confrontation. The government's failures are repeatedly indicated, and the possibility of decisive intervention by the president is unambiguously hinted. It is also highly important that not one word in the president's message supported a shift in economic policy, the talk of the "end of economic romanticism," or a transition to certain "nonmonetarist methods" in the struggle with the stop-start nature of inflation. It is clearly stated: The course is to be the same as before, but it must be more consistent, considered, and professional. Now, Boris Nikolayevich, specific actions are expected from you and the prime minister. It is the government's duty to provide specific calculations of economic policy and of the guidelines for the year, including on inflation, the standard of living, and other highly important socioeconomic indicators, so that at the beginning of next year it can be said that everything possible has been done for the revival of Russia. A few days remain until the government session. The pause in the reform process has become protracted. It is time to end it, and it is possible to end it.
