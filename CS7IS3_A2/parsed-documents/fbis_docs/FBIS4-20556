(Onga-machi, Fukuoka Pref.; president: Eiji Ishii), a developer of mechatronic equipment, has developed a low-cost energy-efficient method for controlling electric vehicles that employs a general-purpose AC motor (3-phase AC induction motor). The drive units of electric vehicles are usually DC motors, but QM Software has reportedly solved the problem of control at low speed that has been plaguing AC motors, and is now able to use that motor in electric cars. The company is also looking at the idea of forming ties with a car manufacturer in order to commercialize the motor. In order to test the motor, it outfit an electric car and golf cart with the motor, a controller, and battery. The motor used in the electric car had a maximum 10 kW output (15 hp) and could achieve a maximum speed of 40 km/hr. The motor used in the golf cart had a 2.2 kW maximum output (3 hp), a maximum 40 km/hr driving speed, and a hill-climbing ability less than 20 km/hr. A general-purpose motor is a lot cheaper and more durable than a DC motor, but at low speeds it is hard to control due to its rotational unevenness. QM Software, however, has perfected a way of achieving smooth control at low speeds by a method known as "vector control," which it has applied to this motor. The president of QM Software, Eiji Ishii, said that speed variations per rpm (revolutions per second) in a four-electrode motor were less than 0.1 percent, which is quite stable. Because the motor generates strong torque (rotational force) at low speeds, it enables quick acceleration and is good for climbing hills. A general-use motor also has the ability to generate electricity when going downhill or decelerating, so by returning this electricity to the battery, it is able to conserve large amounts of energy. Compared to an electric vehicle equipped with a similar size DC motor and battery, a car outfitted with this AC motor can travel far greater distances. In addition to the electric vehicle and golf cart, the company is also working on a monorail transport vehicle for golf courses that it plans to outfit with the same motor. Putting the motor into commercial mass production is beyond their capability, so it plans to link up with different manufacturers who have expertise in that area.
