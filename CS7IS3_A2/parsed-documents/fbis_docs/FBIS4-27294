FBIS4-27294 "dreas105_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 30 May 1994 North Korea Repatriation of North Koreans in ROK Urged Repatriation of North Koreans in ROK Urged SK3005111494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1027 GMT 30 May 94 SK3005111494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The release of an old man, An Hak-sop, and the repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea, were urged strongly in different countries. The secretary general of the Uganda-DPRK Friendship Association, the general secretary of the Ugandan Union of railway workers and the president of Chambogo Polytechnical College of Uganda in a letter sent in joint name to the International Red Cross on May 20, recalling that the South Korean authorities have kept An Hak-sop behind bars for 40 odd years and put him to all sorts of tortures for the mere reason that he refused to recant his belief in communism, called upon the organization to put strong pressure on the South Korean authorities to set him free. Noting that the inhumanitarian act of not repatriating still now Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who should have been returned to their hometowns under the Korean Armistice Agreement deserves a strong denunciation, the letter strongly demanded their repatriation to the northern half of Korea. Chairman of the Human Rights Committee of Nepal Budacharya Sakiya in his letters to the World Human Rights Committee and the South Korean authorities said Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan should be repatriated at an earlier date so that they may enjoy a happy life with their families and relatives for the rest of their life. The Nepalese intellectuals' forum for solidarity with the Korean people in its letters to the South Korean "president" and to the"president of the Red Cross" of South Korea on May 23 and 24 said the South Korean authorities' refusal to send back the old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan contravenes the 1907 Hague Convention, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Korean Armistice Agreement. It urged their unconditional and immediate repatriation.
