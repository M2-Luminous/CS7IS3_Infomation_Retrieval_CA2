It does not infringe upon civil rights and curbs only the rights of criminal groupings, a high-ranking Russian counterintelligence official said. In an interview with the CRIME-PRESS news agency on Wednesday, Yevgeniy Sevostyanov, head of the counterintelligence service in Moscow and the Moscow region, said that the decree aims at protecting the population of Russia from organised crime. "The adopted measures limit only the rights of the members of criminal gangs and their direct accomplices." Vasiliy Kuptsov, Moscow criminal police chief, said that the measures could have been even tougher. "If the old law does not provide adequate measurers against criminals, a new law is needed," he said. "We should have resorted to such measures earlier, then there would be no such orgy of crime and innocent victims of criminal score settling," Kuptsov said. "I believe such measures must be used also against other people who are suspected of participation in criminal gangs or serious crimes," he added. This opinion was shared by Constitutional Court Judge Gadis Gadzhiyev. He told CRIME-PRESS that as a means of fighting crime the decree should have appeared three years ago. He believes the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, and the Federation Council, the upper house, must approve the decree as soon as possible in order to avoid the unnecessary criticism of the decree.
