I have the privilege of knowing about your record in the university and as a public servant. You have always been committed to the nation's best causes and to strengthening the republic. We Mexicans see in you a distinguished attorney, a man with absolute democratic convictions, and a citizen who has always shown respect for the law while exhibiting the purest, ethical values. For this reason and because of the great services you render the nation, I am allowing myself to tell you that it is necessary that you remain in the Interior Secretariat and as chairman of the General Council of the Federal Electoral Commission. Hoping that the country will continue to benefit from your unbiased and patriotic cooperation, I take this opportunity to express to you my affection and respect. Signed: Ernesto Zedillo.
