At least, this is what the defense minister, who has set up a communications network throughout the country, has planned. The government has increased its military presence in the country's most conflict-ridden areas to prevent guerrilla threats from hampering Sunday's elections. [Begin Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda recording] The Armed Forces are present at every municipality seat. Approximately 88 percent of the voting sites are covered, also. The Armed Forces are present at every location with more than three voting sites. This protection of the election process by the Public Force has been the most complete in the country's history. [end recording] The minister said the Army's presence on the streets of Santa Fe de Bogota is due to the election process and not to the capital's security problems. [Begin Pardo Rueda recording] The Army can cooperate with the police in the latter's work but cannot replace it. [end recording] For election day, a communications system has been set up which will make it possible for authorities to act quickly and effectively if necessary.
