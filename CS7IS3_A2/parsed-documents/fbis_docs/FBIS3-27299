If the British side unilaterally publicizes the content of the talks, the Chinese side will naturally take action accordingly. Guo Fengmin made the above remarks when asked by a reporter what reaction the Chinese side will take if the British side publicizes the contents of talks at a spring party hosted by the Island Office [Hong Kong Island] of XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong Branch yesterday evening. Guo Fengmin said: When China and Britain started the talks, they laid down the rule that the contents would be kept confidential. If the British side now takes unilateral action, the Chinese side of course will react accordingly. As to what reaction will be taken Guo Fengmin hopes the public will "wait and see." Besides, Guo Fengmin also said that according to the provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, at least three JLG meetings should be held each year. "I think there will be three meetings this year." He pointed out that there will be a experts panel meeting on the use of military land this week, after which other expert panel meetings will be considered.
