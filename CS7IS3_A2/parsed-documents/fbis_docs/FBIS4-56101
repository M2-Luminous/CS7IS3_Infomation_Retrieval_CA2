Their one-hour discussion focused on the possibility of forming a strong rightwing election bloc. According to Jan Carnogursky, the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] is skeptical in that respect. That is what he briefly told me about the bloc, which is also represented by the National Democratic Party, the Democratic Union, the Democratic Party, and the Party of Businessmen and Tradesmen. [Begin recording] [Carnogursky] If all of us wanted to form one election bloc, then according to the Elections Law, it would mean that we would have to win at least 10 percent of the vote in order to actually make it into the parliament. For that reason, we have simply continued pursuing our idea of getting rightwing deputies to the Slovak parliament. That trend will continue until 10 June. Thereafter, the party ticket will be complete because extending the process of forming election blocs and negotiating after 10 June would be wasteful. [Reporter] Mr. Cernak [National Democratic Party chairman] said he will not form any election coalition without you, the KDH. What is the situation with regard to the Democratic Union, the party headed by a chairman who enjoys the greatest popularity of around 20 percent? What is the Democratic Union's reaction? [Carnogursky] The Democratic Union intends to go into the elections alone and it is not contemplating a coalition with any other party. [end recording]
