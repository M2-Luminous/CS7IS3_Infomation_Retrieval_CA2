Agents from Russia sat in the Balkhash Non-Ferrous Metals Refinery director's waiting room from morning until night. Balkhash brass was delivered by plane so that defense plants would not shut down. Now the warehouse is full of brass and bronze rolled stock, and no one wants it. It is no longer being sent to Mongolia, Vietnam and Cuba as a form of "fraternal assistance." No customers have come forward in Kazakhstan. Yet Balkhash is currently completing construction of a new rolling-mill department... Where will its products go? The Zhezkazgantsvetmet [Zhezkazgan Non-Ferrous Metals Refinery] and Balkhashmed [Balkhash Copper Refinery] associations have long been wondering what they are going to do with their sulfuric acid. During the first half of the year Kazakhstani customers purchased only 52,000 tonnes of acid, and Russian customers bought a little more, yet out of environmental considerations alone the two associations should be producing half a million tonnes. They have the capacity to do that, but right now that equipment is idle. In Zhayrem they have mined mountains of barite, but no one needs it, either. There has been a sharp drop in demand for lead and zinc ore. During a visit to Zhezkazgan Prime Minister S. Tereshchenko said: "We need to become a part of the world market, but no one there is waiting on us and our products." It turns out that the world market is saturated with lead, zinc, copper and cable, yet Zhezkazgan Oblast is rapidly creating new capacity for the manufacture of copper wire rod, enameled wire and cable, and is developing a new tungsten deposit. Where will all this be sold, and to whom? The Kumolinskiy Mining and Concentration Combine has been under construction for a long time and will manufacture rhodusite, but now it turns out that no one needs that product, because defense expenditures are decreasing. In view of our tremendous natural resources many people think it should be easy to attract foreign capital to develop them. But in reality that is not happening. When they arrive in Zhezkazgan Oblast, foreign specialists immediately start asking the kind of questions to which we do not have any clear-cut answers. These include the details about surveys of mineral deposits, the extent to which all useful components are being recovered, the availability of advanced technologies and infrastructure and -- one of the most important questions -- availability of transportation to market. Yet on our side all these things are often based on emotion. Someone once said that barite was in demand and began to mine it, but it turned out that what was in demand was not barite, but rather manganese, which had been ignored. At the end of this year Zhezkazgan will begin manufacturing copper wire rod, but its price on the world market is only 50 percent higher than the price of copper, and demand is much lower. When the wire rod starts going into cable manufacture, Kazakhstan will be fully supplied with cable. Will we be able to sell the surplus? How much will Kazakhstan need of various metals and items manufactured from them? No one can answer those questions. Our enterprises do not know market conditions either on the world market or in the CIS. The oblast's economy is very inert and materials-intensive, and it is difficult and sometimes impossible to reorient it toward new types of manufacture. Currently efforts are being made in Sayak, Zhayrem and Karazhal to manufacture marble plates and jewelry, but there are plenty of these products on the world market already. With new products it will take time for the market to recognize and value them. The only thing that is well known is Zhezkazgan copper, so that is what people will buy. Will our cable be in demand immediately? We have only one hope: to sell it at a lower price. But in that case we run the risk of anti-dumping sanctions by international organizations. Recently the Zhezkazgantsvetmet Association calculated its expenses for the coming year and its potential losses, and they totalled R25 billion [rubles]. Even at current prices electric power will cost R75 billion. And that is the most profitable enterprise in the oblast. At the Balkhashmed Association losses are projected to begin this year. Nor are we seeing the emergence of a "natural economy," since up to 90 percent of the materials and equipment required must be imported from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Yet Kazakhstan's president has decreed that we can only purchase an amount equal to the money we have earned from shipments of our own products and equal to the amount of funds in correspondent accounts at banks outside the republic. No matter how you look at it, in a market economy sales markets are of prime significance. The lack of attention to this issue is the weak link in reform.
