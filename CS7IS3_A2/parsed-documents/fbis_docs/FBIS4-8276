FBIS4-8276 "dreeu070__a94044" FBIS-EEU-94-070-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Minister on Czech-Israeli Military Cooperation Minister on Czech-Israeli Military Cooperation AU0804182294 Prague CTK in English 1341 GMT 8 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0804182294 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Israel and its defense industry are among serious applicants for close cooperation with the Czech Republic, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told journalists today. "We bear in mind that the Israeli military industry is state-of-the-art," said Baudys who met Israeli deputies Orri Orr and Moshe Nissim today. However, it would be premature to speak about concrete cooperation in this field, he added. Baudys discussed army modernization, relations between armed forces and parliament, military buildup and acquiring public confidence with the Israeli deputies. "The meeting was very useful" because Orr is a former senior Israeli military officer "with a very successful military record so that he can consider the problems both from the military and parliamentary views," Baudys stated. Orr and Nissim, who arrived in the Czech Republic for a one-week visit on April 4, also met the Federation of Jewish Communities.
