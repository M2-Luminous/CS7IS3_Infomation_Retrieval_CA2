During the event, Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan praised the soldiers deployed in Chiapas State for their dedication and spirit. Gen. Riviello Bazan said the Army's intervention in the Chiapas conflict is strictly in accordance with the law and ethics of the Armed Forces. [Riviello Bazan] "We did not act on our own, rather, in accordance to the law. We are in Chiapas to protect constitutional order, which is demanded of us by the country and the people of Mexico." Gen. Riviello Bazan said the Armed Forces have acted with prudence and firmness, without abuses. [Riviello Bazan] "President Salinas de Gortari is a good commander and great social leader. From far and near the hands of provocation moved. They found their response in dialogue, concord, and national agreement." Gen. Riviello Bazan said values like loyalty are not nor can be changeable. [Riviello Bazan] "No one can justify violence and the taking up of weapons to demand solutions. We must not attempt to glorify those who resorted to violence. If those who encourage confrontation were faced with it, the first thing they would do is ask the authorities for their protection." The defense secretary said the Armed Forces are reliable, and this is why the Mexican people support and respect them. [Riviello Bazan] "There are some who would like to separate us from the people; that is impossible. We are one and the same. Just look at our faces, skin, thoughts, and heart of each and every soldier. You will see we are the people; we are Mexico just like the rest of the country." The defense secretary added: [Riviello Bazan] "We are no more and no less than any other Mexican who works hard for his country. We are an Army for peace. We are an Army to have peace. We believe in the law; we obey the law; we follow orders. Discipline is our motto." During the event, Gen. Luis Angel Fuentes Alvarez, director of the Heroic Military School, read the honor list of the Child Heroes of Chapultepec and the Heroic Navy School. Also present at the event were representatives of the Legislative and Judicial Branches, cabinet members, and the Navy secretary.
