[Veer] It can certainly be called pragmatic although I did not want to use this term. In 1992, the KP defined itself as a pragmatic election party but, after this, many other parties in Hungary began to use this term. In the KP's case, pragmatism means that it is only prepared to make decisions in accordance with economic rationality, regardless of how this fits in with various people's ideological views. [passage omitted] [Rist] The KP's program is trying to deal with the problems of almost all social strata and to make it attractive for everyone. Are you not worried that this effort will slip into demagogy? [Veer] We have often been accused of this. In my view, demagogy means irresponsible promises. The KP would only be demagogic if it promised things it cannot fulfill. However, it is difficult to call it demagogic just because it is sensitive to social issues, because it emphasizes responsibility in this, too. [Rist] The KP's program seems to have a strong economic policy line that intends mainly to favor the enterprises. [Veer] Undoubtedly, putting the economy back on its feet is the most important thought in the KP's program. Its slogan states the same: Rather than the economy being for politics, politics must be for the economy. However, this does not mean that any values can be sacrificed for this. I am thinking of education, health care, and culture which are openly represented by the KP. The maintenance of these is an obligation, rather than generosity. In addition to supporting the entrepreneur, our enterprise-friendliness wishes to support the enterprising society by creating workplaces, through the market, abundance of goods, and by establishing a consumer society. The essence of our economic program is that, in addition to having to help the entrepreneurs, we also have to help the system from which an economy that is good for everyone can develop. [Rist] Who do you see as your voters? [Veer] The pensioners, the intelligentsia of the provinces, and Budapest's citizens. However, this is a very difficult question because the KP has not yet been tested. We think that we will also be able to take away provincial votes from the Hungarian Socialist Party through our agricultural program. [passage omitted] [Rist] What are your views on the role and tasks of the state? [Veer] The coalition has clearly been following an etatist policy which resulted in the establishment of a rather centralized state structure. According to the KP, naturally, the state must not deny its tasks and responsibilities. It should only withdraw from the economy to the extent that its functioning can be ensured. The conditions for this have to be established through laws and tax policy. The state cannot withdraw from construction of housing, youth policy, or the maintenance of sciences, but it need not direct the economy. However, it will only be possible to see in the future how long it takes to dismantle the etatist system without damaging the already established living conditions. Corruption, which is a result of the centralization, will have to be investigated by the justice organizations rather than the government. [passage omitted]
