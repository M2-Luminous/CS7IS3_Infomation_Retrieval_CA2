[passage omitted] Listen to how the Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev assesses the situation. [Begin Grachev recording] We take an understanding attitude toward the sovereign right of every state, including those of eastern Europe, to choose a path for ensuring its own security. Such a choice could be participation in military political alliances. We would not like the states of central and eastern Europe, or the Baltic region, to speculate on a mythical threat from Russia. We do not understand their aspiration to defend themselves from Russia by membership of NATO. We, for our part, welcome the decision by the meeting of the NATO council, at the foreign minister level, in Brussels on 3 December, to remove this question from the agenda. We are supporters of the kind of path which leads to a genuine all-European system of security, that is, collective actions--but not by the criteria of belonging to blocs--with a view to preventing and settling the crises and conflicts currently convulsing Europe. We believe that security and international stability should be indivisible and rely on all-European structures. Russia takes as its premise that our relations with NATO should be richer and develop across a broad range of interaction. Russia's rapprochement with NATO, it seems to us, should proceed at a rapid pace. The east Europeans could, of course, also join this process. We have met with Mr. Woerner, the president has met him, and I was there, and we reached this agreement--that we set up groups, they have already been set up, expert groups of specialists, from NATO on the one side and Russia on the other. Over the course of January we are going to study a plan for Russia to cooperate with NATO, and sometime in January, perhaps in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where I have been invited, so as fully to explain every text of our military doctrine to the members of NATO and other interested persons, and maybe we'll sign this agreement there, if the president instructs me to do so, on behalf of the government. This matter has been studied. In addition, I have had a meeting with the commander in chief of the joint armed forces in Europe, an American general, with whom we also agreed during January to study an agreement, at a purely military level--the other one was at a military political level, while this is at a purely military level--between the commander in chief of NATO's joint armed forces in Europe, and the Russian armed forces.
