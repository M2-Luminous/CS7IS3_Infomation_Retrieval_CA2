In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed a non-capacity related amendment of license for the Chippewa Falls Hydroelectric Project, No. 2440&hyph;002. The Chippewa Falls Hydroelectric Project is located on the Chippewa River in Chippewa County, Wisconsin. The application is for the lowering of the reservoir 0.5 foot for 17 months for maintenance work. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving the application would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
