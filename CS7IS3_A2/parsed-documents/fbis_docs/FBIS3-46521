Following this, the government established the "Headquarters for Emergency Farm Policies." The headquarters is headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and other seats are filled by all cabinet ministers except the justice and defense ministers. We hope the all-star team steadily promotes farm policy reform without losing its direction. Under the current farm policy, rice farmers cannot freely seek expansion of their businesses due to the government's rice paddy reduction and food control policies. They have to cope with imported rice under such handicaps. Even without this disadvantage, rice farming is often said to be the least attractive job for young people. The government is probably planning new subsidies to rice farmers, but they would never take effect unless these restrictions are removed. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] compiled a policy report in 1992: "New Direction of Food and Farm Policies (or the so-called New Policies)." The report says that, in the year 2000, 80 percent of the nation's rice output should be produced by 50,000 large-scale rice farmers who cultivate rice paddies of 10 to 20 hectares, 100,000 part-time farmers who cultivate five to 10 hectares, and 20,000 organized farmers. This seems to be a very drastic objective since the average size of rice paddies owned by individual farmers is only 0.7 hectare right now. To achieve the objective, the speed of farm transactions should be accelerated by 250 percent compared to the present level. This means great numbers of farmers scale down or quit their farming business to concentrate on the nation's farmlands to large-scale farmers. Now that a considerable percentage of farmers is becoming old or doing farming as its side business, the opportunity is going to be ripe for a drastic farmland reform. The New Policies report predicts a drastic increase of "nonfarmer landowners." Farmlands Should Be Given to Motivated Farmers Even if a number of landowners give up farming, this would not immediately result in an increase of large-scale farmers. Also, productivity would not improve when farmers have to work on undeveloped and scattered rice paddies. Of late, many farmlands are offered for rent, but most of them are left deserted with no tenants. Concentration of farmlands to motivated farmers is becoming the biggest issue of Japan's farm administration. The limitation of compulsory rice production control was highlighted this year by a drastic decrease in the rice crop. Japan cannot abandon the rice paddy cut policy until it accepts the rice tariffication because the "existence of effective production control measures" is a prerequisite of GATT's special treatment for Japan's rice. Even under the GATT restriction, however, it is still possible to give farmers a "freedom of choice" whether or not they accept rice paddy reduction. The government can offer compensation to those who accept the government policy, but those who do not want to cut their production should be allowed to deal with the market at their own risk. Rice farmers are extremely frustrated with the production control policy. While the government intends to relax the policy for a while to cope with the rice shortfall, imports of foreign-grown rice will certainly bring about oversupply of rice again. Under such circumstances, none of the Japanese rice farmers can be a motivated farmer. To back implementation of the New Policies, the government has enacted the Farm Management Reinforcement Law. Under the law, each local government body is allowed to designate the region's leading farmers as "approved farmers" for public support. As a tentative measure, the freedom of choice should be given at least to these approved farmers. While agricultural cooperatives have been enforcing the rice paddy cut policy in a tie-up with the government, some of them are beginning to break up with the government to protest its decision on the rice market liberalization. This is a chance to correct questioned ties between agricultural cooperative and the administrative branch. The New Policies report does not touch on the revision of the Food Control Law since the report was compiled in the midst of the Uruguay Round negotiations. However, reform of the food control system is an indispensable condition for further development of Japanese agriculture. The food control system started immediately after World War II to protect consumers suffering from a food shortage. However, it has already been changed into a tool to protect producers. Yet, the system presently restricts producers' business activities, too. The rice farmers' weak point is that they have no say in the price of their own products. Distribution of farm products is usually concentrated to agricultural cooperatives, but, except for rice, farmers are allowed to sell their own products directly to consumers. However, the law prohibits rice farmers from selling or deciding prices of their own product except for one exception called the special purpose rice. A town in Nagano Prefecture has a farmers' production group which is designated by the government as a model of independent farming bodies. The group has its own rice retail shop. However, the law requires the farmers to sell their own rice after repurchasing from local agricultural cooperatives -- at least on the invoice. The procedure pushes up the price of rice sold there. Even in the model group, farmers cannot freely sell their own rice. Under such circumstances, can the food control system really protect interests of consumers? Food Control Law Must Be Drastically Revised The MAFF reportedly intends to seek the minimum revision of the Food Control Law. But this would not motivate farmers. We urge the MAFF to drastically revise the law to create rice farming for the 21st Century. To secure a younger farming population, it is necessary to encourage young people's entrance into the farming business regardless of whether they are from a farmer's family or not. The government has to prove that farming is a business they can be proud of. At the same time, the government is supposed to consider financial support for highly educated but landless farmers, following a successful subsidy system in France. Also, the government must take appropriate measures to promote farming in mountain villages, where farmers have regional disadvantages, for improving their productivity. In line with the New Policies report, the government enacted a special law in September to support farming in 1,700 local government bodies, whose productivity is relatively low. Yet, farm subsidies would not be enough. A new farm policy to vitalize these regions should be discussed as a combination of all existing regional development policies, as well as new measures. The government is expected to drastically review all policies for these regions, and to hammer out new comprehensive measures overcoming bureaucratic sectionalism. In that case, the government is supposed to attach importance to the creativity of local communities. This is because communities must have authority and financial resources to carve their way to the future at their own risk. The government should reconsider why local government bodies welcomed the former Takeshita administration's decision to allot 100 million yen to each local government with no restriction on purposes for expenditure.
