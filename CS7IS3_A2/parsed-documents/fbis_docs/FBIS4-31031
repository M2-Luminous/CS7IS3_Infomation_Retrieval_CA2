The March exports with payment in hard currency totalled approximately $495.2 million, which is 63 percent more than in February 1994 and 34.2 percent more than in March 1993. The March imports with payment in hard currency totalled approximately $439.4 million, that is, 24.2 percent less than in March 1993. Over the first three months of 1994 exports totalled $1,080 million, of which 51.9 percent went to developed countries, 29.7 percent to developing countries, and 18.4 percent to transition countries. Romania's major export partners were Germany, Italy, Turkey, and France.

Concerning exports, Moucha mentioned good ties with a Ukrainian company to which Roman-made tractors are being exported, the only tractors that manage to cross Siberia at extremely low temperatures. "We intend to set up a joint venture with a French company authorized by Renault. We already have a contract signed with that company for the import of motors and product integration. There is also a significant demand for our coaches equipped with Renault engines or with other engines, which have proved to be competitive on European highways," Moucha added. Among the Romanian truck factory's partners Moucha also mentioned Cuba, to which 22,000 trucks and diesel engines have been exported over the past years. "Cuba wants to re-equip 12,000 of its ZIL-type trucks, replacing their gasoline engines with diesel-oil-fuelled engines that are delivered by the Roman Ltd company. The factory also supplies cast iron parts worth $2 million annually to a German company and several other components to the United States and France," the manager of the Roman Ltd concluded.

He said the meetings preceded the signing of a loan agreement between the UBS and the National Bank of Romania on 6 May. The contract, he said, was a clear proof of the fact that international banking institutions have a vested interest in the development of the Romanian economy.

The largest and oldest Romanian manufacturer, RULMENTUL of Brasov produced 23.6 million bearings in 1993 -- a 25 percent production increase compared with the previous year. The factory also managed to increase its exports by 26 percent. This year the factory plans to manufacture 27 million ball bearings. Other contracts currently under negotiation with partners from all continents may boost production even further and increase the share of exports to 80 percent. The fact that Romania was granted most favored nation status has brought the U.S. market back among the top importers of Romanian ball bearings, and it may even place first this year among the factory's customers, with orders for some 15 million pieces. Other partners for RULMENTUL's exports are England, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, Argentine, Brazil, and Venezuela. This will regain the Brasov factory the position of seventh/eighth producer of ball bearings in the world and the third to fourth place in Europe. In this context, it is worth recalling that the factory has recently obtained an important credit for technological updating from the Japanese company Koyo, guaranteed by the Japanese Government.

The Germans will contribute 1.5 million marks in the next four years to the program that will materialize in 50 centers all over Romania. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1326 GMT 7 May 94) TRADE FIGURES: "For the first time after December 1989, Romania's trade in the first quarter of 1994 has registered a relatively balanced evolution and the biggest volume of exports, about $1.1 billion," Mihai Berinde, head of the Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Trade, said in a recent interview. The best results were scored in March, when exports amounted to $500 million, that is a 34.2 percent increase over the similar period of last year. Mihai Berinde considers that "conditions exist for Romania to increase its exports to the European Union and EFTA markets by at least 10 percent. The American market, following the redemption of the most favored nation status, will absorb some 20 percent more goods as compared to the Romanian exports there last year." The Romanian official said that "the Eastern market is also being regained," with the Russian Federation and Ukraine having returned to the first five places in Romania's foreign trade list. Free zones of mutual interest are expected to be created with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Bulgaria. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0732 GMT 10 May 94) DEVELOPMENT AGENCY REPORT: The annual report issued by the Romanian Agency for Development (ARD) states that participation of foreign capital in Romanian companies amounted to $144,419,780. The report proposes a number of concessions to be granted to the large foreign investors. ARD President Nicolae Jantea said the agency had undergone a structural change in 1993. The ARD has registered 8,683 companies with foreign capital worth over $144 million in 1993. The agency supplied information and assistance services to prospective investors in the fields of banking, commercial, insurance, telecommunications, services, trade, and so forth. The ARD proposed some amendments to the law on foreign investments. If they are approved, the foreign companies with a nominal capital smaller than $1,000 will not receive certificates of investors. On the other hand, the companies investing more than $10,000 would benefit from a set of facilities such as exemption from tariffs on raw and auxiliary materials, and lower income taxes. The facilities would be considerably larger for long-term (14 years) productive investments over $50 million, which integrate more than 60 percent of their production volume into the Romanian economy and export over 50 percent of their production. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1058 GMT 10 May 94) TRADE WITH BRAZIL: The volume of trade between Romania and Brazil stood at $54.4 million in 1993. Romanian imports, mainly iron ore and manganese, totalled $51 million dollars, which shows a trade deficit for Romania. As a consequence, a major objective for 1994 is to increase Romanian exports of tractors, farm machinery, and automobiles. Romania has already penetrated the Brazilian market with products such as passenger and freight cars, power transformers, and building materials. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0933 GMT 11 May 94) PRIVATIZATION OF TOURISM: "Without being a supporter of statistics myself, I feel that privatisation has already started and has even reached such a pace capable of leading to the end of the process scheduled for the beginning of 1996, when most of the touristic companies are to become private," Romanian Minister of Tourism Matei Dan told the business journal PERIODICAL. "Economic analysts can assess that Romania has witnessed a stable economic flow in the past two years, recording about 6 million foreign tourists arriving in, and 10 million Romanian citizens getting out," the Romanian minister said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0734 GMT 12 May 94) COMPANIES WITH FOREIGN CAPITAL: There were 112 companies with foreign capital of over $1 million in Romania at the end of April.

(Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0839 GMT 12 May 94) CAPITAL INVESTMENT: Sources in the Romanian Ministry of Industries say the investment effort in industry went up 35 percent in 1994, reaching $1 billion. However, to trigger a fast revitalization of all industrial sectors would take $3 billion, and the total cost of the process is put at $15 billion. "It is clear for everybody", CRONICA ROMANA notes, "that the most important thing now is to find solutions for capital injection in view of updating the industry". "We are vitally interested in attracting foreign capital", said Industries Minister Dumitru Popescu. "We have promoted a bill to this end for the attraction of investors bringing funds of over $50 million since we have had enough of petty investors". (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0843 GMT 12 May 94) COMPUTERLAND ROMANIA: The Romanian-American Company Computerland Romania, a participant in the Bucharest Computer and Electronics Romanian Fair CERF '94, is part of the Computerland International System, a world top in network installation, service and training in computer technology. "By its strategy -- concentrating on final users and full service -- as well as with the competence of its team, Computerland Romania is holding today a top position in the Romanian market, by the multi-vendor structure of the products distributed by it and also by its multiple services all across the country," Computerland Romania General Manager Nicolae Badea stated. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0856 GMT 12 May 94) GALATI FREE TRADE ZONE: The Galati Free Trade Zone, located near Galati port on the Danube close to the river mouth, has been established by a recent government decision. "By this free zone, Galati city can become one of the important turntable of Europe for the flow of goods," said the Galati County deputy- prefect. He said also that the decision to establish the zone was grounded mainly on the Galati Port's ideal transit position in the vicinity of the border with the Republic of Moldova and with Ukraine, thus with direct links to the CIS market, with direct links to both the Eastern and Western Europe, plus possibilities of links through the Danube and the Black Sea with the Middle East. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1351 GMT 13 May 94) ILIESCU, SAMSUNG TALK: On Friday, 13 May, President Ion Iliescu received a delegation of the Samsung company from the Republic of Korea, led by the general executive manager for Europe. The purpose of the Korean delegation's visit to Romania is to discuss the development of cooperation with its representative in Romania, ANA Electronic. That relationship is evidenced by a factory that assembles electronic products in Romania, and is capable of producing 100,000 color television sets annually. The assembly line will be ready for commission by the end of June this year. After the meeting with the Romanian president, the head of the delegation said that the main topics related to Samsung's cooperation projects in Romania, which permit multiple expansion opportunities, mostly in the production of basic electronic sub-assemblies, and that other programs were yet to be developed between the Romanian manufacturer and its South Korean partner. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1352 GMT 13 May 94) ELECTRONICS: There is a revitalization of Romanian electronics, writes the daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. That sector's exports in 1993 amounted to $165 million. The privatization of the electronics industry has started yielding fruit. Seventy joint ventures with foreign capital were set up, including 48 production units, with the remainder handling trade activities. The major investors are France, 11 companies; Italy, eight; and Germany, six. Activities include: 20 design, marketing, and consulting services, 10 producers of consumer goods, and eight telecommunications.

(Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1705 GMT 17 May 94) MINISTER ON IMPORTS, EXPORTS: Minister of Industries Dumitru Popescu stated in an interview: "Romanian industry has always had traditional partners in Europe and Central Asia, and it has developed various forms of international economic cooperation and foreign trade such as: import of technology and equipment from developed European countries, particularly in machine building, chemistry, metallurgy and so on; export of industrial finished products to European and Central Asian countries (metallurgical, chemical and petrochemical products, tractors, machine tools, bearings, building materials, etc.); turn-key projects by Romanian companies together with leader European companies for complex objectives in Central Asia (a good example being Iran); export of services in the industrial field -- consulting, technical assistance -- in Central Asian countries and construction-installation works in Europe. Exports to those areas, out of Romania's total exports, account for 39 percent to countries of the European Union and for 15 percent to Central Asian countries. Imports from the above-mentioned areas, out of Romania's total imports, account for 42 percent from European Union countries and for 5 percent from countries in Central Asia. Romanian industry is currently undergoing a transition to a market economy, which requires certain measures for its restructuring, modernization, and redevelopment, concurrently with measures for stepping up its privatisation." (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0552 GMT 18 May 94) SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: "Two percent of the gross domestic product would be enough to finance the national programme for research and development and to complete its projects," said Minister of Research and Technology Doru Dumitru Palade. He is of the opinion that half of the 2 percent could come from the state budget and the other half through direct contracts with beneficiaries of the work carried out by scientific research units. In this context, Doru Dumitru Palade mentioned that "the most severe issue" confronting Romanian scientific research is financing. Referring to the priorities in Romanian scientific research, the Romanian minister indicates as the main fields ecology, health care, agriculture, silviculture, food industry, information technology, communications, and transportation.

(Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1612 GMT 20 May 94) TRADE WITH POLAND DECLINES: Poland presently holds a modest place on the list of Romania's major trade partners after ranking third until 1989. In 1993 the volume of trade was put at merely $63 million. In an attempt to discover the causes leading to this situation, a ROMPRES editor turned to the commercial counselor of the Polish embassy in Bucharest, Grzegorz Matusiewicz, and to Mircea Toader, a director in the Romanian Ministry of Commerce. The Polish diplomat sees the situation as due to "a reform in economic instruments and the fundamental changes in the economic policies of Poland and Romania after 1989." "We consider that as far as Romania's debt of 47.1 million rubles is concerned, it could be repaid in Romanian products, for which Polish partners are showing interest," the Polish diplomat added, adding that "in the beginning, part of it could be covered by promotional activities." "The Romanian market is showing the same interest in Polish investments as other markets do." In turn, Mircea Toader showed that "the idea that came out of the talks with the Polish partners was that the future of our bilateral economic relations depends on the debt's being written off. We wish to return it in the supply of goods. We consider it necessary to reach a free trade agreement. If not, the level of customs duties could become an extremely heavy burden on Romanian-Polish trade, Toader said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1920 GMT 20 May 94) WESTERN LOANS VIEWED: In an article entitled "The West Has Released Credits to Romania" the daily ADEVARUL of 23 May comments on the significance of the new credits, which top the $1 billion mark, cautioning, however, that the country's foreign debt thus reaches about $4.3 billion, and wonders whether the government will at long last trigger the economic restructuring with this money. After the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has granted the first installment, worth $316 of the Stand-By Agreement, the World Bank released a restructuring loan worth $175 million. At the same time the Group of 24 assessed at its Brussels meeting that loans worth over $1 billion should be given to Romania in 1994, including the credits from the IMF, the World Bank, and the group of 24 itself. Adding to the money already issued by the respective financial bodies last week, there is a new long-term loan worth $250 million from the World Bank for the restructuring and privatization of industry and banking, which will be released next October. ADEVARUL says that this avalanche of credits marks a change in the West's views on Romania, being matched by an appreciation of the government's and the national bank's financial-economic policy. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0859 GMT 23 May 94) APRIL FOREIGN TRADE: According to a release of the National Statistics Board, Romanian hard currency exports amounted to $475 million in April, that is 3.9 percent less than in March, but 94.6 percent higher than in April 1993. Imports increased to $467.1 million, that is 6.3 percent more than in March and 56.6 percent more than in April 1993. Overall imports for the first four months in 1994 totalled $1,409.2 million. The import figures for the first four months of this year do not include the 2,677,800 tonnes of imported crude oil (worth some $241.2 million), since customs clearing documents for these imports have not yet been completed. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1300 GMT 25 May 94) LARGE SCALE PRIVATIZATION: Iacob Zelenco, president of the National Privatization Agency announced that large scale privatization in the economy will actually start on 1 July. Selective privatization will be replaced by an increased public offer of commercial companies put out for sale. The offer will cover whole sectors of the economy that can go private at a fast pace: consumer goods, tourism, trade, building materials, medicines, and cosmetics. Sectors with common characteristics are taken into consideration for this action: the production is based on domestic raw materials and is mainly designed for domestic consumption; there is a fast circulation of capital and no financial problems as a rule; and the branches are also attractive to foreign investors. The mass privatization will probably start on 1 July this year, when the National Privatization Agency and the World Bank experts are expected to have completed the necessary preparations. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0915 GMT 27 May 94) SAVINGS CURB INFLATION: The wise interest rates policy implemented by the National Bank of Romania in the past few months has increased the citizens' trust in depositing their domestic currency earnings with the banks -- the only exception being the state savings system known as CEC [expansion unknown]. This policy has determined a spectacular ninefold growth of bank savings from 20 billion lei in November 1993 to 178 billion in April 1994, which is indicative of the confidence the banks have earned among the average depositor. The situation has had a two-fold effect on inflation. First it curbed the tendency to purchase and hoard goods and convertible currency as protection against the depreciation of the leu. Second it provides the national economy with a noninflationary crediting pipeline. This new development has facilitated the return of the domestic currency market to normal, leading to the natural death of the dual exchange rates operating until not so long ago: the first one on the official bank and exchange offices market, and the other one the black market. This also signals the start of a process of price normalization, which always depends on the rate of exchange. Nevertheless, this balancing of prices will have to be considered in its dynamic evolution, by further allowing the U.S. dollar's current exchange rate to fluctuate in keeping with the rate of inflation (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0805 GMT 30 May 94) HARD CURRENCY RESERVES: According to figures released by the National Bank, Romania's hard currency reserves increased from $20 million to $600 million within five months. Such a spectacular leap would not have been possible without the recent agreement concluded with the IMF, which has helped the Romanian economy come out of its predicament. The progressive growth of Romanian exports and of public confidence in the monetary and currency policies of the National Bank of Romania have boosted the deposits of local residents with the merchant banks to $1,087 million by the end of April 1994. Compared to an aggregate $13 million personal savings in Romanian banks prior to 1989, individual deposits in hard currency in Romanian banks now exceed the figure of $250 million. The overall cash availabilities at national level stand at $1.5 billion, an amount that can cover three months' imports. All these positive developments, particularly in the foreign trade activity, are also reflected in the country's balance of foreign payments, where the deficit has been cut from $414 million dollars to $36 million within one year. A contribution to this remarkable improvement was made by direct investments of foreign capital, which grew to $102 million dollars in the first quarter 1994 from $25 million in the equivalent period last year. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1108 GMT 30 May 94) INDIAN INVESTMENT: The Birla Financial and Industrial Group of India plans to invest in Romania in several fields, mainly textiles, yarn and fibers.
