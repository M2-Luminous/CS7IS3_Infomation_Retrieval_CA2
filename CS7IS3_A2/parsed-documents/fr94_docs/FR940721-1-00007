FR940721-1-00007 FR940721-1-00003 Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;17&hyph;04 to require application of a slippage mark on each root fitting lug and bushing within 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS). In addition, this proposal would require, within 25 hours' TIS after the effective date of this AD and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hours' TIS, that the M/R blade assembly be removed and that the root fittings, root fitting lugs, lead-lag lugs, the M/R blade skin, and the doublers adjacent to the root fitting be inspected for cracks. This AD proposal also requires that the bushings be inspected for looseness and slippage, and that slippage marks be applied if not already present. Visual inspections of the exposed M/R blade skin, root fittings, root fitting lugs, and lead-lag lugs for cracks and inspection of the bushing slippage marks for movement are also required at intervals not to exceed 25 hours' TIS. The FAA no longer allows pilots to perform checks such as those contained in AD 91&hyph;17&hyph;04, paragraph (b). Therefore, a pilot would not be permitted to perform any of the proposed inspections in this AD. The FAA estimates that 1,000 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 22 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be ยง1,210,000. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39&hyph;8003 (56 FR 42230, August 27, 1991), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: Mcdonnell Douglas Helicopter Company and Hughes Helicopters, Inc.: Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;05&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 91&hyph;17&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8003.
