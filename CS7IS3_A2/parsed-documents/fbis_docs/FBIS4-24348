At one time, the Zimbabwe army was heavily committed in Mozambique and also facing the threat of South African destabilization, but now it seems there is going to be a peace dividend. From Harare, Rachel Rawlings reports: President Mugabe announced his government's intention to cut 15,000 posts in the army, thus reducing its size by about one-third [figures as heard]. Opening a new parliamentary session today, President Mugabe said the general tranquility within Zimbabwe as well as the South African elections and Mozambican peace accord meant the time was right for the cut, but he reassured any fears of sudden mass unemployment, saying the government wouldn't simply put on the streets the affected young men and women who have so loyally, selflessly, and gallantly defended the country's sovereignty. He said demobilization would be carried out in two phases and the former soldiers would receive training in civilian skills. The future of the army had been posing a serious problem. Zimbabwe's structural adjustment program calls for a substantial reduction in government's spending. The defense budget is massive, eating up nearly 10 percent of government expenditure, but it was increased last year despite the scaling down of military activities. This caused widespread dissatisfaction, because basic social services, such as health and education, became increasingly expensive for ordinary people. On the other hand, as unemployment spirals ever upwards, it could have been dangerous to have thousands of unemployed military personnel joining the millions already searching fruitlessly for work. The peace dividend might be a nice idea, but it won't be clear until next month's budget exactly how much money will be saved and whether any of it will be reassigned to other parts of government or whether most of it will be used up in the proposed retraining program.
