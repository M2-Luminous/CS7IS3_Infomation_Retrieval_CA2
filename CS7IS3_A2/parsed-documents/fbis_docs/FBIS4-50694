Addressing a high-level seminar on the post-evaluation of project performance, sponsored by the World Bank, Minister of Finance Jin Renqing [name and title as received] said that it is imperative to set up a post-evaluation system that supervises and controls state investment activities and increase investment returns and quality. Statistics show that the country's total investment will reach 1500 billion yuan this year and about 800 billion will come from the government. Jin explained that post-evaluation means investigation of social and economic activities carried out at present or in the past. Post-evaluation can give evidence of whether the investment activity is reasonable and effective or not and put forward suggestions and basis for future decision making. Jin said that as one of the important methods for macro-economic control, the post-evaluation system has been widely adopted in the world in recent years. In the year 1988, China began trial post-evaluations of major state construction projects. Up till now it has conducted qualitative analysis of 33 projects, nine of which use foreign investment. However, as Jin put it, China's post-evaluation lacks authority, fairness and transparency due to the fact that it is handled separately by state finance, planning, banking, and auditing departments. Jin Renqing pointed out that it is a very complicated task to establish a post-evaluation system best suited to China's national conditions. He said that the new system should be rational and operable, and in setting up such system, both the long- and short-term interests should be taken into account. "It needs time," Jin concluded. Officials from the Finance Ministry disclosed that so far two methods for setting up the system have been raised with the help of the World Bank. One is to establish a unified and independent state post- evaluation organ to coordinate supervision over the performances of investment projects nationwide. The other is to let the international engineering consulting company, the state auditing administration and other departments concerned carry out post-evaluation under the leadership of the State Planning Commission. At today's seminar, the second method received much support from participants. But Jin Renqing assured participants that after the post-evaluation method has been adopted throughout the country, China will certainly organize a state post-evaluation department. Information from the state Finance Ministry revealed that a basic construction finance office has been set up in the finance ministry, which will conduct financial management and investment benefits analysis on state major construction projects and external debts. The World Bank has promised to provide 400,000 U.S. dollars to help China invite world-famous consultants to carry out special-subject investigations on setting up a post-evaluation system in the country.
