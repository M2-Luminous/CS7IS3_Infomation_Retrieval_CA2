Tanzanian Vice-Minister of Home Affairs Edward Mwesaumo said in a statement March 26: "The United States is making haste with the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and threatening `sanctions' against the DPRK. This cannot be construed otherwise than a premeditated act intended to delay a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and stifle the DPRK." Mozambican Minister of Interior Manuel Jose Antonio said in a statement April 1 that nothing could be solved by war or pressure and all the issues should be settled only through peaceful negotiation. "The United States must renounce its policy of strength," he added. Chairman of the Zaire-Korea Friendship Association Pierre Welo Ahondju Ewale said in a statement April 1 that the United States, if it is truly willing to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, must stop at once, though belatedly, introducing Patriot missiles into South Korea and posing a nuclear threat to the DPRK and approach the DPRK-U.S. talks with sincerity. "If the United States venture invasion of Korea, we will join the heroic Korean people in the fight of justice against U.S. imperialism," he declared.
