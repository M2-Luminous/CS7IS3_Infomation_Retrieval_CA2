Publication of this notice is in compliance with notice 89&hyph;61. This is not a determination that the list of taxable substances should be modified. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing relating to these petitions must be received by May 13, 1994. Any modification of the list of taxable substances based upon this petition would be effective January 1, 1991. ADDRESSES: Send comments and requests for a public hearing to: Internal Revenue Service, P.O. Box 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044 (Attn: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (Petition), room 5228). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The petition for glycerine was received on February 21, 1990, and the petition for phenol was received on March 6, 1990. The petitioner is Dow Chemical Company, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. The following is a summary of the information contained in the petitions. The complete petitions are available in the Internal Revenue Service Freedom of Information Reading Room. Glycerine HTS number: 1520.90.00.00 CAS number: 56&hyph;81&hyph;5 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals propylene, chlorine, and sodium hydroxide. Glycerine is a liquid produced predominantly by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with an aqueous caustic carbonate solution, followed by the removal of water, sodium chloride, and other impurities by mechanical means, chemical extraction, and distillation. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 3 H 6 (propylene) + 2 Cl 2 (chlorine) + 2 NaOH (sodium hydroxide) + H 2 O (water) __> C 3 H 8 O 3 (glycerine) + 2 NaCl (sodium chloride) + 2 HCl (hydrogen chloride). According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 93.5 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $9.52 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for propylene of 0.67, a conversion factor for chlorine of 2.16, and a conversion factor for sodium hydroxide of 1.54. Phenol HTS number: 2907.11.00.00 CAS number: 108&hyph;95&hyph;2 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and propylene. Phenol is a solid produced predominantly based on cumene peroxidation. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 6 H 6 (benzene) + C 3 H 6 (propylene) + O 2 (oxygen) __> C 6 H 6 O (phenol) + C 3 H 6 O (acetone) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 78.9 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $6.33 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for benzene of 0.9 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.4. Dale D.
