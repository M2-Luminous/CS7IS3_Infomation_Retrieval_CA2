Some have been misled to say that the RPF might meet the government. Which government? Major General Romeo Dallaire for his part said on BBC radio that the talks will be between soldiers at the front and troop commanders at the front. He added that the talks are low level. Maj. Gen. Dallaire did not say what the aim of the talks is. There are two things which must be explained: Which people will the RPF meet and what is the aim of the talks? We refer here to those who may wrongly think that the talks concern a cease-fire. Going back to the first point, who will the RPF talk to? There are soldiers who have dissociated themselves from the clique of killers. These soldiers, in addition to meeting the RPF, even said they could work together with the RPF to plan how to get rid of the clique of killers. On the other side, there are soldiers and politicians who are part of the clique, for example government members. They cannot all hold talks with the RPF. The clique is the one which kills; it is the one the RPF is fighting, and the RPF will only relax once it has saved Rwandans from it. Therefore those who can meet the RPF and who can work with it are the ones who have distanced themselves from the clique. Even the talks would not be aimed at stopping the war. The talks would rather be aimed at removing the case for resuming the war. The reason for resuming war is that the Presidential Guards continue to kill innocent people, and the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militia continue to bereave the country in all corners. There are people like Rugambarara from (Bicyumbi) commune who have massacred people. Therefore the talks would be aimed at restoring peace to the country. This is one of the reasons why the RPF has resumed fighting. To restore peace in the country means annihilating the killers; to defeat the enemies of peace means continuing the fight until they are defeated. So, even if the talks took place, they would not be about a cease-fire but rather to form a coalition to fight the enemies of peace so that they are completely defeated. That means that they would be held between the RPF and those who have distanced themselves from the clique. We have always said that soldiers who really believe they are Rwandan soldiers should distance themselves from the clique of presidential guards and work together with the RPF. Many of these soldiers have always distanced themselves from the clique. They should show their courage and love for the motherland by officially declaring that they are with the RPF. Rwandans will thank them for that.
