ECLA, which also promoted protectionism and questioned economic opening, is now speaking the language of deregulation that all Latin American countries now use. Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos said this during the closing of ECLA's 25th period of sessions in Cartagena. According to Santos, "today ECLA regains its relevance by tuning into contemporary trends and tackling issues that are part of the economic and political agenda in each and everyone of our countries." In the official's opinion, ECLA thus regained its influence over Latin America during the Cartagena meeting. "In grasping the urgency of incorporating our countries into major contemporary trends of commerce and heading with renewed energy into the struggle against poverty, ECLA is again feeling the heartbeat of major Latin American issues," he said. In his opinion, the new ECLA faces the challenge of establishing economic guidelines in order to avoid at all costs continuing conditions that could foster violent social confrontations. The minister indicated that there are three priority topics on the agenda of all the Latin American and Caribbean countries: begin integration and productive modernization, and forge links between all social topics and policies. He thinks that the region now faces the challenge of emerging from a dangerous dilemma: it cannot compete with high production in terms of its labor force (like China, India, and Pakistan), neither can it compete in terms of the sophistication of its products, since it lacks design and high tech capabilities. "If we do not overcome this dilemma, we will continue to lose importance in the world market," Santos noted in disclosing that Latin America's participation in total worldwide exports has gone from 7.7 percent in 1960 to 5.5 percent in 1985 and 3.7 percent in 1992. This is a matter of raising the countries' productivity by incorporating the most advanced processes and systems. Once greater value-added status is achieved, the economy becomes less vulnerable to the fluctuations of international markets. "We cannot choose a strategy of competing with low wages at the expense of the impoverishment of our peoples or at the expense of artificially stimulating an undervalued exchange rate, which ultimately constitutes another reflection of the same impoverishment," the foreign trade minister indicated. Santos feels that to achieve modernization it is necessary to have policies within companies and through government action to create the adequate infrastructure, in addition to seeking greater efficiency in the financial market and making a big effort in education and training projects for the labor force. Area countries also have to strive to make multilateral agreements adjust to the idea of establishing a hemispheric free trade zone. Santos reported that at the end of the incumbent government's term Colombia will have free trade agreements with 22 countries. He pointed to the open integration approach through which they have been reached, namely, allowing other countries to join. "The Free Trade Agreement (TLC) can become a tool for regional integration," Santos indicated, referring to its characteristic as a broad agreement that includes topics other than commercial ones and that allows new countries to join. The big task of the area countries is to include social topics in the processes of economic opening and modernization. "The challenge that emerges in this process of change is establishing this new relation with the rest of the world in order to become a true source for growth and well-being," Santos noted. The idea is for the benefits of the new economic model to be distributed equitably. According to the foreign trade minister, "ECLA's overall approach, which establishes that it is impossible to separate economic and social policies, and its insistence on the importance of the concept of equity when discussing economic transformation, is precisely the kind of balance we want to reach in Colombia."
