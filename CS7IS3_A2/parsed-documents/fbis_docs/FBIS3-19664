Finland's operations in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, for their part, will extend further than the planned peacekeeping training, Foreign Minister Haavisto says. The agreement will be signed later in the spring, and Finland will at that point give its own declaration. Jarkko Juselius reporting: [Begin recording] [Juselius] The building blocks for Finland's security policy are slowly being gathered together in different places. It is starting to look apparent that Finland's observer membership of the Western European Union, WEU, will be implemented fairly quickly if Finland becomes an EU member. According to Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, Finland will take a stance on observer membership fairly quickly after the possible membership [in the EU]. Will Finland be ready when membership has been secured, or if it is secured, will Finland be ready immediately after that to take measures to become an observer member of the WEU? [Haavisto] There are no decisions on this but we will certainly take a stance, if and when membership starts. [Juselius] Immediately? [Haavisto] Fairly quickly after joining. [Juselius] Foreign Minister Haavisto does not yet speak of observer membership but Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, for his part, announced at the beginning of March that he thinks it is fairly clear that Finland will become at least an observer member of the WEU. [passage omitted] [Juselius] According to Haavisto, at the agreement signing ceremony Finland will present its own declaration on Finland's Partnership for Peace aims. [Haavisto] Yes, we will present our own declaration, where we will say that we are a partner giving help, making a contribution to this peacekeeping cooperation. [Juselius] Once more, when is this agreement going to be signed? [Haavisto] I cannot give you an exact date, but sometime in the spring. [end recording]
