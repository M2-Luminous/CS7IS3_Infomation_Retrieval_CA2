"Our people meet Lunar New Year's day, one of the traditional festive seasons, at this juncture of a forceful march toward a new victory, upholding the (Solar) New Year's day message (of President Kim Il-song), and cities and villages are filled with the rejoicing of workers, farmers and children playing such folk games as sledging, kite flying and top spinning," Radio Pyongyang was quoted as reporting on Friday. The report, noting that Lunar New Year day is one of Koreans' three traditional festive seasons, said, "the people clean their houses on New Year's Eve to send off the passing year and put on new clothing and eat special food on New Year's day to meet the coming new year." "The most important thing you must do on New Year's day is bow down to your parents and seniors in New Year's day greetings, as this is a custom observed on New Year's day only, and not in other festive seasons. "In the past, poor workers could afford to prepare only one or two plain dishes on Lunar New Year's day and the only jovial way for them to spend the festive day was to play a folk game." Radio Pyongyang was also quoted as reporting that North Koreans spent a joyful Lunar New Year's day "because of the sagacious leadership of Kim Chong-il in the preservation and development of the cultural assets of the nation handed down from generation to generation." Pyongyang resumed observing Lunar New Year's day in 1989, not as a public holiday but as a "substitute holiday" -- meaning that North Koreans must work on a public holiday in exchange for a day off on this substitute holiday. Just after the armistice ending the Korean war was signed in July 1953, North Korea stopped observing Lunar New Year, regarding it as a vestige of feudalism. On Lunar New Year's Eve in February 1989, Radio Pyongyang, celebrating the holiday's restoration after 36 years of oblivion, reported the people could once again observe the day as a traditional festive season through "the good offices of the dear leader (Kim Chong-il)." Celebration of Lunar New Year's day in North Korea appears to be quite different from South Korea. In South Korea the first event performed by every household on this traditional holiday is a rite in memory of ancestors, but in North Korea this custom is not observed, according to North Korean media. Instead Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il are eulogized through propaganda praising the Kims for restoring Lunar New Year's day as a traditional festive season, with the people told anew to pledge their allegiance to this father-son dynasty by visiting a nearby statue of Kim Il-song. In North Korea, Lunar New Year's day is not a day of family reunions, unlike in South Korea. In playing folk games, however, North Koreans are not much different than their brethren in the South: Sledging, top spinning, kite flying and other games are played on both sides of the border.
