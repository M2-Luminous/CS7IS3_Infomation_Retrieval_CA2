Now to give us the TEC perspective we have in the studio Mr. Joe Slovo. Good evening, Mr. Slovo, and welcome to Newsline. [Slovo] Good evening, Astrid. [Ascar] Zam Titus of the TEC delegation said today that the situation in the Ciskei is firmly in control. What do you interpret that to mean? [Slovo] I interpret it to mean that in contrast to Bophuthatswana [Bop] in the early stages the process so far has been a completely peaceful one, and we can only hope that it remains a peaceful one. From the news reports, it seems that the delegation from the TEC was well received, was welcomed, and it bodes well for the coming few days. [Ascar] What will the TEC's official response be to claims that the ANC [African National Congress] and its affiliates are attempting to purposefully destabilize the situation in homelands and independent states that are not ANC affiliated? [Slovo] The TEC has not addressed that question yet. Let me give my own view, and that is that there is absolutely no substance to that allegation. Neither in Bophuthatswana nor in the Ciskei was the trigger of events based on any ANC incitement. Indeed, in the case of the Ciskei. We were sitting at the TEC yesterday afternoon and we received a request from Mr. Mickey Webb on behalf of Brigadier Gqozo, asking the TEC to take over the Ciskei. So I don't believe there is any substance whatsoever in that suggestion. [Ascar] To whom would the TEC be accountable? [Slovo] Well, the TEC would be accountable in terms of its powers under the act to the law, and to the people of the Ciskei and to the people of South Africa. [Ascar] There has been reports that the TEC would be able to guarantee in some way or ensure that the pension funds will in fact be there--people do not need to fear that they will lose those funds after the elections. How will it ensure this? [Slovo] Well, we had the same problem in Bophuthatswana. One of the origins of the conflict there between the civil servants and Mangope was precisely this point, and it spilt over into other areas. We have managed to get across to the civil servants in Bophuthatswana the perception -- which is a correct perception -- that their pensions are guaranteed, their jobs are guaranteed, and they need fear nothing from the transformation. This is a problem which, of course, not only affects Bophuthatswana and the Ciskei, but is simmering in many other areas of South Africa and is obviously an issue which the TEC will have to address in earnest. [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, when you say it's simmering in many other areas of South Africa, could I ask you to be more specific? [Slovo] Well, one has heard reports of some activities in Lebowa and other homelands, where the civil servants are beginning to fear that perhaps the existing administrations will either run off with their cash, with their pension funds, and that there will be no guarantee that they will eventually get what they expect to get and what they are entitled to get. And I believe this problem is something which will have to be addressed across the board. [Ascar] Reports in the press today alluded to the TEC going into kwaZulu. Will you be referring to kwaZulu at all? [Slovo] Well, the TEC has not taken a decision to go into kwaZulu. The TEC has taken a resolution calling upon the kwaZulu government to allow free and fair election in its area and calling upon them to allow all buildings, police stations, etc., to be used for purposes of election and to allow the Independent Electoral Commission to operate there as they are operating in other parts of South Africa. No decision has been taken by the TEC as to any specific action which will be taken. And of course, depending upon the response of the kwaZulu government, the whole question of what the TEC does about it will have to be addressed and will have to be addressed very, very urgently. Indeed, the management committee of the TEC is meeting tomorrow afternoon to consider the kwaZulu response to the Johann Kriegler delegation from the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] which is there today. I have not yet heard a report of whether he has succeeded or not, but depending on what the IEC says, the Transitional Executive Council and its management committee will have to consider what action is necessary in the circumstances. [Ascar] All right, the TEC is considering what action will be necessary in kwaZulu. It did go into Bophuthatswana, and it has gone into the Ciskei. Surely there is a pattern emerging here. [Slovo] Not really, because in the Ciskei we were asked to take over by Brig. Gqozo. In the case of Bophuthatswana, we know that government had collapsed, the BDF [Bophuthatswana Defense Force] and the police were in revolt, there was a situation of chaos, and Mangope, if he ever had the confidence of any section of the people, had lost it completely. The situation was completely ungovernable, and it was necessary for the TEC to do something about the citizens in that country because they are South African citizens, and we were called upon. It would have been utterly irresponsible for the TEC to fold its arms and to do nothing about it. So there is no pattern. The only pattern that is asserted by the TEC is a pattern that every South African citizen -- whether in Bop or whether in Ciskei or whether in kwaZulu has an absolute right to take part in the election without hindrance, without [word indistinct] by any authority. And that applies to Bop, to Ciskei, and must apply to kwaZulu as well. [Ascar] Does the TEC, Mr. Slovo, have adequate resources to deal with all these situations that are arising? [Slovo] Well, it hasn't got an army. It hasn't got its own cash to dish around, but it has got the power to call upon the South African Government as it did in the case of Bophuthatswana -- as it might have to do if things turn badly in the Ciskei -- for the forces under general control of the TEC and the government to ensure that the situation remains stable. [Ascar] Does the TEC feel at all that it would have to deal with any resistance coming from people living in those areas? How would it deal with resistance coming form those people -- a kind of impression that: Well, these are outsiders. What would it do in that situation? [Slovo] I don't think that we can expect much resistance in the Ciskei, and we know that the only resistance really that occurred in Bop came from the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and from Terreblanche's rag bag army, which tries to come in and take over the place. And I don't believe that there will be resistance in the Ciskei, at least one hopes not. [Ascar] What will the TEC directive be to the two point administrators that have been appointed? [Slovo] If we'd follow the pattern of Bophuthatswana, it will be that they should establish an administrative council representing all sectors of Ciskei society, that they must regulate the affairs of Ciskei during the transition, that they must immediately facilitate the work of the Independent Electoral Commission and the Independent Media Commission and the Independent Broadcasting Commission, and the TEC, that they should meet the traditional leaders in order to inform them of the changes that are taking place, and assure them of their salaries and so on, and that they must take immediate steps obviously to assert financial control over all government funds and secure all government property. But also the key question, which the TEC in the case of Bophuthatswana made absolutely clear, is that we must reiterate that all public servants -- the police, the army, including those dismissed, and there have been some in the Ciskei by the former head of the Ciskei state -- are guaranteed their jobs, are guaranteed their salaries, are guaranteed their pensions. And that is one of the key questions we know at the moment in the Ciskei. [Ascar] You said that includes those who have been dismissed? [Slovo] Yes, there's a running sore in the Ciskei of thousands of civil servants who two years ago were dismissed and are still out of their jobs. That's an issue which will have to be addressed. [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, how do you think this will affect Brig. Gqozo's participation in the election? [Slovo] Well, it's up to him. If he thinks he can get any votes, he should have the complete freedom to participate in the election, and I don't believe he has any support whatsoever in the area. The decision to step down yesterday was perhaps the wisest decision he has ever taken in his life, and of course the election should be free and fair, and everybody including Mangope, including Gqozo, have the right to take part in the election as long as they don't use illegal means in the process. [Ascar] Have you had any reports about any looting or any incidents of violence in Ciskei at all? [Slovo] None at all up to now, and that is the most gratifying thing about the turn of events there, and one can only hope and pray and see to it that there is no violence, and that there is no repeat of some of the negative events which occurred for example in the early stages in Bop. [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, we thank you for your participation.
