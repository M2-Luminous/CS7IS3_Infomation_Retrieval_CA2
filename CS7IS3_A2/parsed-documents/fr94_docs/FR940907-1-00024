As prescribed in 32 CFR 5232.500, insert the following clause in fixed price solicitations and contracts for shipbuilding or ship conversion, alteration, or repair, when progress payments are based on a percentage or stage of completion: (Beginning of Clause) 5252.232&hyph;9100‚ê£PAYMENTS (FP) (DEC 1992) (a) Computation of payments. (1) Until such time as physical progress in the performance of work on a vessel is fifty percent (50%) complete, the Government, upon submission by the Contractor of invoices certified by the Contractor as hereinafter provided, will promptly make payments, on account of the total contract price, of ninety percent (90%) of the amount determined by multiplying the total contract price of such vessel by the percentage of physical progress accomplished in the performance of work on such vessel as certified by the Contractor subject to the approval of the Supervisor; provided , that no such payment shall be made in an amount which when added to the total of all payments previously made with respect to such vessel under (i) paragraph (a) of this requirement and (ii) the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of the allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related invoice to have been incurred in the performance of work on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors. (2) After the percentage of physical progress in the performance of work on a vessel has reached fifty percent (50%), the Government, upon submission by the Contractor of invoices certified by the Contractor as hereinafter provided, will promptly make payments, on account of the total contract price, of one hundred percent (100%) of the amount determined by: (i) multiplying the total contract price of such vessel by the percentage of physical progress in the performance of work on such vessel as certified by the Contractor subject to the approval of the supervisor, and (ii) subtracting from that product five percent (5%) of the total contract price of such vessel; provided , that no such payment shall be made in an amount which when added to the total of all payments made previously with respect to such vessel under paragraph (a) of this requirement and the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement exceeds one hundred five percent (105%) of the allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related invoice to have been incurred in the performance of work on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors; provided, further , that the Contractor furnishes data on actual cumulative costs and estimated future costs acceptable to the Supervisor which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Supervisor that the Contractor will make a profit of at least five percent (5%) on completion of the contract, and the Contractor provides updated information on a quarterly basis. If updated data indicate the Contractor will not make a profit of at least five percent (5%) on completion of the contract, the progress payments shall be adjusted retroactively so that the total of all payments made with respect to the vessel under paragraph (a) of this requirement and the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related invoice to have been incurred in the performance of work on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors or 100% of total contract price, whichever is less. (b) Invoices . Invoices may be submitted every two weeks, but not more frequently; provided, however, that if after contract award more frequent progress payments are approved by cognizant Government authority, this requirement shall be modified accordingly without additional consideration by the Contractor to the Government for such modification. No payment will be required to be made upon invoices aggregating less than five thousand dollars ($5,000). The Contractor shall certify on each invoice: (1) The percentage of physical progress in the performance of work on the vessel as a decimal carried to four places; and (2) The allowable costs incurred in the performance of the work on the vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors as of the date the invoice is submitted. Such certification shall provide for cost category reporting in accordance with the Contractor's normal accounting system and shall be broken down into direct material, direct labor, and indirect costs.
