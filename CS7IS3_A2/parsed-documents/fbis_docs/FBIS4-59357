Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, he categorically stated that India will not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) nor will it accept any "regional arrangement" on the issue under pressure from any quarter. He also reiterated his Government's commitment not to cap the missile programme. Referring to the just concluded official talks in London with the United States, the Indian Prime Minister said that no special significance should be attached to them as these would have no impact on the country's nuclear policy. Statements emanating from India at the highest level indicate that it is determined to unleash a nuclear arms race in South Asia. At present India operates eight nuclear reactors and has atomic research centres all over the country. In addition, six more reactors are under construction and another 14 have been planned for the next 20 years. There are confirmed reports that at the moment India possesses 40 to 60 nuclear warheads. Through its Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme initiated in 1983, India has developed five missile systems. It has successfully tested its intermediate range surface-to-surface missile, Agni, which has a range of 2500 kilometres which would ultimately be increased to 5000 kilometres. To keep all this hidden from the outside world, questions about India's nuclear programme cannot be asked in its Parliament under the Nuclear Energy act of 1962. It is only because of the threat posed by its bigger neighbour that Pakistan was forced to embark on its own nuclear programme. However, in the interest of peace in the region and to save it from a nuclear holocaust, Pakistan has offered seven different proposals to curb regional proliferation. All of these have been rejected by India on the pretext that it believes only in global nuclear disarmament. This is only a self-serving stance and an excuse for not signing the NPT. In an address to the Indian Defence Policy Forum in 1992, former US Secretary of Defence, Robert McNamara asserted that "by its refusal to accept the NPT, India is isolating itself and is now seen as a major barrier to further progress toward reduction of the nuclear danger". In January 1993, the Washington Post wrote: "There is growing consensus that it makes little sense to penalise Pakistan but not India, a far bigger power whose indigenous development of both nuclear and ballistic missile capacity continues unabated. In her address at the Command and Staff College, Quetta the other day, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto highlighted the same point: "The nuclear and missile threat to Pakistan is real and immediate. It is, therefore unrealistic and illogical to expect Pakistan to take unilateral steps. Sanity and reality demands regional nuclear solution". It is unfortunate that by pursuing a policy of benign neglect towards India's nuclear Programme, the West has complicated the region's nuclear tangle. The international community has to play its role in this connection and exert pressure on New Delhi to see reason and accept the imperative of a regional approach to dealing with the nuclear issue -- a potential threat to the existence of more than a billion people in the sub continent.
