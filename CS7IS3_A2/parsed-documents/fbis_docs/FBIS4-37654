The sources said that the party sent one of Barzani's senior aides to Baghdad, where he held talks 11 and 12 June. They confirmed that a KDP delegation including KDP Central Committee Member Yunis Ruzbayani and 'Izzat Sulayman Bik, a prominent party figure, visited Baghdad 10 June and met with President Saddam Husayn's son Qusayy. The results of the talks are not known. The sources said that the three figures [as published] went to the Iraqi capital via the Fa'idah point on the dividing lines between the areas under the Iraqi Army's control and the areas under the control of the Kurdistan Front [KF]. They added that Falak al-Din Kaka'i, a prominent member of Barzani's party, confirmed in an interview broadcast by the Voice of America's Kurdish service Sunday night that the Turkish Government had asked the party seven months earlier to start a dialogue with the Iraqi Government. [passage omitted] The same sources added that the KDP "perhaps interpreted the Turkish request as being a reflection of the Western and particulary the U.S. position." They did not rule out the possibility that the negotiations between Barzani and Baghdad might cause "more tension between the Kurdish leaders and, generally, in the ranks of the Iraqi opposition."
