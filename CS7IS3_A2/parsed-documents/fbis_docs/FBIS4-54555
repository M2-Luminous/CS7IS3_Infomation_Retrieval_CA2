The following is the text of the president's reply: I have received your letter confirming an interest in the speedy and comprehensive implementation of the Washington agreement. I maintain that it can already be said that since the agreement was signed Bosniak-Croatian relations have been developing in a positive way and that on the whole we can be satisfied with initial results. I agree with you, however, that everything should be done to implement as soon as possible the agreement in its entirety and that those impeding this positive process on either side should be neutralized. I firmly believe that it is possible and necessary to resolve all the issues you mentioned to our mutual satisfaction. I again stress that you can fully rely on all my influence in order to fully implement as soon as possible the agreements signed in Washington. I believe that my visit to Sarajevo will take place soon and I am ready to travel as soon as this is technically possible. I believe that this visit will facilitate quicker solutions of all open issues and the further development of mutual understanding and cooperation between the Croatian and the Bosniak-Muslim people and between the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia.
