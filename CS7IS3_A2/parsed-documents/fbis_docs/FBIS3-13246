[Basindwah] Good morning to you. [Abu-al-Majd] Minister, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih briefly visited Cairo on Wednesday and met President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. You attended the meeting. What were the main topics of discussion in light of the Yemeni crisis and the Egyptian role? [Basindwah] First, I would like to note that the ease with which the visit was quickly organized reflects the warmth of relations between Sanaa and Cairo. There are no formalities between the two countries. The hospitality was warm and as expected. Sanaa senses Cairo's interest in Yemeni developments. This is why President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih visited his brother His Excellency President Muhammad Husni Mubarak to inform him of the latest developments in the Yemeni crisis. He said that Sanaa fully accepts Cairo's mediation and role by President Mubarak to bring viewpoints closer. Sanaa always looks forward to Cairo playing its major pan-Arab role. Cairo has always been the source of hope for the Arab nation. [Abu-al-Majd] Were there new proposals to resolve the crisis, especially as the visit of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih came amid high tension between him and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who visited Cairo before signing the Pledge and Accord Document? [Basindwah] I believe that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's visit to Cairo did not come amid a deterioration of the crisis, certainly not on the military level. I believe the military crisis has virtually been defused. But there are continuing political differences and the ice between Aden and Sanaa must be melted. Cairo can play a major role here. Undoubtedly, there is agreement on particular things that Cairo will do. Sanaa and President Salih welcome this. President Salih hopes the credit for ending the crisis will go to Cairo. [Abu-al-Majd] What are the most important things Egypt will do to end this crisis? We have always hoped that we would see Yemeni unity take its natural and realistic course as a model for comprehensive Arab unity. [Basindwah] I cannot reveal much; we must take the advice of our noble prophet, may God's peace be upon him, especially in this blessed month of Ramadan, to be secretive when we go about our businesses. I can tell you that Cairo has a vision, a method to resolve the crisis. I believe this vision is reasonable and Cairo must work with the parties to the conflict to implement its proposals. Everybody must realize that the Yemenis' relations with each other are not relations between two peoples or two countries. We in Yemen are one Arab Muslim people, one Arab Muslim country. [Abu-al-Majd] What are Egypt's ideas on this concept? [Basindwah] Cairo believes the Pledge and Accord Document is the basis for heading toward ending the crisis. As long as everyone clings to the Document, we need only discuss the mechanisms of how to implement it. Undoubtedly, the implementation will take place within the framework of the Constitution. [Abu-al-Majd] But, Minister, the vice president and president were supposed to return to Sanaa after signing the document in the Jordanian capital, Amman. This did not happen and military clashes took place. Why did the crisis escalate and what do you believe is the solution? [Basindwah] Of course, the president, vice president, and the entire government were supposed to return to Sanaa after the Document was signed in Amman on 20 February. But we all know what happened. The signing was accompanied by military escalation. Let us be optimistic and hope that 'Id al-Fitr will introduce goodwill for Yemen and the Arab and Islamic nations as well as for the whole world. [Abu-al-Majd] But the Socialist Party, Minister, has some demands, such as arresting those who assassinated some of its leaders and other things. Is the People's Congress ready to meet these demands? [Basindwah] I cannot speak for the People's Congress because I am not a member. I belong to no party. I am independent, I repeat, independent, and I say this very frankly. But I also say that we, as government officials, need to cooperate to arrest all those who are proven to have been involved in the assassination operations. This is a group responsibility that we must all shoulder. None of us should attempt to weasel out of it. Anyone who tries to shy away from this responsibility must be punished and held accountable for doing so. [Abu-al-Majd] Minister, are there any mediators other than Cairo involved in trying to resolve the crisis? [Basindwah] There is a lot of mediation and from various sides but the more acceptable mediation comes from the brothers. [Abu-al-Majd] Is there any mediation from outside the Arab world? [Basindwah] Of course, some friends who are not Arabs are using their good offices continuously to reduce the tension. But there is no mediation in the sense of sitting round a table to discuss how to get out of the crisis. [Abu-al-Majd] Can you give us some examples of these mediating countries from outside the Arab world? [Basindwah] Of course, heading these countries is the friendly United States. [Abu-al-Majd] Is this mediation acceptable to both sides? [Basindwah] Both sides accept this mediation. There are also the good offices of the European Union. And there are the constructive and objective efforts or positions of Japan, Russia, China, and many friendly countries. [Basindwah] But what, for the Yemeni people, is the closest mediation that could realize a final solution to the crisis? [Basindwah] The mediation of the brothers, primarily Egypt.
