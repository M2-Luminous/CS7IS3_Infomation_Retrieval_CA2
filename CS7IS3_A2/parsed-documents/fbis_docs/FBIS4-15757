[passage omitted] At present the situation in Rwanda is continuing to deteriorate. The aborted cease-fire talks produced no result. The events in Rwanda have dealt a serious political blow to the Arusha peace process and the United Nations' peacekeeping operation has been put in jeopardy. Russia calls on the opposing sides to halt hostilities immediately and to resume a constructive dialogue with the participation of all the country's political forces in order to settle the domestic political conflict in Rwanda as soon as possible on the basis of the Arusha accords and the relevant UN Security Council decisions, said the representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
