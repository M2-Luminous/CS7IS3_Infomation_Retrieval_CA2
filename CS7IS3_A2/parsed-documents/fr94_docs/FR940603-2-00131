FR940603-2-00131 FR940603-2-00083 SEI proposes to market the SCN program to both affiliated and unaffiliated utilities and/or their respective customers. The program and related services would be sold to unaffiliated parties at prices to be negotiated based upon the fair market value thereof. As currently required under the terms of the Original Orders, SEI will make the proprietary technology incorporated into the SCN program available to the Operating Companies without charge (except for the actual expenses incurred by SEI in making such program available). If an Operating Company requests SEI to provide any related service, e.g., software support, training of Operating Company personnel, maintenance of the customer's equipment, or the like, SEI would be the associate company for the costs of such services, determined in accordance with rules 90 and 91. Under the Original Orders, SEI has entered into Service Agreements with SCS and each of the Operating Companies (other than Savannah, which was not then a subsidiary of Southern) pursuant to which personnel and other resources of SCS and the Operating Companies may be made available to SEI, upon request, to support SEI in connection with its authorized activities. Under these agreements, SEI is obligated to reimburse SCS or an Operating Company, as the case may be, for the cost of such services, determined in accordance with Rules 9 and 91. The cost of services provided by an Operating Company to SEI includes all direct charges and certain indirect costs, such as pension costs, insurance, payroll taxes, and payments to employee benefits plans, and a portion of the administrative and general expenses of the Operating Company. The existing Service Agreements also obligate SEI to make any new intellectual or proprietary property, processes, programs, computer or other data bases, support services, training and other facilities and techniques developed in the course of SEI's business available for utilization by other Southern system companies without charge, except for the actual expenses incurred in making the same available, to the extent that SEI has or retains proprietary rights therein. Under the Service Agreements, SEI has a reciprocal right to receive such intellectual property from SCS and the Operating Companies without charge, except for the actual expenses incurred in making the same available. SCS and the Operating Companies propose to continue to render services and provide other resources to SEI in connection with SEI's authorized activities in accordance with the existing Service Agreements, as amended, to reflect the changes to SEI's authorized business activities and to comply with the Commission's rules relating to the rendering of services or sale of goods directly by SEI or indirectly by the Operating Companies and SCS to EWGs and FUCOs in which Southern holds an interest. SCS and the Operating Companies will not, without requesting the further approval of the Commission, render any services or sell any goods directly or indirectly to any EWG or FUCO in which Southern holds an interest, except pursuant to the Service Agreements, as herein proposed to be amended. Southern proposes to invest in SEI up to an aggregate of $250,000,000 from time to time through December 31, 1998, in addition to any investments in SEI that Southern shall have made pursuant to previous authorizations, including but not limited to the 1987 Order, prior to the effective date of the order in this proceeding. It is proposed that such additional investments may take the form of any combination of cash capital contributions to SEI, loans to SEI by Southern, and loans to SEI by one or more lenders other than Southern that are guaranteed by Southern. SEI proposes to issue promissory notes (``Notes'') from time to time through December 31, 1998 to Southern or to lenders other than Southern which have been guaranteed by Southern, provided that the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Notes at any time outstanding and Southern's additional investments in SEI shall not exceed $250 million. The Notes would have maturities no later than December 31, 2003, and would bear interest at a rate of not more than 3% over the prime rate at the bank to be designated by Southern in the case of Notes issued to lenders other than Southern, and a rate of not more than the prime rate in the case of Notes issued to Southern. In connection with any sale of Notes to lenders other than Southern, a commitment fee may be paid in an amount not greater than 1/2 of 1% of the principal amount of the Note. It is anticipated that any such Notes may be guaranteed by Southern as to principal, premium, if any, and interest. It is further proposed that the Notes issued to Southern may, at the option of Southern, be converted to capital contributions to SEI through Southern's forgiveness of the debt (including any accrued interest) represented thereby. Southern also proposes, from time to time, to guarantee or act as indemnitor of commercial sureties required to support bid bonds and performance and other obligations (other than securities or other financial instruments) issued or undertaken by SEI in connection with its authorized activities. It is therefore proposed that Southern may (i) provide such guarantees of, and similar provisions and arrangements concerning, the performance and undertaking of other obligations by SEI (or any subsidiary of SEI), or of any Project entity (including but not limited to EWGs and FUCOs) in which Southern holds a direct or indirect interest, and of other obligations relating to SEI's authorized activities, and (ii) provide such indemnifications of and with respect to persons acting as surety on bonds or other obligations on behalf of such companies, in an aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $800,000,000 through December 31, 2003; provided, that any guarantees or indemnifications outstanding at December 31, 2003 shall continue until expiration or termination in accordance with their terms; and provided further that the aggregate amount of such authorized guarantees or indemnifications of sureties shall be reduced dollar for dollar by any similar guarantees or indemnifications of sureties made or incurred by Southern pursuant to authority requested in File No. 70&hyph;8173 in connection with the business activities of Development.
