FR941107-2-00156 FR941107-2-00089 [Release No. 34&hyph;34920; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;40] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Automatic Execution of Index Option Orders October 31, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on October 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Phlx proposes to codify the eligibility of index options for its Automated Options Market (``AUTOM'') System and its automatic execution feature (``Auto-X''). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Autom is the Exchange's electronic order routing, delivery, execution, and reporting system for options. Orders are routed from member firms directly to the appropriate specialist post on the Exchange's trading floor. Certain market and marketable limit orders are eligible for AUTOM's automatic execution feature, AUTO&hyph;X. These AUTO&hyph;X designated orders are automatically executed at the disseminated quotation price on the Exchange and reported to the originating firm. Those orders not eligible for AUTO&hyph;X are manually handled by the specialist. The AUTOM system has operated on a pilot basis since 1988, when it first was approved by the Commission for market orders of up to five contracts for twelve Phlx near-month equity options. 2 AUTOM has been extended and amended several times since. 3 Most recently, the pilot program was approved to operate until December 31, 1994. 4 In 1991, the Commission approved the use of AUTO&hyph;X as part of the AUTOM pilot program. 5 Orders for up to 100 contracts are eligible for AUTOM and orders for up to 25 contracts are eligible for AUTOM&hyph;X. 6 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25540 (March 31, 1988), 53 FR 11390. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 25868 (June 30, 1988), 53 FR 25563; 26354 (December 13, 1988), 53 FR 51185; 26522 (February 3, 1989), 54 FR 6465; 27599 (January 9, 1990), 55 FR 1751; 28265 (July 26, 1990), 55 FR 31274; 28978 (March 15, 1991), 56 FR 12050; 29662 (September 9, 1991), 56 FR 46816 (permitting AUTO&hyph;X orders up to 20 contracts in Duracell options only); 29782 (October 3, 1991), 56 FR 51247 (permitting AUTO&hyph;X for all strike prices and expiration months); 29837 (October 18, 1991), 56 FR 55146 (permitting AUTO&hyph;X orders up to 20 contracts in all options); 32559 (June 30, 1993), 58 FR 36496; 32906 (September 15, 1993), 58 FR 15168 (permitting AUTO&hyph;X orders up to 25 contracts in all options); and 33405 (December 30, 1993), 59 FR 790. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33405, supra note 3. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28978, supra note 3. 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32000 (March 15, 1993), 58 FR 15168. At this time, the Phlx proposes to codify its existing practice of accepting index option orders for execution through AUTOM and AUTO&hyph;X. Currently, AUTOM and AUTO&hyph;X are available for all Phlx options, including both equity options and index options. Although the term ``index options'' was not specifically employed by the Phlx throughout the AUTOM pilot program, Exchange research indicates that index options became AUTOM-eligible in June 1990, and AUTO&hyph;X-eligible in March 1991. Since then, the Exchange has included index options trading when it reports volume information and makes capacity representations to the Commission as part of the AUTOM pilot. Accordingly, codifying index options into the AUTOM pilot does not raise new systems capacity concerns, as AUTOM has operated without problems since index options have been included in AUTOM; specifically, the Exchange has not experienced systems problems or received formal customer complaints related to index options trading on AUTOM.
