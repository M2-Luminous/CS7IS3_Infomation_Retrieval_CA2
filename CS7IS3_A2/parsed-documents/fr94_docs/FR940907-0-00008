The debtor will be given 30 days from receipt of this letter to inform FmHA of its intent, 90 days to finalize the payoff, and will be notified that an election to pay off FmHA would require the execution of a Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement, similar to that provided in Guide 5 of this subpart (available in any FmHA Office); or (B) If the debt is not paid off at the net recovery value, FmHA will proceed to liquidate the loan. (f) Debtor responses to debt restructuring and net recovery value calculations. Responses from the debtor will be handled as follows: (1) Acceptance of FmHA's restructured debt offer. When a debtor accepts the offer for debt restructuring, processing will be in accordance with ยง1951.223 (c) of subpart E of part 1951 of this chapter using the adjusted unpaid principal and outstanding accrued interest at the Administrator's approved interest rate and terms. The debtor will be required to execute a Shared Appreciation Agreement which will provide that, should the debtor sell or transfer title to the facility within the next 10 years, FmHA is entitled to a portion of any gain realized. This agreement will include language similar to that found in Guide 4 of this subpart (available in any FmHA Office). The original of Form FmHA 1956&hyph;1, with appropriate attachments signed by the State Director, and a copy of the Shared Appreciation Agreement will be sent to the Finance Office. Note: All documents pertaining to this transaction will be sent to the Finance Office in one single complete package; and (2) Acceptance by debtor to pay off loan at the recovery value. Processing of this transaction will be in accordance with ยง1956.124 of this subpart. However, the account does not need to be accelerated. The debtor will be required to execute a Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement, similar to that found in Guide 5 of this subpart (available in any FmHA Office). The original of Form FmHA 1956&hyph;1, with appropriate attachments signed by the State Director, and a copy of the recorded Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement will be sent to the Finance Office. The executed Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement will be recorded in the county in which the facility is located. The Finance Office will credit the accounts of debtors who entered into Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreements with the amount paid by the debtor (net recovery value). Note: All documents pertaining to this transaction will be sent to the Finance Office in one single complete package. (g) Collection and processing of recapture. (1) When FmHA becomes aware of the sale or transfer of title to the facility on which there is an effective Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement (Guide 5 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office) or a Shared Appreciation Agreement (Guide 4 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office) outstanding and a determination is made that a recapture is appropriate, FmHA will notify the debtor of the following: (i) Date and amount of recapture due; and (ii) FmHA action to be taken if debtor does not respond within the designated timeframe with the amount of recapture due. (2) When the recapture is received, the payment will be processed on Form FmHA 451&hyph;2 as a miscellaneous collection in accordance with subpart B of part 1951 of this chapter. The Form FmHA 451&hyph;2 along with a copy of the Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement (Guide 5 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office) or Shared Appreciation Agreement (Guide 4 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office), as appropriate, will be forwarded to the Finance Office. (3) When the amount of the recapture has been paid and credited to the debtor's account, the debtor will be released from liability by using Form FmHA 1965&hyph;8, ``Release from Personal Liability,'' modified as appropriate. (h) No recapture due. If FmHA determines there is no recapture due, the Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement (Guide 5 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office) or Shared Appreciation Agreement (Guide 4 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office) will be appropriately annotated, the Recapture Agreement released from the record, and the Agreement returned to the debtor. 4. Section 1956.147 is amended by revising the word ``borrower'' to read ``debtor'' in paragraphs (a)(3)(iv) and (a)(3)(v)(B). 5.
