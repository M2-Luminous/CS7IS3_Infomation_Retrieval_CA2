Kim said, "The structure of industry has to be transformed into one which consumes less energy." The Chief Executive made the remarks during a report from the Advisory Council for Science and Technology at Chongwadae [presidential offices]. After the report, the President hosted a lunch for the 10 council members and seven related Cabinet ministers on the occasion of the first anniversary of the council inauguration. President Kim also said that products which do not contaminate the environment much have to constitute the mainstream of exports, calling for added efforts to foster people's awareness of environmental protection and energy conservation. Pointing out the fierce confrontation between the United States and France during the Uruguay Round negotiations, President Kim accented that a comprehensive plan should be mapped out to sharpen the national competitiveness of the domestic video industry in preparation for the coming multimedia era. "Our video industry, in fact, has been lagging far behind those of advanced countries chiefly because of a lack of creative ideas and financial shortcomings. This problem should not be left unattended," he said. He emphasized the fact that the video industry is a more value added one than manufacturing and will become promising in the coming century. Kim added that national leap into the ranks of advanced nations is possible only when science and technology backs, calling for development of Korean technology. Prof. Pak U-hui of Seoul National University said that government officials' understanding of science and technology development remains low in terms of budget allocation and law. He also said that officials are not catching up with the change of times. President Kim said that the officials have to change their way of thinking in the era of the World Trade Organization.
