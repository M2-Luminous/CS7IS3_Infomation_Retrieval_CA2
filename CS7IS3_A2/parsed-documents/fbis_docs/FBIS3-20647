A high-level official of the Chinese nuclear industry said today that the nuclear power industry hopes to build multi-unit nuclear power bases along the coast. The economic prosperity of the coastal areas makes the poverty of energy resources in those areas all the more striking. Experts estimate that by 2020, installed nuclear power capacity on the mainland could reach 20,000MW, raising its proportion of the total annual electric power output of the country from the presently weak 1 percent up to about 5 percent. China's energy resources are unevenly distributed, and the shortage of energy resources in the eastern and southern areas is particularly evident. Economic, safe, and clean nuclear power is one way to end the energy crisis, and reduce the transportation pressures and the harmful environmental effects caused by thermal power. China will pursue an electric power development strategy of "lead with thermal and hydropower, supplement with nuclear power," and will give consideration to building more nuclear power plants in the coastal areas. In their individual development of nuclear power plants, Zhejiang and Guangdong have been very constructive. Other coastal provinces that are now expressing their interest in building nuclear power plants are: Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hainan, and Shandong, some already making early-stage preparations, and others proceeding with commercial discussions. The development of China's nuclear power industry will be done cautiously. The official added that financing is China's biggest problem because of the high costs and long construction periods required. Investment resources for future nuclear power construction must come from many sources, through national and local investments, raising money locally, bank loans, and foreign loans and export credits. China welcomes foreign investments as a means to speed up electric power construction through joint ventures with foreign investors, or independent investments in thermal and hydropower projects, but whether foreign investments can be accepted in the nuclear power arena hasn't been decided yet.
