Lieutenant General Basie Smit, Major General Krappies Engelbrecht, and Lieutenant General Johan le Roux were suspended last week after the Goldstone Commission report implicated them in gun smuggling and violence. Mr. Justice Goldstone said in a statement that this information and any other information received would be handed to the international team investigating the allegations. The Johannesburg newspaper, THE STAR, reported earlier that the commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, said that unless he received additional information on the so-called third force from the Goldstone Commission, he would order the suspended generals to resume duty tomorrow. Gen. van der Merwe said the attorney general was assessing the prima facie value of the evidence, and he expected to hear from him soon.
