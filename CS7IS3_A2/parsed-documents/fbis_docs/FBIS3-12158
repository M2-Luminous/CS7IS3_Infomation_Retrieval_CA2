The ministers raised proposals for the prime minister's attention and consideration. These proposals will be worked out by the prime minister and then raised for discussion at the cabinet meeting on 27 February. One proposal was to remove dangerous residents if there is evidence that they are Kakh members. Another was to pay compensation to the casualties. A third proposal was to establish a national inquiry commission. Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer told our correspondent Karmela Menashe that the government is determined to accelerate the peace process. Minister Amnon Rubinstein noted that for the first time, a closure was imposed also on Jewish residents in Hebron and Qiryat Arba' and that they cannot move without permission. At the end of the meeting, Police Minister Moshe Shahal said that the police are currently operating in 12-hour shifts. Units were reinforced in all sensitive places, particularly in Jerusalem. The police minister added that the attorney general raised several proposals during the meeting, including removing Jewish residents from their homes, a move which according to the attorney general, has a legal basis. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports the closure was expanded to encompass the whole of Judaea and Samaria, and to close down the Cave of the Patriarchs for 48 hours. The closure on the Gaza Strip, imposed this morning, as well the curfew imposed on Hebron and Bethlehem following the murder, are continuing.
