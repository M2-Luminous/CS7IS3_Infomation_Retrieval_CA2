This IZVESTIYA correspondent has learned that, at a Ukrainian Defense Ministry Collegium session 21 January devoted to the training of military personnel in the country's higher educational establishments and the strengthening of discipline among the troops, Lieutenant General Vladimir Mikhtyuk, commander of the Strategic Missile Forces 43d Missile Army stationed in Vinnitsa, and Major General Nikolay Filatov, commander of the 46th Missile Division from Pervomaysk in Nikolayev Oblast, unexpectedly and without prior arrangement took the Ukrainian military oath. Major General Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th Missile Division stationed in Khmelnitskiy, refused to take the Ukrainian oath at this collegium session and stated that he would not even do so before his own combined unit -- where 40 percent of the officers do not want to swear an oath of allegiance to a fatherland yet again. That accounts for 413 of the 1,017 officers in the division. Of these, 354 want to move to Russia for the rest of their service, while the others want to be discharged to the reserve and go to live back home. Given that, before last Friday, the leading personnel of the missile army and missile divisions stationed in Ukraine as well as the overwhelming majority of other missile officers had not sworn loyalty to Ukraine, this step by the Defense Ministry Collegium is being seen by some observers as a direct challenge to the policy announced by President Leonid Kravchuk in the sphere of his state's nuclear missile disarmament, and as an attempt to complicate and delay this process as long as possible, to make it as unpredictable as possible, and to nullify cooperation with Russia in carrying out the START I and II treaties. As is well known, there are 176 strategic RS-18 liquid-propellant missiles (90 in Khmelnitskiy and 40 in Pervomaysk) and RS-22 solid-propellant (all 46 in Pervomaysk) launch systems with 1,250 nuclear warheads plus 650 air-launched cruise missile assemblies [bloki] in Ukraine. The Strategic Nuclear Forces Administrative Command and Control Center is located there, and the creation of nuclear space forces has been announced. The elimination of the strategic nuclear complex along with the country's fulfillment of its commitments under the Lisbon Protocol to join the Nonproliferation Treaty as a nuclear-free state represents for many Ukrainian generals -- particularly those who had recently moved to top jobs in the Kiev Defense Ministry -- the complete end of their careers. They will naturally do all they can to prevent it. Meanwhile the situation in the Ukrainian Missile Forces -- this is no secret to specialists -- remains very complex despite all the reassuring statements from Ukrainian generals. Many missile systems have come to the end of their warranty and inspection and maintenance [reglamentnyy] servicing period. The state does not have enough money to carry out the servicing. In 1993 Ukrainian specialists stood down two RS-18 strategic missile regiments in Pervomaysk and Khmelnitskiy (10 RS-18's each). The nuclear warheads were dismantled and sent to technical storage bases, the missiles were removed from their silos, their oxidants and fuel were transferred to special tanks, and the missiles were loaded onto railcars and prepared for dispatch to "Yuzhmashzavod" in Dnepropetrovsk. But each dismantled missile still contains up to 100 kg of a highly toxic substance -- one of the components of the missile fuel. The equipment to degasify them does not exist, nor does the technology for processing the heptyl. The plant turned out not to be ready to receive these missiles. It was necessary to remove them from the railcars and transfer the toxic liquids from the rail tanks into other containers. The dismantling of obsolete [vysluzhivshikh svoi sroki] missiles has been halted indefinitely. There are neither the warehouses, nor the specialized transportation, nor the funds to handle them. Officers are angry that they are being forced to do such a dangerous and senseless job. Their service conditions and their pay are far lower than in Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces. For instance, a missile division commander in Ukraine earns 2.2 million coupons-karbovantsi a month. If this sum is expressed in Russian rubles [R] at the actual exchange rate (24 to 1), it turns out that a Ukrainian general is "valued" less than a Russian lieutenant -- who earned around R100,000 in December 1993 and will have been earning 90 percent more as of January. Moreover, last month Ukraine's missile troops received their pay literally on the eve of the New Year, after major scandals at the Finance Ministry, and have not yet seen any money this January.
