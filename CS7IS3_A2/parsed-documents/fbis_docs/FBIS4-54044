"The decision to resume (the negotiations) is welcome, and I strongly hope constructive discussions will be made for the further development of favorable bilateral relations," he said. Toyoda, however, said the automobile issue is basically a private affair and it is necessary for industries of both sides to join forces to arrive at a settlement. Toyoda, who will become head of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) on Friday, pledged that the Japanese automobile industry will faithfully implement its action program announced in March to steadily increase imports of auto parts from U.S. suppliers. Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., said the Japanese industry will contribute toward settlement of the automobile trade issue between the two countries. A senior government official said Toyota President Tatsuro Toyoda will call on U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale in a few days to discuss the automobile issue.
