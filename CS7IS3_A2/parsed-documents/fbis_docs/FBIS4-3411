The six-year project will cost a total of 538.84 million yuan, including 40 million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans. The program aims to transform 15,394 hectares of red-soil land, with 12,300 hectares of land to be opened up for planting fruit trees and creating grassland. On the rest of the land, about 230,000 lean-meat pigs and 1,000 dairy cows will be raised. The program also includes reconstruction of a 100,000-ton fodder factory and a silk textile plant. The program is strong on ecological development, with a focus on integration of farming, animal husbandry and fruit tree cultivation. It will also rationally allocate resources to infrastructure construction and to setting up a social service network. The program encourages farmers to go to the mountains to open up red soil land with contracted targets.
