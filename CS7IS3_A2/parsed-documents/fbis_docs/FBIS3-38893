This can be testified by the blood spilled so far: 10 deaths and some 40 wounded. However, the worst could be around the corner. The final weeks of the Italian mission in Somalia promise to be very risky indeed. [Senate Speaker] Spadolini has understood this and has asked for a rapid end to a match that started off badly, "without any particular willingness on our part," and got worse, "involving a diplomatic relationship -- including the United Nations -- that was always tense and painful." For some time now Defense Minister Fabbri has been echoing these sentiments. Some objective consideration is called for, independently of the fact that the day before yesterday 29-year-old Giulio Ruzzi lost his life there: Operation Restore Hope has not untied any of the knots in the Somalia crisis. According to a report from the UN security forces, General Aidid is actually planning a major attack against the UN troops once the Westerners have left. His main enemy, Ali Mahdi -- the interim president whose men control the area around Balad -- would like to get back the hundreds of pounds of old guns that were seized from him by the Italians, since he is convinced that after 31 March he will have to defend himself -- with arms -- against his eternal enemies. General Carmine Fiore, the commander of Ibis 2 confirmed from Balad that the danger was real. "I have a problem admitting," he said on the telephone, "that the days between now and 31 March could be tough days." Indeed, this was predicted. Nevertheless, we were not expecting an attack of the kind which took place Sunday [6 February] and which cost the life of one of our men, but we did know that it would be tough. With the Somalis you must always be on your guard. [Caprile] General, why this ambush along the Imperial Road? [Fiore] I have been given an explanation. A dozen families all belonging to the same clan -- the Abgal, which is also Ali Mahdi's clan -- live in that area. Recently, a district commissioner (a sort of governor -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) was elected who appears to be favoring those in his family a bit too much. So where do we come in? Some people got it into their heads that we have sided with that man. That is why they shot at us on Sunday. [Caprile] What do you intend to do now? [Fiore] I have convened the heads of these families for a meeting tomorrow: I want to make it clear once and for all where things stand. I hope to succeed. But I repeat: With the Somalis you can never tell. [Caprile] What will happen in Somalia once you have left? [Fiore] If I had been asked that question a week ago I would have been able to give an optimistic reply. Now, I am decidedly pessimistic. I am not saying that things will end up badly, but I fail to see -- no matter how you look at it -- how things can be put back together. It is nothing more than a squalid struggle for power. [Caprile] How is the morale among the troops? [Fiore] Great, despite everything. They are well-trained men who are used to this kind of stress. [Fiore interview ends] From Fiore we move on to Bruno Loi, the former Italian commander in Somalia, who was often targeted by Butrus-Ghali for his "attempts" to find a political solution to the Somalia puzzle. He has made a list of all the mistakes, underestimations, and omissions that can be blamed on the United Nations in the management of Operation Restore Hope. According to the commander of the Lightning Force, the most serious mistake was "believing, in bad faith, that the Italians cheated and that they wanted to increase their prestige for who knows what purpose." According to the general, the fact that someone at UN Headquarters thought that the Italians were "stacking the deck" was a "mistake" caused by jealousy about our successes, as well as by the need to maintain specific interests in the region. The list of UN gaffes, which is signed by Loi, begins with the fact that "it did not believe in the mediation capability of Italy, which has had a presence in that area for about a century." Another disastrous decision was to occupy only the southern part of the country, thus allowing the warlords to continue increasing their war arsenals in the center and north. According to Loi, the mission command is also responsible for "failing to fully exploit the element of surprise to disarm armed gangs." Initially, too much credit was given to General Aidid, thus failing to comply with the requirement of impartiality. The same Aidid was then "excessively demonized," when it became clear that he could not be a reliable ally. According to Loi, when the decision was made to carry out reprisals for the damage done by his militia, Aidid's political image was blurred and the "wildly delivered blows" against him ensured that he was reassessed as a genuine hero. Other UN mistakes denounced by Loi were: believing that only the leaders of the political factions were reliable interlocutors; failing to take account of the fact that the model of democracy proposed to the Somalis was in the Western mold and could therefore cannot be exported to that environment; and the fact that no provisions were made for the country's economic reconstruction. Loi also accused the United Nations of creating an excessively bureaucratic military command and of putting together contingents that were too different and therefore unmanageable. One final mistake was the reprisal for the massacre of the Pakistanis in June 1993. "We have never been against the use of force, but between a slap in the face and the atomic bomb there are a great many intermediate degrees of force that could be used effectively."
