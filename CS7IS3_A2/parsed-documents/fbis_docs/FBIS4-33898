Bolanos described the summit called by the United States in December as a quasi-hemispheric meeting. Without Cuba, he said, the meeting will not be a meeting of all American countries. Bolanos also said Cuba will ask to the host the 1999 summit. [Begin recording] [Bolanos] This summit is taking place in a different international environment; for example, regional integration efforts are stronger at this fourth summit than at previous ones. On the eve of this summit, the Group of Three will sign a free trade treaty. The Association of Caribbean States has emerged as we approach the summit, and while it is true that the purpose of this association is not to promote integration, it aspires to promote agreements, cooperation, and trade and therefore contributes to integration. This summit overshadows the so-called hemispheric summit, which I prefer to describe as quasi-hemispheric because a small part of the hemisphere will not be represented. The region's heads of state will meet to design what the North Americans call a Latin American [words indistinct] policy, which we cannot [words indistinct] in Latin America, a policy that is obviously trying to lay the groundwork for a new version of the policy the United States set for Cuba and Latin America in the 1970's with the Alliance for Progress and Cuba's expulsion from the OAS and to take a firmer grip on the Latin American market to check growing competition from Japan and the European Community. That is the context for the Cartagena summit, and that is why it will be different from the first, second, and third summits. We always attend summits with the purpose of obtaining specific results based on what we think is best for the region. We want results that foster integration, cooperation, and everything that contributes to the progress in the region and to a reaffirmation of regional identity. As a great Cuban intellectual used to say, by reaffirming our identity, we also define our differences from those who are not like us. [Otero] Does Cuba expect any support or declaration by the presidents against the U.S. economic blockade? [Botellos] [Words indistinct] a delayed resolution. I do not think this summit will do less than that. I think we will make progress because the world is different and there have been events with contribute to the issuance of a resolution more advanced than that issued in Bahia last year. Observers and political experts analyzing this summit agree that the Bahia summit revived the principles established in Guadalajara and projected them in a very Latin American dimension, especially the development aspect, which is what hurts our region. Our region's main problems are the results of underdevelopment. The Bahia summit promoted discussion of this issue with the well defined intention of encouraging development not just for its own sake but for social progress. I think this was [words indistinct] the organizers of this summit. Any intention to [words indistinct]. [Otero] You referred to the hemispheric summit as a quasi-hemispheric summit. Many believe this summit was convoked by the United States simply to interfere with the Ibero-American summit. Do you agree or do you think it is the result of a strategic policy by the U.S. Government? [Bolanos] I do not think the United States has ever liked the Ibero-American summit. From the time the United States became a country, it has grown accustomed to influencing Latin America. I do not know if convoking that summit is the result of a policy, a doctrine, or of a need to prevail. [Words indistinct] have always existed to influence and dominate Latin America. The Ibero-American Summit is a different project, an Ibero-American project that has a cultural basis, historical roots, and common problems, a project that includes Europeans who are not the most developed of that continent. There is a feeling of equilibrium that would not exist if the North Americans participated. I think the quasi-hemispheric summit is a call to a meeting that has [word indistinct] intentions, the same intentions and ideas that motivated the founders of the Ibero-American summit, but the fact that Cuba is excluded highlights the difference between the spirit of that call and the spirit of the Ibero-American summits. That summit is intended to establish a policy that is not responsive to Latin America's needs, that includes discrimination against Cuba, and that forces Latin America to a sad dichotomy: going along with the principles set by the United States with a revision of its 1970's policies and turning their back on the Latin American people. [Otero] Thank you very much. [end recording]
