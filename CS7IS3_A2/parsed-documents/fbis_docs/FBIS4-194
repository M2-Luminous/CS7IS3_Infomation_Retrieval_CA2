A report issued by a commission of enquiry set up by five human rights groups said 201 people had been killed and 23 were missing in the wake of clashes between government forces and Chad National Front rebels in the town located 500 kilometers northeast of here. The government at the time said that 30 rebels and two soldiers were killed when the armed opposition group attacked the garrison in Abeche on January 23. Most of the rebels, who had earlier agreed to a ceasefire and then reportedly turned on the government forces, reportedly escaped with a number of weapons. But the commission of enquiry said that 201 people had died, either in the original clashes or in army mop-up operations in the town afterwards, and that there had been numerous cases of torture, rape and pillage by government forces against the civilian population. "All cases of summary execution were the work of the gendarmes and of the soldiers, mostly the Republican Guard whose main leaders are known and have been identified," the report said. The Republican Guard is an elite army unit which takes its orders directly from the head of state. The government forces combed the city looking for rebels who might have gone into hiding after the original clashes "and this operation very quickly turned into a man-hunt", according to the report which spoke of 136 people killed in the city and the others nearby. The investigators also met with 23 captured rebels who were being held in very poor conditions and of whom those wounded were not receiving medical attention.
