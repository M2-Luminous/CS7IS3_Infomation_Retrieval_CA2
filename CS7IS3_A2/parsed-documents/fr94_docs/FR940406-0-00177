FR940406-0-00177 FR940406-0-00012 A. Safety Standards As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA has evaluated several safety rulemakings for their potential impacts on light truck fuel economy in MYs 1996&hyph;97. These include revisions to FMVSS Nos. 208, Occupant Crash Protection; 214, Side Impact Protection; 216, Roof Crush Resistance; 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment; and 201, Occupant Protection in Interior Impacts. In addition, the agency is considering whether to propose a safety standard to improve rollover protection. 1. FMVSS 208 On March 26, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 12472) a final rule requiring automatic restraints on trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5500 pounds or less. These requirements phase in at the following rate for each manufacturer: 20 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995; 50 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996; 90 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1996 to August 31, 1997; and all light trucks manufactured on or after September 1, 1997. Thus, the requirement will affect 50 percent of MY 1996 light trucks and 90 percent of MY 1997 light trucks. Although light truck manufacturers may comply, as passenger car manufacturers have in the past, with the automatic restraint requirements by using automatic belts or air bags, NHTSA expects that essentially all light truck manufacturers will comply by using air bags. To encourage the use of more innovative automatic restraint systems (primarily air bags) in light trucks, during the first four years of the phase-in (i.e., through MY 1998) manufacturers may count each light truck equipped with such a restraint system for the driver's position, and a dynamically tested manual safety belt for the right-front passenger's position, as a vehicle complying with the automatic restraint requirements. Beginning with MY 1999, however, all light trucks are required to provide automatic restraints for both the driver and right-front passenger positions. Title II of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required NHTSA to amend its automatic restraint requirements to mandate that 80 percent of MY 1998, and all MY 1999 light trucks be equipped with driver and passenger-side air bags. On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule in the Federal Register (58 FR 46551) to implement this requirement. Since NHTSA expects that essentially all manufacturers will rely on air bags for compliance with the light truck automatic restraints requirements, this provision should have a negligible substantive impact, and will not affect MYs 1996&hyph;97 fuel economy capabilities.
