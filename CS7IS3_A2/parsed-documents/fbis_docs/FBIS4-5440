FBIS4-5440 "dreas069_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 North Korea Failure of Talks Blamed on U.S.-ROK `Conspiracy' Failure of Talks Blamed on U.S.-ROK `Conspiracy' SK0904044994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0440 GMT 9 Apr 94 SK0904044994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Dirty Conspiracy of Master and Stooge"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The abortion of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks and the creation of a grave situation on the Korean peninsula are a result of the filthy conspiracy between the U.S. master trying to stifle the socialism of Korea and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique who are courting the favor of the master and attempting to slay fellow countrymen with his help, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. The news analyst notes: In return for its "commitment" to the "security" of South Korea from "nuclear threat of the North," the United States forced the puppets to open the South Korean rice market, bear heavier burden for the maintenance of the U.S. troops in South Korea and introduce Patriot missiles and other weapons in larger quantities. Accepting all the demands of the United States, the South Korean puppets sold off the dignity and interests of the nation to the master. They made no bones about committing such flunkeyist treacheries as entreating the master to set the exchange of special envoys between the two halves of Korea as a precondition for the third-round of DPRK-USA talks in an attempt to meddle in the "nuclear problem" without any power and capacity. The abortion of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks and the creation of a grave situation on the Korean peninsula are entirely attributable to such disgusting conspiracy between the United States and the South Korean puppet clique. If the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is to be solved and the strained situation is to be eased today, an end must be put to the U.S. hostile policy to stifle Korea, and such a flunkeyist traitor as Kim Yong-sam must be removed from the power and their criminal tieup be smashed.
