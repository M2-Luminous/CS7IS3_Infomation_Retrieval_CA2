It is the first clear sign of the new plan backed by the military leadership to severely punish illegal immigration. The frustrated refugees were arrested on a beach near Petit Goave, a small port city located some 60 km west of Port-au-Prince, two independent radio stations reported in the Haitian capital. Emile Jonassaint, the provisional president appointed by the Haitian military leadership, following his installation in power two weeks ago, warned that he would punish anyone caught violating the island's laws, especially the law condemning those who leave the country without visas or proper documents. Several analysts said the Army and other enemies of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide hope to reduce the escape of Haitians to prevent the United States from deciding to use its military strength to resolve the political crisis in Haiti, which has lasted 30 months. Preventing the entrance of Haitian refugees has been one of the primary objectives of U.S. policy since the bloody military coup that overthrew Aristide in 1991. Since the coup more than 40,000 persons have fled Haiti in boats. Since President Bill Clinton announced two weeks ago that his country would give Haitians the possibility of requesting political asylum instead of returning them to the island, more than 1,200 persons have been caught at sea and sent back to the Caribbean nation.
