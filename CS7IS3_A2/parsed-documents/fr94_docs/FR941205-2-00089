FR941205-2-00089 FR941205-2-00049 The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). 14 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and not to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, and dealers. 14 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b)(5) (1982). The Commission believes that the proposal will ensure adequate protection to investors because the rule as amended will only afford priority to those transactions that improve the established market for the spread, as measured by the aggregate price of all legs of the transaction. Because the rule provides that at least one leg of the transaction must be executed at a better price than the established market for the option and that no leg of the transaction may be executed outside of the established market for the option series, the Commission believes that this change affords greater protection to the limit order book and therefore, that customer limit orders will not be disadvantaged. Furthermore, because the Rule currently requires that one member must represent all legs of the trade and that the trade may only be executed against one other member, public customers are still less likely to lose priority to hedge orders. The Commission believes the proposal is a reasonable effort by the Phlx to accommodate the ability to price hedge orders more competitively while at the same time not disadvantaging the public customer limit order book. The Commission also notes that the priority principles applicable to synthetic options remain unchanged, i.e. , the option leg will have to be executed at a price better than the established market in order to receive price priority. 15 15 See supra notes 9 and 10. The Phlx has created a new Advice, OFPA F&hyph;14, that restates the definitions of hedge orders contained in Rule 1066(f) and enumerates the priority principles contained in Rule 1033. Additionally, the Phlx has amended OFPA F&hyph;4 to, among other things, require the marking of order tickets executed in reliance upon the spread priority rules. OFPA F&hyph;14 simply restates the definitions and principles already established in Rules 1066 and 1033 for easy reference by floor traders. Moreover, the amendment to OFPA F&hyph;4 merely crates a new trade identifier for synthetic options similar to that already required the hedge orders. Accordingly, the Commission believes these changes raise no new or unique regulatory issues. Several other changes are applicable only to foreign currency options. The Phlx has added Commentary .02 to Rule 1066 to provide a definition of multi-spread transactions, and new paragraph (h) to Rule 1033 was created to allow multi-spread transactions in FCOs for the same account to be executed as a single transaction in accordance with spread priority principles. Although the Commission has been concerned that granting priority to ratio orders and multi-part transactions would allow institutional orders to preempt public customer orders, the Commission believes the above changes are appropriate in the context of the FCO market only for several reasons. First, the Commission notes that the FCO market is dominated by institutions and sophisticated corporate investors who regularly utilize ratio orders and conduct multi-spread transactions. Second, because the number of public customer orders placed on the books of foreign currency specialists is not significant, preemption of customer orders is unlikely. Third, the priority rules applicable to multi-spread transactions mirror the priority rules currently in place for three-way spread type orders, as stated in Rule 1033(e). Because a multi-spread order, as defined by Commentary .02 to Rule 1066, combines two-way and/or three-way spread transactions (to a maximum of six legs for the total transaction), and must be for the same account, the Commission believes that this change will allow institutional investors to better utilize sophisticated trading techniques involving FCO's without altering the existing priority principles applicable to three-way orders.
