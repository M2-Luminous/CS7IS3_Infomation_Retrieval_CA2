FBIS4-28558 "dreas112_a_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Tokyo, Washington To Cooperate in Industrial Technology Tokyo, Washington To Cooperate in Industrial Technology OW1006062494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0609 GMT 10 Jun 94 OW1006062494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States on Friday [10 June] reached a set of accords to promote bilateral cooperation in basic civil industrial technology, officials said. The agreements center on development and dissemination of "precompetitive technologies," said Hiroshi Kashiwagi, the head of the industrial science and technology agency, an organization under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Kashiwagi briefed reporters on the talks, which were held in Japan. Technological cooperation covered under the talks, the second of their kind, is part of the agenda set under the trade "framework" negotiations. The first round of talks were held in Washington last December. Mary Good, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for technology, who headed the U.S. delegation, said, "I believe the agreement is going to lead to very substantial collaborative efforts in the areas where we have not cooperated before." During the three days of high-level sessions -- Tuesday in Kyoto, and Thursday and Friday in Tokyo -- both parties agreed to launch a joint government-private sector campaign for enhancing the technological foundation of the two countries under the "industrial technology initiative" scheme. The scheme will include an expanded interchange of researchers, financial assistance by Japan to major U.S. universities, and promoting information-sharing on publicly owned technological data. Under the scheme, Japan and the U.S. will also conduct joint research and development on about 10 scientific themes that do not involve direct competition between the two countries, Kashiwagi said. A research center, called "The Techno-Growth House," will be constructed in Japan to promote the scheme. The research house is designed to provide research space and accommodation at reasonable charges for foreign researchers. It can also be used for offices and conferences. Kashiwagi said about 10 areas to be studied jointly will include database development for chemicals, environmental technology, know- how on measuring instruments, bioprocessing studies, ceramics, machinery technology and rare materials. "We have chosen the areas which are of great interest both to Japan and the U.S.," Good said. She said studies on ceramics, bioprocessing and technical database may be launched by the end of this year. Friday's accords will be formally announced in a joint statement to be made before the July Naples summit of the major industrial countries by Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. The accords will be reflected in Japan-U.S. talks to find ways to promote economic harmonization in other areas of the trade framework talks, Kashiwagi said. The next round of high-level talks on civil industrial technology cooperation will be held in the U.S. in October.
