FR940810-0-00136 FR940810-0-00021 The following sentence is added to the end of the paragraph: ``Do not reuse or reload cassettes for asbestos sample collection.'' The practice of reusing cassettes can result in lower estimates of employee exposure. Adequate cleaning of the cassettes cannot be assured. Fibers from the cassette may become dislodged and be collected on the filter during subsequent sampling. Employee exposure assessments are often assessed based on a small number of fibers. This is because it is not possible in every work place to use single cassettes for an entire work shift due to excess dust in the air. This is significant for occupational exposures, because the background fiber concentration must be subtracted from the compliance sample. If fugitive fibers from used cassettes were deposited on the blank filter, the background estimate would be artificially high and the employee exposure will be underestimated when the background concentration is subtracted as required. Elimination of the practice of reusing cassettes will eliminate this source of error, thereby better assessing employee exposure. A requirement that cassette reuse not be allowed is added to the end of paragraph 2 of Appendix A. Paragraph 11 is revised as follows: 11. Each set of samples taken will include 10% field blanks or a minimum of 2 field blanks. These blanks must come from the same lot as the filters used for sample collection. The field blank results shall be averaged and subtracted from the analytical results before reporting. A set consists of any sample or group of samples for which an evaluation for this standard must be made. Any samples represented by a field blank having a fiber count in excess of the detection limit of the method being used shall be rejected. The original wording of the standard was inadequate to apply meaningfully to certain sampling practices, such as continuous sampling. This change establishes that the blanks are to be field blanks. This wording also establishes when blanks are to be taken. The specific practice to be followed for blank correction is outlined in Appendix B, the detailed analytical method. Each time an evaluation of work place exposure is made for the purposes of this standard, the samples used in that evaluation must be represented by valid blanks taken in the work space where the compliance samples were taken. The following changes apply to the Quality Control Section. Paragraph 2 is renumbered 2(a). Since the standard was promulgated, the lack of a specific requirement to participate the Program for Analytical Testing (PAT) has led to confusion with the requirement that laboratories participate in a round robin using samples taken from real world samples. A second paragraph is added directly following 2(a) and is denoted 2(b). 2(b) All laboratories should participate in a national sample testing scheme such as the Proficiency Analytical Testing Program (PAT), the Asbestos Registry sponsored by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). This is a requirement of OSHA method ID&hyph;160 and NIOSH 7400. This requirement was originally left out of the standard because of the uncertain status of the PAT program at the time of promulgation of the standard. Inclusion at this time is to make it clear that the required participation in a round robin indicated in paragraph 2(a) is not satisfied by participation in the PAT program. Such participation is however, highly desirable and may be required for private accreditation. Since the original promulgation of the asbestos standards, there have been several improvements and refinements to the analytical procedure. Two major analytical methods reflect these changes and continue to be updated as necessary. The changes are mostly procedural, providing safer analysis and clearer descriptions of the procedures that are to be carried out. As a result, Appendix A and Appendix B have been updated to reflect the most recent refinements. Changes to the mandatory asbestos method Appendix A are intended to clarify some of the requirements of the method. Wording has been inserted to indicate what methods are acceptable. A definition of what constitutes a ``set'' of asbestos samples was added to more clearly define when blank samples are to be taken and to reinforce that they are to be field samples. Paragraph 11 is amended to clarify what a set of samples is and when it is necessary to take blank samples. An early draft version of NIOSH method 7400 was used for the model of Appendix B. There were several problems with the method including the potentially dangerous practice of boiling acetone. This appendix has been replaced entirely with the most current version of OSHA method ID&hyph;160 Asbestos in Air. The OSHA ID&hyph;160 give the same results as NIOSH 7400 when used within the sampling constraints imposed by Appendix A, notably the flow rate limits of between 0.5 and 5 liters per minute for the 25 mm cassette and 1 to 5 for the 37 mm cassette. The counting rules are functionally the same for both methods. Use of Appendix B, OSHA ID&hyph;160 or NIOSH method 7400 when used within the constraints of Appendix A are all acceptable and equivalent. Appendix B is the same as OSHA method ID&hyph;160 on the date of publication of these changes. It, like NIOSH method 7400, is subject to change when such changes will result in better methodology. As the PEL has been lowered to 0.1 fiber/cc, there is an increased concern about sample overloading as voiced by several commentors such as the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). Such overloading is the presence of non-asbestos dust on the surface of the filter obscuring the filter surface. Such dust has been shown to decrease the number of fibers counted even before the surface is fully obscured. Some employers have taken samples in such a way that there are no representative samples for the work being performed because all of the filters have been obscured by excess dust. The intention of Appendix A is to provide for the most precise measurement possible while allowing for the fact that many work places have an exceeding amount of non-asbestos dust. Appendix A suggests that a sample be collected such that there are a minimum of 100 fibers/mm2. In many work places this is not possible. It is preferable to collect a sample that can be used to estimate the asbestos concentration even if it is with a higher than ideal error level than it is to collect a large volume and completely obscure the filter rendering the sample useless. An acceptable weight of dust on the filter is highly dependent on the average particle size of the dust. Very small particles such as those from diesel exhaust will quickly obscure the filter with very little weight (much less than 1 mg on the filter). On the other hand, large particles may load the weight up beyond several milligrams with little loss in fiber count. For 5 micrometer diameter particles with a density of 3, 25% of the filter area will be obscured with a total weight on the filter of 1mg. Increasing the average diameter of the particles to 10 micrometers will double the allowable weight to 2mg. It is very important for the person conducting sampling to be careful about the dust levels in the air. It is acceptable to take a series of samples to model the work place air when serial sampling will result in samples that can be used. Serial sampling has the additional benefit that higher asbestos concentrations can be measured by reducing the volume of air drawn through each filter. Appendix G OSHA is removing appendix G from the construction standard. The rulemaking proceeding and the Agency's experience enforcing the unrevised standard showed that this ``non-mandatory'' appendix was unclear and that portions of it belonged in the regulatory text. Former appendix G covered controls for all four classes of asbestos work. Therefore, OSHA has extracted the main provisions covering various controls and practices required for each class and placed them as discussed in the regulatory text applying to each operation covered.
