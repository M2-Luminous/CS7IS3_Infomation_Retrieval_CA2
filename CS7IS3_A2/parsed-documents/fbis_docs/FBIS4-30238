FBIS4-30238 "dreas122_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 South Korea KGB Source: DPRK Developed Nuclear Detonator KGB Source: DPRK Developed Nuclear Detonator SK2406113994 Seoul YONHAP in English 1129 GMT 24 Jun 94 SK2406113994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 24 (YONHAP) -- The former Soviet Union's KGB believed back in 1990 that North Korea already secured a nuclear detonator, the SANKEI SHIMBUN here said in a dispatch from Moscow on Friday. Quoting a story appearing in the Friday evening issue of IZVESTYA, SANKEI said the report filed by KGB to Soviet leadership in February 1990 said in part, "North Korea already has its first nuclear detonator and is simply withholding its test to keep it a secret." The KGB report said that it had obtained from a reliable source the information that North Korea was indulging in research on the production of nuclear weapons in a bid to maintain a military edge over South Korea and join the group of nuclear countries. Explaining about difference between "nuclear detonator" and "nuclear bomb," IZVESTYA reportedly said the existence of a nuclear detonator means there are nuclear weapons. The contents of the report have high credibility as it was prepared by Col. V.L. Smolinov of 16th department of KGB's Second General Bureau, IZVESTYA added.
