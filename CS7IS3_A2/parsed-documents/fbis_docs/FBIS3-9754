He added the amendment could have the form of a certificates clause to the Czech-Slovak payments agreement. Another condition is the conclusion of an inter-state agreement dealing with cases involving certificated foodstuffs which would not meet the prescribed quality. A commission of experts is to be set up to make out the list of "sensitive items" and to define conditions of their exchanges. The above measures do not apply to re-exported goods whose import is possible only if accompanied by certificates from the importing country. Measures facilitating the implementation of the agreement are to be worked out by May 1, the date until which Slovakia had for the time being postponed the realization of its request for obligatory food certification. Slovakia started to require certificates for food imports on February 11. One week later, on the request from Prague, it suspended the measure temporarily. Later, the former government of Vladimir Meciar said it would reintroduce the certificate request as from April 1, but the new government of Jozef Moravcik, which was appointed on March 16, postponed the measure minimally until May 1.
