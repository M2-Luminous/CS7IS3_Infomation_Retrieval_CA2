FR940511-0-00040 FR940511-0-00015 Despite the ecological arguments that support inclusion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the Sanctuary boundary, NOAA does not believe that the public has had ample opportunity to analyze and comment on the proposal to add the Strait. Since the Strait of Juan de Fuca lies entirely in state waters, the Strait of Juan de Fuca cannot be included without the approval of the Governor of Washington State. However, NOAA will pursue expanding the boundary if supported by the State of Washington. Comment: The boundary of the Sanctuary should be contiguous with that of the proposed Northwest Straits Sanctuary. A gap between these two proposed sanctuaries would cause confusion for commercial shipping and fishing interests and government managing agencies. Response: At this time, the future and nature of the proposed Northwest Straits National Marine Sanctuary is uncertain and cannot serve as a deciding factor in the determination of the eastern boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. The boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary must be determined based on ecological and human use factors. NOAA can modify the boundary in the future if it is deemed appropriate. NOAA will coordinate with existing managing agencies to ensure that the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary and the proposed Northwest Straits National Marine Sanctuary do not unduly disrupt the management of vessel traffic and fishing. Comment: The boundary of the Sanctuary should not encompass the waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca because closely-monitored vessel traffic lanes already exist. Response: The MPRSA encourages multiple uses of the Sanctuary as long as they are compatible with the resource protection goals of the Sanctuary. Clearly, the Coordinated Vessel Traffic System in the Strait of Juan de Fuca is in the best interest of the vessel traffic industry and the environment. NOAA would not interfere with the vessel traffic management regime in the Strait of Juan de Fuca if the Governor of the State of Washington supported inclusion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the Sanctuary boundary. Northern Boundary Comment: The northern boundary of the Sanctuary should be adjacent to the international border and include vessel traffic lanes to facilitate the establishment of a cooperative international sanctuary and coordinated vessel traffic management regime. Response: The northern boundary is adjacent to the international boundary. Inclusion of the Estuaries Comment: NOAA recognized both the high resource values of the estuaries and the high level of point source discharges. By including the estuaries in the boundary NOAA would be in a position to work with the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) to correct the sources of pollution. Response: NOAA has been working with the Washington Department of Ecology to address pollution problems in the coastal estuaries. The Grays Harbor Estuary Management Plan was supported by funding provided pursuant to the Washington Shorelands Management Act. NOAA agrees that the estuaries are extremely valuable environments with high levels of point source discharges. However, NOAA believes that the estuaries are ecologically distinct from the offshore waters of the Olympic Peninsula, which is the core area of the Sanctuary. Inclusion in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) is a more appropriate management framework for NOAA involvement in estuarine management. Comment: The estuaries should be excluded from the Sanctuary boundary because the Washington State Coastal Zone Management Program and the Grays Harbor Management Plan offer sufficient protection to the estuaries. Response: NOAA agrees. The estuaries are excluded from the preferred boundary of the Sanctuary.
