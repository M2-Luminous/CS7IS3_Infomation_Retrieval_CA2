After the Prosecutor General's Office had expressed interest in the utilization of this sum, officials from the State Inspection Department carried out an inspection and submitted their conclusions in late January. Thus, it turned out that the government headed by G. Vagnorius had allocated $870,000 to the Security Department, while the acquired special purpose facilities (arms, ammunition, bulletproof jackets, and so on) were worth only $393,705. Inspectors failed to establish where the remaining $476,295 had gone, because they did not find any documents in the former Security Department and banks justifying the utilization of the residual sum. The Lithuanian Bank Department of Hard Currency Operations transferred the entire $870,000 to the account of the London-based firm "Ligistics [as published] Development Inc" in the Bank Hapoalim back on 26 May 1992. The current Lithuanian Bank leadership also confirms this fact. However, none of the leaders of this bank or the Security Department dared provide information about the size of the remaining sum in the firm's account, because the very contract for the purchase of all these special facilities is missing. According to state inspectors, the current government must establish the total of the unused residue allocated to the Supreme Council Security Department and retrieve it. This opinion is also shared by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office which sent a letter to the prime minister immediately after receiving the conclusions of the State Inspection Department, requesting him to render assistance and authorize the Lithuanian Bank to examine the actual situation. Recently, the Prosecutor General's Office received a reply from Prime Minister A. Slezevicius which reads that "executing the government decision of 3 February 1994, the Lithuanian Bank reports that it failed to acquire any additional information concerning the utilization of the $870,000 which the Government of Lithuania allocated to the Supreme Council Security Department and later transferred to the account of the London-based firm "Ligistics Development Inc." in the Bank Hapoalim, and the residue money. A. Slezevicius maintains that due to the negligence of the requirements for accounts of material assets, book-keeping, and balance accounts, the Republic of Lithuania incurred a $476,295 loss. [passage omitted] Some sources maintain that A. Skucas, former chief of the Supreme Council Security Department, recently paid a visit to the Prosecutor General's Office and tried to persuade it that the total of $870,000 had been spent to buy special facilities in the United States. However, the U.S. State Department and special services banned the shipment of arms to Lithuania because the country allegedly did not want to impair its relations with Russia....
