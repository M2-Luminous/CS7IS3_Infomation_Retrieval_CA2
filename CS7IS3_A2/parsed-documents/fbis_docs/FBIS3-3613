"Any attempts to solve problems with weapons have failed," he said, noting that he expects to see the eventual unification of China conducted "in a peaceful manner." Gorbachev, his wife and an eight member entourage arrived in Taipei Sunday for a six-day visit at the invitation of the UNITED DAILY NEWS newspaper. Commenting on his visit to Taiwan, Gorbachev said "the world has changed, and my visit here is a proof of it." "The route from Moscow to Taiwan was once an impossible journey," Wang Ti-wu, founder of the newspaper said at a welcome dinner Sunday. "The journey has been realized as a result of the new way of thought created by president Gorbachev," Wang said. This is Gorbachev's first trip to East Asia since he resigned as president in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev and wife met with Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu Monday morning over lunch at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chien and Gorbachev exchanged views on world affairs and future prospects for Taiwan-Russian relations. Chien praised Gorbachev as a man of vision and open-mindedness. The liberalization movement Gorbachev initiated made him a great reformer whose vision changed his country and the rest of the world, Chien said. Gorbachev, who presided over the end of the Cold War, the breakaway of the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe, and the beginning of an end to the US-Russian arms race, will give his first speech in Taipei entitled "The World in My Eyes" Monday afternoon at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. Later in the day, Gorbachev and party will meet with Premier Lien Chan at the Executive Yuan and will attend a dinner hosted by Lien in their honor. The 65-year-old Gorbachev, who led the "perestroyka" and "glasnost" reforms in his country in the 80s, will speak on "the reforms and challenge of Russia" at the Grand Hyatt Taipei Tuesday. The Russian statesman, who refers to himself as a columnist, said upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport that he hopes to meet as many politicians, merchants and students as possible during his stay in Taiwan, "so I can get to know the Chinese people better." Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with President Li Teng-hui on Wednesday and visit the Legislative Yuan Thursday.
