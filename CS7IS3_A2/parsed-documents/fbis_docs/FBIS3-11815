Of the 13 institutions authorized by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP), at present only one (Independencia) is operating, but it has encountered serious difficulties in acquiring funds because the SOFOL's are not recognized in financial legislation. Another serious problem, which could become the source of many conflicts in the future, is that existing general regulations do not specify the SOFOL's capitalization indexes, which further increases the distrust that other lending institutions have toward them. Furthermore, the only way to guarantee the long-term credibility of these institutions is through their operations and internal structure, because even though they are regulated by the National Banking Commission (CNB) and by the SHCP, Mexico has no insurance or legal guarantee to prevent these new organizations from perpetrating frauds, which commonly occur in the United States, where they have existed for years. Nevertheless, although their levels of trustworthiness have not even been established, these new institutions are already encountering funding problems due to the lack of information that exists concerning them. "That is one of our biggest problems," explained Jose Luis Rion, director of Independencia and president of the Mexican Association of Limited Purpose Financial Corporations (AMSFOL), which was created on 2 March during the seminar "New Financial Institutions in Mexico," sponsored by the Training Institute. According to Rion, the nonbank banks will have a difficult time acquiring, within the short term, options that will lead to legislation through which they can acquire funds by issuing negotiable documents or obtaining credit from other national and foreign financial institutions, and he explained that in Independencia's case "we have financed ourselves solely with our resources and we know that we are going to suffer losses during the first two years." Despite these initial prospects, the nonbank banks promise to become highly profitable institutions in our country, which is why many investors are asking themselves: What are these new institutions really all about? David Harris, a member of the Dechert, Price, and Rhoads law firm and an expert on the subject of nonbank banks in the United States, explained that in the strictest sense of the word a nonbank bank is a bank because it has the same powers and privileges that a bank has, with the sole exception that it limits its activities to a sector and a specific function. This explains the origins of the term nonbank bank or bank that is not a bank. He continued: Due to the ease with which they escaped the Bank Holding Company Law of 1956, which imposed significant regulations and many prohibitions on the owners of true banks, in the early eighties, following the widespread emergence of institutions that acquired the status of nonbank banks in the United States, Congress decided in 1987 to prohibit the creation of new nonbank banks and concurrently added several new restrictions to those that already existed by reducing certain status benefits. According to David Harris, one of the U.S. Government's greatest concerns regarding the nonbank banks is how these institutions use credit based on the idea that the deposits they obtain must be protected. In fact, this has proven to be of much concern because in the United States these intermediary organizations have perpetrated many frauds due to the difficulties they have encountered in obtaining legislation because they are difficult to define. Nevertheless, Harris said that these organizations have become decisive factors in the competitiveness of many U.S. companies. Harris said that Mexico is now beginning to experience what the United States has experienced for many years: the opening of its financial system to new intermediary organizations like these. Therefore, the U.S. experience in this area should be taken into consideration so that Mexico can make the best of it. Perhaps the most important nonbank bank in the world is General Electric Capital, a branch of the General Electric (GE) company. According to James Paulsfood, who is in charge of Capital's retail businesses and credit cards in Mexico, his organization has provided considerable financial support to the SOFOL's. He says that thanks to this, Capital's active capital has increased considerably. In view of these prospects, these new financial institutions constitute a great opportunity for Mexico to support the productivity of national companies as long as they manage to make the new financial institutions trustworthy for the public that is to use them and for the credit institutions that are to help fund them.
