CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc. [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;60&hyph;C] CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc., 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1101&hyph;8 (water sprinkler system; arrangement of sprinklers) to its Jones Fork Mine (I.D. No. 15&hyph;17496) located in Knott County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to use a single overhead pipe system with 1/2 inch orifice automatic sprinklers located on 10 feet centers to cover 50 feet of fire-resistant belt or 150 feet of non-fire-resistant belt with actuation temperatures between 200 and 230 degrees fahrenheit with water pressure equal to or greater than 10 psi. The petitioner states that the sprinklers would be located 10 feet apart so that the discharge of water will extend over the belt drive, belt take-up, electrical control, and gear reducing unit. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 2. Cyprus Emerald Resources Corporation [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;61&hyph;C] Cyprus Emerald Resources Corporation, 9100 East Mineral Circle, Englewood, Colorado 80112 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.507 (power connection points) to its Emerald Mine No. 1 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;05466) located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use a non-permissible submersible pump in the longwall bleeder sump near the No. 2 bleeder shaft for dewatering the sump and to provide unrestricted airflow into the return shaft. The petitioner states that task training will be provided for all selected mine electricians who will perform electrical work on these pumps; and that the surface pump control and power circuits will be examined monthly. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 3. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;62&hyph;C] Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 77.213 (draw-off tunnel escapeways) to its Cambria Cogeneration Facility (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08276) located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to have an escapeway not less than 30 inches in diameter from the tunnel within 24 feet of the tail roller at the closed end of the tunnel; to install a cable type heat detection system set at 140 degrees fahrenheit in the enclosed portion of the tunnel; to install heat activated sprinklers in the tunnel; to install a CO monitoring sensor in the tunnel near the tail roller to activate a visual alarm in the tail roller area and in the Main and Fuel Handling Control rooms when a level of 30 ppm is reached; and to install a pull cord throughout the tunnel to stop the belt. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 4. Misty Mountain Mining, Inc. [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;63&hyph;C] Misty Mountain Mining, Inc., P.O. Box 517, Barbourville, Kentucky 40906 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.342 (methane monitors) to its Mine No. 2 (I.D. No. 15&hyph;17314) located in Knox County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to monitor continuously with a hand-held deck-mounted methane and oxygen detector instead of using a methane monitoring system on permissible three-wheel tractors with drag bottom buckets. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.
