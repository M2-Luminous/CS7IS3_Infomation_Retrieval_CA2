According to incomplete statistics, Shanghai's 25 publishing houses have established business relations with nearly 100 publishing organizations in 13 foreign countries including Japan, the United States, and Britain as well as in the Hong Kong and Taiwan regions in the 1991-1993 period. During these three years, nearly 300 agreements for copyright business and cooperative publication were signed, involving 375 books. Starting from 1993, a new trend appeared in foreign-related copyright business -- the number of purchased foreign copyrights increased. Last year alone, some publishing houses in Shanghai signed 67 agreements for purchasing foreign copyrights involving 67 books. Most of the foreign companies owning these copyrights are located in the United States. While carrying out the "Copyright Law," these publishing houses have encountered many difficulties. The most outstanding problem was that, after spending a lot of money for the rights to reproduce books or audio-video products in China, they found out local publishing houses had already pirated a large amount of these books or audio-video products, even before the copyrighted ones were printed or put on the market. This practice not only infringed on the economic benefits of the copyright owners but also severely dampened their enthusiasm to be involved in copyrights from other countries or regions. Besides, some books published in Shanghai or other places in China were often found pirated. For example, "Biography of Jiang Qing" authored by Ye Yonglie, "Chinese Historical Stories" published by the Shanghai Cultural Publishing House, "Modern American Spoken Language" and "Contemporary American Colloquial Language" published by the Shanghai Foreign Language Education Publishing House, and "Intelligence Training for 365 Nights" published by the Children's Publishing House were pirated. Three years have passed since the promulgation of the "Copyright Law." Why is piracy still on the rise? First, publicity regarding the "Copyright Law" has not been widespread. Some publishers who infringed others' copyrights did not know that their act was illegal. Second, the punishment for copyright violations is too lenient. According to present regulations, any person who is convicted of piracy or plagiarism shall be fined 10,000-100,000 yuan. This amount is very small compared to the high profits available. No wonder there are still some lawbreakers willing to take a chance. As a result, the act of rights infringement cannot be completely checked. Third, some publishing houses disregarded the law and sold their authorized books to individual publishers who in turn published some hot-selling books under new titles for huge profits. In view of this situation, relevant personages of Shanghai's publishing circles and copyright department urged society to pay attention to the work of giving publicity to and popularizing the "Copyright Law," saying it is necessary to adopt more effective legal measures to conscientiously protect the legal rights and benefits of copyright owners and copyright users. In this way, China's copyright work can soon reach international standards.
