Zatulin stated this in an interview with Interfax today. Earlier, Shakhray had announced his resignation as the Russian Vice Premier at a briefing in Moscow explaining this by the fact that the appointment of the new minister had not been even formally discussed with him. Zatulin (who is also Chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS) suggested that Shakhray had been caught in a trap. "It is no secret that the president's administration and the government are fighting between them for powers and authority. It is not by chance that the rough dismissal of Sergey Shakhray in the best traditions of the Russian bureaucracy was announced when implementation of the ideas of Shakhray and the Party of Russian Integrity and Concord started -- the one on the Civic Accord Pact and on settlement of inter-ethnic relations," Zatulin pointed out. On the question whether the positions of the party in the government would be weakened after the dismissal of Shakhray, Zatulin suggested that for the time-being any party better be outside the government than participate in it. Zatulin said his party aimed to serve Russia rather than the president or the premier. From this point of view the party has supported the activities of Shakhray in the government which are continued by Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, Minister of Justice Yuriy Kalmykov and Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan who are members of the Party of Russian Integrity and Concord, Zatulin stressed.
