During a private appearance before the foreign relations board of the standing committee of the Congress of the [Mexican] Union, Mexico's designated ambassador to Cuba briefly discussed the principal objectives of his work program in Cuba. In this connection, he emphasized that it is necessary to increase commercial and financial relations between the two nations, especially in sectors that are priority sectors for Mexican investment, among which are: basic industry, health, communications, construction, foodstuffs, and the hotel industry. The designated ambassador said the Mexican Embassy will need to stimulate, create, promote, and manifest projects for joint activity in whatever promotes sources of reciprocal exchange and consolidates and expands Mexico's presence on the Cuban market.
