The 265 state farms remaining in the republic will adopt other forms of economic operation. Relays of "Ostankino" news have also been terminated. The cap on broadcasts from Moscow is explained in Tashkent by the fact that "Ostankino" chiefs have not signed an accord on relaying their programs to Uzbekistan in 1994. The other programs (with the exception of news) of the "Ostankino" channel continue to be relayed to Uzbekistan in full.
