While ministers of the senior coalition partner, the True Path Party (DYP), have characterized Cindoruk's plan as "fanciful," ministers affiliated with the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), have pointed to Cindoruk's claims of a potential crisis are being purely speculative. SHP Chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin told reporters that Cindoruk was making speculative assumptions prior to the upcoming local elections. But, Karayalcin added, due to the preelection atmosphere in Turkey, such speculation was predictable. In Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan's reaction to the proposal, he reminded his audience that when Cindoruk had the opportunity to become prime minister during the DYP's party convention in 1993, he declined the position in favor of Tansu Ciller. Golhan said: "The existing coalition government shall continue. Parliament Speaker Cindoruk could have become prime minister if he wanted to. But, he had then proposed Ciller." State Minister Obrahim Tez from the SHP, who also stressed that the coalition government would remain intact after the local elections, said: "This government should continue to remain in power after the local elections for Turkey's stability. The government may have some deficiencies, but we are doing whatever is necessary to overcome them." Agriculture Minister Refaiddin Sahin from the DYP wing of the government said he disagreed with Cindoruk's views. Pointing out that only the DYP's competent bodies wee authorized to call for early elections, Sahin said it was the nation, as a whole, that would decided what to do after the March 27 local elections. He added that whatever the nation decided would be the most suitable and reasonable decision. Sahin also stressed, in a reference to Cindoruk, that those experienced in politics should not present illogical scenarios or predictions that ignore political realities. Main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz said he and his colleagues agreed with Cindoruk's proposal in principle, but disagreed with its duration and function. In a press conference at ANAP headquarters, Yilmaz said he viewed such a government as a temporary one, which should last only as long as the law permits. He defined this period as being no longer than either two or three months. He emphasized that the proposed one-year transition period would not be able to solve Turkey's existing problems. Yilmaz aid that debates over the establishment of a national coalition should be conducted after the local elections and noted that the fact that the issue had been brought up by a DYP member proved that the ruling party was pessimistic about its chances in the upcoming local elections. Yilmaz said his party welcomed any proposal that would lead Turkey toward greater stability. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who returned to Turkey from her one-day visit to the besieged city of Sarajevo, found herself in the midst of another preelection dilemma again. This time she was faced with the possible resignation of former Interior Minister and current Bursa Deputy Mehmet Gazioglu.
