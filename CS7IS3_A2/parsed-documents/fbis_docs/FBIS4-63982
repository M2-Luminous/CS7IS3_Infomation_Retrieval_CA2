The arms systems China has were developed on the basis of Soviet samples and are "genetically" related. For this reason the Chinese market is attractive to Moscow, which "views the development of such ties positively," Kokoshin said. As concerns specific projects, the Russian deputy defence minister pointed to a contract for the delivery to China of several combat aircraft of the Su-27 series. "it is a very good machine. It can remain in service until the year 2020 or even 2025 if properly modernised, I mean its armament and onboard equipment," Andrey Kokoshin explained. He stressed that "our Chinese friends made the right choice."
