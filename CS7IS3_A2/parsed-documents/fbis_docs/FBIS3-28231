Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, in announcing Japan's contribution to the war-torn region, said humanitarian assistance and help in maintaining stability in Macedonia through economic and technical cooperation will be stepped up instead. The announcement followed weeks of deliberations on Japan's possible contribution after the government sent a survey mission there in early January. The team, headed by senior Foreign Ministry Official Shunji Yanai, visited such areas as Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade. Hata said in the statement that Japan is not considering sending personnel to the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The ministry officials said Japan will continue studying the nation's participation "from a mid- to long-term perspective" and closely watch regional developments, the UNPROFOR and the peace process. Officials pointed out that although UNPROFOR commander Brig. Gen. Saermark Thomsen [spelling of name as received] told the mission that he will welcome Japan's participation, the United Nations has made no formal request. Once such a request is made, the nation will consider a dispatch from a legal viewpoint and then make a policy decision, they said. Hata voiced concern in the statement over continuing armed conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the failure of the peace process, and strongly urged a solution through negotiations, not battles. He added Japan intends to make efforts toward peace. Regarding humanitarian cooperation, Tokyo is considering extending between 10 million and 15 million dollars to U.N. organizations to help refugees, the officials said. Details, including timing of the disbursement, have yet to be decided, they said. Tokyo plans to provide facilities, medical goods, food and other equipment to help the refugees, they said. Japan will strengthen ties with Macedonia and promote personnel exchanges to help develop its economy and improve public life in an aim to prevent conflicts from occurring, the officials said. Specifically, Japan will send three or four experts to Macedonia in spring to study implementation of economic and technical cooperation. They will also invite Macedonian Government officials in charge of economic cooperation to Japan in March, they said. Japan also plans to establish diplomatic ties with Macedonia as soon as possible and look into setting up an honorary counsul general, and will lift self-restraints on tourists Friday to Macedonia, they said. The government will also send a Foreign Ministry official to the eight-member conflict prevention mission of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the officials said. To tackle the area's problems more effectively, Japan will strengthen its embassy in Austria to cover Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia, and promote ties with Albania, which play an important role in the stability of the Balkan region, they said. A minister at the Japanese embassy in Austria will become a Japanese representative in charge of problems in the region and will attend consultations among major nations in Zagreb when possible, they said.
