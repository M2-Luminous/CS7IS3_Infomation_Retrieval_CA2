FBIS4-28171 "dreas110_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 South Korea NUB Reports Increase in DPRK Propaganda NUB Reports Increase in DPRK Propaganda SK0806025894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0238 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806025894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, facing imminent international sanctions for its suspected program to build nuclear arms, has intensified agitation and propaganda operations to stir up South Korean society, the National Unification Board [NUB] said Tuesday. Radio Pyongyang reported Saturday that the South Korean government would carry out currency reform in June or July, citing a bulletin on "the civilian government's currency reform" from a ghost organization named "Hanminjon," [South Korean National Democratic Front] or the National Unification Front of Korea, NUB officials said. The currency reform will devalue the won by a ratio of 100 to 1 and affect not only cash in circulation but also bank deposits and securities denominated in won, and informed Chongwadae [presidential offices] sources have already confirmed the bulletin, the report said. Asserting that forged 10,000-won bills found in South Korea last month were the harbinger of a currency reform, North Korea is spreading the bulletin on currency reform in South Korea through its electronic media, the officials said. The NODONG SINMUN, the official newspaper of the North Korean Workers' (Communist) Party, urged Southern workers, in a commentary carried in a recent issue, to launch a full-scale struggle for higher wages, reinstatement of dismissed workers and guaranteed labor participation in company management in June, while criticizing the Kim Yong-sam government's call for burden-sharing. The North Korean propaganda machine's agitation pieces targeting South Korean students, workers and farmers increased from 32 in April to 73 in May, the officials said. Pyongyang's increased anti-Seoul propaganda operations are aimed at disturbing South Korean society by fanning the flames of the "theory of June crisis" postulated by some political circles in the South. An official from NUB said the North Korean radio report on currency reform in South Korea is totally groundless, calling it just part of the psychological warfare designed to disrupt the unity of the South Korean people and Government in dealing with the North Korean nuclear problem. North Korea will make use of collective bargaining on wage hikes in June and July and a pan-national unification meeting it will hold at Panmunjom in August to create an anti-government climate and social confusion in South Korea, he said.
