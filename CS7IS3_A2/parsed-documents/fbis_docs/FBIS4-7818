It was conceived as an association outside and above political parties, and, as its founder and first president Zvonimir Trusic spelled it out in his introductory address, "as a nongovernmental organization that would bring together those who went to war and took their status into their own hands without waiting for a call from the government. Rejecting the role of the government "from the other side of the mirror" and the role of the extended hand of any party or group within any party ("the volunteers did not intend and will not establish any parallel government...for us the CROATIAN STATE is sacred...we have not and will not take into our hands anything for which there exists authorized government bodies and agencies...we do not allow and will not allow ourselves to be taken over by anyone, to be included in any of the current political conflicts"). In his introductory address to the Association Trusic defined it as a kind of (moral) proofreader: "Because of the many bad things happening around us now, the Croatian Volunteers are resolutely joining the fight against war profiteering, we condemn criminal acts of robbery of government property, we demand confiscation of property gained through war profiteering and theft." Threats and Outbursts In order to achieve the stated goals and to define other goals that will cover the broadest interests of the membership, the Association had to be reorganized and bylaws adopted and a new president and members of working bodies elected, which was the job to be done in the second convention. The initial constructive and ceremonial enthusiasm of the convention, however, turned into a verbal gunfight that caused a majority of the delegates to leave the Vatroslav Lisinski Auditorium even before the vote. An unpleasant impression was left both by the uncontrolled outbursts from the speaker's stand and in the corridors (there were threats against those gathering signatures, Trusic said), and also by the "tussling for the microphone and denial of the right to speak to certain distinguished members and guests (that right was denied Mile "Hawk" Dedakovic, Branko "Younghawke" Borkovic, Brother Vjekoslav Lasic, and a hundred others who had something to say). A new president was elected (Tomislav Mercep), vice-presidents (Juraj Njavro, Dario Kordic, Stjepan Spajic, and Pajo Simic), and members of the central committee (Branko Miloloza, Marijan Sola, Djuro Brodarac, Dusko Cikan and Kresimir Cop). The by-laws were not adopted, concern for the general interests of the volunteers remained in the background on this occasion, and, judging by the departure of a goodly portion of the those present before the convention was over, the first big convention of the UHDDR might well have been the last. "Occupation" of the Association One gets the impression, and this was pointed out by Zvonimir Trusic, that it broke down over the attempt of one current within the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] to turn the Association into an instrument and use it as a powerful lever for promotion of its own political objectives. The whistling, the hooting, the dissatisfaction and departure from the hall during the speech of Vuco Vukojevic and certain others showed that some of the volunteers refuse to allow the interests of the Association to be subordinated to the interests of this or that political grouping. Although it was said in the HDZ corridors at the convention that that group of malcontents were actually politically aligned with the HOS [Croatian Defense Force] and the Rightists, when mutual accusations like this are made, the truth is always somewhere in the middle. But things are not so unambiguous, and this stormy convention shows that the conflict within the HDZ, postponed at the last convention of the HDZ, broke out in the convention of the UHDDR, that is, that the faction which withdrew for tactical reasons in the HDZ convention (as it itself put it at the time) attempted to 'occupy' the Association of Volunteers as a springboard for future political showdowns. SLAVONSKI OBZOR of Vinkovci confirms that these are not mere empty speculations by recalling withdrawal of the nomination of Branimir Glavas, Vladimir Seks and Tomislav Mercep at the HDZ convention referred to. Recalling as well the words of Tomislav Mercep, who explained his own withdrawal and the withdrawal of most of the right wing of the party in terms of a "desire to once again take a step out of good will, but it will not last beyond 1 April 1994." that was the deadline given the president of the state and HDZ, it is said, to "do what he has promised the party and the people." Respected and Armed Has that current, then, chosen this association of Croatian volunteers for its (possible) backup base? If so, why? there are several reasons for this choice. The attitude of most of the Croatian public toward the UHDDR is full of respect, emotional, often altogether uncritical, which is precisely why the Association was a prefect shield for promoting political interests of any option or party provided they could swallow it up. The job of the current of the HDZ, it is assumed, would be easier because Mercep, one of its fair-haired boys, enjoys a passable reputation and has the support of a large number of members of the UHDDR. What is more, the UHDDR, which has about 6000 registered members, in spite of certain organizational deficiencies, is a compact entity bound by solid ties of solidarity in wartime and alleged political extremism. And something else, a sizeable portion of the members of the UHDDR who remained outside the Croatian armed units, whether the army of the police, are armed and represent an experienced military force that must command respect. Something of the kind was first stated in public by Tomislav Mercep when he was a guest on the program of Croatian Radio-TV "Latin Writing." He mentioned the Knin Brigade, which numbers 6,500 armed fighting men, but he did not go into the details. Toward the end of last year, we were told by Gen Martin Spegelj, at the convention of Croatian Veterans of the Homeland War (HVDR) in Kutina a representative of the Kutina chapter of the UHDDR welcomed establishment of the sister organization, but declined the possibility of collective membership of the UHDDR in the HVDR, justifying this in terms of the fact that a brigade was just then being formed to be commanded by Mercep, and all of this supposedly with the consent and knowledge of a high official of the defense ministry, who will arm the brigade and fully equip it. Reason Prevailed Be that as it may, the emotional outbursts (Mercep, Sosic), politicized to the extreme on certain occasions (Vukojevic), were more suitable to political gatherings in which the electorate is mobilized than to meetings whose job is to resolve very serious problems like the problems of the Croatian Volunteers. There is evidence that reason nevertheless prevailed in the end in the speeches of volunteers who declined the possibility of politicizing the association (a good example of this is the speech by a volunteer from Ogulin) and pointed to current problems, beginning with the "endemic" problems of the volunteers all the way to the general problems like war profiteering or the attempt to establish a parallel army and government. The convention of volunteers fell apart at the end. The calculation that the volunteers would serve as a stick that could be used in the postponed showdown within the HDZ proved rather hollow. The volunteers let those who counted on their "political emotions" and their "extremism" know quite clearly that their emotions are reserved for the Croatian state and Croatian interests, and their "extremism" is directed exclusively against the occupier and cannot be used for internal showdowns between Croats. In an interview with SLOBODNA DALMACIJA Tomislav Mercep, the new president of the UHDDR, took a sporting view of the thing: he said that the convention was right and proper and it is the right those who lost to be angry. Zvonimir Trusic, former president, thinks quite differently and is announcing establishment of a new association. The best comment on the meeting came from those who left the hall before the end of an event which was supposed to be their convention, but turned into a political game and verbal exhibition by those who are too often inclined to privatize the interests of Croatia as a whole.
