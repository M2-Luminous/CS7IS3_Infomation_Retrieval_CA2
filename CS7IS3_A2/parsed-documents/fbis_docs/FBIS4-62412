[passage omitted] Operations aimed at establishing peace and challenging criminal gangs and mafia clans were carried out in eight towns and rayons in the Republic. This morning, Tbilisi was completely sealed off. Roadblocks were put up at the city's key junctions, and police, security and guard units started apprehending crime suspects, confiscating fire-arms and explosives from the population and unmasking drugs dealers. More than 40 suspects, including 11 people wanted for serious crimes, were detained by 1000 in the morning. Some 30 automatic guns, machine-guns, dozens of hand grenades, pistols and grenade launchers were confiscated from citizens and criminals. The police discovered 100 stolen cars. A large number of drug addicts and dealers were unmasked. The operation is still under way. It can be said that operations like this, especially when hundreds of law-enforcement officials are involved, can rarely be prepared in absolute secrecy. Nevertheless, one can say that the criminal world suffered a telling blow.
