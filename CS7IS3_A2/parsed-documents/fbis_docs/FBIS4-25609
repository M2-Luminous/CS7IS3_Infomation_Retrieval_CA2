It has been learned that the municipal commodity prices department has over the past two days dispatched nearly 1,000 personnel in a campaign concentrating on prioritized checks. Results of the inspection show that an absolute majority of state-run and collectively run grain, oil, and sauce stores have managed to observe state provisions, while a small number of shops were caught overpricing and entertaining only large-quantity purchases. To ensure stability of commodity prices on the market, the municipal government demanded that strong measures be taken to strengthen inspection and to carry on the municipality-wide general inspection of commodity prices in a down-to-earth and in-depth manner. The government's specific demands on commodity prices departments at all levels are: 1. They should further strengthen price administration in cooperation with departments in charge of different trades. Without prior approval, no department or unit should introduce any form of price hike for commodities and fees that are under state control or for which a price hike application is required. They should sternly punish violators of relevant provisions and go a step further to expose to the public, individual cases of a serious and odious nature that have a widespread impact. 2. They should resolutely prohibit, investigate, and deal with price hikes based on invalid excuses. Acts of exploiting the opportunity of reform to unscrupulously and covertly raise prices should be sternly dealt with in accordance with the law. 3. They should keep the chain effect strictly in check and sternly deal with price hikes or the expansion of profit margin without approval. And, 4. They should strengthen inspection of prices at the marketplace.
