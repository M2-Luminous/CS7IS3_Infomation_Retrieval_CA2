You are halfway through your visit and many meetings are still ahead of you. However, I would like to ask you to tell us something about the significance of your visit and to assess the talks you have held so far, above all your talks with Prime Minister John Major. [Klaus] [passage omitted] So far we have not had many official contacts at the highest state level with Great Britain. [passage omitted] Thus our visit is filling this vacuum. It is necessary to leave a mark here. [passage omitted] Simply, it is necessary to represent the Czech Republic here. I think that this is a never-ending process that is important because it is continuing and never-ending, rather than because of one specific result of one specific action. This is the purpose of such visits. Our talks with John Major concentrated, of course, more on international political phenomena than on bilateral relations. There is no significant political, economic, or any other problem in relations between the Czech Republic and Great Britain that we should put an end to, resolve, or put right. I think the fundamental things, fundamental necessary agreements, are in existence. We have formed the legislative basis for our relations. Thus, the Cabinets have done what they should have done and might have done, and now it is the turn of micro subjects--i.e., citizens, entrepreneurs--to make use of the created space. We spoke about external issues, about foreign policy. As far as John Major is concerned, the subject of Bosnia dominated [our talks], without doubt. This is so because Great Britain, as we are well aware, was a bit less vocal when those strong ultimatums were being issued by NATO, laying stress on the land forces rather than an air attack. However, it has seized the initiative now and is strongly emphasizing the land forces, strengthening its contingent there, seeking support for this kind of activity. It was not by chance that John Major opened our talks by speaking about this. [Weissova] Prime Minister, Hungary announced last week that it would submit an application to join the European Union by the end of April. You reacted by saying that the Czech Republic would do the same when it was ready. When do you think we are going to be ready? I am not asking about the time but about the conditions that we will have to fulfill. [Klaus] We all know that the question of our entry to the European Union or NATO is not about how quickly we file our application. We hope no one is deluding himself into thinking along these lines. [passage omitted] [Weissova] Do you think we might wait for such a long time, for 20 or 30 years? [Klaus] Certainly not. Norway's experience was specific. [passage omitted] This is not our case. Time runs faster now. [passage omitted] I would say we have already succeeded in one go to overcome all world records. In 1990, when I was finance minister, I organized the readmittance into the International Monetary Fund. [passage omitted]
