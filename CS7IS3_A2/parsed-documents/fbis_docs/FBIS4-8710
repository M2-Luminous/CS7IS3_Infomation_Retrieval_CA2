The talks lasted two and a half hours, after which the two gave statements for the press and answered several questions. The essence of what was discussed and agreed upon was first disclosed by Serbian President Milosevic. [Milosevic] We had a very good, open talk about, I would say, key issues, primarily the crisis in this area. The main focus of our talks was on events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I am pleased to say that we have a very similar, or I would venture to say identical view of many of the aspects of this issue. Namely, to put it briefly, this process over there is at a critical point from which it could easily escalate into war, but could also just as easily take a turn toward lasting peace. That is why we believe that a solution comprised of small steps and the extinguishing of small fires from point to point is not a solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will lead to a state of constant crises, where only the geographical name of the crisis will change, but it will go on permanently and the war will be difficult to stop. That is why we believe that the best approach is to broker a general cessation of all hostilities on the territory of the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible, but without prejudice regarding the political solution. The peaceful circumstances would give us a lot more space for reaching a final political solution. I am very pleased that Minister Kozyrev shares our approach as regards the fact that the issue of sanctions is directly connected to achieving peace in Bosnia, and that in this respect Russia has a very objective and constructive position. In realizing this general approach, we certainly need to solve the current problem of Gorazde on these same principles. Namely, you are all well aware of the fact that the Muslim side has avoided defining the borders of this protected zone and that it simply launched a massive offensive -- the spring offensive they call it -- from this area. The situation became more complex later when this offensive was successfully repelled and the Serb forces launched successful counter-attacks, and after the intervention -- the (?unnecessary) intervention I would say -- from the air. This has undoubtedly set back the peace process and has to a certain degree compromised the behavior of the UN Protection Force. However, we need to find an exit out of this. We suggested today in our mutual consultations that the most responsible people from the Serbian republic and the United Nations -- those that are supposed to help -- should meet as soon as possible. They have already agreed to meet tomorrow morning [17 April] in order primarily to define the borders of the security zone on the basis of the conclusions of a joint commission -- a Serb-Muslim-UN commission. This would create conditions for cooling the temperature there, therefore, it would constitute the extinguishing of a very difficult and tragic focal point, but it should be within the context of a general agreement -- which we should all strive for -- on the cessation of hostilities on the entire front line in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We assess that we need to invest all our political influence into realizing this and we hope that we shall meet with success. [passage omitted] [end recording]
