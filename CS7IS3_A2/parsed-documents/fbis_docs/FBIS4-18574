[Denktas] It will be the same. They [UN officials] will go and come back and the UN secretary general will submit a new report at the end of the month. Meanwhile, the contacts will be maintained. [Duzgun] Can the fact that a deadline has been established be regarded as pressure? [Denktas] Yes, it is so. [Duzgun] The UN secretary general's report included a statement by Glavkos Kliridhis. He said: "I will agree if Denktas agrees." Does the inclusion of that statement in the report indicate that the UN secretary general has agreed to it? [Denktas] We have been explaining for a long time that Kliridhis' statement should not be taken to mean that the Greek Cypriot side has agreed. However, the UN officials have failed to realize that. [Duzgun] Can you comment on what may take place in the indirect talks when they are resumed? [Denktas] Well, let us wait until the talks are resumed... However, let us consider the existence of a document that has been accepted by one of the two sides but not by the other. The other side has raised objections. Asking the two sides to regard that document as a basis for an agreement will be tantamount to telling one of them that "you do not have to reach an agreement because pressure will be directed toward the Turkish Cypriots." That is the wrong approach. Therefore, why should the Greek Cypriot side change its position after reading the UN secretary general's report? We are confronted with a significant problem, which has been created by the UN secretary general's report. [Duzgun] Will the documents, which have been described as nondocuments, be withdrawn in the new round of talks? [Denktas] Documents are not withdrawn. They form the basis of the process. [Duzgun] Considering the fact that the nondocument has been included in the UN secretary general's report, has it not become an official document? [Denktas] We do not believe that it can be characterized as official. Of course, the UN Security Council may decide to accept it. However, the UN Security Council cannot close its eyes and accept a document over which the two sides have raised objections. In fact, it must not do so because nothing can be resolved through that approach. [Duzgun] Will pressure be directed toward the Turkish Cypriot side again? Will that not create a new impasse? [Denktas] They said that they will return to hold talks. We have asked for certain rights. Maybe they will move to give a tangible form to them. That is the way to hold talks. They are well aware of what has caused the deadlock. There is nothing concrete. They have only made promises. Let us wait to see which countries we will be allowed to visit with our passports. The UN administrator cannot assume responsibility for customs. That can never be. Let us see if they will exclude that from the document. Otherwise, I will not be authorized by the Turkish Cypriot Republican Assembly to do anything. The Turkish Cypriot side's right to have its own customs procedures cannot be transferred to the UN administrator. [Duzgun] Is there a problem with matters related to the airline companies that will be allowed to use the Nicosia International Airport? [Denktas] They have said that only one airline company will be able to use that airport. However, it was said at the beginning that the airline companies registered in Turkey would be able to use it. Cyprus Airways would not be allowed to use that airport. However, we have been informed that it will be able to do so. The UN administration cannot tell Cyprus Airways not to use this or that flight path. All that means that the national airline company of the Greek Cypriot side, which poses as the Cyprus Government, will be able to use the Nicosia International Airport and the Turkish Cypriots, who have been living under an embargo for many years, will be able to benefit from a number of rights that will be accorded them by the UN administrator out of kindness and pity. What kind of an approach is that? Kliridhis said at the beginning that neither Cyprus Airways nor any Turkish company registered in Cyprus should use that airport. He also said that foreign airline companies registered in Turkey will be able to do so. Apparently, they have changed that now. [Duzgun] Have you insisted that Cyprus Airways register in Athens? [Denktas] They have changed matters related to the use of the airport. So they should also change that. They should have that airline company registered in Athens and then come to talk with us under equal conditions. The Greek Cypriot side is trying to have what it refers to as the Cyprus Government establish a foothold in the Nicosia International Airport. [Duzgun] Can the problem on Maras [Varosha] be solved by constructing a new access road? [Denktas] No, a new road will not solve the problem because it will have to cross through territory we control. [Duzgun] Can you explain the problem on Maras? [Denktas] We have been informed that we should hand over an area as large as Maras itself and withdraw our troops. A UN official convinced us to abandon our policy on the northern part of Dhimokratias Avenue by assuring us that the access road to Maras will remain under our control and that they will not ask us to transfer it. [Duzgun] Who convinced you? [Denktas] Butrus Butrus-Ghali. [Duzgun] Was he the official you referred to? [Denktas] Yes, it was Butrus-Ghali. He said: Why are you worried about security? You will control the entry and exit points. Do not worry. You will not be able to convince anyone. Considering that, we agreed to relinquish our position on Dhimokratias Avenue. As soon as we did so, he issued a new report and the UN officials began to say that "the transfer of Maras will be meaningless if the Turkish Cypriot side retains its control of the access road." [Duzgun] A problem has emerged on the customs procedures in Nicosia International Airport. Has a similar problem emerged in Maras? [Denktas] Of course a problem has emerged on custom procedures. A problem has also emerged on the access road to Maras. A place was to be given to the Turkish Cypriots. A proposal was made for the establishment of something like an open market. The UN secretary general has said that he may help the Turkish Cypriots in leasing procedures. Well, let him first include the promises he made to us in his report. [Duzgun] Can you comment on the public property in Maras? [Denktas] They have said that the property belongs to the Cyprus Republic and that the Cyprus Government will resolve that matter. That cannot be. [Duzgun] Does a problem exist on deadlines? [Denktas] We were informed that we should place Maras under UN jurisdiction two months after the conclusion of an agreement on the matter. Nicosia International Airport will be placed under UN jurisdiction two months later. However, that will be four months after the agreement is reached. The Greek Cypriots will resettle in Maras during that time. We will benefit from the airport 12 months later. And the way we shall do so is unknown. No one will be able to evict the Greek Cypriots from Maras if the Greek Cypriot Administration creates discord at the end of the 12 months. What will happen to us then? Whether or not you benefit from the airport after 12 months makes no difference. The promises will not be fulfilled. We have proposed that we transfer the northern part of Dhimokratias Avenue after we establish ourselves in the airport. We will at least have something in our hands.
