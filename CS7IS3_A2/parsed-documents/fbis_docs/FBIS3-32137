This was yesterday stated in a joint communique signed by Presidents Sixto Duran-Ballen and Juan Calos Wasmosy at the conclusion of the official visit by the Paraguayan chief of state. Air Transport Taking into account the cargo transportation difficulties that the two countries have, with a lack of connections that could further promote tourism and commerce, the presidents emphasized the importance of air transport for promoting development between the two nations. They agreed to instruct the aeronautical authorities in their respective countries to continue and to intensify the dialogue on the benefits of an agreement for air transport between the two nations. The presidents also reaffirmed their support for the role played by ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] in the current situation, particularly as it refers to subregional integration agreements and to the promotion and liberalization of regional commerce. In this regard they expressed their firm position with respect to the observance of the preferential treatment provided for by the Treaty of Montevideo of 1980 for the countries of lower relative development. Agreement Between Paraguay and Ecuador for the Protection of Investment Presidents Wasmosy and Duran Ballen also attended a ceremony during which Foreign Ministers Diego Paredes and Luis Ramirez Boettner signed a bilateral agreement for the promotion and reciprocal protection of investment. Under the terms of this agreement each side promised to promote, within its territory and to the extent possible, investments by the other side, putting them under its own laws and regulations. The agreement notes that the party that has admitted investment in its territory will grant the necessary implementation permits. Type of Investment The agreement defines the type of investments that will be admitted, and each party promises to protect them within its territory, granting them the treatment of more favored nation. This implies fair and equitable treatment, no less favorable than the treatment that each party grants to its own investors or to third states. Both sides also guarantee that the investors who avail themselves of the terms of this agreement may freely transfer the payments corresponding to their investment.
