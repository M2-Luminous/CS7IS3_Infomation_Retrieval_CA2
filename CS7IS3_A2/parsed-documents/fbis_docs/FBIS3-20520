An example was a 12 January dispatch from Shanghai by Japan's KYODO News Agency. It said: Top Chinese communist leader Deng Xiaoping yesterday met with Chen Yun, a conservative veteran and former chairman of the CPC Central Advisory Commission. It is said that KYODO obtained this information from an informed Chinese communist source. The 11 January Deng-Chen meeting lasted about an hour and a half. Chen Yun has been in Shanghai ever since last summer. KYODO added an extra remark to the report: What they talked about is still unknown. A Two-King Meeting Is Rather Rare It is a rare thing that "a king meets with another king." One of the rules in Chinese chess is that the marshals of the two sides cannot face each other directly. To do so is a big taboo. No matter how a chess game goes, the marshal should always be shielded by guards, ministers, chariots, horses, artillery, or soldiers. He should not be exposed in such a way as to appear face-to-face with the enemy's marshal. If he has to do so, that means surrender. Deng Xiaoping is the supreme leader of the Chinese communists today. But in terms of "seniority," Chen Yun is above Deng. The lineup of the standing committee members of the CPC's Political Bureau elected at the Eighth National Party Congress was: Mao, Liu, Zhou, Zhu, Chen, Lin, and Deng. As can be seen, Chen held the fifth place and Deng the seventh. When the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee called for "clarifying confusion and bringing things back to order," it was Chen Yun who took the lead in saying that "Mao Zedong was a human being, not a god." In addition, Chen Yun is a man with a strong sense of principle. For example, in the 1988 rectification movement, the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee wanted to expel Li Rui, Li Chang, Yu Haocheng, and Du Runsheng from the party. Chen Yun disagreed, thereby preserving the party membership of these four people. However, Chen Yun himself has a mentality based on "the orthodox Marxist-Leninist ideology." He insists on taking the socialist road and upholding the dictatorship of the proletariat. This has given ultra-leftists a protective umbrella. Deng Liqun, known as the "Leftist Lord," is still very arrogant today simply because he has a strong backing--Chen Yun. As the saying goes, "no one would go to the temple for nothing." This being so, what was the purpose of Deng Xiaoping's visit with Chen Yun? It appears that the visit had something to do with the recent vigorous campaign on the mainland to mark Mao Zedong's 100th birthday led by Deng Liqun. Mao Zedong's Soul Revives Anyone with a discerning eye can see the main reason that Mao Zedong's soul can revive and whip up a gust on the mainland is the planning and manipulation by Deng Liqun. Take the theoretical seminar in commemoration of Mao Zedong's 100th birthday held in Changsha, Hunan, as an example. The sponsor was the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, whose party committee secretary is Wang Renzhi, a pawn of Deng Liqun. In name, the seminar was held to commemorate Mao Zedong; in reality, it was aimed at criticizing Deng Xiaoping. Its real purpose was to criticize all those reform-and-opening advocates headed by Deng Xiaoping for their divorce from Marxism-Leninism and betrayal of Mao Zedong Thought. Another example was the three-day "Contemporary Literature and Art Seminar on Mao Zedong and China" held in Beijing, beginning 22 December last year. This was a significant event amid the activities to mark Mao Zedong's 100th birthday carried out across the mainland. "Leftist Lord" Deng Liqun and "Leftist Generals," including He Jingzhi and Lin Mohan, all attended this seminar, whose theme was to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong's Yanan Forum on Literature and Art and criticize the so-called "unhealthy trends and evil practices" that had appeared with reform and opening. The spearhead was also directed at Deng Xiaoping. Young Deng Antagonizes Old Deng Deng Xiaoping was, of course, unhappy about the acts of respecting Mao in name and criticizing Deng in essence. He knows clearly that Deng Liqun is acting against him. At present, Deng Liqun's official title in the CPC Central Committee is merely the "deputy head of the Leading Group for Party History Research," but actually he is playing a commander-in-chief role in controlling the whole ideological sphere. For this reason, Beijing's intellectual circles, leftists, middle elements, and rightists alike, all see him as the "underground general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party." Perhaps, someone may ask: How can Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to this? The answer is that Deng Liqun planted his men long ago on the theoretical, propaganda, and cultural work fronts. These people have long been accustomed to implementing Deng Liqun's instructions and styling themselves as protectors for Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. They overtly obey but covertly oppose all other instructions; the only thing they really follow is Deng Liqun's order. And, in the eyes of the "Left Lord" and "Left Generals," Deng Xiaoping's "socialism with Chinese characteristics" is "sham" socialism but "real" capitalism. Confronted with this challenge, Deng Xiaoping, of course, wanted to fight back. The best strategy was to "deprive the opponent of backing." In view of the fact that he and Chen Yun had shared the same view about Mao Zedong's nation-devastating Cultural Revolution, it would appear that only by obtaining Chen Yun's concurrence could he now suppress Deng Liqun's arrogance and stop the frantic Maoist wind, which would be no good to all if allowed to blow unchecked. Chen Yun Supports Deng Liqun Deng Xiaoping is adept at employing the outflanking tactics. If the KYODO report on the Deng-Chen meeting in Shanghai is true, the only explanation is that Deng Xiaoping hoped to have another round of cooperation with Chen like the one resulting in the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. This cooperation would prevent Deng Liqun and his ilk from continuing their all-out efforts to stir up left winds. Nonetheless, Chen Yun, who has always styled himself as an orthodox Marxism-Leninism protector, may, in all probability, appreciate Deng Liqun's strategy of using dead Mao to curb living Deng. In no way would he agree with old Deng if the latter wanted to subject young Deng to disciplinary action! Then, how come Deng Xiaoping, who is so wise, tried to seek such a rebuff for himself? It seems that only Mao Mao [Deng Xiaoping's daughter and author of "My Father Deng Xiaoping"] can truly answer this question. A view shared by Chinese and foreign observers alike is: After Deng Xiaoping's death, China will not fall into great disorder, but inevitably a strong quake will take place in the CPC's central leadership because too many bombs are buried around Zhongnanhai. Deng Liqun is a very destructive timebomb. Though he has no gun in hand, he is self-assured because he has the Marxist theory as his invincible weapon.
