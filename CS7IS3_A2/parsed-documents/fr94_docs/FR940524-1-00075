FR940524-1-00075 FR940524-1-00010 (b) The inhalation resistance, drawn at the rate of 85 liters (3 cubic feet) per minute when the blower is not operating or under any practical condition of blower operation shall not exceed the following amounts: ␣ 1Maximum length of hose for which respirator is approved 2Feet 2Meters 1Maximum resistance, water column height 2Inches 2Millimeters 75 23 1.5 38 150 46 2.5 64 250 76 3.5 89 300 91 4.0 102 (c) The exhalation resistance shall not exceed 25 mm. (1 inch) of water-column height at a flow rate of 85 liters (3 cubic feet) per minute when the blower is not operating or under any practical condition of blower operation. §84.154 Airflow resistance test; Type B and Type BE supplied-air respirators; minimum requirements. (a) Airflow resistance shall be determined when the respirator is completely assembled with the respiratory-inlet covering and the hose in the maximum length to be considered for approval, coiled in loops 1.5 to 2.1 m. (5 to 7 feet) in diameter. (b) Airflow resistance shall not exceed 38 mm. (1.5 inches) of water-column height to air drawn at the flow rate of 85 liters (3 cubic feet) per minute. (c) The exhalation resistance shall not exceed 25 mm. (1 inch) of water-column height at this flow rate. §84.155 Airflow resistance test; Type C supplied-air respirator, continuous flow class and Type CE supplied-air respirator; minimum requirements. The resistance to air flowing from the respirator shall not exceed 25 mm. (1 inch) of water-column height when the air flow into the respiratory-inlet covering is 115 liters (4 cubic feet) per minute. §84.156 Airflow resistance test; Type C supplied-air respirator, demand class; minimum requirements. (a) Inhalation resistance shall not exceed 50 millimeters (2 inches) of water at an air flow of 115 liters (4 cubic feet) per minute. (b) The exhalation resistance to a flow of air at a rate of 85 liters (3 cubic feet) per minute shall not exceed 25 millimeters (1 inch) of water. §84.157 Airflow resistance test; Type C supplied-air respirator, pressure-demand class; minimum requirements. (a) The static pressure in the facepiece shall not exceed 38 mm. (1.5 inches) of water-column height. (b) The pressure in the facepiece shall not fall below atmospheric at inhalation airflows less than 115 liters (4 cubic feet) per minute. (c) The exhalation resistance to a flow of air at a rate of 85 liters (3 cubic feet) per minute shall not exceed the static pressure in the facepiece by more than 51 mm. (2 inches) of water-column height. §84.158 Exhalation valve leakage test. (a) Dry exhalation valves and valve seats will be subjected to a suction of 25 mm. water-column height while in a normal operating position. (b) Leakage between the valve and valve seat shall not exceed 30 milliliters per minute. §84.159 Man tests for gases and vapors; supplied-air respirators; general performance requirements. (a) Wearers will enter a chamber containing a gas or vapor as prescribed in §§84.160, 84.161, 84.162, and 84.163. (b) Each wearer will spend 10 minutes in work to provide observations on freedom of the device from leakage. The freedom and comfort allowed the wearer will also be considered. (c) Time during the test period will be divided as follows: (1) Five minutes. Walking, turning head, dipping chin; and (2) Five minutes. Pumping air with a tire pump into a 28-liter (1 cubic foot) container, or equivalent work. (d) No odor of the test gas or vapor shall be detected by the wearer in the air breathed during any such test, and the wearer shall not be subjected to any undue discomfort or encumbrance because of the fit, air delivery, or other features of the respirator during the testing period. §84.160 Man test for gases and vapors; Type A and Type AE respirators; test requirements. (a) The completely assembled respirator will be worn in a chamber containing 0.1 # 0.025 percent isoamyl acetate vapor, and the blower, the intake of the hose, and not more than 25 percent of the hose length will be located in isoamyl acetate-free air. (b) The man in the isoamyl acetate atmosphere will draw his inspired air through the hose, connections, and all parts of the air device by means of his lungs alone (blower not operating). (c) The 10-minute work test will be repeated with the blower in operation at any practical speed up to 50 revolutions of the crank per minute. §84.161 Man test for gases and vapors; Type B and Type BE respirators; test requirements. (a) The completely assembled respirator will be worn in a chamber containing 0.1 # 0.025 percent isoamyl acetate vapor, and the intake of the hose, and not more than 25 percent of the hose length will be located in isoamyl acetate-free air. (b) The man in the isoamyl acetate atmosphere will draw his inspired air through the hose and connections by means of his lungs alone.
