They attended forums with local people and cadres to sum up experiences in the development of the rural joint-stock cooperative system invented by local people and cadres. Xie Fei believes that this joint-stock system with the right to use farmland pooled together, which is currently practiced in the rural areas of Nanhai and Zhongshan cities, is innovative and a great reform of the land management system and has pointed out a new road for relatively economically developed areas to deepen reform, stabilize agricultural production, develop the secondary and tertiary economy, and realize the integration of urban and rural areas. Xie Fei reminded the cadres that they should pay attention to several points when introducing the joint-stock cooperative system for land management: first, they should not be impatient and must judge whether conditions for introducing the system are available in their localities before they go into action; second, they should show respect for the peasants' choices and will; third, they should monitor the development and give positive guidance where the system has been introduced and practiced, and they should never take a laissez-faire attitude; fourth, pilot projects can be launched in the Zhu Jiang Delta area first, and then the system can be steadily popularized after more experience is obtained; and fifth, never should they resort again to the past practice of rushing headlong into mass action and that of egalitarianism and indiscriminate transfers of resources.
