G. Monakhov, E. A. Monakhova, Novosibirsk; UDC 681.324:519.68] [Abstract] Algorithms for preliminary image processing (smoothing and contouring) are studied. Contouring is based on spatial differentiation, and various spatial differentiation algorithms are compared. An approach to paralleling the algorithms is proposed, and implementation of the resultant parallel algorithms on a computing system with a MIKROS programmable structure is studied. The MIKROS architecture is described. The programs were written in Fortran-S. Subroutines in the programs are described. The efficiency of execution is evaluated. Analysis of processing effic iency indicated a speed-up of a factor of 2-3. Figures 5; references 11 (Russian).
