FBIS4-39457 "drsov110_a_94034" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Further on Denial Further on Denial LD0806145194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1347 GMT 8 Jun 94 LD0806145194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has as yet sent to the Russian Defense Ministry no orders to begin the operation on separation of the Georgian and Abkhazian troops, a Russian high- ranking military official told Interfax. The general asked not to disclose his name. He did not rule out that the peacekeeping operation in the conflict zone might begin in the next few days. However, he underlined that the Defense Ministry could not decide on this independently. IF Note: Last week the Russian Federation Council rejected the request to send a 1,500-people Russian military contingent to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, put forward by Yeltsin. One voice was lacking to send Russian peacekeepers to the conflict zone. Deputies considered the present legislative basis defining the status of Russian troops abroad to be insufficient. Moscow does not rule out that the Federation Council will go back to discussion of this issue at its next session on June 21. The leaders of the CIS states participating in the treaty on joint security have backed the decision to bring the peacekeeping forces to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze and Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba also supported this decision. Officials close to Yeltsin have no doubt that for the second time the Federation Council will back the proposal made by Yeltsin. Some experts from the president's administration suggested that the president better not force the developments. Experts repeated that in accordance with the Russian constitution, only the Federation Council can decide on performance of Russian servicemen abroad. Today well informed sources in the Georgian leadership told Interfax that the Russian peacekeeping forces could start implementation of the operation in the zone of the Georgian- Abkhazian conflict in the next few days. The same sources suggested that the peacekeeping operation could begin during the visit of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Caucasian republics on June 8-11. IF Note: During his visit to the Caucasian republics Grachev intends to meet Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. Grachev wanted to discuss with the leaders establishment of Russian military bases in these republics and implementation of the peacekeeping operations in Nagorno Karabakh and in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. The same sources told Interfax that at the first stage the peacekeeping operation might be carried out only by the Russian units stationed in Caucasus since the Federation Council had not approved of the decision to send Russian "blue helmets" to this region. Discussion of this issue by the Federation Council was put off till June 21. "However, the situation may deteriorate if we keep waiting by this term," the sources suggested. Georgian Interior Forces Commander Vladimir Chikovani said that the first stage of the operation on separation of the troops in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict must begin within the next five days after the trilateral (Georgian-Abkhazian-Russian) working group on deployment of peacekeepers in this region completed its work. Chikovani emphasized that military units of practically all CIS countries would take part in the peacekeeping operation. However, in the very beginning battalions from only the Leningrad, Ural and Privolzhsky military districts of Russia will be used. IF Note: A peacekeeping battalion has been composed from volunteers on the basis of the Ural military district. It will be brought to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict along with other Russian formations, well informed sources in the command of the Ural district announced to Interfax. Ural Military District Commander, Colonel-General Yuriy Grekov already checked the battalion. However, no exact term for its introduction into the conflict zone has as yet been established.
