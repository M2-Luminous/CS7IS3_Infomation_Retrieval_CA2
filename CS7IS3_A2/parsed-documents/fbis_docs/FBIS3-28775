The meeting was held as Japan and the United States head toward a showdown over a plethora of trade issues before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton meet. Hata arrived in Washington late Wednesday on an emergency mission seeking U.S. understanding on the Japanese position. Hata said he is bringing no new proposals to Washington. Japan has turned down a U.S. demand that numerical targets be set to measure the progress in opening Japan's markets, saying they would result in managed trade. [passage omitted]
