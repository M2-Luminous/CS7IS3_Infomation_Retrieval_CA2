The first is to sum up the work of our organizations during the period under review and to obtain their opinions concerning our program tasks. The second question entails the following objectives: to assess the extent to which our program was realized during the period under review (on both the global and local scale); to formulate recommendations concerning the realization of our program (also on the global and local scale), which could be linked to proposing suggestions for a review of individual points in the program. It is the second question that I propose to discuss here. I believe that the best method to use will be the comparison method: We should compare our program with the tenets of the coalition agreement and then compare both these documents with the declarations of the coalition government and its actual policy. Of necessity, this should be done concisely, so the present publication does not pretend to be an exhaustive presentation of its subject. Economic Revival and Struggle Against Unemployment Both the PSL program and the coalition agreement accept the general tenets of the market economy and stipulate the following goals: revival and consolidation of economic growth; increased competitiveness of the Polish economy; priority status for a campaign against unemployment; and, to quote, "a different approach (from our earlier policy) to the social welfare policy and a just distribution of the necessary hardships to be borne by different social and income groups in the course of the process of reforming the economy." The following principle has been formulated: "The social welfare policy will be treated not as an onerous appendage to the economy but as a precondition for its development." These tenets can be described as the overall objectives of the economic transformation. The above aims are accompanied by stipulations whose realization will be of instrumental significance in achieving the overall objectives. The stipulations, which are also included in our program, are: to repair the condition of the public finance sector; to develop an industry policy; to selectively protect the domestic market; to stimulate investment and export initiatives (with the help of investment allowances and credits); to reduce enterprises' debts; to accord equal treatment to the private and public sectors of the economy; to enforce financial obligations toward the state (by refusing to tolerate the so-called gray zone); and to work out a "strategy for economic growth and development." These shared ideas of our own program and the coalition agreement have found reflection in the economic policy pursued by the coalition government. This is shown by the 1994 state budget. After all, its characteristic features are: orientation in favor of the development of production, investment projects, and exports, with the associated investment concessions; tax concessions linked to the creation of new jobs in regions threatened with particularly high unemployment; the more than threefold increase of the upper limit of State Treasury credit guarantees; the threefold increase of funds allocated for the promotion of exports; increased funds for industrial restructuring (concentrated mainly in the coal- and sulfur-extraction sectors); increased funds allocated for additional financing of interest liabilities on preferential credits to agriculture; the halting of the decrease in expenditure earmarked for the budget-funded sector; an increase of the lowest disability and old-age pensions; increased expenditure on social welfare assistance schemes; development of new forms of active antiunemployment measures, including emergency and public works. The Guiding Principle All of this should be made common knowledge among delegates to report congresses. Therefore, the above questions should be presented by competent specialists who are thoroughly conversant with the PSL program and ideological principles, the contents of all coalition agreements, the Sejm acts, and government policy. They should be able to demonstrate that government policy is subordinate to the specific leading concepts ensuing from our program and from the coalition agreements. However, this by no means implies that we should suspend our possible criticism of that policy. On the other hand, it is necessary to contest the view that the PSL allegedly promised a very rapid improvement in the population's material circumstances if it won an election victory and participation in the government. The PSL maintained consistently that all that could possibly be achieved on a short-term basis would be a rationalization of the economy that would not create a sufficient foundation for any significant improvement of the working people's situation, and that such chances would have to wait until a long-term economic program was first worked out and then put into practice. The same position is held by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the coalition. Our Attitude Toward the SLD and the Coalition Discussion of these topics entails the question of our fundamental position regarding the SLD, including the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP]. This should be defined by two factors: the PSL's attitude toward the doctrine of social democracy, which is expressed in our Ideological Declaration, and the requirement that we cooperate with the social democrats in the interest of keeping a center-left government. Let me recall that our Ideological Declaration states clearly the following: "The ideology of the Polish Peasant Party endorses selected aspects of the doctrines of social democracy and democratic socialism. This is because the policy of agrarianism is characterized by a similar sensitivity to questions of social justice and exploitation, political and economic democracy, public self-government structures, the forms and functions of ownership, and the socialization of the economic management processes." It follows from this that our potential criticism of the SLD cannot be construed as arising from the fact that the latter adopts a social democratic--or, in this context, leftist--orientation. It follows further that our possible criticism of that formation would be more justified if it were seen to betray the ideals of social democracy than if it actually cultivated these ideals. There are, in fact, some grounds for asking whether the SdRP is, on certain occasions, true to the social democratic doctrine. It is worth recalling that, in the light of its Ideological Declaration, the PSL is a center-left group. It follows from this that any potential right-oriented sympathies on our members' part would be incompatible with the PSL's ideological principles. The requirement of cooperation with the social democrats in the interest of maintaining a center-left oriented government is quite obvious. In such a coalition, the PSL is able to preserve its ideological identity. A coalition with right-oriented groups would result in a significant curtailment of the realization of our program and could even lead to a denial of the PSL's ideological identity. Where there are any differences of opinion between the PSL and the SdRP, it is necessary to apply every effort of will to overcome these differences. I believe that this is always possible on the basis of a rational (as opposed to emotional) set of arguments. The rationality of the arguments should rest on the ideological principles of both groups. As regards progress in implementing our program, it is also worth noting certain associated restrictions formulated in the coalition agreement. The agreement contains the following statement: "As for our predecessors, we differ from them not so much in our formulation of the general economic objectives as in the methods, tactics, and means we recommend for their realization." It could, of course, be said that the coalition intends to create a market economy just as the former Solidarity-derived governments did. However, the particular models of that economy vary in each case, and this should reflect the fundamental difference between the aims adopted by the Solidarity governments (which were right-oriented) and the center-left governments. This very difference in the respective governments' aims should find its expression on the plane of forging economic relations--that is, so-called ownership relations--and distribution relations specific for the coalition. On the first point, there is no full consensus between the PSL and the SLD, so we should strive to work out an agreement in this matter as soon as possible. Here we must be guided by the idea of mixed ownership, which stands in direct contrast to the absolute value placed on the capitalist concept of ownership. The question of relations of distribution requires a deeper treatment. The coalition agreement states: "The state must seek to alleviate the sharp contrasts between the incomes of various social groups inherent in the essence of the market economy, and, in particular, it must counteract the spread of areas of destitution in our society." Our objective here is not solely to alleviate the differences in peoples' incomes. A center-left government should by definition be guided by the principle of significantly reducing the imbalance in the distribution of national income; it should also seek to exert influence on the very model of the relations of distribution in the spirit of social justice. Learning and Labor Before Capital In his 29 December 1993 Sejm address, the prime minister said, among other things: "It is necessary to restore balance in Poland so that learning and labor take precedence over capital.... It is our duty in a civilized country to ensure prosperity for society as a whole, and not just for select elements of society, even if the latter demonstrate the utmost economic activity." I believe that this is precisely the spirit that should influence the shaping of government policy. I should like to recommend that we base the long-term strategic government program on the fundamental principles of agrarianism (and, by the same token, on John Paul II's social teaching, on which we draw in our Ideological Declaration). This question should also be accorded particular attention at the PSL's future report congresses.
