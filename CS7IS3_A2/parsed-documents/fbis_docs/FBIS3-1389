Barry, can you hear me? [Claassen] I can hear you. [Glyn] Barry, can you tell us, where were those shots coming from? It seemed to be unclear when you last spoke to us. [Claassen] Well, it appears that there are snipers on the rooftops, shooting down into the crowds. The police are shooting back with what appear to be 9 mm pistols. I personally came across a man lying in the street. It looked as if he'd been shot in the head, blood pouring out of his head, and he wasn't moving. We've now heard an unconfirmed report of about 15 people being shot. How many of those have been killed, I don't know, but as you might hear in the background, there's still sporadic gunfire being heard. At the moment it's very chaotic, with people crowding into shop doorways and trying to keep down. It's total, it's complete chaos here. [Glyn] Are any of the snipers on top of the city council building? [Claassen] Not that we can see. Some of the high buildings, but not the city council building at this stage, but anything is possible. You know, you can't always make out where the shots are coming from, but I did see snipers up on the buildings. Who they are, I'm not quite sure. [Glyn] But the crowd is making no attempt to disperse? Do I understand that? [Claassen] At the moment, not. I think they most probably might be too terrified to move away, so what they're doing is, they're lying down on the pavement. [Glyn] Barry, I'm sure we'll hear from you again, but do take care of yourself.
