FR941216-2-00012 FR941216-2-00006 [A&hyph;791&hyph;802] Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Furfuryl Alcohol From the Republic of South Africa AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lori Way or John Brinkmann, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0656 or 482&hyph;5288, respectively. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that imports of furfuryl alcohol from the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on June 20, 1994 (59 FR 32953, June 27, 1994), the following events have occurred. On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination in this case ( see 59 FR 38201, July 27, 1994). On July 19, 1994, officials of the Department of Commerce (the Department) visited the petitioner's facilities to observe the furfuryl alcohol production process for purposes of developing the questionnaire. On August 3, 1994, the Department issued an antidumping questionnaire to Illovo Sugar Limited (ISL), which accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation (POI). In August 1994, officials from the Department presented this questionnaire to ISL in South Africa. On August 29, 1994, ISL submitted its response to Section A of our questionnaire. On September 21, 1994, ISL submitted its response to Sections B and C of our questionnaire. A supplemental questionnaire was issued on October 19, 1994. On November 7, 1994, ISL submitted its response to this supplemental questionnaire. QO Chemicals, Inc. (the petitioner) submitted comments regarding deficiencies in the ISL's questionnaire responses in September, October and November 1994. ISL submitted comments regarding the petitioner's submissions in September and November 1994. On October 7, 1994, the petitioner requested that the preliminary determination be postponed until December 9, 1994. We have done so in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1994). Cost of Production Allegation On October 25, 1994, the petitioner filed an allegation that ISL's home market sales of furfuryl alcohol during the POI were sold at less than the cost of production (COP). On November 9, 1994, we issued a deficiency letter regarding the allegation. The petitioner filed supplements to its COP allegation in October, November and December 1994. During November and December 1994, ISL filed numerous submissions regarding the petitioner's COP allegation. Based on our analysis of this allegation, we have determined that a COP investigation is warranted. We will determine whether ISL had made sales below COP for the final determination. Postponement of Final Determination Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, ISL requested on December 2, 1994, that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation, the Department postpone the final determination until no later than 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary determination in the Federal Register . Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary determination is affirmative, and no compelling reasons for denial exist, we have done so. Scope of the Investigation The product covered by this investigation is furfuryl alcohol (C 4 H 3 OCH 2 OH). Furfuryl alcohol is a primary alcohol, and is colorless or pale yellow in appearance. It is used in the manufacture of resins and as a wetting agent and solvent for coating resins, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and other soluble dyes. The product subject to this investigation is classifiable under subheading 2932.13.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is December 1, 1993, through May 31, 1994. Such or Similar Comparisons We have determined that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar merchandise. ISL reported that it sold merchandise in the home market identical to that sold in the United States. Accordingly, no difference in merchandise information was reported in ISL's sales listings. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where possible. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether sales by ISL of furfuryl alcohol to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. United States Price For the purpose of this preliminary determination, we have found that ISL and its exclusive selling agent, Harborchem, are related parties pursuant to Section 771(13) of the Act ( See concurrence memorandum, dated December 7, 1994, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Department building), and that all of ISL's U.S. sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States. Therefore, we based USP on exporter's sales prices, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The claimed relationship between ISL and Harborchem is based on one of agency. We will, however, reexamine the issue of agency for the purpose of the final determination. We calculated ISL's exporter's sales price sales based on FOB U.S. storage or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for the following movement charges in accordance with section 772(e) of the Act: foreign loading on ship, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, tank car rental, U.S inland freight, U.S. inland insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. duty. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses, indirect selling expenses incurred in South Africa, and indirect selling expenses incurred in the United States, including quality control testing, inventory carrying expenses, warehousing expenses, and U.S. storage insurance. We did not make one of the adjustments for freight claimed by Harborchem because there is not adequate information on the record to support this adjustment. Further, we did not make an adjustment to the margin for export incentive payments received by ISL from the Government of the Republic of South Africa through the Government's General Export Incentive Scheme because there is no on-going companion countervailing duty investigation and no such duties are currently being collected ( see concurrence memorandum, dated December 7, 1994).
