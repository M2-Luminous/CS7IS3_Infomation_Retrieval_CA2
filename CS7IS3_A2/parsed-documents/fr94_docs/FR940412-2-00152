FR940412-2-00152 FR940412-2-00109 [Docket Nos. STN 50&hyph;528, STN 50&hyph;529, and STN 50&hyph;530] Arizona Public Service Co., et al.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3 Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;41, NPF&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74 issued to Arizona Public Service Company, (the licensee), for operation of Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3 located in Wintersburg, Arizona. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed action would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications (TS) related to increasing the pressurizer safety valve (PSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent to +3 percent and ^1 percent, increasing the main steam safety valve (MSSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent to +/^3 percent, reducing the high pressurizer pressure trip setpoint (HPPT) response time from 1.15 seconds to 0.5 second, and reducing the Technical Specifications minimum auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump flow requirement from 750 gallons per minute (GPM) to 650 GPM. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated November 13, 1990, as supplemented by letters of additional information dated May 27, 1992, May 13, 1993, and November 12, 1993. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed changes to the TS are required in order to provide the licensee with operational flexibility in meeting surveillance requirements for auxiliary feedwater (AFW) flow, and pressurizer safety valve (PSV) and main steam safety valve (MSSV) lift setpoint tolerances. The proposed change to the TS also involves a reduction of the high pressurizer pressure trip (HPPT) response time. This reduction is necessary to ensure that the peak pressures during postulated accident scenarios for the other changes (AWF, PSV, and MSSV) do not violate safety limits. Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS and the licensee's assessment of increased radiological release as a result of the safety valve setpoint tolerance change and the proposed reduction in auxiliary feedwater flow. For the most limiting SGTR scenario, this results in an increase in the 2-hour thyroid dose from 200 rem to less than 248 rem. Adding the increased dose due to the expanded PSV and MSSV setpoint tolerances (which the licensee calculated as a 5-percent dose increase), results in a 2-hour dose of 260 rem. This value provides adequate margin to the 10 CFR part 100 guideline of 300 rem. The licensee also evaluated radiological release for the reactor coolant pump (RCP) shaft seizure event, and determined that the calculated 0.5 rem increase was insignificant compared to the 246 rem dose reported in Supplement 2 to the staff's Safety Evaluation Report related to the Combustion Engineering Standard Safety Analyses Report (CESSAR) for System 80, and the 300 rem SRP acceptance criteria. The staff finds the analysis results, utilizing proper conservatisms, to be within 10 CFR guidelines. Therefore, the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the Federal Register on December 27, 1990 (55 FR 53220). Two petitions for leave to intervene and request for hearing were filed following this Notice. One request was denied and the other granted. However, the party that was granted the hearing later voluntarily withdrew their contention. Alternative to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. This would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement related to operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3, dated February 1982 (NUREG 0841). Agencies and Persons Consulted The staff consulted the State of Arizona official regarding environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official had no comments. Finding of No Significant Impact Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment. For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's application for amendment dated November 13, 1990, and supplemented by letters of additional information dated May 27, 1992, May 13, 1993, and November 12, 1993, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85004. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 6th day of April 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Theodore R. Quay, Director, Project Directorate IV&hyph;3, Division of Reactor Project III/IV, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
