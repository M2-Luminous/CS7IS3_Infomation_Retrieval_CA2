Credit Lyonnais"] [Text] [PARIS MATCH] Do you not believe that public opinion is justly shocked by the announcement of the 7-billion-franc [Fr] deficit in your 1993 accounts and the Fr20 billion which the government has promised to pay in order to eliminate your debts? [Peyrelevade] The Credit Lyonnais is a large company. Its recovery is essential for its customers, its shareholders, its staff, and for Paris' reputation as a financial center. As for the government, to whom I have to render homage, it had in fact no other reasonable solution than to support us. I would refer you to the banking law. This provides that, whenever a bank is in difficulty, its shareholder or shareholders must do their duty. Why should the state be the only shareholder to escape this obligation? Moreover, it was for the government the best way of protecting its investment. [PARIS MATCH] Despite the recession and the property crisis, France's two other major banks, the BNP [National Bank of Paris] and the Societe Generale, posted profits of Fr1 billion and Fr3.6 billion respectively. How do you justify a deficit of Fr6.9 billion and reserves of almost Fr18 billion? [Peyrelevade] At the origin of our losses, there is of course the economic recession. But all banks on the market are suffering from this. The other explanation, which is much more important, is specific to the Credit Lyonnais. In recent years, this bank has been involved in ventures most of which were carried out via subsidiaries, and following procedures which have escaped the normal central control system. Reserves have accumulated. On property deals. But on other types of business too. I am thinking of the many majority participations taken in enterprises of every kind, from garments to the distribution industry and to golf courses... One ends up with such large amounts that the Credit Lyonnais obviously does not have the capacity, through its own operation, to make good the cost of the past. [PARIS MATCH] The government has decided not to punish your predecessor. Have you shown similar clemency toward the presidents of Credit Lyonnais subsidiaries who "escaped the central control system?" [Peyrelevade] I am not a court judge. But to make the Credit Lyonnais once again into an exemplary bank, I must choose the best professionals wherever they are found. Jean-Francois Henin has left Altus, now under the management of Dominique Bazy, who was with me at UAP [Paris Insurance Union]. The president of SDBO [expansion unknown] is going to change. Other departures have already taken place. I will continue, calmly, as long as is necessary. [PARIS MATCH] The Credit Lyonnais has stacked up Fr43 billion of doubtful property loans, almost Fr5 billion of them to the Pelege group alone. Is it not a little facile to get rid of the problem by creating a property company, with the state taking care of the losses for five years? Is this not a game of hide-and-seek? [Peyrelevade] There are no conjuring tricks. What is imperative is to restore the quality of Credit Lyonnais balance sheet. To do this, we are setting up a "defeasance" [as published] company, in which we are transferring our troublesome property loans. It is true that it is the state which will be picking up the losses. This is a customary technique. It has been used by the state in Sweden for larger amounts than those involved at the Credit Lyonnais, and in order to restore private banks to health. In France it has been used by both public and private banks -- such as Banque Worms, the BIMP [Private Industrial and Tranferable Securities Bank], Pallas Stern, the Banque des Travaux Publics [Public Works Bank], and the Comptoir des Entrepreneurs [Entrepreneurs Bank] -- and for amounts often proportionately larger than our own. Why is this technique used? Because, in order to keep one's loans on the balance sheet, one has to set up reserves. The fact is that it is strictly impossible to know in what amount, given the uncertainties surrounding the present and future property markets. We are therefore acting with wisdom and prudence. I would add that we have agreed to review the situation with the government in two years' time. If the Credit Lyonnais recovers faster than expected, we will take back over part of the burden of this property company. [PARIS MATCH] Are you talking about privatizing the Credit Lyonnais? If so, when will it take place? [Peyrelevade] Privatization is dependent on the bank returning to profitability. 1996 seems a good date to me. [PARIS MATCH] You have inherited the Tapie file and the billion francs which Credit Lyonnais has granted him. Many corporate heads are surprised that, while refusing to grant them credit, you accord favorable treatment to Bernard Tapie. [Peyrelevade] As soon as one mentions Mr. Tapie, passions rise so high that the information becomes distorted. It is true that Credit Lyonnais' SDBO subsidiary lent him in my view too much money. Since 1 December 1993, not only have we not lent him one more cent, but our outstandings to his group are going to reduce, as we have demanded sales mandates on several of his assets: Terraillan, La Vie Claire, and the "Phocea." And that is not all. I was of the opinion that the guaranties previously taken by Credit Lyonnais were not satisfactory. Henceforward, we have a guaranty which is legally sound, on all of Mr Tapie's assets, including his private mansion and his furniture. I do not think we are giving him a gift! [PARIS MATCH] Your fellow bankers consider it normal that the state do its duty, but publicly, like the president of Societe Generale, they say that, before asking for taxpayers' money, they would like to see the Credit Lyonnais make a special effort to find its way back to profitability. What austerity cure are you preparing? [Peyrelevade] I have already told personnel that general expenses will not increase in 1994 and 1995. We are also talking with the trade unions, as staffing levels will have to be cut by 10 percent, or more than 3,500 people, over the next three years in France. I have asked the 20 members of the general management committee to accept a 10-percent pay cut in return for promises of Credit Lyonnais shares. This will demonstrate their confidence in the bank's ability to turn itself around. Finally, Credit Lyonnais will sell Fr20 billion of assets from its industrial and commercial portfolio. [PARIS MATCH] How do you expect to sell Fr20 billion of assets in two years? It is true that your listed participations are worth between Fr5 and 10 billion. But elsewhere experts believe that you are "stuck" with unlisted participations in the Arnault, Ballor, and Pinault holding companies, which are unsalable. [Peyrelevade] We are first of all going to sell what is liquid. This involves in particular our major customers. I have spoken personally with all the presidents involved, and met with a high degree of understanding everywhere. When we will have improved our situation, we will return to them. [PARIS MATCH] One of the conditions for the Credit Lyonnais' recovery is for it to grant more credit to retail customers and corporations. This requires lower French interest rates. Is the Bank of France not overly cautious? [Peyrelevade] It is a pity we do not do everything in our power to lower interest rates. In particular I regret that steps have not been taken to bring down regulated rates faster, whether on A savings accounts, savings banks accounts, or building society accounts. [PARIS MATCH] Is it not dangerous to lower our rates if we want to defend a strong franc, of which you are an ardent defender? [Peyrelevade] I am a partisan of tying the franc and the mark tightly together, but there is no reason whatsoever for the franc to weaken today. Nowadays, the German economy is less competitive than the French one. That ought to be explained better to the markets. One could then lower rates more rapidly. [PARIS MATCH] You talk of the markets. They appear to be worried at the increase in French public deficits. Are they right? [Peyrelevade] We are approaching the danger zone in terms of government deficits. It would be dangerous to go further. We have to steer a careful course and begin to reduce these gradually as the recovery picks up.
