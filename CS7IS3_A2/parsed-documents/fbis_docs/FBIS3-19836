Of the approximately 4 billion schillings that have so far been invested by foreigners, about 1 billion has come from Austria. About 25 percent of the 4,500 joint ventures and subsidiaries in Slovakia are controlled or owned by Austrian enterprises, Katharina Dragschitz, deputy trade delegate to Bratislava, said at a symposium on Slovak-Austrian relations in Moravany near Pistyan. In 1993, Austrian exports amounted to 4.1 billion schillings while products worth 3 billion schillings were imported from Slovakia last year. For Slovakia, Austria's accession to the European Union [EU] would be of major importance because Vienna supports the integration of East and Central Europe into the community, Jan Lisucha, state secretary in the Slovak Foreign Ministry, said. Austria was playing an important role for Slovakia in connection with other issues, too: Some embassies in Vienna are accredited for Slovakia, and many Western companies are dealing with the Slovak market via Vienna. Bilateral contacts in the spheres of culture, science, and the arts have intensified. However, new border checkpoints must be opened, Lisucha noted. [passage omitted]
