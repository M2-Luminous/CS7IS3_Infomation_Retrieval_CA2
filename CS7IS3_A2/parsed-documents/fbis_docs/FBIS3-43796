Fortunately, the signing of the draft agreement and of the particular arrangements related to the equitable and balanced sharing of power during the transitional period is today a reality. I therefore called on [break in reception] the abolition of the double institution system and the creation of a single parliament called the High Council of the Republic [HCR] or transitional parliament, and the formation of a single government, fourth, the adoption of a referendum and electoral timetable. I am convinced that the proper implementation of these provisions will definitively put an end to the political confusion that has prevailed so far in the country. The immediate consequences of the coming into force of these Palais du Peuple agreements are the dissolution of the National Assembly that resulted from the 1987 legislative elections and of the High Council of the Republic that resulted from the sovereign national conference, and the resignation of the present transitional government which, as of today, is charged with taking care of current affairs until the formation of a new government. Very dear compatriots, as promised in my recent New Year's message, I will very soon sign the texts sanctioning the Palais du Peuple agreements. Right now, as far as I am concerned, I will summon the HCR, that is the transitional parliament, to an extraordinary session on 17 January. The agenda for this session, which will not extend past 15 days, might include the following points: First, the internal organization of the parliament, which implies the verification and validation of the terms of office of its members, the working out and adoption of its rules of procedure, the election of its standing executive committee, and the setting up of its working commissions; second, the drawing up and adoption of the constitutional text of the transition; and third, the election of the prime minister, head of the transitional government. Dear countrymen, regarding the transitional government, I would like to recall that in conformity with the spirit of the agreements signed at the Palais du Peuple and my renewed promise on 4 January, the prime minister and head of the government is expected to be appointed from the opposition. His appointment must be decided by consensus at a consultative meeting between the political and social forces represented within the High Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament. As everyone knows, during the four months of consultations at the Palais du Peuple, no consensus was reached on the nomination of the prime minister of the transitional government. On 9 January, that is five days after my 4 January message to the nation, the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] allies and the political forces of the conclave reached a consensus on a prime ministerial candidate in the person of Professor Mulumba Lukoyi. Furthermore, in a letter addressed to me on 12 January, the USOR introduced the candidature of Mr. Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba. In accordance with the democratic logic underlying the accords of the Palais du Peuple and in virtue of the attributions of the High Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament, it is up to this institution to deliberate the issue. I will therefore wait for the High Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament, to proposes to me an ordinance to be issued on the name of the new prime minister and head of government. Nevertheless, on account of the acute crisis facing the country, along with the people, I expect that this time the transitional parliament will not be bogged down in futile and ill-timed quarrels. My dear countrymen, to end this message, I urge all Zairian citizens -- men, women, and children -- each in his sector, to show a high sense of discipline, patriotism, and civic duty so that in 1994, with the help of God and our ancestors, we can conclude our democratic process. Thus we can allow Zaire to at last play the role that belongs to it in the concert of nations of Africa and the world. God bless Zaire and its people. Thank you.
