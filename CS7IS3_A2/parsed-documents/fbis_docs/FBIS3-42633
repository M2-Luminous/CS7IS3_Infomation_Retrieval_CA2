The Language of Figures. Revenues to the CIS"] [Text] The CIS was conceived primarily as an instrument for preserving the unified economic space. The leaders of the new states understood that nobody would be able to single-handedly bring them out of the economic crisis, which was manifesting itself in all its depth by 1991, and that this could be achieved only through all-around cooperation on a new, mutually advantageous basis following the principles of a market economy. Declarations of such cooperation were made repeatedly. But, concerned about their own difficulties, the new states were unable to realize them. The results of this situation, as could have been expected, were pathetic. In two years the national income of the CIS countries from all sources decreased by one-third. There was an especially sharp decline of production in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, which were gripped by armed conflicts. The share of these states and also of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, where the economic reforms were delayed for various reasons and to various degrees, in the CIS production volume from all sources decreased (Table 1). Because of this there were greater differences in the levels of economic development and well-being of the population of individual countries (Tables 2 and 3). As is the practice in international statistics, the measure of the level of economic development in one country or another is made up of indicators of national income calculated per capita of the population and per one individual employed in the branches of material production. The indicators in all of the tables were obtained by translation into a single currency--rubles--taking into account differences in the actual price levels in individual countries. Table 1.
