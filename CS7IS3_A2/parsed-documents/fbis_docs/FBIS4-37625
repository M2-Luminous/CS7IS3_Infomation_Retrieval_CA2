[Savir] There were representatives from 14 Arab countries, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, the United States, Japan, Russia, and Europe. We decided on approximately 35 projects. We agreed to strengthen economic cooperation. We decided that the economy must be based on open borders and the free movement of commodities. For the first time, it was decided to establish a permanent Middle East framework, in which Jordan, the Palestinians, Egypt, and Israel would participate, to monitor various regional projects in the fields of transportation, tourism, and electricity. I believe that the main achievement of the Rabat conference was the sense shared by all the participants that through economic cooperation and by working together, we can develop the region. [Ganor] What viable regional plans were agreed on? [Savir] The main issue this time was tourism. A whole day was devoted to this subject. There are various facets pertaining to tourism. Work has begin on feasibility surveys for roads and railway tracks. During this round, the United States proposed a plan to promote civil aviation between the countries in the region. An instructional center will be established in Egypt to train qualified personnel to handle regional tourism. Swiss experts will prepare feasibility studies in al-'Aqabah, Elat, and Jericho. Approximately 1.5 million tourists visit here each year. As peace draws near, these figures should rise to European levels. Similar projects are being formulated in the fields of agriculture and with regard to linking the region's electricity grids. Feasibility studies will soon be completed, and then we will have to attract investments from the private sector. This issue was discussed as well. [Ganor] What time frames are we talking about? [Savir] We are talking about uninterrupted work. Whenever a round of talks such as the recent one in Rabat takes place, attention is focused on the multilateral economic talks; however, experts now hold limited conferences on specific subjects -- whether it be tourism, transportation, or communications -- almost every week. These experts are about to complete feasibility studies. I believe that the crowning achievement this time was the unprecedented discussion on the establishment of a financial mechanism to finance these projects. Second, a conference with the participation of the private sector will take place in Marrakech in November, at the initiative of Foreign Minister Peres. These projects will be presented to the managers of the largest U.S., Japanese, European, and Middle Eastern companies, including Israel. An attempt will be made to attract them to invest here. The Middle East understands that it must function as a region, not just as Egyptians, Jordanians, and Israelis. If we do not coalesce as one economic region, the international community will not invest here, because the various regions of the world are competing for funds. [Ganor] What is the probability of Syria joining the multilateral talks? [Savir] That is hard to say. This decision is for Syria to make. At this stage, it has still not joined; however, representatives from the EC and Japan said that they visited Damascus on the eve of the Rabat conference and sensed great Syrian interest in all these projects. The Syrians asked the Europeans to return to Damascus to brief them on the results. Perhaps Syria is beginning to understand that the train has already left the station and that this opportunity must not be missed. Ultimately, not only will Syria contribute to the peace process, but the peace process will also contribute to the Syrian economy. I believe that the multilateral track has now become too important for any party to want to remain outside. No one can afford to remain outside. As I said before, however, this is a Syrian decision, and it is undoubtedly linked to progress in the bilateral talks. [Ganor] In your talks with the Moroccan representatives, was there any agreement on how to translate the special relationship between the two countries into diplomatic ties? [Savir] We were given a very warm welcome by the Moroccan Government. We held various talks. At this stage, there is a great deal of very positive normalization in our ties with Morocco, but we have still not reached the stage of formalized relations. We discussed the strengthening of economic ties. Look, one keeps on meeting Israeli tourists in Rabat. When we left, we ran into a delegation of 300 people at the airport. The Moroccan Manufacturers Association expressed its desire to formalize ties with its Israeli counterpart. Therefore, our relations are growing stronger. We are seeing the fruits of peace, although we have not yet established diplomatic relations. Let us fill in the contents first, and the framework will undoubtedly follow. [Ganor] Thank you, Mr. Savir.
