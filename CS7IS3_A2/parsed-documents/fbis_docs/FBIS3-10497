[Magalhaes] I find it quite undefined because there is still only a single known candidate: Lula [Inacio Lula Da Silva] of the PT [Workers Party]. Since he never captures more than one-third of the electorate, it does not seem he will be elected by a majority. The country is trying to find a solution without Lula. But those who think like that have not yet found the road. It is a difficult road to find not only because there are many parties fighting for leadership but also because there are many interests and personal problems. [Faria] During the national PFL [Liberal Front Party] meeting, part of the party wanted to launch your presidential candidacy. But you found a way to stop it. Why? [Magalhaes] It would be hasty. First of all, the party must finish its government program. If Brazil is in a bad state of mismanagement, it is up to the PFL to show the country the excessive size of the state and the bad use of public administration. The party can do that even in alliance with other organizations if the essential part of the program we are drawing up is maintained. An alliance in the first round may be the best solution, not only for the party but also for the country. The PFL could make alliances with almost all parties. Any party making alliances should not be prejudiced. It should not exclude anyone. [Faria] But the noticeable aspect of the PFL national meeting was the great interest in an alliance with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. [Magalhaes] The truth is local problems have great influence on parties in making alliances. I believe local problems will not hurt an important national alliance. The PSDB is a party that has leaders with whom an alliance is possible. For example, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Governor Ciro Gomes (Ceara), PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, and party leaders Mario Covas (Senate) and Jose Serra (Chamber of Deputies) are very good men. In the case of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, he obviously has a good image in the media despite the 40 percent monthly inflation rate. I believe if inflation is not defeated, his candidacy will not hold. But if inflation is defeated, he will be a strong presidential candidate in any alliance. [Faria] Do you believe the minister's economic plan can defeat inflation? [Magalhaes] That plan is better than nothing, but it will only be good if it is made to last. The truth is that the plan came too late; it should have been presented before. The date 28 February is dangerous because it marks the launching of the Cruzado Plan. The new plan cannot have the false promises of the Cruzado Plan, which became an electoral plan. It must be lasting and aimed at carrying out a profound state reform. But I have confidence that the minister and his economists will not deceive the nation and that they have a good chance to succeed. This is possible because there are now favorable international conditions that did not exist when the Cruzado Plan was implemented. [Faria] You seem to have some enthusiasm for Cardoso and not for Prefect Paulo Maluf, who advocates an alliance between the PFL and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. [Magalhaes] I have no prejudice about names. I had a meeting with him the other day, and he would not be an obstacle to any kind of contacts. But I do not have to launch his name. I know he has some frictions with the PFL that might or might not disappear, depending on his work with our party members and on the changes made in Sao Paulo Prefecture. Maluf still has to present an administrative program for Sao Paulo to have the nation trust his reputation as a good administrator. He may succeed if he spends more time on his administration and less on politics. [Faria] Does an alliance include the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] of [former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes] Quercia? [Magalhaes] I do not exclude the PMDB of any other leader. The PMDB currently is very divided and an alliance would be better with leaders that unite. According to what I read, Deputy Antonio Britto (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]) is the leader who unites better. But also according to what I read, Britto only plans to run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul. Well, I am not going to get involved in the PMDB's internal affairs. The party leaders can resolve their internal problems, and we will be open to an alliance without excluding any names. [Faria] The PFL's total opening sometimes causes surprise. Like the contact promoted by PFL Senate leader Marco Maciel (PE [Pernambuco]) with [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel Brizola. I believe an alliance with Brizola is practically impossible. [Magalhaes] I also believe that. Even with the ability of Senator Marco Maciel, I find it very difficult to reach an alliance. But I would like to reiterate that I am against excluding anyone. [Faria] In other words, you support the theory of the government leader in the Senate, Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS), that a broad anti-Lula alliance should be made. [Magalhaes] I am against a special alliance against anything. Brazil does not like the "anti." In Bahia I grew stronger as my adversaries became anti-Magalhaes. [Faria] What would be your electoral support in that framework? [Magalhaes] I am only talking about Bahia. My situation in my state is quite reasonable. It is a strong state in the national context with an electorate of 7 million people. I believe the presidential succession will depend on Bahia, and I will do as much as I can to have my party contribute to finding the best solution for Brazil, either with my name in front or somebody else's name. What I want is for the country to come out of the current situation. [Faria] We are getting into the constitutional amendments. Do you support the reelection of the president and governors, and the reduction of the deadline for a candidate to leave his post to run for another office? [Magalhaes] I hope to run for a seat in the Senate for Bahia. But if there is reelection, I will be a candidate for governor again with a great chance to win. But I do not believe Congress would approve reelection for the current governors. Regarding the reduction of the deadline to leave a post to run for another office, I would be a hypocrite if I said I oppose it. But I am not fighting for it; I would be satisfied if I had three or four more months to run my state. At any rate, I am getting ready to leave on 30 March. I believe the other governors think the same way.
