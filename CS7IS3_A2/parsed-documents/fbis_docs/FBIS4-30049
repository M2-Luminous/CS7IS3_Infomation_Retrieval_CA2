Pyongyang, in a letter to Washington, said it would "comply in full" with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards agreement, Han said at a press conference. "You can take this to mean that this includes North Korea's compliance in explaining its past nuclear activities," said Han. Han's remarks suggest that North Korea has agreed to the "special inspections" demanded by the IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog agency, of two sites believed to store nuclear waste materials after the North's secretive reprocessing activities in the past. Han denied widespread press reports that Washington was ready to overlook whatever North Korea may have done during its past nuclear development. "That's just not true," said Han. "The past has been the problem from the beginning, and that is why the matter was referred to the UN Security Council. We cannot close our eyes to that." On the proposed inter-Korean summit, the foreign minister said Seoul will not try to set the agenda beforehand though the two sides are expected to discuss implementation of the agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. A "miraculous" breakthrough in the nuclear impasse was achieved after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter met directly with North Korean leader Kim Il-song. Kim relayed through Carter that North Korea would comply fully with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime and with the IAEA safeguards accord, allow IAEA inspectors to remain in North Korea, keep IAEA monitoring equipment in operation and freeze its nuclear activities. Pyongyang confirmed these intentions directly to Washington Thursday, and U.S. President Bill Clinton personally declared that efforts for UN sanctions against North Korea will be suspended and the next round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will open in Geneva early next month. What North Korea said about complying fully with the NPT and the safeguards accord "carries in it various meanings," Han told reporters, especially regarding its intentions to show what it has done in the past with spent fuel. "At least the possibility of recounting the past through access to the two undeclared sites remains alive," he said. "It is unclear as to whether it is still possible for the IAEA to recount what North Korea did with its spent nuclear fuel rods in a way it wants and needs. But an explanation of the past would be possible when this complemented access to the two sites," said Han. As to what constituted satisfactory inspection of past activities, the foreign minister said it would have to be a method guaranteeing 100-percent transparency deemed satisfactory to the IAEA. He denied reports that the Clinton administration was ready to overlook what North Korea may already have done. "It was a choice of whether the issue of the past should be settled before or during the third round of North Korea-U.S. high- level talks. It was not a choice of whether to address or ignore it," said Han. While stressing the importance of both tracing the past and staving off nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Han said the time factor places more emphasis on freezing the North's nuclear program. He described a "new basis" to continue diplomatic efforts on the nuclear problem created by Pyongyang's latest gesture. "It's true that the basis for dialogue was broken when North Korea unloaded fuel rods from its nuclear reactor," he said. "But a new basis was laid with new conditions such as North Korea's promise not to reload and reprocess."
