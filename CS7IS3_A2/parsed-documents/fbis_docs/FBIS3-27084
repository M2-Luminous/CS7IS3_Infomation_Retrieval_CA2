She told reporters that Vietnam would hold dialogue with the United States on all issues of common concern, including human rights, on the basis of equality and mutual respect but including non-interference in each other's internal affairs. She said that the process of normalization of relations would depend on the efforts and sincerity of both sides. Since the United States announced it was lifting its trade embargo against Vietnam on February 3, the human-rights issue has become the major problem in Vietnamese-U.S. relations. The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, who is in charge of Asian affairs, has said the relations between the two countries would develop only if Vietnam demonstrates an improvement in its approach to human rights. However, Ho The Lan said that although Vietnam believes in the importance of developing ties with the U.S. it would be on the basis of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. She added that the two sides have agreed to discuss in Hanoi the set-up of liaison offices and will hold talks on the human rights issue in New York at the end of this month.
