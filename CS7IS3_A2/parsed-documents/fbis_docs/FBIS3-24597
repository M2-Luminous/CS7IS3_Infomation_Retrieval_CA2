Vlasov, L.V. Pautova, Ye.Yu. Rykova, and L.A. Yakubov, Novosibirsk Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 577.123] [Abstract] A study examined the reaction of oligonucleotides and their reactive derivatives carrying the fragment 4'[N-2-chloroethyl-N-methyl)amino]benzylamine in their 5'-terminal phosphate group with the proteins of blood serum. The desoxyribonucleotides p(T)[.sup]16[/] and (pTGACCCTCTTCCCATT) used in the studies were synthesized by the phosphotriester method in a solution. A [.sup]32[/]P radioactive label was introduced into the oligonucleotides by exchange of the 5'-terminal phosphate. Double-stranded DNA of the plasmid pTZ18R and heparin were used as competitors to determine the specificity of the reaction of the oligonucleotide derivatives with the proteins. Murine monoclonal antibodies specific for human myoglobin were used to study the interaction of the oligonucleotides with the immunoglobins IgG and IgM. During the experiments, whole human blood serum was incubated with different concentrations of alkylating oligonucleotide derivatives at 37ï¿½ for 10 or 40 minutes. The modified proteins were analyzed by DS-Na-electrophoresis in gradient polyacrylamide gel in a Laemmli system. The experiments demonstrated that incubation of whole human blood serum with different concentrations of the alkylating derivative p(T)[.sup]16[/] results in affine modification of several proteins, including albumin and the immunoglobins M and G. The dependence of the degree of modification of these three proteins on oligonucleotide concentration was taken as evidence that the oligonucleotides have a higher affinity to IgM than to IgG and albumin. Binding of the reactive oligomer derivatives with the proteins was inhibited in the presence of various polyanions, i.e., oligomers of another composition, double-strand DNA, and heparin. The fact that heparin had the greatest inhibiting effect for the immunoglobins led to speculation regarding relatively nonspecific ionic interaction in the formation of the complex IgG-oligonucleotide. Reaction of the oligonucleotide with monoclonal antibodies of the subclass G1 was inhibited in the presence of a specific antigen. This finding was taken as an indication that the oligonucleotides may react with the immunoglobins either at or near the site where the antigen is recognized by the antibody. The experiments performed thus established that oligonucleotides bind with basic blood proteins with a rather high affinity and revealed interacting features of the reaction of immunoglobins with oligonucleotides that may be used to study the effector functions of these molecules.
