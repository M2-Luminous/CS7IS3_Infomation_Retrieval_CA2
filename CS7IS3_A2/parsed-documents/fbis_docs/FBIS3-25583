Guy] [Text] Johannesburg Feb 23 SAPA -- African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela told visiting Organisation of African Unity [OAU] Secretary-General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim on Wednesday [23 February] not to underestimate the threat the right-wing posed to the election process. Speaking at a joint press conference, Mr Mandela told reporters their meeting had been short because he had a "very important" appointment in Pretoria at 10.30 AM. He would not divulge further details. Referring again to his meeting with the OAU chief, Mr Mandela said he had stressed to him that dialogue was the ANC's most important weapon in dealing with the right-wing. Dr Salim said the OAU would enhance its team that will observe the April elections. Mr Mandela said: "If there's one organisation that has fully supported our struggle, it's the OAU."
