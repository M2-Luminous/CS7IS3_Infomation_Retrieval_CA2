France is the third country he visited as part of a tour of Europe, which, he said, has been very fruitful and has demonstrated the friendship and affection of the people of France for the Caribbean island. This has materialized in the sending of donations, he continued. In statements to Radio Rebelde, Alarcon said his meeting in Paris with (Robert Hue), new secretary general of the French Communist Party, was very friendly. Alarcon said (Hue) reiterated his party's support for Cuba and vowed to maintain the solidarity movement toward the Caribbean nation. Upon assessing his tour, which also included Germany and Belgium, the president of Cuba's legislative body added that there is a great and growing interest in Europe in learning about Cuba's reality. He stressed that the initial amazement over Cuba's survival without assistance from the now defunct Soviet Union and the socialist bloc is over. Alarcon told Radio Rebelde that currently on the continent there is a great deal of interest in learning about the problems of the island, how they are being confronted, and the current development perspectives, because for many people in Europe this is a very unique case. He added that this is a country facing serious economic difficulties, which has continued to preserve firm human values of respecting people and maintaing a feeling of solidarity.
