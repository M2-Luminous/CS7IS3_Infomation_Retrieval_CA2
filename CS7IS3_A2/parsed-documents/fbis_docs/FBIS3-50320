The head of the Romanian delegation, Florin Radulescu-Botica, was elected one of the Assembly's vice-presidents on the first day of the session. Radulescu-Botica speaks in an interview with the daily DREPTATEA about the willingness of the Romanian Parliament members to be active in the Council of Europe. He specifies that Romania is no exception in being applied Directive 488 (for control of the fulfillment of the commitments assumed when it was given the status of Council of Europe full member). It shares this with other newly received members, such as Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the procedure is going to be used also for the countries to be admitted from now on. Radulescu-Botica announced that Mr. Koenig, Council of Europe rapporteur for Romania was going to arrive in Bucharest at the end of March. The Romanian vice president of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly said he hoped that Romania would be able to present positive data on its efforts at all levels, made in order to meet the commitments it made when it entered the European body. During the debates on the situation in former Yugoslavia, Romanian parliamentarians in the Council of Europe Assembly pointed to the difficulties encountered by Romania in order to enforce the embargo imposed to rump Yugoslavia. They opined that the sanctions would not trigger a solution of the crisis in the area. Deputy Dumitru Buzatu showed on that occasion that the figures on Romania's losses in consequence of the enforcement of the embargo are higher than those in the report presented to the Assembly, they amount not to three but to $7,000,000,000. "The sum results from both direct and indirect losses in import-export activities and are based on data on the evolution of the economic relations between Romania and Yugoslavia over 1989-1992," he said. For his part Senator Adrian Paunescu opined that a solution has to be sought for the crisis in Yugoslavia not by enforcing embargoes and restrictions as "this affects nations and not governments." He has underlined that no foreign intervention can lead to a viable solution, adding that "all foreign interventions, irrespective of when and where they are made, have to be understood as civil war."
