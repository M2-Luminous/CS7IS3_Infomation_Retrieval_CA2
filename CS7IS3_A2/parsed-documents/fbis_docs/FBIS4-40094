Filippov and own correspondent Arif Useynov under general headline: "To Whom Does Caspian Shelf Belong? Geydar Aliyev Does Not Agree With Russian Federation Foreign Ministry Note"] [Text] As already reported in the pages of our newspaper, following the USSR's disintegration Azerbaijan, having become a sovereign state, proclaimed the Caspian Sea oil shelf off the republic's shores to be its own property and on this basis announced an international competition to sell oil deposits. This competition was won by British companies, although it was promised that between 10 and 20 percent of this deal would be given to the Russian company "LUKoil." But last week the Russian Foreign Ministry sent the British ambassador in Moscow a note describing as premature the conclusion of an Anglo-Azerbaijani memorandum on cooperation to survey and extract oil and gas in the Caspian Sea's so-called "Azerbaijani sector," because in the opinion of Smolensk Square [Foreign Ministry's location] there is no such thing as sectoral demarcation of the seabed in the Caspian and for that reason questions concerning the practical utilization of this closed basin's natural resources must be resolved jointly by all Caspian states -- Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenia [Turkmenistan]. This note provoked a sharply negative reaction in the British Isles and Baku. British newspapers and the BBC immediately started talking about Russia's "imperial intentions." Official Baku also responded vigorously to the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry note. Our own correspondent reports on this. [Filippov ends] [Useynov report] Baku -- In a conversation with British Ambassador to Baku Thomas Young Heydar Aliyev stated that the note's appearance should be regarded as a minor, insignificant event. "If any state wishes to hold talks about oil extraction in the Caspian by Azerbaijan," he said, "then let it approach Azerbaijan. If this is the Russian Government's intention, why address the note to the British Embassy and not Azerbaijan? What has Britain got to do with it?" The head of state noted that it was with Azerbaijan's agreement that the Russian company "LUKoil" had been included in the consortium of oil-extracting firms headed by British Petroleum. He reported that he had discussed this subject with Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin by telephone 31 May. According to him, the Russian premier knows nothing about the Foreign Ministry message and expressed considerable surprise concerning this. Chernomyrdin noted that he is not raising the question of the Caspian's status and has no intention of doing so, and he requested that this be officially conveyed on his behalf to the participants in the Istanbul talks. Observers believe that the oil question has touched on another, no less important, problem. On what basis do the Caspian states intend to carry out joint utilization of the sea's resources -- not only oil resources, of course? After all, the question of the need to elaborate the Caspian's international status has been raised at international ecological conferences, meetings of Caspian states' representatives on problems of fishing, navigation, and protecting and increasing bioresources, and in all discussions and talks. Without this it is extremely difficult to make the optimal decisions and guarantee the unique water basin's ecological well-being.
