Speakers said at the mass rallies held in Nampo and Wonsan on June 20 and 21 that the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon moves of the Japanese reactionaries have become all the more heinous of late. They expressed towering anger and resentment at the Japanese reactionaries' unjustifiable criminal suppression of Chongnyon, an authoritative organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Koreans in Japan. Noting that there is neither reason nor ground for the Japanese authorities to take Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan as an object of suppression, they stressed that the Japanese authorities should protect and treat preferentially the Koreans in Japan who were forcibly taken to Japan by the Japanese imperialists and forced to hard toil in the past, and their descendants, and Chongnyon, an organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK which is conducting righteous activities to defend the democratic national rights of the Koreans in Japan and to promote friendship with the Japanese people. Saying they could not remain an on-looker to the criminal deeds of the Japanese reactionaries who have become all the more undisguised in their suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and hostile to the DPRK, working hand in glove with the United States and the South Korean puppets, they strongly demanded the Japanese authorities immediately stop the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and severely punish the chief culprits in the recent cases. They warned that the Japanese authorities should know clearly that it is foolish act of throttling themselves to antagonize the DPRK with a clamor for "sanctions" against the DPRK and suppress the Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.
