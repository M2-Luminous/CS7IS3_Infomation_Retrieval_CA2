In this way will the various network systems be integrated, as the authors of this study, Ulrich Kranz and Dr Gurnad Sodhi, explain in an interview with VDI NACHRICHTEN. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Mr. Kranz and Mr. Sodhi, the mobile radio study which your consulting firm has made on behalf of the EU-Commission is concerned with scenarios of mobile communication in Europe by the year 2010. In your analysis, however, you surprisingly often refer to already now available technologies. How does this jibe? Kranz: With adoption of the European GSM Standard, on which both German mobile radio networks D1 and D2 as well as the new E-network are based, there has been initiated an extremely dynamic development. This development has been sort of the starting shot for the future of mobile communication, in which GSM networks will certainly play a significant role. This is because these networks offer not only a large subscriber capacity. They also offer a whole lot of functional advantages such as, for example, International Roaming and thus communication across international borders. Sodhi: A further example is DECT, an already now available technology which seems to have have a quite significant potential for future applications in mobile radio. Fist of all, this Standard is the basis for development of cordless telephones and cordless telecommunication facilities. At the same time, DECT is also an excellent accessing technology which facilitates, for instance, linking subscribers of local networks via radio to other telecommunication networks. In other words, with DECT in place, competition with the local network (Local Loop) could begin sooner or later. This example demonstrates clearly that in the foreseeable future the significance of mobile radio will fundamentally change. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: What will this change lead to? Sodhi: Today when we speak of mobile radio, we mean networks and attendant services which widely differ from those provided by ground networks. As a D-network customer, I can naturally reach a party connected to a conventional network. With a telephone installed at home and another one at the office, and also with a hook-up to a radio mobile system, I now have have three telephone numbers and the caller does not know at which one I can be reached at any given time. This will not be so in the future, because I will have just one personal telephone number... VDI-NACHRICHTEN: ...at which you can be reached regardless where you are located. Kranz: Precisely. The various network infrastructures will be integrated into a "Personal Communication System" (PCS). The connection will be made by an intelligent exchange apparatus which always knows the location of the party called and will steer incoming calls over the appropriate network to that party. As to the question about the changing significance of mobile radio networks, they will operate in a Personal Communication System on practically equal footing with ground networks. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Who will be the providers of such services? Sodhi: In our opinion the service providers, being already active in mobile radio operation, will play an essential role in its expansion. They will put together packages of telecommunication services tailored to the needs of customers in diverse user categories. I repeat: the PCS will not be based on one technology alone but rather will be a hybrid system combining several technologies such as GSM 900, GSM 1800, DECT, and the ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] ground network. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: And does this not also mean that different customers may be receiving different services? Sodhi: Certainly. Whoever wants to be reached only at home or in a certain area thereof will receive a different package of services than someone who requires telecommunication services at the office and during international business trips. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: What functions are taken over by the queuing strategy with regard to setting up guideposts for the PCS scenario you are describing? Kranz: Certainly that of a central station, because development of mass markets for Personal Communication services can succeed only when the constraints have been optimally defined. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: And this means, for instance,... Kranz: ...that viable competitiveness must be made the overriding principle in the development of mobile radio and telecommunication on the whole. This is why, for instance, private network operators should be permitted to install their own lines linking them to radio base stations for use of exchange computers of mobile radio networks. Sodhi: In order to assure an effective competitiveness, it is also necessary that the relation between network operator and service provider be already stipulated in the licensing of mobile radio networks. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Assuming that the queuing strategy constraints are correctly defined and the effects of fair competition become fully realized, how many European users will avail themselves of Personal Communication System services? Kranz: We are starting on the premise that in such a case there will be up to 80 million European PCS users by the year 2010. Certainly, essentially instrumental in attracting such a large number of subscribers will be a network operators' and service providers' rate-setting strategy. In our opinion the PCS will grow on the mass market when the prices for manual mobile telephones and the monthly basic charges have fallen down to 100-150 German marks [DM] and below DM15 respectively. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: When the PCS is now based on already available or soon to be introduced technologies, what comes next? Sodhi: Over the long range we will experience developments in mobile radio comparable to those taking place in ground networks, namely, integration of all services in one universal network and flexible transmission over various different frequency channels of this network, as the user may require. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Thus a sort of ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] for mobile radio? Sodhi: Yes, one could describe it as such. Preliminary work is underway at the European Standardization Institute (ETSI) on establishing a Standard for a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). Meanwhile groups of experts at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are doing similar work directed toward a Future Public Land Mobile Telecommunication System (FPLMTS). These two developments have, in principle, the common goal: a high-performance mobile communication system with a very large subscriber capacity and which in the long run will integrate all other mobile radio services. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: When, in your opinion, will such a marvelous concept of mobile communication become reality? Kranz: We are starting on the premise that a technology based on the UMTS Standard will be introduced at the turn of the millennium. Services with transmission speeds up to 2 Mb/s should be realized during the initial phase. Still higher speeds will be attained later on. VDI-NACHRICHTEN: A multimedia-capable mobile communications system is what this is, then. Sodhi: The UMTS will integrate not only all services but also all forms of telecommunications. And this also includes, of course, image communication. [Boxed material]: Pillars of Mobile Communication At the present time the status of mobile communications is determined by two standards: 1. Global System of Mobile Communication (GSM) Standard, which covers digital mobile radio in almost 60 countries including both German D1 and D2 networks; 2. Digital European Cordless Telephone (DECT) Standard for cordless telephones in Europe. Study for the Green Book The study concerning the future of mobile communication was one of three mobile radio studies made by Eutelis Enterprise Consultants in Ratinger in preparation of the planned "Mobile Communication" Green Book for the European Union. In this Green Book, the draft of which is now being discussed in Brussels and the final version of which is to be ready this year, the EU-Commission will have laid down its concepts of mobile communication development in Europe and begun setting up the necessary guide posts for a queuing strategy.
