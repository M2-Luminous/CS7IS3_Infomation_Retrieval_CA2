Why it is necessary to talk of a "pause" can be judged by the fact that, in March-April alone, the government issued around 500 decrees and directives, of which not one had any direct bearing on economic policy. The edicts on the abolition of export quotas and licenses, on the inclusion of the federal road fund in the budget, and on the operation of virtually all sector funds through the budget can be called unquestionably reformist. True, all this was suggested a year ago, but then the resistance of sector lobbyists could not be overcome. With the inclusion of the majority of funds in the budget the field for corruption is considerably reduced. It is indeed essential, as is envisaged in the edicts, to reduce profits tax and value-added tax by 10-20 percent, but the increase in taxes on individuals and property does not elicit enthusiasm. We have still not restored living standards even to 1990's indicators, and that means that the time to increase citizens' taxes has not yet come. On the contrary, the middle class must be help to get on its feet. It is my conviction that proposals which are being floated to tax interest on savings and to tighten up the regulation of enterprise consumer funds should by no means be supported. The president's desire to reduce the number of tax and customs privileges is undoubtedly correct, although at the same time it would not be a bad idea to determine who granted them and why. Export duties should have been abolished long ago. But the attempt to help unprofitable agriculture by reducing value-added tax to 10 percent is unlikely to bring tangible results. It is far more important economically to force agrarians to battle to cut costs resulting from losses. In talking of the merits of the signed edicts, it is impossible, on the other hand, to overlook their careless professional and juridical elaboration. With a "live" parliament it is an extremely risky business to adopt decisions which come under its jurisdiction. Therefore the question as to whether standard contributions to the social security fund will be reduced from 1 June or whether tax privileges will be given to enterprises with foreign investors remains open. In principle, the aforementioned decisions deserve support, but their legality is open to doubt. The decision on the wholesale introduction of the compulsory universal certification of the opening of accounts, with numerous penalties for deviations from the new rules, cannot be deemed market-oriented and reformist. The authors have evidently forgotten that any enterprise has a balance sheet and accounts books. If any funds do not pass through these records, this is a deception of shareholders and clients. Certification of the opening of accounts will be of very little use in filling the state coffers if people are determined not to pay taxes. The introduction of more stringent penalities for violation of tax legislation and the rules for handling cash receipts is undoubtedly timely. But will yet another administrative offensive on cash transactions help here? The impression arises that, instead of improving the payments system, which itself makes cash transactions simply unprofitable (only purely criminal cash transactions now take place), some people are reviving the old Soviet ideas of separating cash and noncash turnover. I was surprised by the introduction by presidential edict of yet another new procedure for enterprises and organizations to use the money in their accounts. It seems that the document's authors are thinking only of loss-making state enterprises and have forgotten that there are thousands of private firms in Russia who are increasingly annoyed by the expanding bureaucratic state protection. The introduction of transferable securities as a means of reorganizing the debts of enterprises, which was blocked after the president's edict of 19 October 1993, should have been expanded long ago. On the whole the innovations in the payments sphere violate the principle of the Central Bank's independence. In my view, this is unlawful and can lead to no good. No noble purposes can justify the violation of laws, especially if this violation comes from the top. In my view, should it turn out that parliament is for any reason incapable of carrying out normal legislative activity, new elections should be held and the electoral law should be changed; but the Duma should not be turned into a talking shop for deputies. The general impression given by this series of edicts is: several correct measures, several administrative exaggerations, and a few doubts over the legality of some of the decisions. At any rate, it is better than nothing.
