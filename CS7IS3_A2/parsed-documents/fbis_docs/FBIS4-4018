Asked about China's attitude towards such a policy, Li said that while China is a nuclear country, its nuclear weapons take up only a very small portion of the world's total. "China has initiated the proposition of not using nuclear weapons first and not resorting to threats with nuclear weapons," he noted. He pointed out that the Chinese Government always stands for a complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and for the realization of a complete nuclear test ban in such a context. Towards that aim, he said: "the Chinese Government holds that it is of positive significance to reach a pact on a complete nuclear test ban through negotiations." He added that China has stated clearly that it would work towards reaching such a treaty in 1996. "At the moment, China is positively participating in negotiations on a complete nuclear test ban of the Geneva Disarmament Conference," he said.
