FR940919-2-00103 FR940919-2-00046 In addition to initial program training, continuing education opportunities will be made available to employees to enhance current performance or career development. These opportunities may be in the form of self-help instruction packages, videotapes, satellite broadcasts, or non-SSA training or educational opportunities. SSA will ensure that employees are given sufficient time and opportunity to complete the required continuing education. Employee feedback on the value of these continuing education opportunities, including the quality of training materials, methods, and instructors, will be used to continually improve training programs. In addition to formal program training, SSA will rely on a targeted system of in-line quality reviews and monitoring of adjudicative practices for all employees. The elements include a mentoring process for new employees, peer review for experienced employees and management oversight at key points in the adjudicative process. SSA will create mechanisms that facilitate peer discussions of difficult claims or issues. Quality reviewers and policy makers will participate in these types of discussions. Peer reviews and mentoring will not only promote timely and accurate development of disability claims, but will also foster a spirit of teamwork. They will also promote earlier identification and resolution of problems with policy or procedures. Managers will be expected to oversee the adjudication process. They will conduct spot checks at key points in the adjudication process or perform special reviews based on profiles of error-prone claims. The goal of these reviews is to provide immediate, constructive feedback on identified errors to reduce or eliminate their possible recurrence. Payment errors on claims detected during in-line reviews will be corrected before a claimant is notified of the decision. As noted previously, under the Administrative Procedure Act, the ALJ is an independent decisionmaker who must apply an agency's governing statute, regulations and policies, but who is not subject to advance direction and control by the agency with respect to the decisional outcome in any individual claim. Accordingly, a system of peer review, mentoring and management oversight in advance of the ALJ's decisionmaking is inappropriate. However, the ALJ decision may be subject to final agency review. Therefore, as part of the in-line quality assurance process, ALJ decisions (both allowances and denials) and dismissals will be subject to review by the Appeals Council on its own motion prior to effectuation of the ALJ's decision or dismissal. Several key features previously described in this plan are critical to ensuring that adjudicators have the necessary program tools to issue accurate decisions. A single presentation of all substantive policies used in determining eligibility for benefits must be in place. Additionally, an automated and integrated claim processing system will provide the necessary technological support for adjudicators at all levels of the administrative process. Expert systems will be developed to integrate disability policy into the claim processing system. Among other things, the claim processing system will facilitate claims taking, evidence development, and the preparation of accurate notices and decisions by providing on-line editing capacity to identify errors in advance and decision support software to assist in analysis and decisionmaking. The processing system will help to identify errors of both procedure and substance, and also support routine analysis to aid in avoiding future similar errors. An on-line technical review will occur each time information is added to the electronic record. Comprehensive employee education and an in-line review system will build quality into the system of adjudication with the goal of error prevention. SSA must monitor that quality on a systematic, national basis. Accordingly, all employees (including ALJs) will be subject to and receive continuous feedback from comprehensive end-of-line reviews as described in the following section. End-of-Line Reviews A second necessary component of quality assurance is an integrated system of national postadjudicative monitoring to ensure the integrity of the administrative process and to promote national uniformity in the adjudication of disability claims at all levels of the process. This system of quality measurement will include comprehensive reviews of the whole adjudicatory process. At a minimum, a comprehensive end-of-line quality measurement system must: be statistically valid; review both allowances and denials in equal proportion; review the entire disability claim process, both the medical and nonmedical aspects; and review claims decided at all levels of the adjudicatory process. These end-of-line reviews will focus on whether correct decisions were made at the earliest possible point in the process. This type of review will not be aimed at correcting errors in individual claims but, rather, will be the means to oversee, monitor and provide feedback on the application of Agency policies at all levels of decisionmaking. However, erroneous decisions detected during end-of-line reviews will be subject to existing reopening regulations. Reliance on an integrated claim processing system will facilitate the selection of a statistically valid sample of claims at all levels of the process for this review. An integrated claim processing system will permit the selection of other postadjudicative samples of claims as SSA deems necessary to effectively test new operational procedures or monitor specific procedures in the administrative process; oversee the implementation of new program policy regulations and initiatives; and monitor both internal and external claims development practices to prevent fraud. SSA will use the results from these end-of-line reviews to identify areas for improvement in policies, processes or employee education and training. SSA will also use the results to profile error-prone claims with the goal of preventing errors at the front end. Customer Satisfaction Surveys A final component of quality assurance is measuring customer satisfaction. To measure whether SSA has met or exceeded the public's service expectations, SSA must measure the public's level of satisfaction with the level of service SSA provides. Customer surveys (including feedback cards) and periodic focus groups will be the most frequently used methods of determining the public's views on the quality of SSA service. SSA will also survey representatives and third parties who provide assistance or act on claimants' behalf in dealing with SSA. Survey results will be communicated to staff on a timely basis, both as Agency feedback and individual feedback, along with any plans to address identified problems.
