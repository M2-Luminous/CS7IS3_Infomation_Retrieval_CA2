Briefing newsmen in Islamabad today, a Foreign Office spokesman recalled that Pakistan had given two non-papers to India on the 18th of January for a peaceful solution of Jammu and Kashmir issue and other problems. He said it appears from reply to these papers that India is going back from a meaningful and purposeful discussion on the Jammu and Kashmir issue as agreed upon between the two countries. The spokesman said the Indian reply appears to be a propaganda exercise camouflaged in diplomatic language and the Indians have merely reiterated their old inflexible position on Jammu and Kashmir.
