ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed project in Benton, Hickory, and Dallas Counties in Missouri. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Donald Neumann, Federal Highway Administration, P.O. Box 1787, Jefferson City, MO 65102, Telephone Number 314&hyph;636&hyph;7104; or Mr. Bob Sfreddo, Design Engineer, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, P.O. Box 270, Jefferson City, MO 65102, Telephone Number 314&hyph;751&hyph;2876. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to build a four lane relocation of U.S. Route 65 in Benton, Hickory, and Dallas Counties in Missouri. The improved highway would have a positive economic and social impact on the Lake of the Ozarks region by providing traffic relief, increased mobility, and enhanced social economic opportunities. 1. The proposed highway project begins in Benton County near the Route MM Junction at Warsaw, and proceeds southward through Hickory and Dallas Counties. It ends 1.0 miles north of Route EE near Buffalo, Missouri. The total project distance is 47.9 miles. The proposal will provide partial relocation of U.S. Route 65 through the Lake of the Ozarks and Pomme de Terre Lake region. The proposed project will involve grading, paving, and bridges for a four-lane relocation with freeway right of way for the entire length of the project. Interchanges will be provided at or near major arterial crossroads. 2. Alternatives currently under consideration include ``build'' alternatives, the ``no build'' alternative, mass transportation alternatives, and upgrading of existing facilities. 3. To date, preliminary information has been furnished to local officials, legislators, and other interested parties. Presentation of the concept has been made at the local level and input received. The scoping process has been initiated with Federal, State, and local agencies. Further public hearings also will be held. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments and questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department at the addresses provided above. Issued on April 18, 1994. Donald Neumann, Program Engineer, Jefferson City. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11813 Filed 5&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M
