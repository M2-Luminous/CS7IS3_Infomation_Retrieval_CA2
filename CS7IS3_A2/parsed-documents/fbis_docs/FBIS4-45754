Prices should reflect the detrimental effects of production processes, products, and services on the environment, while investment in environment-friendly "green" businesses must be promoted, the Environment Agency's paper suggests. For a successful turnaround of the economic system both, producers and consumers have to be involved, it said. Consumers must be educated about an ecological lifestyle that breaks with the entrenched habits of unrestrained consumerism. The corporate world, too, must be made aware of the business opportunities environment technology and eco-oriented industries offer as environmental awareness heightens, the paper said. Despite technological progress that has helped to curb machine energy consumption, each Japanese consumes more than double the world average in primary energy. This is due to large-scale consumption and the never-ending quest for a higher and "bigger" living standard, according to the paper. Consumers could play an important role in the ecological transformation by making choices and buying green products, which would eventually force producers to develop more environment-friendly products. The paper does not trust the market forces alone and recommends introducing taxes that take into account environmental costs and to impose charges on ecologically harmful products and activities to foster the ecological transformation. An environmental tax such as a levy on carbon dioxide emissions was under discussion last year, but the basic environment law, adopted last November, simply urges the government to consider imposing a tax on polluters. The white paper also advocates further expanding deposit systems for bottles and other reusable containers. It claims that industrial production could be even extended in the latter part of the 21st century without further destroying the environment, if investment over the next 50 years focuses on antipollution measures and the saving of scarce resources. Sewage facilities and other investments in environmental protection would also pay off by stimulating the slumping economy, the paper says. For an effective ecological overhaul of the economic system, which should be laid out in the nation's basic environment program currently being worked out, the government should consult with industry, civic groups and municipal bodies, the paper suggests.
