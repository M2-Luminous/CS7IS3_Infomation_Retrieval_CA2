The Institute for Technology and Environmental Protection of the EGA (Development Company Adlersdorf mbH) in Berlin is currently testing an alternative method, which was recently displayed at the Hannover Fair. In the new method, the heavy metals and harmful organic substances are removed from the soils and muds electrokinetically. In the process, an electrical field, which induces a fine water flow in the soil capillaries, is generated by means of two electrodes. Since the harmful substances dissolved in the ground water are encased in a water envelope (hydrate shell), they are--owing to the viscosity of the water filaments--moved along with the flow until they reach, depending on their electrical charge, either the cathode of the anode. Heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and mercury, but also the harmful organic substances as well, together with their water envelopes gather at the poles, where they are then pumped off. The EGA researchers see particular advantages in the new process in that it can be used to cleanse the ground soils beneath developed areas as well. Researchers at the Laboratory for Chemical Engineering in Geneva (EIG) are developing a similar technique. There, the mercury-containing sewage is caused to flow through an electrochemical cell, where the positively charged mercury ions gather at the cathode. The mercury is subsequently removed from the cathode by heating in an evaporator with an internal condenser, where the metal is recovered. The cathode can be used repeatedly. Using this method, even small businesses can process mercury-containing sewage economically and at little cost to the point where the mercury residual concentration is five ppb.
