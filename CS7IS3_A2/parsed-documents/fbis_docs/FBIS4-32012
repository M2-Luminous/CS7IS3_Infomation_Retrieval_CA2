That part of transition representing adaptation to new conditions on a microeconomic level is more difficult and longer-term, she says, and involves mainly the entrepreneurial sector, but also requires consumers and employees to change. The minister notes that the Slovak economy continues to have certain basic advantages over that of Poland or Hungary, though it does have its difficulties. The basis for further development of the economy which the current Moravcik cabinet has promised to lay down is inspiring a trust in the government's economic policies -- something that will give the country access to lower cost credit, Schmognerova told the paper. During talks with the International Monetary Fund on the provision of a stand-by loan, for example, the government strived to specify goals and instruments that correspond to Slovak conditions, and are realistic and realisable, says the minister. "The opposition is trying to make the International Monetary Fund out to be a bogeyman," PRAVDA quotes Schmognerova responding to accusations that the government is being too accommodating towards the international organisation. Instead, sticking to those goals will ensure Slovakia's ability to repay its loans, showing that the government's economic policy is reliable, not just in the eyes of the IMF but more generally.
