FR940927-1-00029 FR940927-1-00010 Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are Mr. John McDonald, First Coast Guard District Bridge Branch, Project Manager and Lieutenant Commander F.J. Kenney, First Coast Guard District Legal Office, Project Counsel. Background and Purpose Requests have been received proposing a change to the present operating regulations in 33 CFR 117.621 which state that the Quincy Weymouth Bridge need not be opened from 6:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. However, commercial vessels are exempt from the two vehicular rush hour closed periods in the existing regulations and can have the bridge opened on signal at any time. Traffic delays result whenever the draws open during the morning and evening rush hours. This proposed rule will change the wording to allow only tide dependent self-propelled vessels greater than 10,000 gross tons to obtain a bridge opening during the two rush hour closed periods. By further limiting the number of rush hour openings, this change to the regulations should provide relief from the traffic delays created when the draws are opened during the two closed periods while still meeting the needs of navigation. Discussion of Proposed Amendments The Quincy Weymouth Bridge over the Fore River between Quincy and Weymouth has a vertical clearance of 33 ’ above mean high water (MHW) and 43 ’ above mean low water (MLW). The channel depth is 35 ’ at mean low water. The pilots of the vessels greater than 10,000 gross tons must transit through the bridge at or near the high tide for safety reasons. The Fore River channel width, turns, cross currents and the width of the bridge present a safety risk to the larger vessels. transiting at high tide with a favorable current reduces the risk of allisions and groundings. The current regulations for the Quincy Weymouth Bridge are that the draws need not be opened from 6:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday except holidays observed in the locality. Traffic delays during the rush hours were frequent due to the commercial barge and tug traffic requesting bridge openings. The Coast Guard held several meetings with local officials, CITGO Petroleum Corporation, and marine interests to discuss safety issues, economic impacts and possible solutions to the vehicular traffic problems in the Quincy Weymouth area. A voluntary agreement resulted that allowed only tide dependent, self-propelled vessels greater than 10,000 gross tons to obtain bridge openings at any time including the rush hour periods. This voluntary action has been successful in alleviating traffic delays resulting from bridge openings during the rush hours. The Coast Guard proposes to change the regulations to make permanent the voluntary agreement, and will specifically state that only self-propelled vessels greater than 10,000 gross tons may pass through the bridge during rush hours. The existing rush hour time periods 6:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. stated in the existing regulations will be retained. The provision in the existing regulations for the passage of public vessels of the United States, state or municipal government vessels through the draw at any time is now published at 33 CFR 117.31 as a requirement for all bridges in the United States. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of executive order 12866, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. If has been exempted from review by the office of management and budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation, under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT, is unnecessary. This conclusion is based on the fact that the regulation will not prevent the mariners from passing through the Quincy Weymouth Bridge but just require mariners to plan their transits around the two closed periods and the high tide.
