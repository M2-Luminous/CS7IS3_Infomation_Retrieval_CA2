Shrill whistles and choruses ("Nazis out" and "Piss off!") prevented the anti-Europe speeches of the two politicians on Muensterplatz in Bonn. There were no excesses. A hail of eggs and tomatoes rained on the rostrum (and on the journalists) from time to time. Policemen protected the speakers with shields. Banners saying "We do not want a second H. from Austria" or "One Austrian was enough" were shown to the election campaigners. At a news conference afterward, Haider said this was "a sign of xenophobia." Only a few fragments of the speeches came out of the loudspeakers. Brunner: "If there is not a European people, there cannot be a European Parliament either." Haider warned against Jacques Delors and the goal of a "socialist central state of Europe." Anyone who does not vote for Brunner's Ticket 13 at the European election on 12 June will initiate "the end of democracy in Germany." After 25 minutes of a turbulent rally, Haider and Brunner were led to a police bus. When they spoke to journalists a little later, Brunner and Haider agreed: It was a "very important event," the "highlight of a power struggle of the German left." Haider announced that, after his return, he will "ask the Austrians during the final stage before the European elections and in view of these pictures from Germany: `Do you want to have that in Austria?'" Brunner then said: "It would be good for the European Union if Austria gave it a shock." In addition, he regretted that Bonn "abolished Article 23 (article on accession) in advance obedience." Not that Germany should become active by itself, he stated seriously and with Haider's approval: "But why have the neighboring countries been deprived of the opportunity to apply for acceding?"
