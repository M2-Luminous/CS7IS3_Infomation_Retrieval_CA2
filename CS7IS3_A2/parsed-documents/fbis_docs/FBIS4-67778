Podrazhanets, who recently assumed the post, believes that it will be very difficult to raise the level of commercial trade between the two countries, currently ranging between $300 million and $400 million, the Sao Paulo daily GAZETA MERCANTIL reported in its 31 March-4 April issue. The reasons were cited as threefold: political instability in Russia, which keeps Brazilian investors away; shipping costs, which are higher than in the trade between Brazil and the United States; and a deficiency in providing sufficient stimulus to the space sector. Russia, GAZETA continued, is determined to cooperate with Brazil in creating an infrastructure by supplying technology and equipment for the satellite launch vehicle project. Russia also wants to participate in the Amazon protection and surveillance project, but it lacks the resources to finance equipment sales. The protocol of intent, signed between Brazil and Russia in December 1993 and intended to increase bilateral trade to $2 billion annually, has not yet ``gotten off the ground,'' according to Ambassador Podrazhanets, due to difficulties in finding the mechanisms necessary to implement the project, particularly resources. ``It's difficult to find the right products for that type of trade,'' he said. In May or June, Podrazhanets continued, the Russian minister of atomic energy will visit Brazil, and in the ensuing months, a joint economic and commercial commission meeting will be held, during which Russia will discuss its interest in increasing cooperation in the areas of space, energy, and mining. Cuba Signs S&T Accords With State Governments An article in the Sao Paulo daily O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 22 March announced that the Cuban and Sao Paulo State Governments will begin an S&T exchange program in April that will bring a number of Cuban specialists to Sao Paulo state universities. In the article, Secretary Roberto Muller of the Secretariat of Science, Technology, and Economic Development remarked: ``We are particularly interested in the transfer of Cuban technology for the development of research in DNA and genetic engineering for plants.'' The exchange program is a result of discussions held on 18 March between visiting Cuban Minister of Higher Education Fernando Vecino Alegret and Secretary Muller, University of Campinas (Unicamp) Rector Carlos Vogt, and Sao Paulo State University (Unesp) Rector Arthur Roquete de Macedo. Secretary Muller further commented that the Sao Paulo state government is also interested in the use of sugarcane waste to generate thermal energy, as well as the mastery of techniques to increase the shelf life of cement. The agreement signed with Cuba was modeled along the lines of the accord signed with the Russian Government, O ESTADO continued. According to Muller, the secretariat is already studying the possibility of bringing in additional researchers, and will shortly be meeting with university rectors to review the situation. Consortiums Plan Telecommunications Satellites Launch Sao Paulo daily FOLHA DE SAO PAULO reported on 25 March that Brazilian Discount Bank (Bradesco), Odebrecht construction firm, Monteiro Aranha, Victori Internacional, and Globopar, owned by businessman Roberto Marinho, formed an association with the French Matra Marconi Space firm, and established an enterprise called Latin American Satellite Systems Communications (CLASS) for the purpose of launching three privately owned satellites to serve Brazil and neighboring Southern Cone countries. A second consortium, formed by the Itamaraty Group owned by businessman Olacyr de Morais, Splice do Brasil, and the German firm Deutsche Aerospace will compete for the same market acting as an associate and commercial representative of the Argentine Nahuel satellite. The two consortiums, according to FOLHA, want to compete with the Brazilian Telecommunications Company (Embratel) in data transmission and offer options for new services, particularly in the area of cable television. Both the Nahuel satellite and the three satellites of the CLASS project will operate on the KU band, which is higher than the frequencies of Brasilsat's C band, and will allow TV signals to be picked up by 6O-cm parabolic antennas that can even be installed on apartment verandas. The CLASS project, which will involve investments of $300 million, was announced on 24 March during the Fourth International Telecommunications and Teleinformatics Congress (Telexpo) in Sao Paulo. Victori International Vice President Joao Santelli Junior told FOLHA that the project is only now being made public but has been in planning since 1992. In November 1993, the consortium asked the Ministry of Communications for three orbital positions. On 22 December, former Telecommunications Minister Hugo Napoleao petitioned the UN International Telecommunications Union (UIT) to authorize the orbital space positions, but the UIT has not yet published its decision. If the request is granted, the CLASS project and the Nahuel consortium will still need authorization from the Ministry of Communications. According to Olacyr de Morais of the Itamaraty Group, the telecommunications market has great potential and several competitors are vying for it. FOLHA reported that that consortium has more ambitious plans than simply shareholder participation in the Argentine Nahuel satellite and intends to launch its own satellite. Brazilian Communications Minister Djalma Morais remarked that Embratel and the state telephone companies are interested in participating as shareholders in the CLASS project; there may be criticisms from within Embratel ranks, however, of any attempt to launch private satellites. Some Embratel representatives believe that the operation of satellites is part of the state telecommunications monopoly. Communications Minister Morais, however, is of the opinion that the satellites will only provide limited services and therefore will not effect the state's monopoly. Victori International Vice President Joao Santelli Junior also told FOLHA that the CLASS project intends to launch the first satellite in 1996 and the second in 1997. He said that the KU band satellites will also make it possible to install telephone terminals at an average cost of $3,000 each in remote areas. The current installation cost in remote areas of Brazil is as much as $100,000 per terminal. CNEN, SCIENTISTS FAVOR QUADRIPARTITE SAFEGUARDS ACCORD--Prior to the 9 February Brazilian Senate's approval of the quadripartite nuclear safeguards agreement (QSA) between Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), President Marcio Costa and various scientists commented favorably on the agreement's impending Senate ratification in Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 8 February. O ESTADO began by quoting a press statement made in Rio on 7 February by CNEN President Marcio Costa supporting the Senate's ratification of the QSA which will authorize international inspections of Brazilian nuclear installations. Although he opined that Brazil will lose sovereignty in the nuclear area, the CNEN head said that he was in favor of its ratification in order to avoid retaliations by First World countries. Costa criticized Germany, which had earlier threatened to break the 1975 Brazil-FRG nuclear accord, suspend the transfer of technology, and withdraw support for Brazil obtaining a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. ``They pulled off the worst swindle in the country with that technology transfer story.'' O ESTADO then went on to quote Ennio Candotti, former president and member of the council of the Brazilian Society for the Progress of Science (SBPC), as saying that Brazil should ratify the quadripartite accord and the Treaty of Tlatelolco. ``But it is important,'' he added, ``to extend those agreements to the countries that today hold arsenals of nuclear arms such as the United States, France, Britain, and Germany itself.'' Candotti then commented on Germany's threats: ``I didn't even know that a nuclear accord with Germany was still in effect, so numerous have been the mistakes earmarking the 1975 treaty that provided for the construction of eight power plants.'' Furthermore, he added, ``a seat on the UN Security Council is not acquired through bartering agreements and disagreements.'' Professor Giorgio Moscati, head of the Physics Institute's Experimental Physics Department of the University of Sao Paulo (USP), believes that Brazil should ratify the accords, O ESTADO continued. ``There is no reason for the country not to open up for a peaceful program and open itself up to international inspections,'' he remarked. Then Brazil will, in return, be able to demand that it cease being discriminated against in imports of products that may have a military application, he added. O ESTADO then noted that Professor Ivan Cunha Nascimento, head of the USP Applied Physics Department, is of the same opinion. ``The accord should be ratified, simply because Brazil is discriminated against internationally and consequently does not have access to state of the art technology that may have a military application.'' He further explained that ``Brazil is considered a `sensitive' country abroad for having a nuclear program that is neither known nor inspected.''
