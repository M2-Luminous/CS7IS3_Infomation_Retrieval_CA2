That is the familiar chorus of the litany of many political parties, and over the next few months the population will continue to be confronted with it. After all, the European election campaign will soon be starting, and a not inconsiderable number of candidates will declare their great belief in the European idea. Their words will meet with great skepticism, not least because of Europe's dramatic failure in the former Yugoslavia. Exactly how great and total the debacle really is, was once again illustrated all too clearly yesterday in the European Parliament [EP] in Strasbourg. European Commissioner Hans Van den Broek called for the curtailment of European attempts at negotiating peace, claiming that after all they lead nowhere and invariably end in failure. Despite the many conferences that have been held, the prospect of peace is further away than ever. And whenever agreements were reached in the past, they were not respected. The warring factions in Bosnia are continuing to give priority to their armed struggle and Europe is powerless to convince them to do otherwise. The European Union lacks the military might, a coherent concept, and, above all, the single-mindedness to do so. It is no coincidence that Van den Broek should specifically choose the Greek presidency to propose that Europe wash its hands in innocence, echoing the legendary cowardice of Pontius Pilate. After all, the Greeks are allies of the Serbs, and will do nothing that ruffles the feathers of Milosevic & Co. Under these circumstances, it can virtually be ruled out that the Union will succeed in acting firmly or coherently. After nearly three years of war, an exhausted Europe has had enough of the misery in Bosnia. Yesterday, an isolationist appeal was made by EC Commissioner Van den Broek, but there were also the decisions by the Netherlands and Germany to send thousands of Croatian refugees back home. The question remains, however, as to what the consequences will be of any further spreading of the fighting and ethnic cleansing. Bosnia is not the only powder keg in the Balkans. There is also Kosovo, and Macedonia. If their fuse is ignited, then the fire could spread right through the Balkans, and the European Union would have no alternative but to fear the collapse of that entire flank of the continent. The belief that the Union can isolate itself from the rest of Europe is a dangerous misconception, and a foolish illusion.
