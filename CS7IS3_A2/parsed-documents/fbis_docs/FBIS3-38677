NATO and the EU had managed to make relations between the member states peaceful in the long-term, Scharping said at the conference on security policy today in Munich. The SPD leader conceded that sections of his party had not always seen it like this in the past. Scharping spoke in favor of integrating all East European countries into a European security system. But there would possibly be varying degrees and speeds of East European integration, he said. It was, however, important to retain "a clear perspective," he stressed. In this context the transcript of Scharping's speech included a proposal for forming joint military units with East European states. Thus, a German-Polish or German-Czech corps would be feasible. The SPD was ready to relinquish national sovereignty in favor of European integration, Scharping added. Automatic obligations must not, however, arise with respect to the United Nations. Until now the German Government has reserved the right to take part in UN measures. This would also remain a "basic conviction of German foreign policy" in the event of an SPD-governed German Government. In any case, events in Somalia had "not increased acceptance of UN obligations"; rather the opposite, Scharping added. While the SPD also pursued the goal of a permanent UN Security Council seat for Germany, he did not attach any "special priority" to this over other tasks. Scharping issued a strong warning against Germany going it alone in Europe. Those who thought aloud about Germany withdrawing from the European Union -- even only in the sense of a legal possibility -- signaled an attempt to abandon European integration. Without mentioning names, Scharping was thus alluding to remarks by Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber (CSU) [Christian Social Union, who criticized the Maastricht Treaty as too centralized]. At the same time Scharping stressed that there were "no really serious differences" with the present German Government as regards foreign and security policy.
