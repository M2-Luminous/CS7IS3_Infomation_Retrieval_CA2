The survey said 24.8 percent of those polled said they buy imports more frequently than before, up 10.2 percentage points from the previous survey taken in May. Asked whether the yen's rise has helped cut the prices of imports, 65.4 percent answered yes, against 43.9 percent in the May poll. People who answered they see no price changes despite the stronger yen accounted for only 18.8 percent of respondents, sharply down from 35.8 percent, a finding indicating that importers have been passing on the high-yen benefits to consumers. The poll was conducted in mid-December on 4,200 people nationwide, of which 92.3 percent responded. More than half -- 57.9 percent -- also wanted to see price cuts on everyday goods rather than luxury goods.
