Speaking at the end of a coordinated meeting for politics and security affairs in Jakarta yesterday, Alatas said Indonesia is only implementing several resolutions adopted at international forums. He also cited a comprehensive plan by the International Conference on Indochinese Refugees, ICIR, on the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees to their country of origin. Only about 8,000 Vietnamese refugees currently held at Galang Island want to seek political asylum in a third country, while the majority who left for economic reasons must return to Vietnam. Alatas also said that the ICIR places special emphasis on screening Vietnamese refugees who really want to be resettled in a third country.
