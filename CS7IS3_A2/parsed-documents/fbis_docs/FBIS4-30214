FBIS4-30214 "dreas122_a_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Kubo: SDPJ, Coalition Fail To Reach Accord Kubo: SDPJ, Coalition Fail To Reach Accord OW2406093494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0925 GMT 24 Jun 94 OW2406093494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party (SDP) cannot come to agree with the ruling coalition on key policies that would bring the party back to the coalition fold, SDP [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] General Secretary Wataru Kubo said Friday [24 June]. Kubo told reporters the SDP handed down its position in a second round of meetings with coalition parties held Friday evening. Kubo said the SDP and the coalition parties were unable to reach agreement on tax reform despite detailed discussions, with the ruling coalition calling for a consumption tax hike while the SDP is opposed to such a move. Although it is not impossible to find ways to reach an agreement on tax reform, kubo said it is difficult considering the time limit under the current political situation. The SDP and the ruling coalition parties also remained at odds over the resignation of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and the formation of a new government, he said. "We heard that the leaders of the ruling coalition parties agreed earlier in the day that the cabinet's resignation is unnecessary," Kubo said. "We consider that to mean that they cannot accept SDP demands" for the cabinet to resign en masse and to then form a new coalition government, he said. Kubo said it is "truly regrettable" but the SDP has reached a conclusion that it cannot agree with the ruling parties on policies that are crucial for the SDP's return to the government. He said, however, that the SDP and the coalition parties will hold talks again later in the day, after the coalition side meets to discuss the SDP's stance. "But our stance is final," Kubo said. Asked whether the SDP will support a no-confidence motion against the Hata government, which was submitted Thursday by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kubo said the party is undecided. Hata indicated Thursday that he is ready to resign with his ministers if it is necessary to bring the second largest opposition SDP back to the coalition. The SDP left the coalition in April. Hata told a news conference he will leave everything, including his resignation, to the negotiations between the coalition parties and the SDP. Hata also met SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama Thursday night in an unsuccessful attempt to tide over the political crisis. The two-month old minority coalition and the SDP held two rounds of negotiations Friday in the morning and in the evening. Meanwhile, LDP President Yohei Kono vowed to pass the no- confidence motion against Hata's government and bring his party back to power. The LDP lost its nearly four-decades-long grip on power last August. At a general meeting of parliamentarians from both houses of the Diet, Kono blasted the coalition, saying it has lost international respect for its "irresponsibleness." He said the coalition government has not implemented any policies and leaves everything to the bureaucrats.
