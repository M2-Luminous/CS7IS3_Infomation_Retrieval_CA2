Large groups of professional workers, recent graduates, and government employees whose resignations have been purchased have been added to the problem. According to the CEPAR [expansion not given], the labor supply in the country is growing at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent. The working age population has increased at a percentage higher than that of population growth. As a result, it has been predicted that the young economically active population (EAP) will increase by 26 percent, while the feminine EAP will increase by 31 percent. This situation is of concern to analysts. According to the most recent report of the CEPLAES [expansion not given], the rate of employment declined 9.1 percent in 1993. The financial difficulties being experienced by businesses and the uncertainty they are feeling have aggravated the effects of the reduced labor demand. The public and private productive sectors are seeking to invest, and thus to provide more stable jobs. The result of this process is an increase in unemployment, to which is added the decline in the purchasing power of the wage earners. Alberto Acosta warns in an article in the periodical CORREO POBLACIONAL of the lack of planning of a political and industrial nature that would lead to the creation of jobs. "It is hoped that the market, on its own, will generate businesses and jobs, but there is no structural policy oriented toward this goal." He notes that the lack of reliable information on the employment factor is an indication that those responsible for economic management regard it as a second-category variable. And on the basic level, there is further symptomatic lack of concern about the errors being committed in the training of professional workers. The result has been serious difficulty in securing job placements. On the basis of these predictions and the current economic determinations, it is estimated that it will be necessary to absorb an additional labor supply of 981,000 workers in the cities and 257,000 in the rural sector in the next 10 years if the rates of open unemployment (14.7 percent) and underemployment (55 percent) are to be prevented from increasing. These figures show that 124,000 jobs, 79 percent of them in the cities, will have to be created every year. The International Labor Organization recommends that the increases in social allocations and consumption subsidies be reduced, while investments in human capital and training must be increased. This organization also regards the establishment of subsidies to improve nutrition and preventive medical care as necessary. According to the International Labor Organization, the trend toward increased unemployment rates, even in the industrialized countries, is alarming because of the magnitude of the risk it entails. In fact, this factor leads to many consequences, including the erosion of national income and the citizens' standard of living, thus aggravating the problems of promoting development and alleviating poverty. Unemployment also increases the public-budget deficit and macroeconomic instability, and it absorbs resources that could otherwise be allocated for the purchase of productive equipment, education, training, and the provision of aid services to the most neglected sectors. Many are of the opinion that the state is no longer the main force in the battle against unemployment, poverty, and underdevelopment, but rather the basic cause of these problems because of the distorting effect of its interventions on the market. However, the philosophy oriented toward the market economy that gained ground in the decade of the 1980's still has not, in practice, produced convincing solutions, at least on a large scale. This is evidenced by the job deficit accompanying the current economic recovery.
