Judging by a careful analysis by Senator Alberto Lizardi, former president of the Federation of Venezuelan Public Accountant Associations [Federacion de Colegios de Contadores Publicos de Venezuela] and president of the Iberoamerican Confederation of Public Accountants, 66 percent of the country's commercial banks are facing serious financial and economic problems. It is a situation that, in his opinion, merits an exhaustive government study by Congress, depositors, and even the General Bank Superintendency, which, in his opinion, is overlooking its real duties. "The General Bank Superintendency has become a conceptual organization that does not supervise, make recommendations, or intervene in any institution until it collapses." Lizardi has said the 251 billion bolivares of unproductive assets are costing the financial sector 150 billion bolivares, and they have become a decisive factor in preventing commercial banks from providing benefits. After reading a bulletin issued by the General Bank Superintendency in September 1993, I am convinced, Lizardi has said, neither the government, state, General Bank Superintendency nor Central Bank of Venezuela are aware of the scope of the crisis, because a parallel banking system is in operation and the Venezuelan authorities are looking the other way. This parallel system has between 500 and 800 billion bolivares at its receiving offices [mesas de dinero], and no one knows where those resources from the general public, industrial organizations, merchants and small depositors are invested. The bank superintendent confirmed this fact when he said he will begin to receive information on this in May. Lizardi has said it is incredible banks do not publish their consolidated balances and the financial statements that reflect the operations of their main headquarters and branches, thereby keeping the public abreast of the operations conducted by the entire economic group and its real situation, including its offices abroad. In the specific case of receiving office operations, Lizardi says a failure to enter such operations as well as "offshore" [previous word in English] deals has led to the evasion of income taxes on an interest differential of approximately six points for funds invested and funds received. Invested funds amounted to 68.83 percent and received funds to 62.31 percent on 31 December 1993. According to the Lizardi report, the state loses approximately 6.492 billion bolivares in income taxes yearly. It lost this much from receiving office operations last year alone." [no opening quotation mark as published] Asked about the emergency law undergoing debate in Congress, Lizardi has said even though it is an important tool it will not resolve the crisis of the financial sector, which can only be resolved by applying true regulatory mechanisms. "We must begin regulating banks; there must be an effective superintendency, and independent bank auditors must be replaced every two (?years) [periodos], not every 14 as in the Banco Latino case. Regulations such as these were implemented in the United States when several savings and loan institutions collectively went bankrupt; it is a means of conducting a purge." Lizardi takes a positive view of a joint effort in which the executive and legislative branches, General Bank Superintendency and all the sectors involved will work together to achieve permanent and not temporary solutions.
