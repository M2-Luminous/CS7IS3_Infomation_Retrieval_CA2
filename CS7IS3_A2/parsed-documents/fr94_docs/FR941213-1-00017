FR941213-1-00017 FR941213-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MT22&hyph;1&hyph;6399b, MT9&hyph;3&hyph;6561b, & MT13&hyph;2&hyph;6560b; FRL&hyph;5118&hyph;4] Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plan for Montana; Missoula; PM 10 and CO Contingency Measures and Local Regulations; Disapproval of Missoula Variance Provision AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Montana with a letter dated March 2, 1994. This submittal addresses the Federal Clean Air Act requirement to submit contingency measures for both particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ) and for carbon monoxide (CO) for the areas in Missoula designated as nonattainment for the PM 10 and CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Further, this submittal satisfies several commitments made by the State in a previous PM 10 SIP submittal. Due to the completion of those commitments, EPA is proposing to approve the related rules of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences on June 28, 1991 and amended on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor in letters dated August 20, 1991, June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994. These rules include regulations regarding inspections, emergency procedures, minor source construction permits, open burning, and wood waste burners. EPA also proposes to approve minor revisions to previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program Chapters VII and VIII, as included in the March 2, 1994 submittal. Further, EPA declines to take action on Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations. Finally, EPA proposes to disapprove Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter X, Variances. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is acting on the State's SIP revisions as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for EPA's actions is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by January 12, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Amy Platt, 8ART-AP, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the State's submittal and documents relevant to this proposed rule are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405; and Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Air Quality Bureau, Cogswell Building, Helena, Montana 59620&hyph;0901.
