FR940119-1-00034 FR940119-1-00011 It is clear from the RSPA's analysis of information and data obtained in conducting the March 1991 EFRD study, that spillage from a pipeline failure can be significantly reduced by RCVs only where a modern SCADA system is equipped with a well-designed leak detection subsystem. The type and sophistication of the control system, installed as part of an existing SCADA system, depends on the age of the control system. The March 1991 EFRD study contained a number of proposals to address the issue of EFRDs. One of the proposals was that the Department conduct a research study on whether SCADA systems, including well-designed leak detection subsystems, should be required on hazardous liquid pipelines in order to enhance the safe operation of the pipelines. Enhanced safety requirements would include provision for more rapid response following accidents, including valve spacing criteria and initiating the closure of RCVs. This study is presently being conducted by the Volpe National Transportation System Center (VNTSC) and is discussed later in this ANPRM. Another proposal from this study was for the RSPA to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to require, on hazardous liquid pipelines with SCADA systems installed, that existing manually operated main line block valves 5 in urban areas be retrofitted to make them RCVs and install RCVs when new valves are installed in urban areas. This ANPRM seeks data on valves located in urban areas. 5 A valve which provides a positive shut off of commodity flow both upstream and downstream of the valve is generally known as a ``block valve'' because it blocks the flow in the pipeline. Other proposals in the study suggested public input on whether the hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR part 195 should be revised to require valve spacing criteria for EFRDs at the following locations: (1) Where the valves could most effectively reduce the likelihood of the escaping liquid entering the water at water crossings that are more than 100-feet wide, and on either side of a reservoir holding water for human consumption; (2) At other critical areas affected by commodity release; and (3) At specific locations outside of urban areas on hazardous liquid pipelines in proximity to the public. Some of the questions posed in this ANPRM are designed to provide data on which the RSPA will decide on a further course of action concerning the proposed placement of EFRDs in these locations. Past Data Collection To broaden the data base for the March 1991 EFRD study, the RSPA solicited information from the public, including gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators and equipment manufacturers, through a Federal Register notice (54 FR 20945; May 15, 1989). A series of 15 questions addressed a number of EFRD/leak detection-related issues including SCADA technology, establishing a maximum allowable spill value, and criteria for valve spacing. The 72 responses to the notice are contained in Docket PS&hyph;104; Notice 1 and are available for review in the Docket Unit, room 8421. The notice included a series of questions about leak detection subsystems which are part of operators' SCADA systems. The responses to the questions indicated SCADA systems are becoming more sophisticated and leak detection subsystems are becoming more common on hazardous liquid pipelines. The sensitivity of leak detection subsystems on hazardous liquid pipelines was reported to range from 0.5 percent of flow to 5 percent of flow over a 1- to 2-hour period. Once a leak is suspected, the time for the dispatcher to respond by closing valves ranges from a few minutes for an RCV to an average of about 2 hours for manually operated valves. Commenters to the notice were also asked to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a valve spacing requirement based on a maximum spill criterion. Two advantages cited by commenters to support establishing a maximum spill criterion on a hazardous liquid pipeline were: (1) Reduction in the exposure to the public of the possible hazard created by a spill and (2) improved contingency plans since the plans could be based on a spill of a set volume. However, commenters cited more disadvantages than advantages.
