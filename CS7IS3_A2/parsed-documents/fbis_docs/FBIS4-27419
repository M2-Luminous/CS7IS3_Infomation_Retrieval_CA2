[Toyoda] As a matter of fact, automobiles represent a very large part of Japan's trade surplus. But, as Keidanren chairman, I should not serve only the auto industry. It is important in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks to adequately implement macro economic policies. As each industrial sector is appropriately working on negotiation in its field, I want Keidanren to deal with macro economic issues. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your attitude toward political donations and relations between politicians and the business sector? [Toyoda] The previous leadership of Keidanren decided not to engage in political donations, and I will follow that policy. Japan's politics is currently undergoing great changes, and we would like to watch developments. Offering donations is not the only way Keidanren can deal with politicians. As Japanese society changes, donations to defend liberalism are losing their significance. I hope politicians make elections less expensive hereafter. Keidanren intends to launch a special committee on business-politics relations, and to study foreign companies' attitudes toward politics. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What, then, is your attitude toward bureaucrats? [Toyoda] Administrative reform is one of the most urgent issues for Japan. Bureaucrats are supposed to take the initiative in the reform process as they are fully aware of the need for reform. They are capable of carrying out reform, and they are well aware of the need for it. Deregulation must be promoted, and it is absolutely necessary to provide the watchdog body proposed by the so-called Hiraiwa Council. No matter who takes over the government, this policy should remain unchanged. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Japan has lost the knack of constant economic growth. As Keidanren chairman, what is your management strategy? [Toyoda] All companies have to keep maturing, and so does a nation. The bubble-economy boom should not be revived, but we must seek ways to improve society. If we stop, we will fall behind international competitors. Although Japan is going to have an aged society, it should not lose its vitality. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Officials of Keidanren are often called "private bureaucrats" for their high-handed attitudes. What are you going to do to reform Keidanren itself? [Toyoda] Society is changing, and Keidanren must try harder to catch up with social trends. We have to think about organizational reform, and our officials should be modestly capable people.
