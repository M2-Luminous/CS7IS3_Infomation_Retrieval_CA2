Our roads are bad. Our phone system doesn't work. Our flights are inadequate. But nature is on our side. That's why you should come in now or you may miss the bus..." This was not meant as a threat to Thai investors. Nor was it an overstatement about Laos' abundant opportunities. The senior Lao official was stressing to a group of about 150 Thai businessmen here over the weekend that this landlocked country of 4.3 million people is in a hurry to revise all its investment laws to attractive foreign investors. But the pace of jumping headlong into a free market economy will be determined by the Laotians, not foreign investors. The new breed of Lao leaders, a mixture of French-educated intellectuals well exposed to the capitalist system and those with socialist training from the former Soviet Union who had fought the Americans from their caves in the northeast in the 1960s, is all set to embark on the path of modernization. "We must face the facts. We don't have the technology. We don't have the capital. We don't have the management skills. We don't have the marketing experience. But we do have natural resources and the will to move ahead and open our country open," intones one of the young leaders in charge of drawing up "Laos in the Year 2000." The plan represents an ambitious attempt to put Laos on the world's economic map. But there have been hiccups. "Some critics say our development plans are too much like Thailand's. Well, all economic plans have to start somewhere, based on certain elementary factors. But I am sure that ours will not be exactly like Thailand's plan. For example, our rural development plan will be different. Ours will work -- meaning that we won't allow the gap between the urban and rural areas to be a wide as that in Thailand," another senior official says. The tone of self-confidence is unmistakable. So is the keen awareness to avoid Thailand's blunder of allowing a single foreign country to dominate its economic landscape. In this connection, the traditional love-hate relationship between Thailand and Laos has been invoked, albeit very subtly, by local critics here, in the wake of the onslaught of Thai investments pouring into Laos in the past few years. Thailand's investments in Laos now stand at 47 per cent, the single biggest in this category. And the pattern is changing dramatically -- from small traders moving goods across the Mekong River to multinational firms based in Thailand winning major contracts in construction, mining, forestry, finance and all facets of the economy. The Thai presence is overwhelming. Anti-Thai feelings may not have surfaced in any significant degree just yet. But the danger has been lurking. As a Thai academic who took part in a seminar here on "Thai-Lao Bridge: Economic and Investment Prospects in Laos" organized by Nation Publishing Group suggested: "I can't help but look back 20 years and find a very close resemblance of how Japan came into Thailand as the biggest single foreign investor. We wanted Japan's capital and technology. But we didn't like the way they behaved towards us. We were against the Japanese but deep inside we envied their success as an economic power. That's what's happening in Vientiane when we talk about Thai investors in Laos..." In private conversations, Laotian leaders would readily admit that attempts are being made to preempt such negative side-effects in the wake of their vigorous push to race against time to build up its economic infrastructure. Inevitably, Thailand, with clear advantages over other countries in this respect, has become the first to ride the wave of foreign investments in this country. "We must face the facts. Whether we like it or not, we will have to deal with the Thais, yesterday, today or tomorrow. There is no escaping the fact that we are close neighbours and Thailand is further advanced than Laos and once we open the gate it is only natural that our big and rich neighbours would be the first to knock at our door. That's why our initial efforts will be to accommodate Thai investors, the good ones of course," said another senior official responsible for attracting foreign investors into Laos. Some "bad investors" have been punished and ostracised. But "good investors" aren't easy to come by. They tend to be more demanding, posing tough questions and seeking guarantees on investment that the Laotian authorities aren't quite ready yet to offer in clear terms. The bad guys would come in on any terms, hoping to earn a quick buck, exploiting Laos' resources to the hilt but the real, solid ones are more cautious, waiting in the wings, weighing the pros and cons to decide whether to spend the same amount of money in Laos or Vietnam or Cambodia. The choice is never easy considering the varying degrees of uncertainty in all the three Indochinese countries. But some "big names" from Thailand have arrived, waving their drafts of MoUs, or "Memorandums of Understanding", as a way to test the waters. Thai banks have made inroads in Vientiane and Thai construction companies have lobbied hard to win contracts through some complicated rules which require both a good understanding of how things are done and who to talk to before gaining entry into the game. "Everything is negotiable," declared a top Laotian official in charge of drawing up the ground rules for foreign investors, responding to the growing complaints from Thai businessmen about unclear laws and regulations on a number of areas of investments. The pledge to apply flexibility in all areas might have come as good news to some. But the same statement also spells chaos and disorder. "If everything can be discussed, it also means that what applies today may not apply the following day or vice versa," a Thai trader says. The teething problems will be there for sometime. But one should not interpret the new sense of compromise as a gesture of weakness. The fierce sense of political independence which has been the hallmark of Laos' political philosophy through the Cold War remains as strong as ever. Any adjustments in its political structure will only come very slowly and after very careful consideration. "We are quite convinced that our present political structure of a one-party system is ideal for us. But changes will come if we consider them appropriate. For example, our parliament, which used to be a very quiet and inactive body, has lately been activated. House debates are a common theme and newspapers in Laos now have become more critical about issues that affect the country..." the same official says. The wind of change has arrived but this tiny country of calm and restraint appears determined to proceed at its own pace and with its own style. If Laos appeared to have picked up speed in recent years, that was only because Laos wants to make sure that it is not left far too much behind. As one local resident told me: "We have been left behind for so long that we have to run very fast indeed just to remain where we are..."
