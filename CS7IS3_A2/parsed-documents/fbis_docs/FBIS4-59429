FBIS4-59429 "drnes093_l_94009" FBIS-NES-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 ISRAEL Protest of `Fascists' in Italian Government Urged Protest of `Fascists' in Italian Government Urged TA1205113994 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT (24 SHA'OT supplement) in Hebrew 12 May 94 p 8 TA1205113994 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT (24 SHA'OT supplement) Hebrew BFN [Commentary by Sever Plotzker: "Do Not Let Fascism Have Its Way"] [Excerpts] On 10 May, TV mogul Silvio Berlusconi, the newly elected Italian prime minister, presented the composition of his government: Berlusconi's popular movement -- which organized for the election at the record time of 10 weeks and swept most of the Italian voter's support -- is an alliance of three parties: Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, a populist party seeking to turn Italy into a loose north-south federation; the Northern League; and the National Alliance, which contains the hardcore Italian neo- fascists. This is the first time fascists are members of a European government since 1944. [passage omitted] Before it is too late -- before the representation of neo-fascists expands, before the new fascists are again accepted among the civilized European nations -- my government, the Government of Israel, the government of the state of the Jews, must take a demonstrative act against what is happening in Italy this spring of 1994. We cannot just let this happen. I urge and expect Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to express the Israeli Government's most determined protest over the fact that neo-fascists were made part of an Italian government. I expect Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to recall Israel's ambassador in Rome for prolonged consultations. I strongly suggest that the membership of Italian observers in the Temporary International Presence in Hebron be suspended for as long as they are subject to a government the deputy prime minister of which is a neo-fascist. And, if all the above diplomatic hints do not help, I call on my government to downgrade the Israeli representation in Italy from the ambassadorial to the consular level, or even less. I am aware of the fact that some Italians might view this as an interference with their domestic matters. Not true! Legitimizing fascism or neo-post-fascism is no domestic matter of any country. It is a virus that could spread like AIDS if it is not abolished at once. Even if the Italians are willing to stomach their fascists, we, the Jewish government, will scream and how. It is not only that we are entitled to do so; it is our national duty. This is what the State of Israel is there for. We cannot afford to keep silent. We know the dreadful price of silence. There is no such thing as humanitarian fascism.
