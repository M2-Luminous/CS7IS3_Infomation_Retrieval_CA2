FR940916-1-00109 FR940916-1-00016 The brake-pipe leakage test would continue to be a valid method of qualifying brake systems. However, FRA proposes that the air flow method of testing the condition of the brake pipe become an acceptable alternate to the brake-pipe leakage test. The air flow method would only be an alternative for trains equipped with 26&hyph;L freight locomotive brake equipment and outfitted with an EOT device. The maximum allowable flow would be 60 CFM. FRA believes that the air flow method is a much more comprehensive test than the leakage test. Although FRA is not proposing to mandate the use of the air flow method, it does recommend that railroads use the method when possible, not just to qualify brake systems, but in order to provide additional information regarding the brake system to the train crew. The air flow method has been approved for use by AAR member railroads after extensive testing, and the method has been available in Canada as an alternate means of qualifying train brakes since 1984. The brake-pipe gradient of 15 psi has been retained for both the leakage and air flow method of train brake testing; however, the minimum rear-car pressure has been increased to 75 psi, which will require a locomotive brake-pipe pressure of 90 psi. FRA feels that the added margin of braking power justifies the increase in pressure. Comments received by FRA indicated a high reliability of the rear-car pressure transducers used in reporting brake-pipe pressure by an EOT device. Consequently, FRA feels justified in allowing the use of EOT devices in establishing the rear car pressure for Class 1 brake tests. This proposed Class 1 brake test also requires that EOT devices be inspected. The pressure display on the front unit would be verified with that of the rear unit at the time of installation on the train. The emergency function would be tested after installation on the train by closing the angle cock at the rear car, to isolate it from the train, and then actuating the emergency switch on the front unit. After verifying of the emergency application on the rear car, the angle cock must be opened to reestablish trainline continuity. FRA proposes to continue to allow railroads the option of performing a complete Class 1 test or a leakage/application-and-release test on cars picked up at a point other than a terminal. Cars receiving the abbreviated test shall be given a complete Class 1 test at the next terminal where facilities are available for such attention. FRA proposes to continue to allow ``roll-by'' inspections of the brake release but to limit their speed to 10 mph, since roll-by inspections made at greater speeds would not permit sufficient visual inspection of the brake equipment. Some pieces of equipment currently being used by railroads that incorporate several different types of brake systems with piston travel limits which differ greatly from the 7&hyph;9 inch limits found on standard brake cylinders. Inspectors of this equipment may not know the piston travel limits for this equipment and, thus, may perform a cursory inspection of the pistons assuming the travel is correct. Therefore, in order to aid inspectors in performing quality inspections, FRA proposes that the piston travel limits of non-standard brake cylinders be displayed on a badge plate or stencil. Section 232.311. This section contains the guidelines for determining the distance a train is allowed to travel between Class 1 train brake system tests. The requirements proposed in this section were carefully constructed to enhance safety both with respect to sound functioning of train braking systems and other mechanical components (particularly of railroad freight cars). The approach balances the conflicting concerns of railroads and railroad labor organizations. FRA agrees with railroad commenters, that if the brake systems on today's trains are properly tested, inspected, and maintained, the trains are capable of safely operating for greater distances between brake system tests than currently permitted. However, FRA also agrees with the position presented by labor organizations that proper brake system inspections and maintenance are not being performed by the railroads. Consequently, FRA would provide railroads with the incentive of permission to travel distances that are in excess of what is currently permitted if quality tests, inspections, and maintenance are performed. In addition, if a railroad fails to perform the tasks required for extended movement, by merely performing the minimum required tests and inspections that FRA finds necessary for the safe operation of a train, then its trains would not be permitted to be moved beyond 500 miles without another Class 1 brake test. FRA believes that the proposed 500-mile reduction from the 1,000-mile limit currently allowed is justified based on the fact that the 1,000-mile inspection was extended from 500 miles in 1982 based on a commitment by the railroads to perform high quality tests and inspections at initial terminals, which based on FRA experience and the comments received, has not been fulfilled. The requirements proposed in this section offer the railroads important flexibility while imposing firm requirements. A railroad may elect to conduct a Class 1 test utilizing train crew members trained in the requirements of the power brake regulations. In that case, the railroad may operate the train no more than 500 miles.
