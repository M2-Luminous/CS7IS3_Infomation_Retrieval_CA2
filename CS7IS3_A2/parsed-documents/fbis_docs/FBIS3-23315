The RAF has not given up its armed struggle, Rolf Hannich, deputy spokesman for the Office of the Federal Public Prosecutor said on Monday in an interview with DPA. At the same time, he warned against assuming that the RAF no longer constitutes a terrorist threat. It is true that in late October 1993, the majority of RAF prisoners, the so-called hard-liners around Brigitte Mohnhaupt, left the RAF. Nevertheless, one cannot assume that the RAF has given up its fight against the state. On the contrary, in its last command declaration of 2 November 1993, the RAF made it clear that it continues to be active as a terrorist group. One must assume that, despite the arrest in Bad Kleinen, the RAF remains capable of taking action, Hannich said. Hence, attacks have to be expected from the RAF command level in the future, too. Hannich thus rejected an assessment by the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution that the RAF had ceased to exist as a single entity. [passage omitted]
