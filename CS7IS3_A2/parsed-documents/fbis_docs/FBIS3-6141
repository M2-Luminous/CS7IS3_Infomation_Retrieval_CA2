Some said as the Tokyo conference had already ended, Hun Sen will go to ask the king to dismiss Sam Rangsi as finance minister and replace him with puppet Cham Prasit [state secretary for finance], who will heartlessly extort money from the people. Moreover, with Cham Prasit as finance minister, Hun Sen can spend financial aid at will. Others said: Today, he asks the king to remove Sam Rangsi; tomorrow, he will ask for the dismissal of others who have not surrendered to him. In the end, he will control, then completely eradicate FUNCINPEC. This shows that the only thing Vietnamese communist Hun Sen understands is destruction, not national reconciliation or national unification. He also understands only the Vietnamese communists' dictatorship. As for Prince Ranariddh, all he can do is bow and scrape before him. The MP's further said that Prince Ranariddh was well aware of this move because he was colluding with Hun Sen to remove Sam Rangsi. But he will not go to Beijing as he is afraid of being seen as too obviously involved in the matter. Some other MP's said Hun Sen's visit was to ask the king to grant him the title of Samdech Krompreah. Prince Ranariddh is afraid of him, so why should the prince have a higher title than he? Moreover, he also wants to have a higher title than that of puppet Chea Sim and puppet Heng Samrin. The MP's added that Hun Sen will certainly boast that he had won this or that victory and will threaten the king not to achieve national reconciliation. Puppet Hun Sen is extremely insolent, so he will resort to this method, no matter what. He knows nothing about right and wrong since he totally obeys the orders of the Vietnamese communists, his masters. In sum, puppet Hun Sen's visit to the king is not to seek a solution, but to create more problems for FUNCINPEC and our nation and people. He never thinks about national reconciliation or peace. He thinks only about reinforcing and expanding his Vietnamese communist power and threatening the king so he can eliminate resistance forces and other national forces with the aim of doing away with the Cambodian nation and race. The nation and people are keeping an eye on the farce.
