However, Portugal will not oppose air strikes if those countries which in particular have troops on the ground -- Britain, France, Spain, Canada, and others -- believe that such strikes are the adequate means to bring to an end, or mitigate, the slaughter that is taking place on the ground. But I repeat, the goal is the provision of humanitarian aid to the population and ending the war that has hit that part of Europe. [end recording]
