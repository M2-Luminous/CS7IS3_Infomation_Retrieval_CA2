The Czech Republic's export business has been turning more and more toward developed economies, while trade with former East-bloc countries and the former USSR has remained close to the same levels or, in some cases, dropped off. From 1992 to 1993 alone, exports to the EU jumped 24 percent, accounting for $5.5 billion US, while imports from the EU increased by 10 percent to $1.1 billion US. Still, trade between the EU, the world's largest single economy, and the Czech Republic is not completely free. And this continues to irk some Czech leaders. "We have never asked for [economic] assistance. We asked only for foreign trade. But unfortunately these barriers exist, and will continue to exist for the near future," said Vladimir Budinsky, chair of Czech Parliament's economics committee. Petr Postulka, head of the EU division at the Ministry of Industry and Trade's Foreign Trade Section, said that with the recession in Europe right now, "It's not always easy to achieve positive results, because the situation of the European Union is not very positive." But, he said, arrangements to fully liberalize two sensitive trade sectors--textiles and steel--in which the Czech Republic's goods traditionally undersell those made within the EU, should be completed by the beginning of 1997. A free trade agreement with the Czech Republic for most other industrial goods should be signed by 1995.
