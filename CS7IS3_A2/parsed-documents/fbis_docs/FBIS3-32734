Blanco said that although the document acknowledges that the Shining Path is the greatest human rights violator in Peru, but also notes the progress attained by the government in this field, the report persists in accusing the Peruvian Government of systematically implementing a policy of murders and disappearances. Besides pointing out that the government's antisubversive strategy is based on the concepts of prosperity, democracy, and respect for human rights, Blanco maintains that the U.S. State Department's view is incomplete and ignores other more objective reports such as the ones prepared by the United Nations. Gen. Cisneros, who agrees with Blanco, denied that the Peruvian Government systematically implements a policy of abuses to human rights. He said that the U.S. report is quite unfair to the Armed Forces which last year were very careful to act within the legal norms and with respect for the individual. He added that the U.S. Government has a distorted notion of the problem as a consequence of "information obtained from people interested in creating a false image of Peru." However, Cisneros agreed on the need to modify the trial mechanism -- by military courts -- of terrorists to make trials "more transparent and according to the law." "We can already observe a change of attitude in the government, especially since the installation of new Supreme Court members who were chosen by a Disciplinary Board for Magistrates," Cisneros said.
