The spectrophotometer calibration must be verified through use of a NIST 930D Standard Reference Material (SRM). The SRM 930D consists of three (3) neutral density glass filters and a blank, each mounted in a cuvette. The wavelengths and temperature to be used in the calibration are listed on the NIST certificate that accompanies the reported values. Determine and record a transmittance of the SRM values at the NIST wavelengths (three filters at five wavelengths each for a total of 15 determinations). A percent difference shall be calculated between the NIST certified values and the spectrophotometer response. At least 12 of the 15 differences (in percent) shall be within # 0.5 percent of the NIST SRM values. No one value shall have a difference of # 1.0 percent. Failure to achieve these criteria identifies a need to recalibrate the SRM or service the spectrophotometer. 7.1.3.1.2.2␣Scan the filter to be tested and the NIST blank from wavelength 380 to 780 nm, and record the spectrophotometer percent transmittance responses at 10 nm intervals. The sequence of testing is: blank filter, tested filter, tested filter rotated 90 degrees in the plane of the filter, blank filter. Calculate the average transmittance at each 10 nm interval. If any pair of the tested filter transmittance values (for the same filter and wavelength) differ by more than # 0.25 percent, rescan the tested filter. Failure to achieve this tolerance shall prevent the use of the filter in the calibration tests of the COMS. 7.1.3.1.2.3␣Correct the tested filter transmittance values by dividing the average tested filter transmittance by the average blank filter transmittance at each 10 nm interval. 7.1.3.1.2.4␣Calculate the weighted tested filter transmittance by multiplying the transmittance value by the corresponding response factor shown in table 1&hyph;4, to obtain the Source C Human Eye Response.
