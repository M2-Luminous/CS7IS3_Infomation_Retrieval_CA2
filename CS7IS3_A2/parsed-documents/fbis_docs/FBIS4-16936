Nonetheless, neither the parliament, nor its Committee for planning, budgeting, financing and pricing have stirred a finger to bring the issue under deliberations. As Andrei Pecherov, chairman of the said committee, explained in an interview to UKRINFORM's correspondent, the interfering parliamentary elections are to blame. With the freshly elected parliament yet to convene its maiden plenary session the State Budget's performance in the first quarter, and hence, its correction, are highly improbable to ever occur. It may be noted that the State Budget's miraculous deficit-free nature was very skeptically and reluctantly accepted by the MP's. Alas, it is precisely on what international financial institutions insist. In view of this, in the process of drafting the State Budget's deficit was gradually reduced to nil.
