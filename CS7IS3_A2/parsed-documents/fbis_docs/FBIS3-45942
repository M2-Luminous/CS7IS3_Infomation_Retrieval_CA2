Dawamat said his visit is intended to enhance relations between China and Malaysia and to promote economic ties between Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China and Malaysia. Xinjiang welcomes Malaysians to go there as tourists or doing business, he said, as the region is rich in natural resources and has many Muslims, like Malaysia. Mahathir said friendly relations between Malaysia and China have been developing fast. Since his visit to China, there have been more personnel exchanges. He hoped that more people from Xinjiang will come to Malaysia. One potential area for business cooperation may be petroleum, he suggested. Dawamat is heading a Xinjiang delegation on a one-week visit to Malaysia. They arrived yesterday.
