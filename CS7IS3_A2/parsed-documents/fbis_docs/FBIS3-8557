Jacques Poos is the head of the Council of WEU. Olechowski and Poos discussed also Poland's relations with the European Union and NATO. A debate on the status of Poland and other Central European states which have been WEU's partners for consultation is still being held and should end at a session of the Council of WEU scheduled to take place in Luxembourg on May 9-10, Poos stressed at a joint press conference ending Olechowski's visit to Luxembourg. Poos expressed his hope that during the May session the Western European Union would agree on granting Poland and other countries of the region a status very close to association. He admitted, however, that such a status would not give Poland "legal security guarantees but will enable its full participation in political discussions and its gradual inclusion into joint operations in the military sphere". According to Olechowski, the associate status with the WEU would be better for Poland than its partnership with NATO. During his one-day official visit to Luxembourg Olechowski was also received by Grand Duke Jean and Prime Minister Jacques Santer.
