FR940805-2-00039 FR940805-2-00030 II It is further ordered, that, pending divestiture of FreeHand, Respondents shall take such action as is necessary to maintain the viability and marketability of FreeHand and shall not cause or permit the destruction, removal from the market, wasting, deterioration or impairment of FreeHand. Pending divestiture of FreeHand, employees of Respondents involved in the development, marketing, or sale of Illustrator or FreeHand shall not be involved in the development, marketing or sale of the other product; and employees of Respondents involved in the development, marketing or sale of Illustrator or FreeHand shall not receive or have access to or the use of any ``material confidential information'' not in the public domain, with respect to the other product except as such information would be available to those employees in the normal course of business if the Acquisition had not taken place. (``Material confidential information,'' as used herein, means competitively sensitive or proprietary information not independently known from sources other than those employees involved in the development, marketing, or sale of FreeHand or Illustrator.) III It is further ordered, that within six (6) months after the Acquisition is consummated Respondents shall absolutely and in good faith divest FreeHand to Altsys in accordance with the Altsys agreement. Adobe and Aldus shall comply with all the terms of the Altsys Agreement, except that the License shall be terminated no later than six (6) months after the Acquisition. The purpose of the divestiture is to ensure the continuation of FreeHand as an ongoing viable Professional Illustration Software program, to maintain FreeHand as an independent competitor in the Professional Illustration Software business, and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the Acquisition as alleged in the Commission's Complaint. IV It is further ordered, that, within sixty (60) days after the date this Order becomes final and every sixty (60) days thereafter until Respondents have fully complied with the provisions of Paragraphs II and III of this Order, Respondents shall submit to the Commission a verified written report setting forth in detail the manner and form in which they intend to comply, are complying, or have complied with those provisions. Respondents shall include in their compliance reports, among other things that are required from time to time, a full description of the efforts being made to comply with Paragraphs II and III of this Order. V It is further ordered, that for a period of ten (10) years from the date on which this Order becomes final, Respondents shall not, without the prior approval of the Commission, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, partnerships, or otherwise: A. Acquire any stock, share capital, equity or other interest in any concern, corporate or noncorporate, then engaged in the development or sale of Professional Illustration Software, provided, however, that an acquisition of such stock, share capital, equity or other interest will be exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if it is solely for the purpose of investment and Respondents will hold no more than one percent of the shares of any class of security traded on a national securities exchange or authorized to be quoted in an interdealer quotation system of a national securities association registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission; or B. Acquire any Professional Illustration Software or acquire or enter into any exclusive license to Professional Illustration Software; Provided, however, that such an acquisition will be exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if the purchase price is less than $2,000,000 (two million dollars). VI It is further ordered, that, for a period of ten (10) years from the date this order becomes final, unless Respondents are required to seek prior approval from the Commission pursuant to Paragraph V, Respondents shall not, without providing advance written notification to the Commission, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, partnerships, or otherwise, acquire any Professional Illustration Software or any exclusive license to Professional Illustration Software; Said notification shall be given on the Notification and Report Form set forth in the Appendix to Part 803 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations as amended (hereinafter referred to as ``the Notification''). Respondents shall provide to the Commission at least ten days prior to acquiring any such interest (hereinafter referred to as the ``first waiting period''), both the Notification and supplemental information either in Respondents' possession or reasonably available to Respondents. Such supplemental information shall include a copy of the proposed acquisition agreement; the names of the principal representatives of each Respondent and of the firm Respondents desire to acquire who negotiated the acquisition agreement; and any management or strategic plans discussing the proposed acquisition. If, within the first waiting period, representatives of the Commission make a written request for additional information, Respondents shall not consummate the acquisition until twenty days after submitting such additional information. Early termination of the waiting periods in this paragraph may be requested and, where appropriate, granted in the same manner as is applicable under the requirements and provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. 18a. VII One year from the date this Order becomes final, annually for the next nine (9) years, and at other times as the Commission may require, Respondents shall file with the Commission verified written reports setting forth in detail the manner and form in which they have complied and are complying with Paragraphs V and VI of this Order.
