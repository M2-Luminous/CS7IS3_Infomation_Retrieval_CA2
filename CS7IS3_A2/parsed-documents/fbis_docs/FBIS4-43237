"Such a change in government in Bonn would be a high-grade security risk," Kanther told WELT AM SONNTAG after the SPD obstructed the anticrime law in the Bundesrat, after it had passed in the Bundestag. The SPD-led laender refused to pass the "1994 anticrime law" in the Bundesrat on Friday [10 June] after it had been adopted by the coalition government of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. Although they welcomed the more severe punishment of neo-Nazis as provided for by the draft law, they especially reject additional measures to fight crime involving international gangs. Minister Kanther gave examples to WELT AM SONNTAG of what, according to their election program, the Greens want to enforce in a coalition with the SPD. - "The Greens call for the dissolution of the Federal Intelligence Service [BND] and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], because they regard these institutions as a danger to democracy." - "The Greens press for weakening the police. Important instruments for fighting crime should be banned, such as electronic devices for collecting evidence, the use of undercover investigators, and the permission to raid entire neighborhoods." - "Riot police in the laender should be dissolved. The Greens also regard the Federal Border Police as superfluous." - "The Greens reject stricter detention laws. Instead, the conditions for probation should be extended." Kanther pointed out that common positions were emerging, at least between parts of the SPD and the Greens. One case in point was the drugs policy: "According to the Greens, trade in hashish and marijuana should be legalized, and heroin should even be distributed to addicts by the state. The SPD is ready to put such trends into practice wherever it assumes power."
