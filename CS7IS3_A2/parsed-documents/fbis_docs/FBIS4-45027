Speaking at a joint meeting of the Chamber of Commerce and the Iran and Germany Official Industries Organization, he added: It is true that in the last two years the country and the banks have been faced with delayed payments, but to make up for this loss, in the last four years more work was done than projected in the Five-Year Plan, and the average growth of 8.1 percent in GNP is a good indication of thriving economic activity. The Central Bank consultant said: In the year 1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989] Iran imported 4.5 to 5 million tons of wheat per year, while in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] and 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] this figure decreased to 2.5 million tons. Imports of almost 4 million tons of iron and steel in the year 1367 changed to exports of 1 million tons of these materials in the year 1372. Dr. Kashan said the nation's capacity to produce oil by-products increased from 2.5 million barrels per day [BPD] in the year 1367 to the present 4.5 million BPD. He added: The Islamic Republic of Iran carried out its Five-Year Economic Development Plan with fewer than 500 foreign experts, and its capital formations grew to 23 percent of GNP. Concerning the extent of Iran's indebtedness, he added: Iran's total debts, including the suspended payments and what will come due in the future, will be paid in the next five years without any problem according to the payment schedule that has been established. He added: This is provided that payments are not delayed by a drop in the value of the dollar against other reputable currencies such as the yen and the mark, or by a drop in the price of oil.
