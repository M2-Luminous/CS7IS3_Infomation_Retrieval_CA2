"In the three months that have passed since the Ukrainian president issued the directive on the privatization of unfinished construction facilities and their land, virtually nothing has been done," stated Yukhym Zvyahilskyy. Of the 9,200 unfinished construction facilities earmarked for privatization, in the words of State Property Fund Chairman Volodymyr Pryadko, only 3 have been sold after three months. The following were named by the participants as being among the causes suppressing progress on this matter: The privatization scheme is bulky; there are no potential buyers or investors due to the financial and payment crisis; privatization is being carried out in tough conditions and there is nothing to gain financially. The opinion of Ukrainian Construction and Architecture Minister Yuriy Serbin's is that, in holding up the privatization of unfinished construction facilities, "it has turned out that the culprits are state administrations that are unwilling to give up the facilities they think they need, though lacking funds to complete their construction." One of the ways to speed up privatization, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy believes, is through "personal responsibility of local leaders regarding the implementation of presidential directives." He added: "Our president is very liberal. One should punish administratively rather than trying to talk them round."
