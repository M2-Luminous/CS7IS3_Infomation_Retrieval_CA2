In an interview with FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, Ulrich Irmer, the FDP Bundestag Group's foreign policy spokesman, said that the call for CSCE observers would make the Turks feel they are "to be brought before the judge" again. This would irritate Ankara and lessen its willingness to negotiate. That is why the Bundestag group has decided against a Bundestag motion calling for observers, as had been suggested by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Talking to FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU three weeks ago, Kinkel had called for CSCE observers to be sent to Turkey. Irmer said that, instead of criticizing [Turkey] "in the open market" by calling for observers, the Turkish Government should be persuaded to change its line toward the Kurds and its human rights policy by means of talks within the CSCE and the Council of Europe. In such internal talks, the Turkish Government tends to show "goodwill and thoughtfulness"; but it "simply does not have its own army under control any more." As a result of that, the Kurdish identity of people in southeast Turkey is disputed, and they are refused the rights of an ethnic minority. Irmer said that the fight against the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) "is an enormous strain on the civilian population." Ankara's attempt at solving the Kurdish problem by military means is "unsuitable." The FDP group's foreign policy spokesman does not share Kinkel's view that the human rights situation in Turkey has deteriorated. "I do not have any indication" of that, Irmer said. The FDP politician said that the German delegation might try putting Turkey's Kurdish policy on the agenda of the CSCE conference of parliamentarians to be held in Vienna in early July.
