However, there are objections to you in part of the political spectrum -- above all among those whom the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] wanted to reach in the eighties. [Scharping] I do not see it in this way. According to the polls, the SPD has stabilized at 40 percent. This is a good starting position, which is also confirmed by the election result in Lower Saxony. If the question is aimed at the occasional criticism that topics like equal status for women, the protection of the natural foundations of life, or others are receding into the background, this is not correct. They are only increasingly related to the main social problem: the combating of unemployment and the reestablishment of social justice. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] However, these topics are not identical. A topical example: The government program retreats on the demand for a general speed limit and is not very specific about a gasoline price increase. [Scharping] The exciting question is how an ecologically tolerable traffic policy is to be drawn up. Regarding consumption, one has to provide the car industry with incentives and, at the same time, with reliable basic conditions, so that a reduction in so-called car fleet consumption becomes possible. First of all, this is a matter of technical progress. Regarding the speed limit, differentiated solutions that are in keeping with the situation will be required. It is not very imaginative to put up a sign with a speed limit everywhere. In exclusively residential areas the speed limit of 30 km per hour is appropriate and the municipalities have to be enabled to push it through. A speed of 90 or 100 km per hour is appropriate on highways, and on superhighways the location of the driver, the traffic density, and the traffic burden make a difference. A four-lane superhighway near a city is different from a six-lane one somewhere in the country. We have an increasing number of technical opportunities to react appropriately to these different situations. We do not exclude the speed limit from the program -- in no way. But a simple yes or no to the speed limit results in a discussion on symbols, and symbolic debates are usually rather fruitless. I give you an example: The Land of Rhineland- Palatinate has always been suspected of opposing the speed limit. In fact, there is a speed limit on 40 percent of the superhighways in Rhineland-Palatinate, which is more than in any other land, and their experience regarding accident rates is very good. If this is flexibly handled, technical possibilities and the people's sense of responsibility can be usefully combined. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You have given the country your three topics: Work, work, work. When we hear the SPD talk about ecology today, it often sounds like an appendage. [Scharping] Then I recommend you to listen more closely. Economy and ecology are inseparable components of the development of the future. One must not create an artificial contradiction between them. They are integrated, interrelated, and unrenounceable components of the future development. Economic development means growth that is in line with the environment, but also the modernization of the social state, the reduction of labor costs, and an intelligent organization of work. There are people who believe that the economic development could be more or less pursued from an Archimedean point. I think that this is a rather primitive way of thinking in a highly complicated and strongly intertwined society where labor is divided. A point from which the whole complex development can be advanced does not exist. I want to give an example. At the end of the sixties, the law on stability and growth was very much discussed in Germany. More precisely: The magic quadrilateral was constantly discussed because Karl Schiller had invented the formula of the magic quadrilateral. It consisted of price stability, a balance in foreign trade, full employment, and adequate economic growth. It must be possible today to count at least up to three. That is, modernization of the economy, intelligent organization of work, and modernization of the activities of the state, including the social state. This has to be translated into reality. Ecologically oriented growth is an integral part of the modernization of the economy. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You want a leaner state and commit yourself to the framework in the government program: no increase in the state quota and no increase in the state debts. You would be a chancellor of the crisis. Do you think that there are also chances in the crisis? [Scharping] Crisis? Let us rather talk of challenges. First of all, ecological growth and, second, chances for the modernization of the activities of the state. What is the state? From my point of view, it has to guarantee the civilized coexistence of people on the foundation of basic values and basic rights and it has to guarantee the equality of opportunities. Whatever aspects may be taken -- social differences or equal status for men and women -- I always come to the same result: It is the task of the state to make a civilized coexistence possible. It creates the framework for private initiative, also for a private sense of responsibility toward the community, and it has to provide equal opportunities. However, this part of the state's activity is only accepted if the citizens know and can trust that the state will use the means entrusted to it in the most cost-advantageous and just way possible. All three aspects, justice, efficiency, and cost-consciousness, are grossly neglected at present. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Only by the Kohl government? [Scharping] By the present government policy and by a social trend that has developed all virtues of "I" considerably more than the virtues of "we." A new balance has to be found. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] The virtues of "we" include the preparedness for sharing. This cannot be ordered from above. Is national feeling required for it today? [Scharping] No, not at all. A sense of responsibility is required, as well as the ability to put the striving for one's happiness into a joint context. Everyone has the moral obligation to contribute to the public welfare, the preamble to the Hamburg constitution says. One could also quote Kant's categorical imperative or Thomas Aquinas' four basic virtues. Whatever it may be -- civilized societies cannot manage without the harmony of freedom, equality, and fraternity. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] But this does not explain why I am supposed to pay surcharges for people in the new laender and not for people in Portugal. [Scharping] I would not propose that to anyone. It would be an absurd undertaking to play Germany's inner development off against global questions of underdevelopment, the protection of human rights, or environmental protection on a global scale. But the opposite must not be done either. Aggression develops from the social problems in Germany, from fear, hopelessness, and the concern about jobs. Xenophobia, the hatred for minorities, and the disregard of other cultures develop from aggression. Precisely those who are interested in multiculturalism, the respect for other opinions, and social tolerance ought to advocate economic stability and social justice all the more. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] This sounds good.... [Scharping] It not only sounds good. It is the truth. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] The Greens would immediately support the concepts of tolerance and multiculturalism. Can you envisage a Green foreign minister? [Scharping] I will not hold any debates on a coalition, not even on the sly. There will only be a political change in Germany if the SPD clearly becomes stronger. But I add the following: Policies cannot be made with trivial nonsense -- the dissolution of the Bundeswehr and NATO, the immediate introduction of a gasoline price of 5 German marks per liter. Nor will the Greens' reliability increase if their leading representatives state immediately after a party congress where such resolutions were adopted that they are not so serious. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Have you therefore already eliminated a possible coalition partner? [Scharping] Once again: I do not hold any debates on coalitions. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Scharping, we have not even asked you a question about a coalition.... [Scharping] You asked whether I eliminate anyone. I only rule out one thing, that is, a grand coalition. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] There is no doubt that you will need a coalition partner. Thus, we are interested in your judgment of the eligible candidates. [Scharping] We can calmly wait for all that. Just like the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], the Greens are political opponents. Of course, I want to convince many of those who have so far voted for the Greens in the same way as others who have voted for the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] or the FDP so far. I value the voters of all other parties. I have the firm impression that the supply of possible coalitions will be greater than the demand. Expressed in terms of the market economy, this, of course, reduces the price. We want to become the strongest force. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] We give up, and express our interest in the plans of the strongest force. Did you start too early? Your topic of work has been taken up by all parties. Now people are asking about concrete alternatives to the SPD. [Scharping] At any rate, the concern of the CDU/CSU about the possible loss of government responsibility is perceptible for the first time. This is justified and good from my point of view and even urgently necessary from a general point of view. This party has to be replaced because there is nobody who is so much to blame for economic mistakes, the highest mass unemployment rate, bitter social injustice, and the apparent financial crisis of the state. In the first place, and for me the most important, it has lost the direct and immediate basic political capital, that is, confidence. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Will the slight economic upswing turn the tables once again? The CDU/CSU is banking on it. [Scharping] But what do we have in this field? Unfortunately, I add immediately. In December 1993 there was a sharp decline, particularly in the field of industrial production. Now there are slight improvements, as compared to a very bad year. This is to be explicitly welcomed and even more so if the tender shoots of growth were even more ecologically oriented. However, everyone knows that we would need a growth of at least 1.5 percent or rather of 2 percent for the labor market to move. Unfortunately, we will not achieve this growth in the course of 1994. If this trivial economic policy, which is completely uncertain for the enterprises that make investments and hardly reliable, is not changed, nothing new will develop. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] What does your program tell the voters: The SPD does the following three things differently and better? [Scharping] The economic and labor market policy, the social policy, including help for families with children, and distribution of burdens for inner unity. To start with the last: The financial contributions to inner unity, which I explicitly believe to be right, must not continue to be settled at the expense of the employees and the wage- and employment-intensive enterprises. For this destroys and impairs the competitiveness of the medium-sized enterprises and craft industries. Most of the innovations come from there, most of the jobs are there -- that is, 50 percent -- and 70 percent of the training takes place there. Thus, we are damaging our economic future and social justice if we continue the usual financing via solidarity funds and ancillary wage costs. With all that, it is completely clear that the tax and rate quota to be reached in 1995 must not be changed. However, within this framework, there must be shifts because of economic reason and social justice. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Let us come to the topic of foreign policy. You said at the security conference there are no real differences to that of the FRG Government. The Federal Government presented a white book that provides for crisis reaction forces for missions all over the world. The SPD resolution was: No combat missions. Which is correct? [Scharping] There are no differences in the basic orientations: European integration, transatlantic partnership, reliable and, if possible, friendly relations with the Eastern states. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Combat missions: yes or no -- this is also a basic question. [Scharping] Regarding the combat missions, there is a clear dividing line and a massive conflict between the SPD and the government parties. We want to be a UN member, protect our rights, and fulfill our duties there. We are sovereign in the decision on how we will do this. Therefore, the Social Democrats say: Strengthening the United Nations, yes to peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The resolution adopted at the Wiesbaden party congress draws a line that we will not cross: No actions like the Gulf war. [DIE TAGESZEITING] If you become chancellor, how will you celebrate 8 May 1995? [Scharping] As a day that freed Germany from fascism.
