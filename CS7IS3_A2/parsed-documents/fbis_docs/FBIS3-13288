Certainly, the Hebron massacre, which drew reactions from and shocked the entire world, has not made Bill Clinton or his staff bat an eyelash. Nor has this prompted them to change, even slightly, their country's policy from that of Israel. The latest reports on this subject indicates Washington told the Palestinian leadership that it should resolve its problems with Israel directly and without any intervention from any other party, that the discussion of the issue of sending international protection forces to Gaza and Jericho--and only to Gaza and Jericho--will be held only within the Israeli-Palestinian meetings and within the framework of the Oslo agreement. Thus, the United States proves once again that it is blindly taking sides with Israeli governments hawks, that it does not care for Arab and Islamic sentiments that appeared as reactions to the Hebron massacre, that it insists on hurting the feelings of Arabs and Muslims and imposes itself by force on Israel's side as an antagonist of all peoples in the region. Immediately following the massacre, President Bill Clinton addressed an appeal to transfer the Israeli-Palestinian talks to Washington. The PLO immediately accepted the invitation. Now the U.S. Administration is taking issues back to square one. It is insisting that the issue of international protection for the inhabitants of the occupied territory can only be solved between the PLO and Israel and within the Oslo agreement. In view of the blood shed by Israeli terrorism at the Ibrahimi Mosque, the world is now convinced that real protection for the Palestinian people under occupation must be provided. However, the United States continues to turn a cold shoulder to logic and to insist that every Arab and Muslim everywhere must continue to feel that his actual and definite enemy is the United States and not the Israeli state. Why does the United States reject effective protection for the Palestinian people under occupation and insist on spiking the wheels, when even some Israeli cabinet members support providing such protection and for removing settlements from the West Bank and Gaza? When it takes a hostile stand that rejects the facts of history and reality, the United States should not be surprised if the current that opposes it and its interests intensifies in the region and throughout the Arab and Islamic worlds as well. It should not be surprised at what will happen in the future. People are collections of feelings and sentiments. When their feelings are hurt their reaction will, by and large, be spontaneous and without thought or discretion.
