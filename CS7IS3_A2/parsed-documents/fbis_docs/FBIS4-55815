The destroyed mosque was in the area controlled by the Bosnian Croats Army (HVO). There are no details about perpetrators but an investigation is expected, the announcement said. `This terrible incident, which happened on the eve of the major Moslem religious holiday of Kurban Bairam, has deteriorated the already tense relations between Moslems and Croats in the area of Vitez,' the Croat Radio said. Only a few hours before explosive was planted, Moslem troops were celebrating the coming of Kurban Bairam by shooting on the positions of a HVO brigade in the area of Vitez, the radio said. The Bosnian Croats and Moslems were fighting fiercly from last spring (over territories with mixed population in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina) to early February, when, under strong U.S. pressure, they signed an accord on their federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina supposed to grow into a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. Relations between Croats and Moslems are, however, still very strained, and clashes and incidents do happen increasingly often. Apart from Vitez, mosques had been destroyed by Bosnian Croats in Zepca, Kiseljak, western Mostar, and Livno, all in the Croat republic of Herzeg Bosnia.
