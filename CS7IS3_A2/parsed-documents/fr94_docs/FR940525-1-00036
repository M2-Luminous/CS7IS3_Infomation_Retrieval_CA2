FR940525-1-00036 FR940525-1-00007 For risk-based capital purposes, non-standard representations or warranties a bank may extend in transferring assets (including the transfer of servicing rights), or may assume in other transactions, including the acquisition of loan servicing rights, are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes. 24a Standard representations and warranties, which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified with reasonable due diligence by the seller or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights are acquired. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions that provide for the return of the assets to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred are not fully and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller. 24a Representations are statements, express or implied, regarding a past or existing fact, circumstance, or state of facts pertinent to the contract, which is influential in bringing about the agreement. Warranties are promises that certain facts are truly as they are represented to be and that they will remain so, subject to specified limitations. A cash advance by a loan servicer does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan. A servicer cash advance is an arrangement under which the servicer advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan. * * * * * D. *␣*␣* Before an off-balance sheet item can be incorporated into the risk-based capital ratio, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount of the item must be determined. Once the credit-equivalent amount is determined, the amount is then assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. 40 The method for determining the credit-equivalent amount of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is set forth in section III.E.2 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount is determined by multiplying the full amount of the bank's exposure under the item by the applicable credit conversion factor as set forth below and in Attachment IV to this appendix A. 40 The sufficiency of collateral and guarantees for off-balance sheet items is determined by the market value of the collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the face amount of the item, except for interest- and exchange-rate contracts, for which this determination is made in relation to the credit-equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B of this appendix A. However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in section III.B.5 of this appendix A and section III.D.1 of this appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of a bank's exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with the item against which capital is already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the bank's exposure to be converted may be the same or greater than the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of standby letters of credit that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of a customer's loan or debt instrument that is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount. Generally, the full face value of an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount and incorporated in weighted risk assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective risk-based capital requirement. However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute or a recourse transaction (including a transaction reported as a financing on a bank's balance sheet) is limited to the maximum contractual amount of loss to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes the institution if this amount is less than the effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets, or other claim supported by the direct credit substitutes or recourse arrangement. 1. Items with a 100 percent conversion factor. A 100 percent conversion factor applies to direct credit substitutes, which include guarantees, or equivalent instruments, backing financial claims such as outstanding securities, loans, and other financial liabilities, or that back off-balance sheet items that require capital under the risk-based capital framework. Direct credit substitutes include, for example, financial standby letters of credit, or other equivalent irrevocable undertakings or surety arrangements, that guarantee repayment of financial obligations such as: commercial paper, tax-exempt securities, commercial or individual loans or debt obligations, or standby or commercial letters of credit. As described in section III.B.5 of this appendix A, purchases of subordinated securities or of servicing rights may give rise to a direct credit substitute. Direct credit substitutes also include the acquisition of risk participations in bankers acceptances and standby letters of credit, since both of these transactions, in effect, constitute a guarantee by the acquiring bank that the underlying account party (obligor) will repay its obligation to the originating, or issuing, institution. 41 (Standby letters of credit that are performance-related are discussed below and have a credit conversion factor of 50 percent.) 41 Credit-equivalent amounts of acquisitions of risk participations are assigned to the risk category appropriate to the account party obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. The full amount of a bank's exposure under a direct credit substitute is converted at 100 percent and the resulting credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. In the case of a direct credit substitute in which a risk participation 42 has been conveyed, the full amount of the bank's exposure is still converted at 100 percent. However, the credit equivalent amount that has been conveyed is assigned to whichever risk category is lower: the risk category appropriate to the obligor, after giving effect to any relevant guarantees or collateral, or the risk category appropriate to the institution acquiring the participation. Any remainder is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, guarantor, or collateral. For example, the portion of a direct credit substitute conveyed as a risk participation to a U.S. domestic depository institution or foreign bank is assigned to the risk category appropriate to claims guaranteed by those institutions, that is, the 20 percent risk category. 43 This approach recognizes that such conveyances replace the originating bank's exposure to the obligor with an exposure to the institutions acquiring the risk participations. 44 42 That is, a participation in which the originating banking organization remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount of the direct credit substitute if the party that has acquired the participation fails to pay when the instrument is drawn. 43 Risk participations with a remaining maturity of over one year that are conveyed to non-OECD banks are to be assigned to the 100 percent risk category, unless a lower risk category is appropriate to the obligor, guarantor, or collateral. 44 A risk participation in bankers acceptances conveyed to other institutions is also assigned to the risk category appropriate to the institution acquiring the participation or, if relevant, the guarantor or nature of the collateral. In the case of direct credit substitutes that take the form of a syndication as defined in the instructions to the commercial bank Call Report, that is, where each bank is obligated only for its pro rata share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating bank, each bank will only include its pro rata share of its exposure under the direct credit substitute in its risk-based capital calculation.
