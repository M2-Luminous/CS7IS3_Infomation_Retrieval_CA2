FR940414-1-00065 FR940414-1-00010 1. Impact Measures The EIA examines three categories of economic impacts that may result from regulation: Facility closures, conversion of PFPR product lines to non-PFPR operations, and compliance costs in excess of five percent of facility revenue. Facility closure is the most severe of the three impacts evaluated. Consistent with the analysis in other effluent guidelines rulemakings, compliance costs that are less than five percent of facility revenue are judged to be economically achievable (see, for example, the EIAs for effluent limitations for the OCPSF and pesticide manufacturing industries). However, it is assumed that compliance costs equal to five percent or more of facility revenue do not necessarily indicate a significant impact, such as an operational change at a facility. This ratio is counted as a moderate economic impact as a conservative measure of the possibility of such an impact. Projections of these economic impacts are based on economic models that estimate pre- and post-compliance costs, revenues, and quantities for individual facilities. The individual facility impacts are projected using a combination of data from the 1988 Survey Questionnaire and secondary sources (e.g., Robert Morris Associates Annual Statement Studies, Dun and Bradstreet's Million Dollar Directory, Standard and Poor's Price Index Record). In addition, impact projections rely on facility-specific compliance cost estimates developed by the Agency (see Section X of today's notice). Impact projections are first made for surveyed facilities and then extrapolated to the facility population. Facility financial viability is first analyzed in the baseline (pre-compliance) scenario by calculating the three-year after-tax cash flow from the Survey data. If a facility has lost cash on average over the three-year period, the facility is not expected to continue in operation and post-compliance impacts are not evaluated, i.e., the facility is considered to be a baseline closure. 2. Application of the Impact Measures The particular impacts evaluated for a facility are a function of the type of PFPR operations conducted at the facility as well as the percentage of the facility's revenue that is derived from PFPR operations. These characteristics are used as indicators of the likely response of management to compliance costs. The impact measures used in the analysis are discussed below. a. Subcategory C Facilities. Certain PFPR facilities regulated under Subcategory C are expected to be the most likely to consider facility closure as a response to the regulation. In particular, PFPR facilities that also manufacture PAIs and facilities earning a significant percentage of their revenue from PFPR activities are assumed to be the likeliest facilities to consider closure as the alternative to compliance with the regulation. PFPR facilities that also manufacture PAIs (hereafter ``PFPR/Manufacturing facilities'') generally obtain a high percentage of their revenue from PFPR activities. Based on responses to the 1988 Survey questionnaire, the mean percentage of facility revenue from PFPR activities was 54 percent for PFPR/Manufacturing facilities, with a median value of 38 percent. In addition, the manufacturing operations are integrated with the PFPR operations and additional costs may be incurred in manufacturing operations (e.g., tolling costs) if PFPR operations are shut down. Owners of PFPR facilities that do not manufacture PAIs might also consider closing entirely rather than converting their PFPR lines if PFPR activities constitute a substantial portion of their business. The analysis assumes that facilities that obtain at least 25 percent of their revenue from PFPR activities will consider closing entirely. 2 This fairly low percentage of revenue was chosen so that evaluation of the most severe economic impact_facility closure_includes all facilities that might consider this alternative. 2 Ideally, the determination of whether management would consider closing a facility entirely would be based on the percentage of profit, rather than revenue, derived from PFPR activities. However, because costs were not reported for PFPR activities in the Survey, calculation of PFPR profits is not possible. Facilities regulated under Subcategory C that do not manufacture PAIs and that obtain less than 25 percent of their revenue from PFPR activities are expected to respond differently to compliance costs. These facilities frequently engage in the formulating and packaging of many non-pesticide products as well as pesticide products. The facilities are typically not dependant on pesticide FPR, but may include pesticides in the line of many chemical preparations that they formulate, package, and repackage. The production lines are not usually specific to pesticides, but can formulate, package, or repackage a wide range of products. Therefore, the facilities are more likely to consider converting their PFPR lines to produce non-pesticide products than closing the facility or the lines if PFPR production is discontinued. The analysis evaluates whether these facilities would, in fact, be expected to convert their pesticide lines to other formulating/packaging/repackaging operations as a result of the regulation. As an additional measure of economic effects on facilities regulated under Subcategory C, the annualized compliance costs are compared to facility revenue for each facility. As discussed above, projected annualized compliance costs that are less than five percent of facility revenue are taken to indicate that the facility will not experience significant economic impacts. b. Subcategory E Facilities. For refilling establishments, the only economic measure evaluated is compliance costs as a percentage of revenue. Refilling establishments constitute a distinct set of facilities within the PFPR industry. An estimated 47 percent of the facilities potentially covered by the PFPR regulation are classified as Subcategory E facilities. These facilities do not formulate or package pesticides, but maintain at least one bulk storage tank for pesticides and distribute the formulated product in refillable containers to farmers. Most refilling establishments surveyed reported a primary SIC code of # 5191, which characterizes the establishments as ``primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of animal feeds, fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, pesticides, seeds, and other farm supplies, except grains.'' In keeping with this line of business, typical ownership of refilling establishments differs from that of other PFPR facilities. An estimated 29 percent of refilling establishments are owned as a cooperative, e.g., a group of farmers who purchase and distribute pesticide among themselves. (See Table 1.) In contrast, only an estimated two percent of other PFPR facilities have a cooperative form of ownership.
