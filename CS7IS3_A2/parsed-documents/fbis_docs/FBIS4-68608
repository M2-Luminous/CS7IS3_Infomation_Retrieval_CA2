Chibisov: "One Good Turn Deserves Another: From a Selector Conference in the MPS"] [Text] The railroad workers have always distinguished themselves by stability in both work and payment of wages. On some railroads, however, problems have recently arisen. They are permitting delays in their payment. In February, in particular. At the sector's plants --even in the first two months of the year. After all, as O. Moshchenko, RF first deputy minister of Railways, emphasized yesterday at the selector conference devoted to this problem, this is social protection of the railroad workers, the creation of a normal psychological climate in the collectives, material ensurance for transport workers, fulfillment of the Tariff Agreement, etc. At the preceding selector conference (at the beginning of April), G. Fadeyev, minister of Railways discussed this problem in detail. The reasons for the delays were analyzed: there was an increase, at the end of last year, in the growth rate of wages above the level specified by the Tariff Agreement -- over 400 billion rubles [R] was paid out for this alone; the roads failed to carry out shipment of the advance financing limits of the transit mainlines; the proceeds for the shipping roads were not fully recovered as monetary sums. Underlying all this is the large debt for transport. At that time, specific deadlines were slated for settling with the collectives. For example, the wages for February were to be issued by 25 April, and issued for the normal payment periods in June. What is the situation today? While by the beginning of April, the debt for February was 50 percent of the wage volume, today the indicator equals 14 percent. This is on the whole for the Russian network. The picture is different, however, for each road. Most of the mainlines have fully cleared off the debts for wages, but there is BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line] which still has to pay out 30 percent of them, the Transbaykal -- 16, the Far Eastern -- 47, the West Siberian -- 25, and the Sakhalin -- up to 97 percent. The situation among the workers in the social sphere looks somewhat better than among those in the production sphere, although even here not everything is running smoothly. For example, the workers of the sectorial medical institutions are being paid wages only for March, and those employed in the education system -- for February. The state of affairs for the transport plants is particularly alarming. There are enterprises which have not yet even issued their January wages. It will take R23 billion to clear off the two-months debt. Even though the MPS [Ministry of Railways] administration had a preliminary agreement with the roads that they would settle with the plants, practically no steps have been taken to liquidate the debt. It is a question, not of full payment for the goods produced by the enterprises for railroad orders, but of wage payments. The sums here are by no means astronomical. For example, the Volga Railroad owes R400 million, the North Caucasus -- only R30 million, and the October -- R140 million. Small amounts. The roads are holding back the transfers, though, and the plants cannot pay the wages. The main reason for this, of course, is the customers' debt. The measures which the roads take to clear it off -- not letting the customers have rolling stock, appeal to higher courts, jobs according to contracts -- are so far not working in full measure. The indebtedness continues to grow. In the two ten-day periods of April, it increased by 16.2 percent, or by R116.3 billion. It is the mainlines where delay in wage payment is observed that account for a considerable part of it. What are the sources of getting funds for wages? As was emphasized at the conference, various ways must be used to exact money for transport. There are already positive examples in the work of the mainlines. Let us say, the Kuybyshev Railroad concluded a contract with BAM and the Transbaykal to receive payments through supplies of motor vehicles. The Transbaykal and BAM workers sell them, and the money earned is transferred to wages. There are examples of settling with petroleum products and timber materials, with their subsequent sale. At some enterprises of the Southeastern, wages are paid in products and other commodities. In a word, every possibility must be utilized to get funds, so that by June we can make the break-through to paying wages in the normal periods of time.
