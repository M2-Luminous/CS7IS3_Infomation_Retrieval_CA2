Rebas announced that he had started to gather information on the subject after resigning from the minister's post. The conversion of the military industry in Russia has never been more than a propaganda move, he claimed, adding that modern weaponry is constantly being produced in addition to existing stockpiles or armament. The military industry has suffered relatively less from the industrial decline than the non-military production, Rebas told the audience and added that the development and production of biological and chemical weapons is going on, despite high-level denials. The ex-minister stressed the influence of the military-industrial complex on the Russian politics, mentioning the organisations joining the defence industry, their representatives in the government circles and in the parliament. Russia has given priority to the military industry and adopted expansionist foreign policy, Rebas said. He warned that the people in Russia are willing to adopt aggressive ideas and stressed the need to explain the situation more efficiently in the Western countries.
