If extended, it will be the first large loan made to a subsidiary of the group since the inauguration of the current government, which has had strained relations with the group. The syndicated loan will be extended to Hyundai Petrochemical Co. by Boram Bank, Korea Long-Term Credit Bank, Kwangju Bank and KKBC International, Ltd., financial sources said yesterday. The four institutions together will extend the company the loan composed of 87.6 billion won in Korean won and the remaining sum in U.S. dollars. The Korean currency portion of the syndicated loan will carry an annual interest rate of 12.4 percent and be paid back in installments over four years after a three-year grace period. Hyundai Petrochemical Co. will pay back the U.S. dollar fraction carrying an annual interest of 4.7 percent over five and a half years after two and a half years of deferment of interest and principal payments, the sources said. The company reportedly plans to use the money in importing capital goods and setting up a synthetic rubber plant in a petrochemical complex on the western coastal area of Taesan, South Chungchong Province. The financial sources pointed out that despite the signing of the contract, it remains to be seen whether Hyundai will actually borrow money from the institutions. Initially, the group contacted the state-owned Korea Development Bank [KDB] for an investment loan for expanding the petrochemical company but was rejected. Speculation was rampant that the government had ordered KDB to turn down Hyundai's request for political reasons. Hyundai allegedly failed to get the loan because Chong Chu-yong, founder and honorary chairman of Hyundai Group, angered President Kim Yong-sam during the 1992 presidential election campaign by vilifying him. Meanwhile, Chong announced in a news conference Tuesday that he would not interfere in the management of Hyundai Group and will devote himself to managing his mammoth farm on reclaimed land in Sosan, South Chungchong Province. The presidential office of Chongwadae was reportedly dissatisfied with Chong's announcement and the financial sources presumed it is still unclear whether Hyundai will get the loan. The four financial institutions, however, said that they had signed the loan contract independent of the political circle. The loan contract, the sources said, provides ample grist for the rumor mill that local banks and nonbank financial institutions have lifted their restrictions on loans to the conglomerate.
