The operating principle and the design of the instrument are described and its principal technical specifications are given. Hardware and software were developed which ensure the necessary operating modes and instrument automation, control of the measurement process and documentation of the results. A key part of the outfit is an IBM PC-XT personal computer with a universal controller. Programs ensure proper conditions for photometric measurement of the sample (changing the angular coordinate and direction of rotation of the sample relative to its initial position, supplying values of the accompanying angular coordinates, interval of change of angle and number of executed intervals), as well as implementation of the procedure of collecting and processing of measurement data and ensuring the proper number of readings to be used in averaging the signals of the photoreception system for attaining the necessary reproducibility of the results. The results in the form of scattering diagrams are represented on a display screen and are printed out. The results of study of the scattering diagrams of a rough metallic surface at wavelengths 0.65 and 10.6 �m and MS14 milk glass at scattering angles 64 and 104� are compared.
