"Polet" relies mainly on the "Cosmos" rocket, which is capable of lifting large numbers of satellites into orbit for a variety of purposes. Evidence from independent European experts testifies to the rocket's high class: Only 19 failures in 700 launches is one of the world's best records. The Russian rocket has a further advantage -- it is cheaper than foreign counterparts. All the same, it will not be easy to find buyers. The West dictates its own policy in the space commercial services market.
