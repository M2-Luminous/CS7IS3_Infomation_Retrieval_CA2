General manager of the company Mr. Li Yumin said that he hoped the restructuring of the company's international opeations would help China's insurance business move in step with its international counterparts as soon as possible. The move is considered as a preparation in the insurance sector for the restoration of China's signatory status to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. According to the document, the company will to some extent allow autonomy to its branches for various measures to be adopted in accordance with their own business situation. The branches are free to implement measures in terms of insurance charge rate, insurance provisions and insurance cost while at the same time being responsible to the parent company in terms of profit, insurance premiums and indemnity. If a branch fulfills a particular set target, then it will be given a reward or a penalty if the case is the oposite. Mr Li said that he hoped this practice would help increase the revenue from premiums by 15 percent this year compared with that in the year before. The insurance company founded on October 20, 1949 has an employment of 110,000 and premium revenue was RMB 49.96 billion [renminbi] last year, 35.6 percent up over the previous year. The total amount in indemnities paid at home and broad was valued at RMB 27.85 billion.
