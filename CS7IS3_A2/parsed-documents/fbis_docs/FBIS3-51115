The meeting began at 0830 sharp with almost perfect attendance. The only person missing was the head of the Argentine Rural Society, Eduardo de Zavalia, who--as his peers explained later--could not postpone an already scheduled trip to Brazil. Consequently, those attending were: Jorge Blanco Villegas (Argentine Industrial Union); Roberto Sanmartino (Argentine Union of Construction Enterprises); Monir Madcur (Argentine Construction Board); and Jorge Berardi (Commodity Exchange). Other members of the delegation were: Francisco Macri (Association of Automotive Manufacturers); Jorge di Fiori (Argentine Chamber of Commerce); Osvaldo Cornide (Coordinating Agency for Commercial Activities); and Eduardo Escassany (Banking Association of Buenos Aires). The meeting lasted until exactly 0940, enough time for just one round of coffee or tea and pastries, and a short individual explanation of the benefits of this political accord for the economic future. On that point, nobody heard or said anything different from what was stated last Monday, when these associations expressed their approval of Menem and Alfonsin's handshake the day before, thus opening the way toward constitutional reform. Some of them, like Macri and Madcur, expressed hope that in the midterm period this consensus would move to the economic terrain in a more effective manner, but both Bauza and the other business leaders hastened to recommend that "for now it is better not to introduce points of disagreement." What was explicitly stated was a request from the secretary general to his visitors: help drum up support for the reform bill, not only among the business community, but also by speaking out to help mitigate points of resistance in public opinion. The businessmen agreed to do so, and some even said they would call upon their contacts among the Radicals to persuade the most reluctant leaders about this before the party convention on 3 December so that the convention will give a mandate to the UCR [Radical Civic Union] deputies to vote for the reform as a way to strengthen the agreement. At about the middle of the meeting, Bauza let drop a phrase that sounded more like a suggestion than a question: "Are you also going to meet with Alfonsin to show him your satisfaction with the agreement?" he asked. The businessmen had actually already discussed that possibility, but it was a cause of some controversy. It seems that some of the leaders are more "pro-Menem" than others. They are the ones who said that "it is not necessary" to have a meeting with the former president, for the simple reason that--at least for now--they did not visit Carlos Menem. On the other side were those who believe the meeting with the Radical leader "is appropriate" in order to maintain balance in a situation like the one that brought them together yesterday. It now seems that this view has carried the day, since some of them assured CLARIN that the meeting with Alfonsin "will take place this week." The moment of tension that arose in that part of the meeting was quickly dissipated. Bauza himself eased the climate by telling stories about the conclusion of the negotiations at Olivos. All the businessmen said yesterday they had not been brought together by Bauza, but that the meeting had been arranged at the spontaneous initiative of some of the business leaders. "We set it up with three or four telephone calls," they explained. Still, it was obvious that the personal intervention of the secretary general had a great deal to do with the holding of the meeting (see following section). However, reports about the meeting that this newspaper heard did not agree on one fairly important point. The majority of those contacted said they were attending the meeting representing their respective groups. Bauza Seeks Supporters The breakfast meeting between Eduardo Bauza and Argentina's top business leaders did not come about spontaneously. The operation that ended with the visitors' public "approval" of the Olivos pact was the result of a political operation that began on the very day the private meeting between Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin came to light. After the political stir aroused by the announcement of this first summit meeting, Alfonsin was not the only one who had to close ranks among his supporters. While the government did not need to line up its troops behind the accord, its principal operators did have to smooth things over with their economic and political associates who had been left on the sidelines by this maneuver. So the secretary general of the presidency did not hesitate to telephone some of the friends of the government in the business community. On that same Monday when the news broke, a few privileged people began to hear in advance about the negotiations with the opposition. Bauza, in some way, wanted to resume the code of mutual "information loyalty" that they owed to each other. Menem's preferred operator had begun a painstaking effort with the sector as soon as he entered his present office. It was he who had assigned the secretary of legal and technical affairs, Carlos Corach, the task of holding luncheon meetings once a week with a business group. Starting on Monday, 7 (November) [as published], the circle of businessmen who were kept informed expanded daily along with the amount of news published. Bauza's final move toward the business establishment came on the very day of the accord. On that night Bauza gave up the roast lamb awaiting him at the home of Hugo Anzorreguy to tell, by telephone, the details of the meeting to the group of the elect. Between one dialogue and the other, they mutually arranged yesterday's meeting. In fact, the breakfast meeting was a way of returning mutual favors. For Bauza, it was because he thus became the favored contact of the business groups (a by no means inconsiderable factor in the government), and for the visitors, it was because they could demonstrate that the renowned national business community was not left "out in the cold" from a political accord that may go down in the history books.
