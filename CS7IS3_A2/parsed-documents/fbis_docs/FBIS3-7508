(NTT) shares is false, an investment consultant said Tuesday [29 March]. Hosokawa has told the Diet that he only helped his father-in-law buy the shares by putting up a condominium as collateral to finance the purchase. But "the NTT share transaction is what Prime Minister Hosokawa himself asked for. His father-in-law only allowed his name to be used by Hosokawa for the transaction," the 60-year-old consultant said on condition of anonymity. The consultant told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he himself recommended the NTT share purchase to Hosokawa via one of Hosokawa's aides. He said he is willing to testify before the Diet about his allegations. Hosokawa's father-in-law, Shohei Ueda, the father of Hosokawa's wife, Kayoko, died last May. The premier has repeatedly told the Diet he merely complied with his father-in-law's request to put up his own condominium as collateral to secure a loan to finance the NTT share purchase. He has said he financed the purchase of the condominium in Tokyo's Motoazabu area with part of a 100 million yen loan he borrowed in 1982 from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking group, a company at the center of a money-and-mob scandal. Japan Communist Party legislator Zenmei Matsumoto said he would press Hosokawa during Wednesday's parliamentary session to account for the inconsistency between the premier's statements and the consultant's allegations. Hosokawa's political office said, "the transaction is a legal economic activity taken by the premier's father-in-law and the premier himself did not initiate the deal." The consultant said he approached the aide of then Kumamoto Gov. Hosokawa in the fall of 1986 with an offer to act as an intermediary for acquiring NTT shares, before NTT solicited bids for its shares for the first time on October 4, 1986. He said Hosokawa expressed his willingness to tender his bids for the shares after the aide explained about NTT share investment in a conversation in early September of that year at the governor's office. The aide and the consultant introduced Masatoshi Miyama, Hosokawa's top financial secretary, to a Tokyo-based stock investment financing company, he said. Miyama offered to borrow the money for the share purchase in the name of Hosokawa's father-in-law, he said. The financing contract called for putting up both the NTT shares and the premier's condominium as collateral, he said. The Hosokawa side succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares for which he had submitted bids. Six months after NTT floated the shares on the Tokyo stock exchange in February 1987, Miyama sold off 199 of the shares, raking in handsome profits, he said. Even after Hosokawa repaid the funds borrowed for the share purchase, he ended up securing a net investment profit of some 50 million yen, he said. Miyama broke a promise to have the consultant dictate the timing of any selloff of NTT shares, while giving the consultant 10 percent of the net profit from the sell-offs, he said. The consultant obtained only part of what Hosokawa's camp had agreed to pay to him, he said. The consultant said he cannot identify who first conveyed the investment offer to Hosokawa "to prevent the publicity from causing annoyances" to the aide.
