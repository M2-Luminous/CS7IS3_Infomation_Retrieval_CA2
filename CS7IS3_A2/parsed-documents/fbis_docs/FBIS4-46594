There is an automatic system for restriction and warning about moving to threshold regimes. The Tu-160 is equipped with a hose/cone aerial refuelling system. When not in use, the boom retracts into a compartment ahead of the pilots' cockpit in the fuselage nose. Initially, when Il-78 and 3M tanker aircraft were equipped with an aerial refuelling system having a heavy cone, a massive "firing" boom was installed in the bomber, but since the appearance of lighter cones, the Tu-160 has had lightweight booms of a simpler design since 1988. An option also examined at Air Force insistence was that of outfitting the aircraft with a nonretractable boom accommodated in the slightly upturned fuselage nose (as in the 3M), but such a solution subsequently was rejected. The bomber is equipped with a sighting and navigation system supporting automatic flight and combat employment. This includes a number of systems and sensors which permit engaging ground targets regardless of time of day, region or weather conditions. An inertial navigation system, astronavigation system, satellite navigation system, multichannel digital communications system and developed ECM system are installed. The latter permits detecting enemy radars in a wide band and conducting active and passive jamming. The navigation and fire control radar mounted in the fuselage nose has a parabolic antenna and is capable of detecting large naval and ground radar-signature targets at a great distance. There is an electro-optical bombsight supporting high-accuracy bombing under daylight conditions and with a low level of illumination. The tail cone accommodates numerous pods with decoy flares and chaff. A thermal direction finder which detects enemy missiles and aircraft approaching from the rear hemisphere is in the extreme rear of the fuselage. The overall number of digital processors aboard the aircraft exceeds 100. The navigator workstation is equipped with eight digital computers. The pilots' cockpit is equipped with standard electromechanical instruments similar to those installed in the Tu-22M3 bomber, but the aircraft is controlled not with the help of the control yoke traditional for heavy aircraft, but by means of a "fighter" type of stick (the Tu-160 largely is obligated for the control stick's appearance to Reshetnikov, who helped convince numerous "conservatives" of the benefit of using it on a heavy bomber). The Tu-160 armament is located in two large fuselage bays and may include a wide assortment of guided missiles, guided and free fall bombs, as well as other weapons both with nuclear as well as conventional filling. This permits using the aircraft against essentially all types of ground and naval targets. Missile armament includes up to 12 Kh-55 cruise missiles created in the Raduga MKB [Design Bureau] and accommodated in two rotary launchers. The cruise missiles are for engaging stationary targets with preset coordinates, input to the cruise missile "memory" before the bomber takes off. The Kh-15 aeroballistic missile may be included in the armament for engaging targets of no lesser range. An antiship version of this missile with a radar homing system operating in the millimeter band and an antiradar version with passive homing have been developed. Use of other types of advanced missile weapons also is possible. Bomb armament of the Tu-160 bomber is viewed as a "second priority" weapon intended for engaging targets remaining after a first missile strike by the bomber. It also is accommodated in the weapons bay and may include various types of guided bombs, including the most powerful domestic munitions of this class--series KAB-1500 with a caliber of 1,500 kg. The aircraft also can be equipped with free fall (including nuclear) bombs of various caliber, expendable cluster bomb dispensers, sea mines and other armament. One possible area of employing the Tu-160 is to use it in the Burlak system intended for inserting light satellites into near-earth orbit. A need for such satellites may arise in the course of combat operations in case the enemy succeeds in destroying or substantially weakening the orbital grouping and the Baykonur and Plesetsk space launch facilities have been knocked out. In addition, Burlak has enormous potential for commercial use for launching domestic and foreign satellites for the most varied purposes. The system consists of the Tu-160 platform aircraft and a solid-propellant cruise missile being created in the Raduga MBK [sic; probably MKB]. Burlak Aircraft System Characteristics Weight of payload to be inserted into low circular orbits, kg: polar 300-500 equatorial 500-700 Weight of payload to be inserted into circular orbits 1,000 km high or elliptical orbits (perigee 200 km, apogee 8,500 km), kg: polar 50-150 equatorial 120-220 Maximum payload dimensions, m: 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.2 Volume of payload bay, m[.sup]3[/] 1.75. Employing the aircraft system precludes the need for creating new costly ranges and ground launch complexes or leasing existing ones. It supports formation of an orbit in practically any plane and launches from any place on earth suitable from the standpoint of safety regardless of time of day and climatic and weather conditions. Compared with traditional launch vehicles, specific energy costs for launching an equivalent payload are reduced by 2-3 times and the unfavorable effect on ecology is diminished. Equipment for preparing the missile and system are autonomous and mobile and support prompt launch of a mission-specific payload. Despite very major achievements of domestic designers in creating bombers, our country's Long-Range Aviation has remained a very small component of the strategic nuclear triad for many years. When the START I Agreement was concluded in 1991, the USSR had 162 strategic bombers carrying 855 nuclear weapons, which was 8.3 percent of the overall number (10,271) of the USSR's nuclear weapons. Heavy bombers in the U.S. strategic forces always were given a substantially greater role: in that same 1991 the United States had 574 heavy bombers with 2,353 nuclear weapons (22.3 percent), i.e., aviation had approximately the very same weight as ICBM's, although it was behind submarine missile forces. But the situation may change substantially in case of realization of the START II Treaty, which provides for a radical restructuring of strategic nuclear forces. This inevitably will involve an increase in the role of heavy bombers in the country's defense system (by 2003 the limit for bombers will be 750-1,250 nuclear weapons, with 3,000-3,500 nuclear weapons overall). While the main emphasis previously was placed on creating weapons intended for combating the main potential enemy, the United States, now various scenarios of armed conflicts are being examined, and it is not a nuclear "apocalypse" that appears most likely, but limited local wars. In this case Long-Range Aviation remains the only part of the strategic triad capable of universal employment (using both nuclear as well as conventional weapons), which significantly elevates its role. The domestic and foreign press has noted that the Tu-160 presently is the most powerful strike aircraft in the world. One can become convinced of the soundness of these assertions by comparing it with the U.S. analogue, the Rockwell B-1B strategic bomber. The common feature of fourth-generation aircraft is the integrated aerodynamic configuration distinguished by the smooth joining of wing and fuselage, which because of its unquestionable advantages (increased aerodynamic efficiency, increased internal volumes, a decrease in the area flowed around and in radar cross-section) has become widespread in modern combat aviation. It also was adopted for many fighters of the 1970's and 1980's (Su-27, MiG-29, G-16, F/A-18). The closeness of requirements (possibility of penetrating enemy air defense at low altitude and transonic speed and at high altitude and supersonic speed while providing intercontinental flight range and a considerable combat payload) predetermined the choice for both aircraft of a variable-geometry wing supporting multiple-regime flight [mnogorezhimnost poleta]. But their similarity ends with these configuration features common to both aircraft. The Tu-160 is considerably heavier than the U.S. aircraft (maximum takeoff weight 275 t compared with 216 t of the B-1B) and possesses a much greater maximum load-carrying capacity (design weight of combat payload in weapons bays is 45 t as against 34 t for the B-1B). A certain advantage of the Tu-160 in specific weight indicators of thrust-to-weight ratio also leads to better specifications and performance characteristics: it has a greater flight range (12,300 km compared with the B-1B's 10,400 km). It should be taken into account that the Tu-160 has a high supersonic flight speed at which it is capable of flying for a lengthy time, while the maximum Mach number for the B-1B is reduced to 1.25 because of the rejection of variable-geometry intakes and a decrease in the proportion (by weight) of titanium alloys in the construction from 21 to 17.6 percent. In the assessment of Russian Air Force Commander P. S. Deynekin, expressed in a conversation with the authors, maneuverability and controllability characteristics of the B-1B and Tu-160 aircraft are approximately identical. The "empty" B-1B (with a takeoff weight of around 150 t) in which Deynekin flew in the United States made sharp turns with up to a 40� bank and a steep climb and descent. But in the commander's words, it also would have been possible to fly a Tu-160 with an incomplete fuel load in a similar manner. Advantages of the Tupolev aircraft were dictated by a number of its fundamental design features. In contrast to the B-1B, which uses a system of supplementary moving airfoil surfaces in the aircraft nose for damping elastic vibrations of the fuselage in the pitch plane when flying in a turbulent atmosphere, there is no need for such devices in the Tu-160. Increased rigidity of the aircraft's construction is achieved through a lesser elongation of the nose with developed wing root leading-edge extensions. Realization of an original wheel well configuration--without disturbing the fuselage's load-bearing unit, while in the B-1 the fuselage is greatly weakened (in the figurative expression of aircraft chief designer V. I. Bliznyuk, it is "cut in half" by the wheel compartments)--permitted getting by without using a supplementary electronic system. The increased resonance of joints for rotating the Tu-160's moving wing panels (the relative length of the center section beam is 0.25 with unfolded wing compared with 0.19 for the B-1B) reduces trim losses at transonic speeds as a result of a lesser shift of the center of aerodynamic pressure when reversing the wing. Use of an electro-remote control system in the Tu-160 provides a fundamental capability to reduce trim losses even more by reducing the aircraft's static stability. In creating the Tu-160 and B-1B, designers were given the task of sharply reducing radar cross-section, the main indicator of radar signature. But while the United States sacrificed a number of very important performance characteristics for the sake of this (above all speed, which turned the bomber from supersonic to transonic), the Tupolev firm achieved similar results without "worsening" the aircraft. In contrast to the air intake with S-shaped baffles used in the B-1B, an ordinary variable-geometry intake was installed in the Tu-160, providing high characteristics in all flight configurations, and radar cross-section was reduced by using "low-signature" engines. A reduction in radar signature also is facilitated by a more "integrated" configuration (from a front view, the Tu-160's lines resemble the U.S. Northrop B-2 low-signature aircraft), a cockpit not extending beyond fuselage lines (in the B-1B it is situated above the wheel wells and forms a unique hump in the aircraft nose section), and an all-moving fin (the slot formed between the B-1B vertical tail and rudder provides an additional splash of reflected radar emission). Armament of the bombers also differs substantially. The Tu-160 is capable of carrying a wide assortment of both nuclear as well as conventional munitions (guided and unguided). The presence of an optical bombsight provides high precision of high-altitude bombing. The B-1B presently is equipped only for delivering B-61 and B-83 nuclear free fall bombs. The SRAM short-range guided missile was removed from the armament since storage periods of solid-propellant rocket motors had expired, and work on the SRAM II advanced missile stopped in 1991. It has been written repeatedly that the B-1B is capable of carrying ALCM cruise missiles. It fact, tests were conducted confirming the possibility of accommodating such weapons on the aircraft, but as of the present time the B-1B bomber fleet does not have the necessary equipment permitting use of cruise missiles. (A large amount of additional funds, which the U.S. Defense Department does not have, is required to manufacture such equipment and install it in the aircraft.) Only in 1991 did the U.S. Air Force begin work to arm the B-1B with conventional 225 kg free fall bombs. The B-1B can perform only "carpet" bombing of areas because of the absence of an optical bombsight. At the same time, the U.S. aircraft has more sophisticated cockpit instrumentation, particularly monochron CRT indicators installed in front of each pilot, which makes flying the aircraft easier, especially in low-altitude flight. Comparing the Tu-160 and B-1B, it is impossible to ignore the higher engineering professionalism and elegance of design of the Tupolev aircraft, which favorably distinguish it from the Rockwell creation. Thus, the deflecting root sections of flaps, which provide smooth joining of the rotating and stationary parts of the wing, improve aircraft aerodynamics when flying at high speeds by performing the role of additional fins. In a cruising regime they form a smooth transition between wing surfaces, ideal from the standpoint of aerodynamics and radar signature. This elegant, clever solution contrasts with the cumbersome, "nonaerodynamic" system of joining used by the Americans and including hideous (from an aesthetic standpoint) deflecting panels and complicated and not very reliable seals. In general, in the authors' opinion, a unique "superiority complex" (in the good sense of this word) was displayed in creating the Tu-160, which formed in the best part of the engineering design corps of the OKB [Special Design Bureau] imeni A. N. Tupolev (a rather rare quality for our days). The multiple-regime combat aircraft, harmoniously combining low signature with high performance characteristics and powerful defensive and offensive weapons, has good chances of "surviving" in the skies of the early 21st century. It is obvious that of all the strategic supersonic bombers created as of the present time, specifically the Tu-160 most approaches the ideal of such an aircraft.
