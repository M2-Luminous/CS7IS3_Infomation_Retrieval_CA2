Identification of Commodity Status Groups 1. Cargoes identified by the Cargo Classification Working Group of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) as possibly inactive. These entries may also appear in Coast Guard tables and lists. If so, this is indicated by additional commodity status group number(s). 2. Entries that appear in Table 30.25&hyph;1, Parts 30&hyph;40. Where the Coast Guard has reason to believe the entry is a lube oil additive or a lube oil additive component, it is identified with ``(LOA)''.
