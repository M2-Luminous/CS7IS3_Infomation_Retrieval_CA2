The Rumble of Boots: Vivid Episodes From Market Competition"] [Text] Although the Russian market in plastic money will be 25 years old this year, the stormiest events in it did not unfold until 1992-1993, when real competition among payment systems and numerous commercial structures emerged here. And in literally the past few months the competition in the Russian electronic-payments market has developed into an open conflict in which both sides have conducted themselves fairly toughly and the plot of the conflict has taken on the qualities of a detective story. The Story of Plastic Money in Russia: Pain Over Rights "My wife's credit card was stolen." "Did you put a stop on the account?" "No, I'm pleased: the thief is spending much less!" (A bourgeois joke) The pioneers in developing the Russian consumer-payments market were Diners Club International (which, incidentally, in 1950 put out the world's first international credit card) and American Express. In 1969 they signed an agency agreement with the State Committee for Foreign Tourism in the person of its commercial arm, the Inturist All-Union Joint-Stock Company, for servicing those payment systems' credit cards; that is, the joint-stock company became those systems servicing agent. In 1974 an analogous agreement was concluded with VISA International, in 1975 one was signed with Eurocard/Mastercard, and in 1986 one was signed with JCB International. During the entire time that agency rights to the servicing of credit cards belonged to the Inturist All-Union Joint-Stock Company, the entire technical side of the work was handled by a credit-card group operating under the State Committee for Foreign Tourism, and commercial settlements were carried out on behalf of Inturist through the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Activity. At the end of 1987, in accordance with new legislation, the Inturservis All-Union (naturally!) Economic-Accountability (absolutely essential!) VTO [Foreign Trade Association] (subsequently All-Union Joint-Stock Company] was founded, and Inturist's agency rights with respect to all payment systems were transferred to it. A special subsidiary company, Inturkreditkart, was set up for the technical servicing of payments. Igor Fedorov became head of the main company, and Aleksandr Kapustin started working in the subsidiary (we will encounter their names again more than once). And this is when the first intrigues in the Russian "plastic" market began, intrigues which illuminate by reflected light many years of competition among international payment systems on the remaining five-sixths (or approximately that much) of the globe. In January 1988 VISA International elected the Inturist All-Union Joint-Stock Company as a member possessing basic rights (including the right of emission), despite the fact that the joint-stock company was not a banking institution. When this was done, Inturservis was recognized as a managing agent of Inturist. In response, Eurocard (subsequently Europay) elected the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Activity as its member. Beginning in November 1988, Inturservis started exercising Inturist's membership rights, concluding direct contracts with trade enterprises dealing in foreign exchange (and this was just the time when they were undergoing a development boom). At the same time, the servicing of all payments continued to be carried out exclusively through the Inturservis processing center, which at that time was the only agency in Russia that had the requisite software, hardware and personnel to handle the complete cycle of servicing "plastic" payments: the processing of credit cards, the confirmation of purchases and verification of account balances, the conversion of the payment into electronic form and computer connections with the payment system, the handling of the payment disbursal, and the offsetting of client's payments between banks. The present stage in the development of the Russian "plastic money" market began in September 1991, when Kredo Bank, which was accepted as a VISA International member in 1990, started offering VISA cards in Russia. Later Most [Bridge] Bank, Inkombank and Mosbiznesbank started carrying out programs to issue VISA cards, while the Inturservis processing center continued to service payments made with their cards. In 1992, after the sole Russian member of Europay International, the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Activity, ceased its banking activity in November 1991, Europay International started to accept other Russian banks as members, among which the most active became Most-bank (to which the personnel that had been working with credit cards in the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Activity transferred) and Dialog Bank. In the meantime, Kredo Bank, Most Bank and Dialog Bank--the first three banks to become members of both VISA International and Europay International--proposed to Inturservis that it divide its business in servicing VISA and Europay credit cards into two parts. However, the negotiations proved unsuccessful, since it is possible to transfer agency rights, but rather difficult to divide a processing center and its personnel. Then the banks decided to found another processing center, Kardtsentr [Card Center], which was to be only for the Europay system. Naturally, that undertaking received the active support of Europay international, since Inturservis had historically received the support of VISA International. Then Kredo Bank, however, decided (we do not rule out the possibility that it did so under the influence of the fairly jealous VISA International) not to take part in Kardtsentr, and, joining with Inturservis, on 11 November 1992 it founded the United Card Service Joint-Stock Company (UCS), the Russian version of whose name was United Credit Card Company--KOKK (for more detail, see the following section of the article). Aleksandr Kapustin became the president of UCS, and Yuriy Agapov became chairman of the board. In January 1993 authority to carry out Inturservis's activities in the area of "plastic" payments was transferred to UCS (for $900,000). That is how two processing centers emerged in the market, while UCS has so far retained an exclusive position with respect to the processing of VISA, Diners Club and JCB cards. At the same time, payments with Europay cards can be serviced by both UCS and Kardtsentr. To give a more complete picture, it should be added that in 1993 many national card-payment programs started to be implemented--STB, Olbi, Ortcard, Most-card and Union Card. However, because these cards are mainly connected with ruble accounts, and no connection with external payment systems is required for servicing them, the processing of these cards is usually carried out by their issuers' own processing centers (for more detail, see KOMMERSANT No. 33, 23 August 1993). Once again, to give a more complete picture, let us also mention the American Express company, which has not taken any part in the conflicts that we are going to relate: at the beginning of 1992 American Express began to terminate, de facto, the fulfillment of its existing agency agreement with Inturservis, and by the end of the year all of Inturservis's contracts with enterprises for the servicing of payments made with the American Express card were transferred to American Express (Russia) Ltd., which assumed functions related to the technical servicing of payments. A Classic Capitalist Conflict: Kredo and Most Divide Their Property But Do Not Divide Their Market and Management "Filled with agitation, I undid your corset-- You ran away laughing, While I stood there pondering...." Count Aleksey Tolstoy And so, by the fall of 1993 the UCS company was a joint-stock company with authorized capital of $1 million, in which 49 percent of the shares belonged to the Inturservis All-Russian Joint Stock Company--the owner of agency rights for all payment systems--while 39 percent belonged to Kredo Bank (through which all payments serviced through UCS passed), and 12 percent belonged to the joint Finnish-British company Inpass Ltd. In the latter, 50 percent each of the shares belonged to the Finnish Okobank, through which VISA payments passed after going through Kredo, and to the British company CardTec Ltd, which develops hardware for the credit card business. In our view, a fateful role in the subsequent development of events was played by the public disclosure of plans for the reorganization of UCS, plans which had been jointly developed by the joint-stock companies. (The presentation of UCS stockholders' new policy took place on 28 September--see KOMMERSANT No. 39, 4 October 1993). According to the strategy that had been developed, the Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company was supposed to transfer its exclusive contracts with enterprises for VISA and Europay cards to the Russian banking sector, leaving UCS (or its successor) only rights and contracts to service Diners Club and JCB cards. For this purpose, Russian banks that were VISA members were supposed to establish, on the basis of equal rights, a new Viza Rossiya Servis (VRS) company, to which the Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company's contracts--but only contracts pertaining to VISA cards--were supposed to be transferred. (It must be noted that in most countries national bank associations that are members of international payments systems have long since been established.) At the same time, according to the plan, all technical operations related to the servicing of credit cards would continue to be carried out by UCS (on the basis of a service agreement with VRS). On the other hand, the Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company was supposed to transfer contracts for Europay cards to Kredo Bank--either permanently or until such time as an agreement was concluded to establish for Europay cards an organization analogous to Viza Rossiya Servis (that is, a national association), to which all rights for the servicing of cards would be transferred. In and of itself, this latter circumstance gave Kredo certain potential advantages in the "plastic money" market, at least until such time as a Europay national association was established. However, what was key in the new strategy was not even that, but the point according to which, until Russian Europay member-banks had been granted the right to utilize the technical services of UCS along with the services of Kardtsentr, VRS members would not be allowed to seek the services of Kardtsentr for servicing the cards of Europay and other systems (in the event that Kardtsentr started working with systems other than Europay). There are grounds for assuming that this point was included in the UCS program as a countermove after it became known that Europay International was pressuring the Russian Europay member-banks to obtain a provision whereby Kardtsentr for three years would not provide services to trade enterprises that had agreements with VISA. We learned of the existence of such pressure and of attempts on the part of Europay to "use force to impose exclusivity" from [Piter Derbi], the president of Dialog Bank, which is one of the founders of Kardtsentr (See CARDS INTERNATIONAL, No. 93, 6 September 1993). In this connection, it is indisputable that the UCS technical exclusivity proposed for the members of Viza Rossiya Servis would have substantially graver consequences for the affairs of Kardtsentr than Kardtsentr's technical exclusivity would have for the future of UCS. Faced with the necessity of choosing, both processing centers' clients would more likely choose UCS--by virtue of the greater work experience contributed to UCS by Inturservis. Naturally, diametrically opposite opinions exist with respect to the quality and efficiency of Kardtsentr's work. They range from the opinion set forth in an open letter from Kardtsentr's founders to the officers of UCS (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 14 August 1993), to that expressed by Fedor Naumov, the head of Inkombank's credit card department, who left Kardtsentr: "They have existed for 13 months now and have not yet done anything. Conducting affairs that way is a mockery of banks (see EAST EUROPEAN BANKER, No. 35, September 1993). However, even Dmitriy Alekhin, Kardtsentr's managing director, has said the following: "We started with nothing, and in order to provide high-class services and compete with UCS, we need not only technology but experience ... at present we are not yet ready" (see EAST EUROPEAN BANKER, No. 35, September 1993). In other words, after the presentation of the UCS's stockholders's agreement, the situation required decisive actions from the active members of Kardtsentr, if only to preserve the status quo in the credit-card servicing market, especially for the servicing of the deeply kindred Europay cards. Open Letter From Bankers (August 1993) on the Utility of Honest Competition To Mr A. V. Kapustin, General Director of KOKK Mr I. A. Fedorov, Chairman of the Board of the Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company Mr Yu. V. Agapov, President of Kredo Bank Mr I. V. Lipanov, Vice-President of Kredo Bank Lately the mass media have carried invalid reports aimed at discrediting the activities of the Kardtsentr Joint-Stock Company, whose founders are a group of Russian banks. We regard these publications as the manifestation of unscrupulous competition and profoundly regret that such methods are becoming common in Russian banking practice. As founders of Kardtsentr who have an interest in the successful development in our country of a civilized system of settlements employing plastic cards, we propose to you in the future to wage competition in the financial services market by other means, namely: by means of the quality of services provided to clients, the speed with which settlements are made, and attractive prices for services provided. We sincerely desire interaction and cooperation and hope that such unseemly occurrences will not happen in the future. [Signed] President of the National Credit Bank O. Boyko President of the Stolichnyy Bank A. Smolenskiy President of Most Bank V. Gusinskiy President of Elbim Bank S. Morozov President of Yugorskiy Bank O. Kantor The first round of the counterintrigue developed according to a perfectly capitalist scenario: in October-November of last year, Most Bank entered into negotiations with Inturservis for the purchase of its block of 49 percent of UCS stock. The ground for negotiations had been prepared by the expression of a willingness (within the framework of the UCS stockholders' strategic agreement) to give up the rights to servicing credit cards. Inturservis seemingly let it be known that it was prepared to quit the "plastic market." Indeed, in the past few years the alignment of forces has changed substantially, and the Inturist system has ceased to be the principal source of "plastic" payments in Russia. However, Igor Fedorov, president of the Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company, naturally wanted to get a good "indemnity." To do so he wanted, first of all, to sell the entire block of stock as a whole (without breaking it up), and second, to do so on a competitive basis. Consequently, Inkombank, which is active in issuing VISA cards, entered into a fight with Mosbank for the Inturservis bloc of UCS stock. Because of purely technical circumstances, Inkombank dropped out of the competition, but in the course of bidding it raised the acquisition price to $2.3 million, that is to nearly 4.7 times the nominal value. Toward the beginning of December Igor Fedorov concluded a contract with Most Bank, received money for the bloc of UCS stock, and seemingly offhandedly informed the UCS board about it (directly int he course of a board meeting). The Gogolian tableau vivant was unexpectedly interrupted by Mr [Pekka Khonkanen], president of Inpass Ltd. With purely Scandinavian imperturbability he announced that Most Bank had also offered to buy his 12 percent of UCS shares--for good money. The reaction of Kredo Bank's representatives on the UCS board was instantaneous--they immediately (at the board meeting) made Mr [Khonkanen] an offer that he couldn't refuse. Realizing that haggling was inappropriate in this case, he took about $560,000 for his 12 percent, that is, the same 4.7 times the nominal value. Consequently, as of 3 December UCS became the joint property of Kredo Bank, whose 51 percent had cost it less than $1 million, and Most Bank, which had paid $2.3 million for 49 percent of the stock. And Igor Fedorov and [Pekka Khonkanen] evidently remained extremely pleased with themselves--the securities in which they had invested had brought their companies each 370 percent annual earnings in foreign exchange, which is close to the result recorded in the Guinnes Book of World Records, and that is without counting dividends--based on the results of 1993, UCS's net profit for distribution came to $600,000, or 60 percent per share. And it cannot be said that Inturservis and Inpass Ltd. sold everything that they could--the former firm left itself all agency rights with regard to the technical servicing of credit cards (UCS continued to lease certain rights from Inturservis), and the latter left itself the status of the first nonresident bank hooked up to the chain of VISA credit card payments serviced by UCS. And this is when the second round began, which now took place in the spirit of a "Red Guard attack." The officers of Most Bank, deciding to exercise their rights as a stockholder, submitted a proposal to the management of UCS to put all payments for the Europay system in the Russian stage of the banking chain through Most Bank, rather than Kredo Bank. Here, in our view, commentary is needed. The bank through which the processing center carries out the "plastic" payments for at least one of the credit card systems receives considerable advantages. They are the following: First of all, UCS is an extremely large client. In 1993 UCS turnover for servicing credit-card payments came to nearly $170 million, approximately one-fifth of which was for the Europay system. Naturally, balances of funds in the UCS account would become a good backup in the short-term money market for any bank. Moreover, since cash foreign exchange is now out of favor, one can predict a substantial increase in electronic turnover to show up in the 1994 results. Second, from every transaction the servicing bank takes a commission, which in this case could come to several hundred thousands of dollars a year. Third, the servicing bank also gains the opportunity to acquire for itself extremely large settlement accounts of UCS clients that accept "plastic" payments directly. For enterprises accepting credit cards, it is advantageous to have an account in the servicing bank because in that case their payments are made a day or two faster. At least, all clients serviced for the Europay system at Kardtsentr have accounts in Kardtsentr's founding banks. Fourth, the servicing bank can also offer new clients services related to the collection of cash proceeds, getting additional commissions and a considerable influx of cash from that. Fifth, by acquiring clients, the bank gains the additional opportunity to place corporate and personal credit cards issued by the bank among clients and their personnel, and to eventually provide those firms with its automatic teller machines. UCS president Aleksandr Kapustin responded to the proposal by Most Bank's officers in accordance with his charter: if the owner of the controlling block (Kredo) gave approval for a contract to be transferred "from itself" to Most Bank, Mr Kapustin would not object. Kredo, naturally, graphically demonstrated the elementary truth of capitalism, namely, the difference between a block of shares and a controlling block. As a result of which, an unpleasant truth was revealed to Most Bank: having paid $2.3 million, it had not acquired any rights with respect to the management of UCS and had not acquired any additional market or income. The possible dividend on UCS stock is poor consolation, since on the basis of 1994 results it will (in terms of the real capital spent by Most Bank) amount to no more than 30 percent in foreign exchange, and that is in the event that the principal UCS stockholder does not adopt a plan for large-scale reinvestments. Consequently, accomplishment of the main "political" objective--to save Kardtsentr and its clientele by influencing the process of the reorganization of UCS and establishment of Viza Rossiya Servis--remained just as remote as it had in September 1993. Under these circumstances, Most Bank decided to resort to "the continuation of politics by other means," by carrying out a revolution in UCS's management staff. Practically a Detective-Story Plot: Most Bank versus Toby Mitchell "Many will revile me And now will probably ask Why do I joke so stupidly? What's it to them? I want to!" Aleksandr Pushkin KOMMERSANT Toby Mitchell citizen of Great Britain, 36 years old. Worked for the VISA International company starting in 1985; in 1990 was appointed director of the Central and Eastern Europe Department; in 1992 became vice-president of VISA International. In January 1993, with the consent of VISA International, Mr Mitchell founded the Payment Systems Partnership company, in which he named himself senior partner. The company's principal job is consultations regarding the development of consumer payment systems in Eastern Europe. According to Mr Kapustin, after relations between the management of UCS and the junior stockholding firm (Most Bank) grew strained, Most Bank's representatives expressed a desire to see the firm's accounting reports. The company's officers accommodated the junior stockholder's desire and gave Most Bank's specialists access to their financial documents. It must be noted that the group sent to UCS was not an auditing commission of the joint-stock company in the full sense of the word (and could not have been one, according to UCS's charter), since it represented the interests of only one of the stockholders. Nonetheless, the UCS officers decided not to hide "their cards." Aleksandr Kapustin regarded the audit with Olympian calm, since in 1993 UCS's financial documents had repeatedly been audited by Centrobank, the Anti-Trust Committee, the tax inspectorate, and several auditing firms (including Ernst & Young specialists), and even by the Ministry of State Security. In the course of their work, the Most group's specialists called attention to documents confirming a payment for the amount of $95,000 from the firm's account to the personal account of Mr Mitchell for the performance of a set of work under contract with UCS. Let us note that in conversation with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, Kredo Bank's vice-president Igor Lipanov, a member of the UCS board, said that the decision to conclude a contract with Mr Mitchell was approved by UCS's Council of Directors and board, and made in accordance with the UCS's charter, and that the results of its fulfillment were detailed in an appropriate report dated 29 May 1993 and deemed highly satisfactory by the board. Subsequently, this fact was certified in an official letter signed by Yuriy Agapov (Kredo's president and chairman of the UCS board) and Igor Fedorov (president of the VISA International and member of the UCS board). However, as Mr Kapustin reported, immediately after the group of Most Bank specialists had called attention to the documents pertaining to the contract with Mr Mitchell, those documents were confiscated according to established procedures by a representative of the okrug tax police, which coincidentally (let's call it a coincidence) showed up at UCS literally "on the heels" of the group of Most Bank staff members (the UCS bookkeeping department has an official record of the confiscation). KOMMERSANT Subsequently KOMMERSANT's editorial staff decided to clarify the question of why a payment by UCS was made to Mr Mitchell's personal account (although that is not contrary to Russian law), rather than to the account of Payment Systems Partnership, which would be more typical for standard Russian practice. We asked that question to Mr Mitchell himself and also sought the opinion of Mr Antony Berendt, a specialist in British business and banking law from the London School of Business. It turned out that the Payment Systems Partnership firm, in principle, has no account other than Mr Mitchell's personal account. The point is that British law allows the formation of a legal entity as the commercial name (trade name) of an individual, with the use of the individual's personal accounts for business purposes. In other words, whereas Russian law contemplates the possibility of engaging in entrepreneurial activity without the formation of a legal entity, British law contemplates the possibility of engaging in entrepreneurial activity with the formation (for purposes of taxation and the creation of a subject of commercial and international law) of a legal entity in the form of a trade name. Nonetheless, on 9 February (two days after the completion of the audit and a day after the confiscation of documents pertaining to the contract with Mr Mitchell, a letter from Mr Polyakov, a vice president of Most Bank, was received by the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's Administration for Combating Economic Crimes. The letter stated that the transfer of the money to Mr Mitchell had caused harm to Most Bank's interests, and it also contained a request to "resolve the question" of bringing criminal charges against Mr Kapustin on the basis of this fact (the editorial office has the text of the complaint, as it does the texts of the other documents mentioned). Naturally, the removal of the "criminal" from the office of UCS president would be decided automatically. Evidently, in that case even the main stockholder would lose the possibility of influencing the situation, since the decision to remove a "criminal" from the management of the main processing center in Russia would most likely be supported by the management of VISA International and Europay International. It is interesting that, according to Mr Kapustin himself, whom staff members of the Economic Crimes Administration invited for a conversation, confidential documents confiscated on the day before by the representative of the okrug tax police were appended to Mr Polyakov's letter (incidentally, a sentence to the effect that documents pertaining to the transfer of money to Mr Mitchell are attached to Mr Polyakov's letter exists in the text of the letter itself). Moreover, according to unofficial information obtained by UCS's representative in the City Internal Affairs Administration's Economic Crimes Administration, Most Bank's complaint had been brought to the Economic Crimes Administration by Col Papakhin, the deputy director of the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative Administration, who at that moment was on a regular leave; while on leave, Mr Papakhin was awaiting an order dismissing him from the internal affairs agencies, after which he was supposed to begin work at Most Bank (as KOMMERSANT's staff has learned, starting this March Aleksandr Papakhin began performing official duties at Most Bank). Not finding any indications of a crime in the UCS president's actions, on 17 February the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's Administration for Combating Economic Crimes issued a order declining to initiate a criminal case. Nonetheless, on 17 February staff members of the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative Administration issued an order on the initiation of criminal case No. 003209 with regard to the fact of the transfer of money to Mr Mitchell "by an unknown criminal." Mr Gusinskiy, Most Bank's president, sent a letter to the Moscow Procuracy (initial No. 561, dated 23 February 1994) expressing the opinion that staff members of the City Internal Affairs Administration's Economic Crimes Administration had a "prejudiced attitude" toward the case. But the Moscow Procuracy's Administration for Oversight Over the Execution of the Law in Internal Affairs Agencies issued an order revoking the order of the City Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative Administration to initiate a criminal case on the grounds that the latter order was "illegal" and "issued on a contrived pretext." This last circumstance requires separate commentary. The point is that the order to initiate a criminal case indicated that it had been initiated on the basis of an audit conducted by the Seventh Department (for combating organized crime) of the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's RUOP [Regional Administration for Fighting Organized Crime]. However, staff members of the Moscow Procuracy (and this fact is officially confirmed in the procuracy's order revoking the order initiating the criminal case) established that, with respect to UCS, an "audit by the Seventh Department of the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's RUOP was not conducted," and consequently, no materials from the "audit" had been received by the City Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative Administration. In reality, the City Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative Administration had initiated the criminal case after receiving a 17 February 1994 letter from Most Bank, which was registered there under number 387 (the fact of the receipt of the letter from Most Bank is mentioned by Vladimir Gusinskiy in his letter to the Moscow Procuracy that is referred to above). In addition, the Investigative Administration's order initiating the criminal case states that "an unknown criminal unjustifiably transferred $95,000 from an account at Most Bank to Account No. 070614623 at the Republic National Bank (New York)." In reality, UCS had no settlement account in Most Bank. Moreover, as UCS's financial documents indicate, money was not transferred to Republic National Bank, either. Mr Mitchell's money was transferred from the International Moscow Bank (from the UCS account) to Kredo Bank (to Mr Mitchell's account). However, since International Moscow and Kredo do not have direct correspondent relations, the money, in accordance with established procedure, was transferred through Republic National Bank, which has correspondent relations with both banks and is Kredo's principal correspondent bank for settlements in U.S. dollars. Nonetheless, after the Moscow Procuracy's decision, the case was transferred further along official lines to the RF Procuracy General. At this stage, the company's principal stockholder, Kredo Bank, was involved in the process of examining the case. On 17 March the Bank's vice-president Igor Lipanov sent a letter to the Moscow Procuracy and the director of the Investigative Administration of the RF Procuracy that noted that, in the opinion of Kredo Bank's officers, Most Bank "is attempting to provoke a criminal investigation of the UCS president on a contrived pretext for the purposes of gaining competitive advantages in the market." In sum, as KOMMERSANT's editorial staff has learned, on 6 April the UCS officers received an official letter (initial No. 16-574-94) confirming the official agreement of the RF Procuracy General with the order of the Moscow Procuracy not to initiate the criminal case against Mr Kapustin. With this decision by the Procuracy General, the detective aspect of the plot was exhausted, for Mr Mitchell, in an interview with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, stated that he would decline to bring suit against Most Bank and its officers, whose actions, according to him, had damaged his reputation. Thus, suspicion was lifted from the UCS management, the company's activities continued, and Mr Kapustin ceased to be associated in business circles with Article 93-1 of the RSFSR Criminal Code (from eight years to the "top," and invariably with confiscation of property). It would seem that the time had come to engage in implementing the UCS strategy in full. But everything worked out somewhat differently. VISA and Europe: Their Shadows Swayed on the Threshold "They're dissatisfied with my reply, `Resolve our dispute as fast as possible!' They repeated with ardor And with the same rattling of spurs. "I cast a glance around the room And it was as though I were charmed by the design `I like BOTH very much!' I told them and ran out.--Count Aleksey Tolstoy For a final clarification of the situation in the "plastic" market and of the prospects for its development, we turned to the officers of the international "plastic" associations themselves, whose interests the leading Russian banks in the internecine guarded (along with their own), appealing to them in the course of the matter for support. Last week Alan Goslar, first vice-president of VISA International, told us the following: "My attitude toward the existing situation is this: it's a purely Russian problem. Russia's banking community should sort out this whole thing on its own. After hearing both sides, I said that they themselves should find a solution. We cannot act as a jury. They are their affairs, and I will do everything possible to keep from being drawn into the conflict. "Granted, Russian banks are inclined to create squabbles out of nothing and to deal with one another harshly," continued Mr Goslar. "The methods employed in business are very different from ours. They very much like to push each other toward the abyss. Taking some one to the point of collapse is practiced very widely here. It's a market where the competition is very strong, and the banks have a weapon that we never dreamed of. According to my observations, Mr Gusinskiy believes that there are battles ahead that he is capable of winning. I'm sure that he will take very decisive actions. But I am prepared to argue that Kredo, too, is prepared for decisive actions. I'm sure that Mr Gusinskiy is pursuing certain goals, but will he be able to achieve them using such methods?" Something was achieved all the same--Western businessmen recalled the plots of Jack London and Brett Harte, and maybe even those of Mario Puzo and Ian Fleming. As a result, we developed the sense that the conflict among Russian banks had forced international associations to think seriously about politics in Russia. They, carefully counting all the stars that had fallen from the eyes of Russian bankers and illuminated their way to the Russian market, decided to change their policy of clearly defined preferences for any specific Russian structures and, it appears, started to actively assist all at once. If it does not prove possible to unambiguously defeat their historically ubiquitous competitor, whom they have encountered in a new market, then it is better not to lose what they already have. Evidently, having noticed the certainty that emerged in Western associations that it was extremely risky in Russia to bet everything on one horse (be it UCS or Kardtsentr), Most Bank appears to have decided to play that situation to its own maximum benefit. According to the latest information, Most Bank has taken decisive steps toward individual self-definition in the credit card market. One can say that it has made an asymmetrical response. As Mr Geoffrey de Schrevel, chief manager of Europay International for Central and Eastern Europe, informed us, Most Bank's representatives informed him that, while not planning to quit Kardtsentr, they nonetheless want to build their own Europay processing center parallel to Kardtsentr's machine. Since any Europay member-bank may in principle do such a thing, the association will not object. In addition, according to Mr Jan Doskar, VISA International's manager for Eastern Europe, Most Bank, which is a member of the VISA system, intends by the end of the year (following UCS) to install a terminal for satellite communications with their system. Despite the fact that Most Bank is losing out to its competitors in the "plastic" market in time, it has a chance for success. After all, in the course of the conflict Most Bank evidently succeeded in burying the idea of UCS stockholders for establishing a Viza Rossiya Servis and an analogous entity for Europay with a common processing center in the form of UCS or its successor. Now, it appears, Kredo Bank has been doomed forever to "climb down" from its controlling block in any organizations dealing with credit cards. On the other hand, even if Kredo Bank should try to establish a national association on the basis of UCS (for example, through the additional issuance of UCS stock), other banks will hardly join it--if 49 percent is not enough to redistribute the market, smaller shares are even more pointless. Thus, Kardtsentr's existing clientele, on which Most Bank might count in its independent actions in the market, will be retained in the Europay system (and, in the future, in the VISA system too). However, Kredo has not abandoned realization of part of its original strategic design, either. As KOMMERSANT editors have learned, back on 15 March Igor Fedorov, on behalf of the Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company, officially gave up to Kredo agency rights and contracts (gave up exclusive authorization) not only for the VISA and Europay systems, but for the Diners Club and JCB systems, too. Last week Kredo began transferring contracts with enterprises (former clients first of Inturservis and then of UCS) directly to itself and strengthened its position as the bank that exclusively services the UCS turnover. Moreover, according to information possessed by the editors, last week the Union Card company (founded by a consortium of Russian banks, including Inkombank, Avtobank, TOKO Bank, Mosbiznesbank, Delovaya Rossiya [Business Russia], the VBB and others) concluded a processing contract with UCS (Union Card payments were previously serviced by Avtobank's center). Consequently, the network of enterprises accepting Union Card cards has expanded by at least 2,000 outlets (the number of UCS's clients for the servicing of payments with the cards of other payment systems), and the turnover serviced by UCS will increase by another 10-15 percent, according to our estimates. In addition, we do not rule out the possibility that the positions of Kredo Bank, Inkombank and certain bank founders of Kardtsentr (Dialog, Moscow Savings Bank and others) on the market may draw closer after the Most Bank's processing center becomes a competitor not only of UCS but of Kardtsentr itself. Thus, as a result of the clash that occurred in the credit card market, the situation of oligopoly (in which experts, recalling the words of Kardtsentr's director, might assess the positions of Kredo Bank and UCS as preferable for the time being) has been preserved. This situation's plus for clients consists in the fact that, when UCS and Kardtsentr and Most Bank's new processing center all start to simultaneously service both the VISA system and the Europay system, they will inevitably begin to compete among themselves in terms of rates and services. Moreover, the party that is losing in terms of service capabilities will most likely resort to offering dumping rates. Specialists judge the lowest limit of rates to be 1.9-2.0 percent, as opposed to the current 3.5-4.0 percent. Under these conditions, the servicing of payments will for all practical purposes become an unprofitable business, and the development of it will become exclusively a money-losing proposition, for 2 percent is the amount of the external commission that foreign banks take. In addition, each of the sides will place its reliance even more emphatically on strong points in its business technology: Kardtsentr and the banks belonging to it will evidently place it on the development of automatic teller machines, and UCS--on the installation of universal devices for processing the cards (at the so-called POS--point of sale) of all the systems represented in the market, including national ones (STB, Union Card, etc.). On the other hand, the minus for clients will be that it will hardly be likely that Russian banks, having numerous processing centers, will ever reach any agreement on organizing the national mutual offsetting of credit card payments made within Russia (and that idea was seemingly the second level of the strategy of Kredo Bank and UCS), as happens in other countries, including those with a substantially smaller "plastic" turnover. Accordingly, the money in settlements will continue to race overseas--with an inevitable loss of pace and of external commission (2 percent of the amount). By withdrawing, for all practical purposes, from creating the possibility for the Russian banking sector to organize the internal mutual offsetting of payments on the basis of a single processing center, international associations have not helped the Russian "plastic" market to rise to a new stage. It cannot be said that they have come off as losers: they have been left with respectable insurance deposits (according to the associations' rules, the Russian servicing banks and processing centers keep them in foreign banks), almost $4 million in external commissions (based on the forecast for 1994), and also the possibility of "sitting" for two or three days on Russian money involved in settlements.
