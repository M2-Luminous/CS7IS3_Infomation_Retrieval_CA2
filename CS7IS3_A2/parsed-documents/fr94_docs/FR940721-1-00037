FR940721-1-00037 FR940721-1-00011 If a limited partnership has a general partner who holds 20 percent of the value of the investment interests, referring physicians hold 20 percent, and all the other investors have no business relationship with the partnerships, then the 60&hyph;40 investor rule would be met, as long as all other requirements are satisfied. The 60&hyph;40 investor rule would not be met if any of the other disinterested investors in the above example holds a debt instrument instead of an equity instrument. For example, if a joint venture raises one-third of its capital through a debt instrument held by disinterested investors, with the remaining two thirds of its capital derived from equity instruments held equally by interested (physicians and general partners) and disinterested investors, the safe harbor would not be met. In this example, even though interested investors hold only one-third of all the investment interests, they hold one-half of the equity investment interests, and thus no safe harbor protection would be available. We note that other standards in this small entity safe harbor preclude protection for abusive schemes to give referring investors preferential treatment in any way by creating different classes of investment. For example, if a joint venture creates two classes of stock, with one of the classes reserved for referring physicians who receive a higher dividend per share than non-referring investors in the other class, such an arrangement would not comply with at least sections 1001.952(a)(2) (ii), (iii) and (viii). ␣Items or Services Furnished by an Investor As discussed above, when an investor furnishes items or services to the joint venture, such as management services, he or she is a tainted or interested investor for the purposes of complying with the 60&hyph;40 investor rule (§1001.952(a)(2)(vi)). It was not our intent to have any revenues that the joint venture derives from this investor's services to be considered tainted for the purpose of qualifying for the 60&hyph;40 revenue rule. Because of the apparent confusion caused by the language ``items or services furnished'' in this safe harbor standard, we are proposing striking it. The focus of the inquiry in this standard is where the business and clients are coming from. In other words, the revenues are tainted, and may not exceed 40 percent of total revenues, if they are derived ``from referrals*␣*␣* or business otherwise generated from investors.'' We note that the language we are proposing to strike_``items or services furnished''_is superfluous because, if the revenue is ``generated'' (i.e., induced to come to the joint venture for items or services by an investor ), it is tainted. Thus, the language we are proposing to delete appears not to have added anything and merely caused confusion. The following example demonstrates the confusion and our solution. If a radiologist holds an investment interest in an imaging center and reads all the films at the center, his or her reading of the film does not taint all the revenues from the referrals by non-investors. However, we have received a few questions from people who read the 60&hyph;40 revenue rule as making such referrals tainted because the investor furnished services at the joint venture. We emphasize that if a radiologist-investor is reading the film and making referrals or otherwise generating business, then the revenues the joint venture derives from that activity would become tainted. For example, revenues would be tainted when a radiologist-investor takes part in a consultation with a non-investor internist, and during that consultation the radiologist recommends a procedure which is performed at the joint venture. C. Clarifications to Space and Equipment Rental and Personal Services and Management Contracts Safe Harbors (§§1001.952 (b), (c) and (d)) •In the preamble discussing the safe harbor provisions for space and equipment rental and personal services and management contracts (56 FR 35971&hyph;74), we made clear that one of our concerns was that health care providers in a position to make referrals to each other who engaged in these business arrangements could renegotiate their contracts on a regular basis depending on the volume of business generated. It is for this reason that we require the leases or contracts be for a term of not less than one year. (See §§1001.952(b)(4), 1001.952(c)(4), and 1001.952(d)(4).)
