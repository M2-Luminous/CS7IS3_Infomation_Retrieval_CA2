FBIS4-37219 "drnes118dd_94016" FBIS-NES-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Members Released; Leader Says No Infighting Hamas Members Released; Leader Says No Infighting NC1706155994 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1400 GMT 17 Jun 94 NC1706155994 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Excerpt] Gaza, 17 Jun (MENA) -- Amidst the joy, ululation, and chants of the Palestinian people, who still cannot believe that they have started their first steps toward liberation from the 27-year colonization, yesterday evening Israel released 368 Palestinian prisoners from a total of more than 1,000 who are supposed to be set free under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Hasan 'Asfur, a member of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks who returned to Gaza over a month ago to join the members of the Palestinian National Authority in the Gaza Strip, said in a statement to MENA that most of the released prisoners are members of the Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. Foremost of these released prisoners are two of the leaders of the movement, Shaykh Sayyid Abu-Musamih and 'Imad al-Faluji. This is the first time that Israel has released Hamas and Islamic Jihad members. 'Asfur adds that they were officially informed by the Israeli authorities of the release of this number of prisoners, including 160 convicts. Contradictory figures were quoted yesterday and today regarding the correct number of the released prisoners. These figures varied between 200 and 400 prisoners. Some people even claimed that the released prisoners did not exceed 130 men. 'Asfur said that all those released signed a "document of pledge." This document contained -- after it was drafted three times, according to Palestinian sources here -- the following: "I declare that I realize that this signature is a basic condition for releasing me. I also understand that this measure is being executed within the framework of the peace agreement signed between Israel and the PLO on 4 May 1994. Therefore, I promise to abandon all acts of terrorism and violence and to respect the law." This is the first time that Hamas detainees have signed a document of pledge to release them after they received orders to do so from their leadership. However, more than 600 Palestinian detainees from various factions refused to sign the document and the Israeli authorities refused to release them. Shaykh Abu-Musamih -- who had been convicted to nine years in prison, three of which he had already served, and who became one of the Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip after its leader, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, was arrested -- affirmed that, despite the fact that his movement will not participate in any of the self-rule authority's activities, it does have a red line that it will not cross. This line is not to allow internecine fighting in the Palestinian arena. Shaykh Abu-Musamih mentioned that his movement does not object to participating in any institution or sector that serves the Palestinian people. Shaykh Abu-Musamih said that the movement will not be turned into a political party, but it is studying the possibility of establishing a political wing. [passage omitted]
