He was glad that an agreement between Beijing and Berlin had been signed for their sister-city relations and a memorandum made on their exchanges from 1994 to 1995, Qiao said, hoping that exchanges will be strengthened and cooperation implemented in various fields. Diepgen said that his current tour in Beijing has improved mutual understanding. With the German-Chinese relations going on the right track, he said, new developments will be witnessed between Berlin and Beijing, and the two cities can cooperate for mutual benefit in infrastructure, telecommunications, environmental protection and revamping China's small- and medium-sized enterprises. Li Qiyan, Beijing's mayor, attended the meeting.
