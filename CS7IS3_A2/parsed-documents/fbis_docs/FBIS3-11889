Gallotti insisted that the STF decision to convert wages into URV's on the 20th of each month has a constitutional foundation and is strictly under the jurisdiction of the STF. "Through the unanimous decision of its members, the STF made an administrative decision based on the Constitution. This subject exclusively concerns the STF. The STF chairman does not want contention with representatives of other government branches that are just as independent and who ought to seek harmony and not confrontation, seeking respect for the constitutional rule of independency and harmony among the branches. To obey the Constitution is the best way to preserve the credibility of the institutions," Gallotti said.
