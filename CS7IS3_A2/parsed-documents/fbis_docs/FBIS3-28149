[Yanai] When the Cold War ended, the international situation became fluid and complicated. Japan was confronted with the question of how to maintain its security, stability, and prosperity as well as the task of building a post-Cold War new international order; hence the need to create an organization in the Foreign Ministry which could properly respond to such situations. During the Cold War, one diplomatic policy was to belong to either the East or West camp. But a new world order has not yet been formed in place of the Cold War, and it demands Japan deal with the new era in a positive manner. In the report of the third Council for Administrative Reform, an opinion was expressed that the Foreign Ministry needs to have an organization which can deal with such situations. In response, the Consultation Group for Consolidated Diplomacy was formed with Ryuzo Segawa as its chairman. More concrete views on reorganizing the ministry were exchanged at the meeting, and a report was compiled in December 1991. The report recommended the ministry create two bureaus -- a consolidated policies bureau and an international information bureau, although names were not specified. In the background were such concrete realities as the experience and reflections of the Persian Gulf crisis which took place in August 1990. In the sense that the war erupted in the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and African Affairs Bureau was in charge of the affair, but the initial diplomatic efforts to deal with the situation were made at the United Nations and the Security Council. In the meantime, the coalition forces were organized with the United States as its main component, joined by the United Kingdom, France, and other countries. The Middle East and African Affairs Bureau alone could not handle such a situation. The matter of transporting refugees of Asian origin was related to the Asian Affairs Bureau. When situations arose in which periphery countries were seriously affected by the war and needed assistance, the Economic Cooperation Bureau had to step in. Therefore, crisis management was required for wider spheres and more subjects than in the past, and this could not be properly handled by the existing organizations. It was keenly felt that an overall organization such as the Foreign Policy Bureau was necessary. [GAIKO FORUM] As a matter of fact, the United Nations Bureau was reorganized, was it not? [Yanai] Most functions of the United Nations Bureau were taken over, and the Policy Planning Division of the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau was added. In addition, the General Affairs Section was newly created in the Foreign Policy Bureau. Simply speaking, the United Nations Bureau was dissolved for a better setup with additional functions. By nature, the United Nations deals with everything in the universe. In that sense, the United Nations and what the Foreign Policy Bureau plans to contend with are closely related. Therefore, the bureau took over such functions. [GAIKO FORUM] Were there rearrangements with other bureaus? [Yanai] There were some, but they were not limited to mere adjustments. The new bureau is in charge of planning and framing foreign policies which are across-the-board, comprehensive, and long-range in nature. In the past, no bureaus existed to handle such matters. Adjustments with other bureaus were then needed to deal with various problems in a more concrete manner. This did not mean replacing other bureaus, but working out an overall policy by coordinating the matters under other bureaus' jurisdiction. Comprehensively Coordinating Multinational Matters [GAIKO FORUM] Matters which cannot be solved by one nation, such as problems of displaced persons and human rights, have taken place in record numbers in recent days, have they not? [Yanai] The Global Issues Division is in charge of matters on a global scale. As a whole, the bureau consists of nine divisions [ka] and five sections [shitsu]. Organizational Chart of the Foreign Policy Bureau Main Body Administrators Divisions 1)Director-General, Foreign Policy General Affairs Division Bureau 2)Councilor Planning Division National Security Policy Division United Nations Policy Division International Peace Cooperation Section Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Councilor Organization 1)Councilor, Arms Control and Scientific Arms Control & Disarmament Division Affairs 2)Counselor Nonproliferation of Weapons-Related Materials Section Scientific Affairs & Nuclear Energy Division International Science Cooperation Section Department of International Cooperation 1)Director, International Cooperation United Nations Administration Department 2)Counselor Division Specialized Agencies Administration Section Human Rights and Refugees Division Refugee Assistance Section Global Issues Division The deputy director-general of the bureau is a councilor, and the councilor of the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Department as well as the director of the International Cooperation Department have counselors under them. Basically, the organization of the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Department and the International Cooperation Department are headed by persons with director-general's rank. Therefore, you may construe they are almost independent organizations even though they fall within the Foreign Policy Bureau. These days there are matters which cannot be solved by a nation, and many things which are beyond the abilities of a superpower such as the United States. The organization was formed with this in mind. [GAIKO FORUM] In order to practically strengthen foreign policy, coordination with the cabinet and Foreign Ministry, or with other ministries or civilian needs, is necessary. What do you think about this? [Yanai] The cabinet is in charge of ironing out differences of opinion between the ministries and coming up with a conclusion as a whole. But in the process of drawing up and working out foreign policy, it is naturally required to coordinate and cooperate with other government agencies and private organizations, including the mass media and the Diet. Such work is not monopolized on by my bureau, for other bureaus do the same work as well. For domestic coordination and negotiations with foreign countries, it is convenient in many ways for the Foreign Ministry as a whole to have a general policy. That point is different from past practices. [GAIKO FORUM] Your bureau practically came into being with the inauguration of the Hosokawa cabinet. Did you make preparations for the Japan-U.S. talks between Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Clinton? [Yanai] Japan-U.S. relations are handled by the North American Affairs Bureau. The Japan-U.S. talks took place in September of 1993 when the prime minister attended the United Nations General Assembly. My bureau was directly involved in the preparations for the prime minister's attendance at the UN General Assembly and in working out the contents of his speech. Not confined just to Japan-U.S. relations -- for example, President Yeltsin's visit to Japan -- direct bilateral negotiations are handled by either the North American Affairs Bureau or the European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau. But in such bilateral talks, there arises matters of global scale as well as multinational matters. My bureau will be involved in such matters in order to coordinate them comprehensively. On Japan's Becoming a Permanent Member of the Security Council [GAIKO FORUM] Newspaper reports had it that the cabinet and Foreign Ministry maintained opposing views on Japan's becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. [Yanai] Delivering an address at the UN General Assembly was the first opportunity for the Hosokawa cabinet to manifest its foreign policy. Domestically, there was an address at the Diet as well as news conferences, but externally that was the first official speech. The most essential problem in the making of an organization for the new world is how to reorganize the Security Council. In his address, the prime minister touched on this. As a matter of fact, the Japanese view was made public in a proposal to the United Nations secretary-general in early July near the end of the Miyazawa cabinet. Since the basic foreign policy of the Hosokawa cabinet was to succeed the former cabinet's, fundamentally there were no problems. Since it was an address designed for the General Assembly, the expression sounded naturally different from the proposal. Frankly speaking, it is only natural that the nuance become different to reflect various opinions in the coalition. In that sense, it cannot be denied there were controversies in the process of drafting the manuscript for the General Assembly. The mass media exaggerated it to sound as if there were basic changes in their way of thinking, but I do not agree with that. [GAIKO FORUM] It was reported the Foreign Ministry positively favored Japan's becoming a permanent member, and that Prime Minister Hosokawa was reluctant to be so hasty. [Yanai] I do not understand the intention of that kind of report. It is an important problem, but the nation as a whole does not correctly comprehend the advantages or responsibilities once Japan becomes a permanent member of the Security Council. In that sense, I am of the opinion the matter should be thoroughly debated domestically. Internationally, the reorganization of the Security Council has become a potential reality in a hurry. In the process, international opinion is conspicuously gaining force that Japan and Germany should be made permanent members. More than 20 nations are in favor of the idea. A great number of countries which have not made their views public are wishing Japan and Germany would contribute by becoming permanent members in view of their present power status in the world. However, representatives of developing nations have to be considered for the position if Japan and Germany are to be members. Such adjustments require time. There is a consensus that several new nations should be added to the permanent membership, and that the permanent membership itself should be expanded. While there is the need to thoroughly discuss the matter domestically, there are risks in being left behind internationally if Japan indulges in domestic discussion because international movements are gaining speed. [GAIKO FORUM] With reference to the dispatch of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to foreign countries in relation to peacekeeping operations [PKO], there seems to be apprehension about Japan becoming a permanent member because it may contribute to increased military burdens. What is your opinion? [Yanai] There are no United Nations forces as such provided for in the UN Charter, and becoming a permanent member does not immediately cause a nation to make its armed forces available. As for present permanent member nations, they bear the responsibility of providing troops or other facilities to the United Nations only after they work out special agreements with the UN. So long as there are no commitments, no differences exist among permanent or nonpermanent member nations of the Security Council and ordinary UN member nations. Japan's Constitution has no provisions for the PKO. Member nations have discretion as to whether they participate, using their own judgment. A permanent member nation has no obligation to participate. Until recently it was the rule that the five major powers -- all permanent members -- did not participate in the PKO. It was only in recent days that they began to participate. As another example, let me cite the coalition forces during the Gulf war. At the time, use of force was authorized by a UN Security Council resolution which Russia [then the Soviet Union] supported, with China abstaining. Although their standpoints were different, the Soviet Union and China did not send troops. Therefore, in compliance with the UN Charter, an obligation to provide military cooperation does not come about based merely on grounds of a nation being a permanent member of the Security Council. Since all problems of international importance related to peace and security are debated at the Security Council, overwhelmingly voluminous information can be gathered. Being present at all times will be advantageous for Japan which seeks the right to speak on such matters as promoting peace and disarmament. Another point I have to make is that Japan is the second largest contributing nation to the upkeep of the UN, only after the United States. Furthermore, Japan is paying its share on time in comparison to the United States which has a major amount in arrears. Thus, Japan is the best financial contributor. In view of the democratic principle of "no taxation without representation," it is a problem for Japan to pay for decisions made without Japan's participation. Task of Positively Working for Peace [GAIKO FORUM] What sort of diplomatic tasks do you have in mind for Japan to deal with in the future? [Yanai] Maintaining peace is a vital problem, although it is difficult to decide what problems should be given priority. After World War II, Japan enjoyed peace, even though there was no guarantee it would last forever. Pacifism thus has taken root. Japan would never engage in aggression nor become a military power. However, I do not think a majority of Japanese have ever thought of such pacifism when Japan actively contributed to creating organizations or engaged in activities to ensure world peace. But the Persian Gulf crisis was instrumental in initiating earnest talks about such matters and in creating in the Japanese such a consciousness. Therefore, Japan's major task is to make positive efforts for the cause of peace. Then there are problems of freedom, democracy, and human rights which are not heeded in many countries of the world, thus destroying peace. In addition, there are problems of poverty and maintaining standards of living, which could be defined as the foundation or infrastructure of peace. Fortunately, Japan has the strength to contribute to many countries in such fields, creating such foundations of peace as human rights, humanity, or economic development. Japan has made considerable contributions so far in economic cooperation, and such contributions will continue to be necessary in the future. There is still the long-range problem of the environment. It is further deteriorating toward the end of this century, and Japan has to make more contributions since it has the ability to do so. In close relation with the problem of peace, Japan has to make parallel efforts in dealing with such problems as disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These are major subjects to be dealt with. Methods of Propelling Asia-Pacific Cooperation [GAIKO FORUM] In retrospect as regards Japanese diplomacy, the problems of the Meiji era were said to be amendments to unequal treaties and problems related to the Korean peninsula. Presently, although the Soviet Union has collapsed, the existence of Russia poses great concern for Japan. Some American journalists are said to have predicted Japan's going nuclear once North Korea [DPRK] possessed nuclear arms. There are also many things to be apprehensive about as regards post-Deng Xiaoping China. In brief, East Asia -- which is closely related to Japan -- seems to be an unpredictable area. [Yanai] As you said, security and peace in Northeast Asia has been one of the most vital aspects for present as well as past Japanese diplomacy. After the Soviet Union collapsed, a considerably large portion of it was inherited by Russia, and Russia itself has created many unstable factors during its process of change. Of course, it has not gone back to the times of czars; rather, it is making efforts to become a democracy and a market economy. For the sake of stability in that region, Russia wished to make headway in that direction by all means, and Japan is determined to assist in any way it can. At the same time, Japan will attempt to settle territorial disputes revolving around the so-called northern territories in order to expand equilibrium. China has been pursuing reform and modernization, and seems to have achieved considerable success in improving its economy. It is most desirable for regional stability that China becomes more open and modernized; Japan may be able to assist in that direction. The Japan-ROK relationship has greatly improved, but it deserves more in view of our grueling historical past. The North Korean regime and its economy is isolated and closed to the outside world; it should be made a member of the international community so the security of this area can be greatly enhanced. Presently North Korea is suspected of developing nuclear weapons; that question should be solved by all means so that North Korea can become an ordinary member of northeast Asia. It necessary to do everything possible in order to attain that goal. Unlike in Europe, there is little regional cooperation in this area, much to our regret. It is true Europe worked a considerably long time to achieve what it has today. Asian nations need time to cooperate with other nations in the Asia-Pacific region in a broad sense, and to establish cooperative relations in East Asia or Northeast Asia in a narrower sense. This is considered one of the tasks of the Foreign Policy Bureau. [GAIKO FORUM] Asia seems to have antipathy against the human rights diplomacy of the United States, harboring the concept that a dictatorship is tolerable for the sake of development. Is it not Japan's vital role to act as go-between for the human rights ideology of the United States and the realities of developing nations? [Yanai] Attitudes in Asia about human rights certainly differ from those of the United States and Europe, nor are they the same between the United States and Europe. It is important to respect basic human rights, of course; peace cannot be maintained without it. On the other hand, it is self-evident that human rights problems in places where overcoming poverty is the burning question are different from those in countries enjoying a relatively high standard of living. Therefore, as regards world standards of respecting human rights, there is naturally a limit to which a country can intervene by praising or condemning another country's human rights record based on its own standards. It is better to a certain degree to deal realistically with the problem of human rights in order not to come into conflict with the sovereignty of those countries in question. Asia covers a broad area, and to a certain degree the way of thinking in some Asian countries is comparatively moderate with respect to human rights. Necessity of Sharing International Information [GAIKO FORUM] Today diplomacy and internal affairs are closely related and inseparable as in no other time in the past. Have you anything to add in relation to domestic society? [Yanai] In the past, diplomacy found points of contact with domestic affairs in relation to war and peace, and in rare cases with trade. Economic and social affairs between Japan and foreign countries allowed them to have contacts. Contrarily, today almost every element of both domestic and foreign communities is interrelated. For that reason, it is necessary to coordinate with internal affairs in order to execute good diplomacy. Diplomacy will never succeed without the support of the people. [GAIKO FORUM] Other government agencies are closely related to private enterprise or regional communities because they have the right to authorization or licenses. However, it is pointed out that the Foreign Ministry does not have such a domestic foothold. Do you have any countermeasures? [Yanai] Domestic information is not automatically gathered, and problems related to internal affairs are not easy to understand. In order to gather and absorb domestic information or demands, efforts are necessary to contact other government agencies, politicians, the mass media, and private enterprises within the country. The Foreign Ministry has networks in foreign countries which provide access to local feelings. But these feelings are not necessarily understood at home. Therein lies the difficulty, and it is necessary to make available domestically the information gathered abroad, and not keep it in the ministry. It has become more and more necessary to gather information rapidly and correctly, and to share it with others. So far I have talked mainly about the Foreign Policy Bureau in relation to the recent reorganization of the Foreign Ministry. But the International Information Bureau was created at the same time. This means functions not related to information are transferred to the Foreign Policy Bureau, and the International Information Bureau is to exert more effort in gathering and analyzing information. Organizational changes were made simultaneously in order to make the information gathered available domestically. One of the tasks of the Foreign Policy Bureau is to become the center of crisis management in the event of large-scale emergencies. The Foreign Policy Bureau has the General Affairs Division as part of its main body; this division will become the center of the entire Foreign Ministry and will deal with large emergencies such as the Persian Gulf war. In the past, such functions did not exist. When emergencies arose, task forces were quickly formed, but they were not permanent. Now that the General Affairs Division exists under the Foreign Policy Bureau, emergencies will be dealt with at all times. [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.
