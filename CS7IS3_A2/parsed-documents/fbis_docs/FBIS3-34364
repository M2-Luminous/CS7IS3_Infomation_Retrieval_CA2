He only noted the few achievements made in his first year in office, specifically the North America Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, the GATT Agreement, and increasing pressure on Asian countries to open their markets and eliminate customs restrictions on their imports. Apart form this, the speech focused on domestic issues. There was disappointment for anyone who expected the U.S. President to say something about his latest tour of Europe and Russia, about his meeting with President al-Asad in Geneva, and whether the tour added or contributed to a clear U.S. view of the world, its problems, and how to address them. The world's problems disappeared in Clinton's address despite the aggravation of problems in volatile areas such as Bosnia and Somalia and despite the doubts surrounding the reforms in Russia and the increasing differences between the United States and its Western allies over security and foreign policy. The drama of President Clinton failing repeatedly to appoint a new defense secretary to succeed Les Aspin added a new dimension to the general picture formed over a year of Democrats' rule of the extent of the confusion, division, and vacillation of actions, goals, and concepts. Does the United States deal with outstanding problems piecemeal? Is it trying to find a separate solution to every problem? Will it intervene militarily where things are hot and, if so, what is the extent and the limit of such intervention? What is the United Nations' role and what are its resources and ability to play such a role? There are people who believe that President Clinton, after a full year in office, appears less enthusiastic about confronting his responsibilities as the first post-Cold War President of the United States. There are others who believe that the Democratic administration has not yet assimilated the changes on the world map and lacks a clear view of the shape of the world order in the long term and of the nature of the world map currently being shaped, a map in which states and ministates are bracing themselves to play an influential role in provoking wars and making peace. It is expected that the world will continue to see the United states vacillating on the road between the Balkans and Somalia and Russia and its former empires without a comprehensive framework for achieving peace based on a firm and consistent basis.
