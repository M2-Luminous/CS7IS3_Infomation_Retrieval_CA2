The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ) (Magnuson Act) and are implemented for the U.S. fishery by regulations at 50 CFR parts 620, 672, and 675. The domestic fishery for Pacific halibut off Alaska is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), as provided by the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (16 U.S.C. 773&hyph;773k), with implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 301. Regulations implementing individual fishing quotas (IFQs) for the domestic groundfish and halibut fisheries off Alaska are at 50 CFR part 676. The king and Tanner crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area are managed under the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. This FMP delegates management of the crab resources in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area to the State of Alaska (State) with Federal oversight. Regulations necessary to carry out the crab FMP appear at 50 CFR part 671.
