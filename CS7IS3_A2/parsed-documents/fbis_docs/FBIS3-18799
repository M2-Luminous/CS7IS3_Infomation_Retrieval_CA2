However their development in many fields does not meet our mutual expectations," German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel says in an interview published in the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on Monday [7 March]. Kinkel stresses the need to realise that along with claims for compensation by Czech victims of Nazism there at the same time exist claims of Sudeten Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War Two. Kinkel says that Germany is aware of its responsibility towards Czech victims of Nazism. "We will seek to find an appropriate solution," he says. "We are watching with interest steps by the Czech Government concerning partial compensation for Nazi victims. But there should not be any prejudices and a dialogue should be carried out with Sudeten Germans," Kinkel says. "Results of the German-Czech commission of historians which recently published a report on its symposium on `Germans, Czechs and Slovaks during the First Republic' should be taken into consideration much more than before, which would help make the discussion a `matter-of-fact' one," Kinkel says. Kinkel expresses satisfaction concerning German-Czech economic relations. "In the economic field, Germany, with a roughly 25- percent share in both imports and exports, is unambiguously the most important partner of the Czech Republic," he says. "We have opened our market to Czech goods. Thousands of Czechs have found jobs in Germany, and especially in border regions. Millions of German tourists visit the Czech Republic. By this we are considerably contributing to economic and social stability in the Czech Republic," he adds. Besides, the Czech economy "has absorbed a considerable portion of German investments oriented towards Central European countries," he said. On the future of Europe, Kinkel voices the conviction that "excessive regulation and centralism" within the European Union has to be moderated. However, the goals of the Union will remain unchanged. On the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, Kinkel says the approach by the EU, NATO and the United Nations Security Council clearly shows the "firmness with which the international community reacts to the Bosnian war." "To achieve a functioning security system in Europe it is important that different institutions -- the EU, the Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), NATO and Western European Union (WEU) -- join together, Kinkel says, adding that Germany supports such countries as the Czech Republic in their efforts to approach the structures of European and trans-Atlantic security.
