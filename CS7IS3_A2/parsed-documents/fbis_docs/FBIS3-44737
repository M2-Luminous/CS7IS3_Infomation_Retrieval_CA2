Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, chaired the forum. Responsible comrades of LIAONING RIBAO, the Liaoning Provincial Radio and Television Department, the Liaoning People's Broadcasting Station, the Liaoning Television Station, and the Liaoning Branch of XINHUA News Agency gave speeches. They reviewed the achievements and problems of the press units of the province and those of the central authorities stationed in the province in their efforts to persistently take economic construction as the central task and adhere to correct press guidance in 1993. They also offered views and suggestions on ways to make this year's press and propaganda work successful. Vice Governor Zhang Rongmao spoke to put forward specific requirements on how press units should strengthen guidance through positive examples and improve the propaganda front. He urged press units under party leadership to adhere to the principle of propaganda through positive example, correctly report the provincial situation, and guide the people throughout the province to make contributions to accelerating Liaoning's economic construction. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, also spoke after attentively listening to the speeches. He said: In 1993, press units of the province persistently took the guidelines of the 14th party congress as guidance and economic construction as the central task and carried out a great amount of work focusing on the arrangements of the provincial party committee and government, thus promoting Liaoning's economic and other work. The year 1994 will be one when the largest number of China's major reform measures will be executed and also a crucial year for the endeavor to more rapidly establish the socialist market economy system. Therefore, it is very important to do a good job in news reports. He emphasized: The focus of the 1994 press work should be on conscientious implementation of the guidelines of the 14th party congress, especially those of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, and the execution of major reform measures should be regarded as an important part of news reports to facilitate the establishment of the socialist market economy system. Press units should intensify publicity of economic work, adhere to the essential criterion of development, and emphasize improvement of economic efficiency as the focus to bring about healthy, sustained, and rapid development in Liaoning's economy. In publicizing the spiritual civilization, they should adhere to the major trends to encourage people's enthusiasm for building socialism and for plunging themselves into economic construction. They should do a good job in publicizing unity and stability to provide a good social environment for reform and opening up and to ensure the development of economic construction and other undertakings. Gu Jinchi also put forward specific demands for improvement of the leading bodies and contingents of the press units of the province.
