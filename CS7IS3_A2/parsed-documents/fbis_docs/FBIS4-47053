But Will Quotas Be Preserved?"] [Text] Regulation of export is currently centered around manipulations of quotas. Their future fate may turn out to be rather varied: Ranging from their significant restructuring for the purpose of reduction to their use as insurance funds in attracting foreign investments. While coordination work goes on in the higher offices, in practical activity exporters will be guided by the MFER [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] instruction on the order of issuing export licenses in 1994, which has passed registry in the Ministry of Justice and was officially disseminated yesterday. Export quotas and licenses--if not twins, are certainly blood relatives. First, quotas are born within the Ministry of Economics. There are four types of these: State quotas, which the MFER strives to distribute through its tendering committee; enterprise quotas, which the latter receive through the retained sectoral departments; regional quotas, which are managed by the local administrations; and auction quotas, which the MFER puts up for bidding. The most troublesome, naturally, is to obtain one quota or another. Then the exporter, who files the application in accordance with the MFER instruction, receives a license from the ministry's local authorized agencies. Turning the quota into a license is in essence a purely technical act. However, the ratified instruction, due to the laws of the genre, certainly does not make it any easier. The objective basis is to tighten the requirements of currency control. Now the MFER authorized agency, before issuing a license, must be assured of guarantees of returnability of the currency revenues in accordance with the joint version of the system of currency control developed by the Central Bank and the GTK [RF State Tariff Committee] (instruction on the order of implementing currency control dated 12 October 1993). And this automatically means that the possibilities for dragging out the issuance of licenses are expanded. It is true, this favorite game of the bureaucrats may become senseless in connection with the rather probable significant reduction in the family of quotas. According to many indicators (among them the direct announcements of Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, acting Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin, and (less importantly) the clear desire of the governmental structures to distribute the annual volume of export licenses as soon as possible), the current system of quota setting and licensing may not even make it to the end of the year. A significant elimination of quotas in export is expected (it is true, the quotas on oil, diesel fuel, aluminum, copper, nickel, and perhaps other nonferrous metals will surely remain). In this case, the government admits that raw material will continue to remain the basis of Russia's exports in the future, and will try to untie the hands of its exporters. Russia's exports in January-April of 1994 increased by 8.7 percent over last year. Moreover, exports of oil (in physical volume) increased by 8.5 percent, of oil products (primarily diesel fuel)--by 22.5 percent, and of natural gas--by 14.4 percent. Even in such a traditionally industrial region of Russia as Sverdlovsk Oblast the relative share of exports of raw materials increased from 57 percent in 1992 to 83.6 percent in 1993. The machine-building areas export only 3.4 percent of their products. The elimination of state quotas raises questions. On one hand, the purpose of quotas is to ensure Russia's state obligations. State quotas are retained in this, synonymously reduced, form: Obligations must be fulfilled, especially since the State Duma firmly intends to significantly cut Russia's credit limits to foreign countries. On the other hand, the draft budget provides for income from state export in the volume of $3.3 billion. Where will this money come from if state quotas are eliminated? The consent of the Ministry of Finance to remove state quotas on exports, and this means also on budget currency losses, may mean only one thing: We should expect elimination of all tariff and currency benefits to exporters and importers (primarily oil and gas producers, which will surely evoke the opposition of the RF Ministry of Fuel and Energy). Other exporters, however, may evidently hope for a reduction in export tariff rates. If benefits disappear, the volume of revenues from customs duties may even in this case cover the budget currency losses.
