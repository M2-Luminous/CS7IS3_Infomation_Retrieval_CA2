FR940812-2-00279 FR940812-2-00109 Friday August 12, 1994 Part V Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner NOFA for Preservation Support Grants and Paperwork Submission: Amendment, Announcement of Paperwork Control Number, and Extension of Application Deadline; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 155␣/␣Friday, August 12, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3762; FR&hyph;3613&hyph;N&hyph;02] NOFA for Preservation Support Grants and Notice of Paperwork Submission: Amendment, Announcement of Paperwork Control Number, and Extension of Application Deadline AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Amendment of NOFA, announcement of paperwork control number, and extension of deadline. SUMMARY: The Department is amending its NOFA for Preservation Support Grants, published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30640), and, therefore, is extending the deadline for applications. In addition, because at the time of publication the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had not issued a control number for the information collection requirements contained in that NOFA, the Department advised potential applicants that the paperwork requirements were subject to OMB approval. Those requirements have now been approved by OMB and the Department is publishing the control number assigned to that paperwork collection. DATES: The new deadline for submission of applications is September 12, 1994. Applications must be physically received in the Preservation Division, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 6286, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, by 4:30 p.m., EST, on or before the due date. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Frank Malone, Director, Office of Preservation and Property Disposition, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 6284, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 708&hyph;3555. To provide service for persons who are hearing- or speech-impaired, this number may be reached via TDD by dialing the Federal Information Relay Service on 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;TDDY (1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339) or 202&hyph;708&hyph;9300. (Except for the TDD number, telephone numbers are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 14, 1994, the Department published its NOFA for Preservation Support Grants and Notice of Paperwork Submission (59 FR 30640). As a result of questions that have been raised by potential applicants, in this notice the Department is amending certain parts of the NOFA. For further clarification, the Department also is advising potential applicants of changes that have been made in the application kit. Under section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) and the requirements of 24 CFR 12.12, the Department therefore is extending the deadline for submitting applications for funds made available under the NOFA until 30 days from today's publication. In addition, the Department announces that the information collection requirements contained in the NOFA have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned control number 2502&hyph;0504. Potential applicants have raised several questions about some of the certifications contained in the NOFA and application kit. As a result, one of the certifications (see item 8 in Section V.C, ``Submission Requirements,'' 59 FR at 30648 of the NOFA) has been revised to clarify that, although an applicant should not apply for these funds with the intention of purchasing properties that are to be assisted with these funds, the Department recognizes that future circumstances may warrant the applicant or its affiliate to seek an ownership interest as purchaser of last resort in such properties. In these cases and in recognition of the Department's overriding goal to maintain the greatest possible number of affordable housing units available for moderate-, low- and very low-income families, special dispensation of this rule, on a case by case basis, may be granted by the Department. Another certification, included in the application kit as Exhibit 8 (pursuant to item 9 in Section V.C of the NOFA), has been revised to clarify that recipients of Preservation Technical Assistance or Resident Capacity Grants are eligible applicants for Preservation Support Grant funds. The applicant must certify that it will perform activities described in its application, and the proscription against the applicant serving as a pass-through intermediary applies to administering allocations of both components of the Preservation Support Grant. These revised certifications are available from the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 6424, Rockville, MD 20850, telephone number: 1&hyph;800&hyph;955&hyph;2232. Please refer to FR&hyph;3613 and specify that you are seeking the revised certifications. However, applicants may also prepare, execute, and submit their own certifications for these two items, based on the following examples (these certifications may be combined): Exhibit 8_Certification As Chief Executive Officer of the organization identified below, I hereby certify that as an applicant for Preservation Support Grant funds, the organization will perform activities described in its application and will not serve as a pass-through intermediary to administer an allocation of the Preservation Support Grant. [Name of Organization] [Address of Organization] [Signature of Chief Executive Officer] [Date] [Print or Type Name and Title of CEO] Certification Regarding Ownership Interest As Chief Executive Officer of the organization identified below, I hereby certify that as an applicant for Preservation Support Grant funds, the organization and its affiliates do not have, and do not intend to seek, an ownership interest in developments that the organization would be assisting with these funds. [Name of Organization] [Address of Organization] [Signature of Chief Executive Officer] [Date] [Print or Type Name and Title of CEO] The Department also advises applicants that on the first page of Exhibit 1 in the application kit, item 4 should be corrected: (1) In the first box, to ask a resident-controlled group to indicate whether it is a local group; and (2) to delete from the second box the phrase ``with a majority of board participation by tenants in HUD-assisted projects.'' This change is needed to correct the discrepancy between the NOFA and the application kit definition of a CBO. The correct definition is in 24 CFR 248.101, which requires that the CBO maintain at least one-third of its governing board's membership for low-income neighborhood residents, other low-income community residents, or elected representatives of low-income neighborhood organizations. In addition, page 2 of Exhibit 1 in the application kit is to be deleted; that page was inadvertently included in the application kit and does not apply to this competition. Accordingly, the Department announces that the information collection requirements contained in FR Doc. 94&hyph;14344, the NOFA for Preservation Support Grants, published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30640), have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned control number 2502&hyph;0504. Further, FR Doc. 94&hyph;14344 is amended as follows: 1. On page 30640, column 2, the first sentence in the second paragraph under the heading DATES: is revised to read as follows: DATES: * * * The deadline for submission of applications is September 12, 1994. *␣*␣* 2. On page 30648, column 3, paragraphs 8 and 9 of Section V.C, ``Submission Requirements,'' are revised to read as follows: V. Grant Application Process * * * * * C. Submission Requirements * * * * * (8) Certification that the applicant and any of its affiliates do not have, and do not intend to seek an ownership interest in developments that the organization would be assisting with these funds; and (9) Other information and materials as may be described in the application kit, including a certification that the applicant will perform activities described in its application and will not serve as a pass-through intermediary to administer an allocation of the Preservation Support Grant. Authority: 42 U.S.C. 4101 et seq .; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). Dated: August 10, 1994. Jeanne K. Engel, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.
