It will be a crucial year for China to comprehensively promote the economic reform system and to make major breakthroughs in this regard. If we consider reform in the 1980's mainly as dismantling the old system -- or "demolishing old houses" -- then the main task in the next-phase of reform will be establishing a new system, or "constructing new buildings." Our current reform has begun to deepen, shifting our focus from single items to comprehensive and coordinated projects. We have shifted our attention to establishing totally new economic relations in an all-round manner rather than focusing on obtaining benefits from relatively independent reform measures. Deepened reform dictates that we have to wage arduous struggles to overcome tough problems. What are the major reform tasks facing us in 1994? According to the State Economic Restructuring Commission, after a long period of deliberation, study, and estimation, China will deepen reform in various fields in 1994 and will make breakthroughs in this regard. A series of reform programs includes macroeconomic reform in taxation, finance, investment, the foreign trade system, the enterprise system, social security, the housing system, the public servant system, the system of salaries for administrative organs and institutions, and prices. There are two important points in the many reform tasks: 1) Proceeding from changing operating mechanisms in state enterprises, we should strive to renovate the enterprise system, and should actively explore and seek effective ways to establish a modern enterprise system. 2) We should accelerate reform in taxation, finance, and the planning and investment systems, and we should make key progress in formulating macro-regulatory and controlling devices which are compatible with the requirements of a market economy. While focusing our efforts on these two main points, we should also make concerted efforts and speed up the establishment of a market system with essential-factor markets as the main form; we should expand and intensify reform in the social security and housing system; we should accelerate the pace of reform in the management of foreign trade and foreign exchanges; and we should actively deepen rural reform. By accomplishing these arduous reform missions, we aim to fulfill the following three objectives: -- We aim to establish a modern enterprise system whereby the requirements of a market economy are fulfilled, property rights are specified, rights and duties are defined, government and enterprises are separated, and scientific administrative methods are enforced. -- While specifically developing essential-factor markets, we aim to enhance a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market system. -- We aim to explore and establish positive and effective state macroregulatory and controlling systems and policies, and to formulate a set of statistical indicators for the national economy and a system of laws and regulations so as to regulate the total social demand and supply to remain basically balanced, and to optimize the economic structure in an effort to guide the national economy to progress in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. To accomplish these reform missions and fulfill the formulated reform objectives, experts from various sectors held that we must persistently implement the reform strategies in an all-round and coordinated manner. We should not only carry out reform as a coordinating component of the entire comprehensive design, but should also consider the arrangement of every reform measure in conjunction with the overall picture. China's reform has entered a phase where we should tackle formidable problems. Therefore, while implementing the strategies in an all-round and coordinated manner, we should also seize opportunities in reform and make major breakthroughs in various crucial links. We should make special efforts to carry out certain reforms which have crucial effects on transforming old systems into new ones, which have a relatively major impact on the overall situation, and which have certain adequate conditions. Additionally, we should strive to make greater efforts in this regard so as to achieve some breakthroughs. We should create conditions for those reforms which lack adequate conditions temporarily, and should actively enhance these conditions. Otherwise we will most probably miss the strategic moment and unnecessarily extend the transitional period of establishing a new economic system, thereby eventually increasing the risks and costs for reform. Responsible comrades of the State Economic Restructuring Commission sharply pointed out that extensive reform in 1994 is a complex and arduous systematic project. The reform will be deep and extensive, involving the readjustment of powers and interests in various sectors. To accomplish these reform missions, on the one hand we should have confidence in a definite victory and should be determined and unwavering so as to be definitely victorious at the first fight. On the other hand, we should also be adequately prepared psychologically for probable difficulties, should uphold scientific designs, should carefully conduct operations, and should promptly summarize experiences so as to avoid major mistakes. While analyzing favorable conditions for reforming the economic system in 1994, economists held that, first, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has further specified the direction and objectives of reform; theories on reform have been continually improved. Consequently, a favorable political environment has been formed. Second, after 15 years of reform and opening up, China has accumulated abundant reform experience which enables hundreds of millions of people to conscientiously join in the great course of reform. Reform has become more acceptable in people's concepts, resulting in a more favorable social environment and receptive public opinion. A gradual rise in the people's living standards and their strong urge to seek new systems and new issues have strengthened their enduring capacity for reform, thereby resulting in a relatively favorable psychological reception. After undergoing economic construction for several years and rapid economic progress for the past two consecutive years, China has considerably increased its comprehensive national strength and has accumulated a certain level of material goods. A strong domestic demand for investments and a steady but rising demand for consumer goods have provided a relatively strong "driving force for internal demand" for reform. All these factors have contributed to a conducive economic environment. We are in a new historic era of reform. The establishment of a socialist market economy, an unprecedented great event in the history of mankind, requires that we properly perform this task with unprecedented courage. That is why we said the year 1994 will be a glorious year for China's reform and opening up, and will also be a year for China to make more leaps and bounds in its economy.
