FR941222-2-00026 FR941222-2-00022 [Docket No. CP93&hyph;685&hyph;000] Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co., Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Tuscarora Pipeline Project December 16, 1994. The staffs of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the California State Lands Commission (SLC) have prepared this draft environmental impact report/environmental impact statement (EIR/EIS) on the natural gas pipeline facilities proposed by Tuscarora Gas Transmission Company (Tuscarora) in the above docket. The draft EIR/IS was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act. The FERC and SLC believe, subject to public comment, that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigation measures including receipt of necessary permits and approvals, has the potential to significantly impact the environment. The draft EIR/EIS evaluates alternatives to the proposal. The draft EIR/EIS assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed Tuscarora Pipeline Project, which includes the following facilities: •One 229-mile, 20 inch-diameter pipeline between Malin, Oregon and Tracy, Nevada (the Tuscarora mainline). The Tuscarora mainline would interconnect with the Pacific Gas Transmission Company's mainline at Malin; •One 4.42-mile, 4-inch-diameter lateral between the Tuscarora mainline and Alturas, California (the Alturas Lateral); •One 10.61-mile, 6-inch-diameter lateral between the Tuscarora mainline and a point near Susanville, California (the Susanville Lateral); •One 5.45-mile, 4-inch-diameter lateral between the Tuscarora mainline and the Sierra Army Depot near Herlong, California (the Herlong Lateral); •Five meter stations located in Alturas, Susanville, and Herlong (Sierra Army Depot), California; and near Spanish Springs and Tracy, Nevada; and •Twelve mainline valves.
