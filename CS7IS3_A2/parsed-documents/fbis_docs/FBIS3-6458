Pol Col [Police Colonel] Sanit Miphan, of the Tourist Police, said the terrorists, most of them Palestinians, usually arrive in Thailand through the southern provinces by way of Malaysia. "Once they arrive in the four southern provinces they destroy their fake Indian or Pakistani passports and live among the local Muslims, waiting for new sets of fake travel document," Sanit said. Many of them specialize in the making of bombs and accept commissions to carry out acts of terror and sabotage. "Afterwards, they usually flee the country through the southern provinces into Malaysia, and onto a third country using fake passports," he said. Sanit said several suspected terrorists were known to have taken refuge at some time or other in Bangkok's tourist district of Soi Nana Nua frequented by visitors from the Middle East, as well as various mosques in Bang Rak and Phra Khanong areas. He said police also kept a dossier on Middle Eastern gangsters active in Soi Nana and Bang Rak areas. A close watch was being kept on areas frequented by Middle Eastern visitors as part of the investigation into the discovery of a truckload of explosives yesterday. Sanit called on foreign tourists to report to police any foreigners they suspected of involvement in crime, and not to panic because of yesterday's discovery. Shortly after the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York City in February last year, there was speculation that some of the terrorists involved had slipped into Thailand and taken refuge for a time before leaving for a third country. The officer said there was insufficient evidence to establish a link between yesterday's discovery and the World Trade Centre tragedy.
