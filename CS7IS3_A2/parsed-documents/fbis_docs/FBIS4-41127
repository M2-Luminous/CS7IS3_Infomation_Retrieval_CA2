Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev reported about this to our Interfax correspondents Wednesday. Grachev made the statement after the ceremony of placing wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin Wall by the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry, due to the 53rd anniversary since the beginning of the Great Patriotic War - WWII. "If we reject the joint Russian-American exercises on the Totsk test range, we shall loose from the political point of view," declared Grachev. Despite a negative attitude towards these exercises on the part of the State Duma, Grachev is convinced that "the exercises should be conducted on the Totsk test range." He reported that he had sent a letter to State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin explaining his position. "These are not combined arms exercises but peace-keeping ones," Grachev emphasized. He pointed out that the total number of Russian armed forces participating in peace-making operations, including 3000 peacekeepers in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, is not more than 20,000 people. Grachev noted that understaffed detachments of land forces pose major problems to the Russian army. He explained the lack of soldiers by a weak legal base for the call up and inappropriate financing. The main thing what the army needs from the state is "to give money and to give people," Grachev said. "Currently we have not enough funds or forces in order to create the army about which we dream, however, the might of our army is growing with every passing day and I think that it will revive in a year of two," Grachev said.
