The Hungarian deputies told their German hosts that although the Partnership for Peace scheme was less than what East Central Europe wanted, it was more than this region had ever got before. The scheme does not draw new dividing lines in Europe but promotes the region's rapproachement to NATO, at the same time not making Russia feel that NATO is forging an alliance against it. Hungarian deputies asked Germany to help fill the Hungary-EC association agreement with genuine content, and promote Hungary's integration into the common European foreign and security policy. German negotiators said that admitting European Free Trade Association [EFTA] countries was now on the agenda in the European Union, a process that should end by January 1995. Then a Union conference will review experiences of new members, admissions, and the association agreements. Talks with the Visegrad countries on full membership will not start before 1997, Kovacs quoted his German partners as saying.
