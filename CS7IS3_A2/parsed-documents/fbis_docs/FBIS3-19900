The chancellor, who for more than 11 years has spent 14 to 16 hours a day wallowing in government business, has a firm opinion about the merry epicure: "He is lazy." It is not just Kohl who knows about the unresolved mountains of files of the president of the Constitutional Court. A "cordial unrelationship" links the two of them, according to one of Kohl's ministers. Herzog is by no means "Kohl's candidate of the heart." For the leader of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], the situation with the law professor, Herzog, is similar to that with the aristocrat, Richard von Weizsaecker. He did not want the one whom he got. An irony of history. No, Roman Herzog will not be a federal president with the chancellor's favor (if he does become president). The free thinker is self-confidently celebrating his independence. It was Tuesday of last week [8 March] in the Bonn Water Works, the makeshift plenary hall. They were freely discussing Herzog's candidacy and there was a general setting of boundaries by Kohl, by Weizsaecker, and by Heitmann. The friend of clear words contrasts his program to Kohl's nebulous rhetoric: "We must speak as clear as glass in this state." He himself adhered to unity at a time when that was not customary "in this land of ours," says Herzog. "In this land of ours," Kohl's patriotic formula until the cabaret performers ruined it for him. A scornful laugh goes through the hall. Once again Herzog got carried away with his sarcasm ("my worst fault"). Things that were taken for granted for 40 years must be examined. Forty years: that includes Kohl's time in office. In family policy, for example. Those without children ought to pay compensation for the families: "That will cost a lot of money." Herzog mentions Hannelore Roensch. After she made this proposal, the family minister had to accept a reprimand from Kohl. Herzog now nonchalantly vindicates her: "A demonstration," is how a CDU elector later judges his performance. Setting of boundaries, part two: Weizsaecker, who found the parties to be "obsessed with power" and who fed the displeasure with them, is corrected. Herzog: "The political and social stability of the last 40 years comes from our party system." Before that in an interview, the president of the court had accused the parties of a lack of capacity for integration and had warned against another Weimar. Was there something to that? Steffan Heitmann's clumsy ideas about national socialism were the last nail in his coffin. Herzog chats about the time of the Nazis without a written speech. Alluding to Oskar Lafontaine, he talks about secondary virtues that made concentration camps possible. Of course, Herzog admits affably, one can run a concentration camp with diligence and punctuality. But secondary virtues are supposed to be more than that: interpersonal relations, respect, politeness. "Then I would like to see the concentration camp that can be run that way." Performance of duty, punctuality, diligence--these virtues ought to be employed for human dignity and liberty. Herzog gets past the reefs but just barely. Afterwards electors say that they held their breath when they heard this passage. It awakens memories of Philipp Jenninger, who hit the wrong note in his rhetoric about national socialism and therefore had to be replaced as president of the Bundestag. But Herzog is not Henninger. Herzog's singular characteristics--they also include his sensitivity. The president can dish it out, but he cannot take it so well. Friedrich Karl Fromme, domestic-policy chief of the newspaper FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, took the candidate Heitmann under his wings. The editorial writer is now reprimanding Heitmann's successor Herzog as scarcely anyone else is. Fromme knows the scene of the jurists. Herzog knows that and therefore this hit him hard. And so he is getting revenge publicly with the publicists--in front of this team from the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union]. Fromme (Herzog does not mention his name, because that would be giving him too much honor) is a "nationally known sourpuss." Kohl, who eats up journalists, never went that far. When Richard von Weizsaecker came down from his aristocratic-presidential Olympus to accuse the parties of being obsessed with power, Norbert Bluem responded to him in DER SPIEGEL: "Welcome to the tumult, Mr. Federal President." Roman Herzog, the uncrowned interview king of recent weeks, has long since arrived in the tumult of the fast-paced altercation. Unemployment, integration of foreigners, Europe, family policy: Herzog knows the answers. In accordance with the traditional pattern, the altercation sometimes leans to the left and sometimes to the right. It is something that they cannot get hold of politically--an unpredictable factor for the CDU. Its program: Herzog is Herzog. The tempermental Bavarian by birth does not want to stay out of the daily political discussion. After all, he is one who speaks his mind. Where is it written in the constitution that a president must be a substitute emperor?
