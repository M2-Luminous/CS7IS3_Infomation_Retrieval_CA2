Statistics show that in the average villager's income in 1980 was 191.33 yuan; by 1985 this had climbed to 343.32 yuan, for an average annual increase of 12.4 percent. However, from 1988 to 1990 there was a decrease in income. In 1991 income recovered and reached 374.33 yuan, but between 1985 and 1991 the rate of annual increase was only 1.8 percent. At the same time this was taking place, the disparity in incomes was also increasing. A. Viewed nationwide, the disparity in incomes between rural households has increased. In 1980 the Gini coefficient for rural village income 0.2366; the multiple between the lowest and highest levels of income was 3.16. By 1988 the Gini coefficient had risen to 0.3024 and the multiple between high and low had risen to 4.68, and this trend has become even more obvious in more recent years. (Statisticians commonly use the Gini coefficient to represent the degree of inequality in the distribution of income; the greater the Gini coefficient the more unequal the distribution.) B. The disparity in villager incomes between regions has increased. Using the national average villager's income as 1, then in 1980 the index of income for the eastern, central and western sections respectively was 1.303, 0.964 and 0.887, while in 1990 it was respectively 1.431, 0.890 and 0.822. C. The disparity between urban and rural incomes again increased. The relevant materials show that urban residents' income has increased from the 1984 ratio of 1.7:1 to the 1990 ratio of 2.2::1. This has caused a relative decrease in the rural villagers' standard of living, with urban residents' consumption ratio climbing from 2.3:1 in 1984 to 2.8:1 in 1990. Causes of the increased disparity in incomes stemmed primarily from the fact that changes in the prices of agricultural products were not favorable to agriculture. In 1989 the agricultural product procurement price index rose 15 percent but the rural industrial product retail price index rose 18.7 percent. In 1990 the agricultural product procurement price index suffered an overall decline of 3.5 percent while rural village industrial products prices rose 4.6 percent. In 1991 agricultural product prices again fell by 2 percent, while rural industrial product prices rose 3 percent. This exacerbated the disparity in urban-rural incomes. Other major factors creating the imbalance in incomes between rural households and between rural districts were the tremendous changes which had taken place in the relative ratios of agricultural and industrial enterprises in the villages of each locality and the relative ratios between agricultural and non-agricultural enterprises taken up by the rural households. Still another important problem was the ruthless assessment of payments from rural villagers. According to rough statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, nationwide in 1991 in cases where statistics could be compiled, villagers involuntarily paid out administrative fees amounting to some 1.77 billion yuan, fines of all kinds amounting to some 2.31 billion yuan, collective assessments of 4.1 billion and miscellaneous other expenses of 3.81 billion, or an average of 13.8 yuan per person. On the one hand, these expenses were not levied according to one's level of income, and thus increased the discrepancies in incomes. On the other hand, the economic expansion in each locality was uneven, and so in the more developed eastern sections a large portion of the various impositions were borne by the town and township enterprises, while in the central and western sections of the country where township enterprises were not so well developed, the burden was borne by the individual households. The discrepancies in rural incomes brings with it some serious problems we cannot overlook. First of all, it effects the amount of hope that the masses hold for the reforms. The final success of the economic reforms depends upon the support and cooperation of the broad masses of the people. However, the amount of support the people will give and the fervor with which they cooperate are determined by the amount of hope they place in the reforms, that is, what are they going to get out of the reforms. If the inequality of income situation worsens exceedingly, there is the possibility that our nation's broad masses of farmers will lose their faith in economic reform. Second, it intensifies the blind outflow of labor from under-developed regions and the outflow of investment capital. If the motive force for the movement of the factors of production comes primarily from the difference in remuneration for the factors of production in different localities, then, if this difference is overly large, it can cause this movement to become excessively severe and it could become a blind movement. For the past several years, because of the difference in development between the eastern and central and western sections of the country, the differences in farmer incomes was exaggerated, and created the "flood of workers" which exerted tremendous pressure upon transportation and basic facilities of some cities: this should not be overlooked. Another problem to which attention should be paid is the flow of large amounts of capital from the central and western areas to the eastern coastal regions, creating a "vicious cycle of poverty" in the central and western areas. Third, it has restricted agricultural production, especially grain output. Within the overall trend of enlarging differences in income, the ones' whose income situation changes for the worse are commonly the households engaged in agriculture and the agricultural areas, especially the grain farmers and grain producing regions. This situation harms agricultural investment capabilities and the enthusiasm of those working agriculture. The most alarming aspect is that there has been a tremendous overall decrease so far this year in the amount of capital inputs such as agricultural machinery and fertilizers. Because of inadequate demand, the agricultural machinery industry is in serious decline, and agriculture's production capacity will of necessity suffer corresponding harm. The following policies are formulated to solve the problem of the overly great differences in farmers' incomes. 1. Sped up the progress of market oriented reforms. At the present time, the income disparities between farming households, between regions and between urban and rural is mainly created by the disparity in income between the agricultural and the non-agricultural production sectors. Thus, we must utilize the market mechanisms to reduce the differences, and thus we must let the market play its role to the fullest extent, and raise the earnings of those engaged in agriculture. Within the short term, while the grain market is gradually opened up, the price of grain can be allowed to rise to the level of the international market. Over the long term, our nation should avoid a long term situation in which our grain prices are higher than international market levels. This is say, we should maintain an appropriate level of grain imports, allow our farmers to plant economic crops. This is the basic method of solving the farmers' low income problem. 2. Continue to encourage the expansion of town and township enterprises under all forms of ownership systems. We must employ legislation to promote and protect the establishment and growth of private enterprise, turn the income of the high income levels into savings, to create employment opportunities for the rural excess labor forces. The most pressing need is to establish legislative protection for the property rights of private enterprises. 3. The state and all levels of society must support the growth of village and township enterprises in the central and western regions. The state should truly focus on investments and credit for the village and township enterprises in the central and western regions and at the same time organize the various governmental departments to cooperate with these regions within the limits of their mission and establish village and township enterprise development zones. 4. In macroscopic terms, we must begin to implement a redistribution policy. That is, we must speed up the reform of the tax collection system, create better tax legislation, and begin collecting individual income taxes in those areas where the conditions are right. The principle of this sort of redistribution of income policy is to increase equability on the condition of not harming efficiency and to effect the common enrichment of the rural villages while admitting the existence of differences.
