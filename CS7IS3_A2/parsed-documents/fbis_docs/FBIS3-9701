Last Friday the president would not appoint him to Waldemar Pawlak's government. [Rosati] "Having been faced with the decision made by the president, I intend to withdraw my candidacy. I am only waiting for the possibility of having a conversation with Prime Minister Pawlak and Chairman Kwasniewski. I want to inform them about my intention to withdraw as a candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and minister of finance, and I would like to hear their opinions on the subject." [Announcer] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski, Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] leader, after a one-hour meeting, decided that Dariusz Rosati would remain the coalition candidate for the vacant posts. Initially, we obtained this information unofficially because the left-wing leader [Kwasniewski] left the Council of Ministers' Office by a different gate from the one where journalists were waiting for him. Later, in the Sejm, Aleksander Kwasniewski locked himself in his office. In the end, not seeing any other possibility of avoiding talking to media representatives, he left the Sejm through a window. Later, however, the leader of the Left answered some questions from journalists. [Kwasniewski] "He is still, I say it clearly, the candidate of the prime minister and the SLD. There will be talks held on this issue shortly. We will see what transpires." [Unidentified correspondent] "Who will the talks be with?" [Kwasniewski] "The president, of course." [Correspondent] We asked Dariusz Rosati if it is possible, after a conversation with the coalition leaders, he would change his mind and continue as the candidate for the government. [Rosati] "Theoretically, one can imagine such a development of the situation and such a fundamental change of circumstances that would allow me to remain the candidate. But, let us be honest, such a development of the situation is very unlikely. I cannot imagine a situation in which the minister of finance and deputy prime minister responsible for economic affairs would be in conflict with the president." [Correspondent] "Have you considered the possibility of withdrawing Mr. Rosati's candidacy and naming Mr. Paga [head of the Securities Commission] as a candidate?" [Kwasniewski] "No, we will not withdraw Mr. Rosati's candidacy." [Correspondent] "Do you consider Mr. Paga suitable?" [Kwasniewski] "We will not withdraw Mr. Rosati's candidacy."
