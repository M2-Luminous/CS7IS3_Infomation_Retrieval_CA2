The growth rate of the entire budget will remain relatively low since serious revenue shortages are certain for fiscal 1994, but public works expenditures will be increased to boost the economy. The total amount of public works expenditures for fiscal 1994 will be calculated as the sum of general public works expenditures, disaster-relief funds, and Y1.23 trillion in interest-free loans from funds raised by the profits from selling stocks of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). Among the government agency budget requests submitted on 31 August 1993, public works plans for fiscal 1994 totaled Y8.939 trillion. In consideration of the current economic situation, the MOF intends to approve almost all budget requests from government agencies. In addition, the public works budget will include funds for constructing nonpublic subways, which is usually classified as "miscellaneous projects." To reinforce subway networks, the Ministry of Transportation is asking for Y58.5 billion for urban railway projects, and Y2.6 billion for the new-town railway project of the Housing and Urban Development Corporation. The MOF intends to allot about Y60 billion for these projects, with the amount of the publics work budget totaling Y8.99 trillion. The 5-percent growth of the public works budget is the largest since fiscal 1988 (up 19.7 percent), when NTT stock loans were introduced to the initial budget.
