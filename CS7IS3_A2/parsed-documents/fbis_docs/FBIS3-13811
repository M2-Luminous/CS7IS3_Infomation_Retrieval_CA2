Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told us yesterday that the obstacles to peace created by the Hebron massacre are not the last ones we will have to overcome. At the same time, Peres expects the negotiations to resume soon: [Peres] I believe that official talks with the four parties will resume in Washington in early April. [Eisenstein] Peres said that the proposals conveyed by the Israeli delegation to Tunis are the proposals of the Norwegian representatives, with which the PLO is basically familiar. Peres noted that the proposal to deploy Palestinian policemen in Hebron is also on the agenda: [Peres] We still have to work out this proposal. It is not an exact repetition of the previous situation. We want something that will also take into consideration the sensitivities and concerns of the local residents. This force must be under Israeli authority, however, because it is inconceivable to have two military authorities in the same city. [Eisenstein] Regarding Peres' scheduled meeting with 'Arafat in Paris on 24 March, the foreign minister said the issue has not been finalized. [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 21 March on page A1 carries a report by 'Aqiva Eldar on Peres' appearance before Labor activists in Tel Aviv on 20 March, adding the following: "Peres stated that Israel will not compromise on Jerusalem, which will remain under Israeli sovereignty and is a 'closed case' from the political point of view but remains open in terms of the religious aspects." [Writing on page 2 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 21 March, Nehama Dowek reports on Peres' remarks on the same occasion. She quotes Peres as saying: "We will not admit to not having the right to live in all parts of Eretz Yisra'el. We have that right, but the question is what sense is there in exercising it." Peres added: "Goldstein's act raises questions about the possibility of coexistence between settlers and Arabs. The settlement of 400 Jews among 120,000 Arabs in Hebron illustrates the magnitude of this problem. We must decide what is the right solution. The settlement map must be a purely Israeli decision rather than the result of pressure created by the negotiations."]
