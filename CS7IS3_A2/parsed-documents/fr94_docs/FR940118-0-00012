FR940118-0-00012 FR940118-0-00004 Under the general rating criteria for urinary frequency in ยง4.115a, we had proposed separate sets of evaluation criteria for daytime and nighttime frequency. The criteria for daytime frequency were assigned evaluations of 40, 20, and 10 percent. For nighttime frequency, awakening to void five or more times per night was proposed as 20 percent, awakening to void three to four times was assigned 10 percent, and one to two times was non-compensable. One commenter felt that the evaluations for nighttime frequency should be higher than proposed, while another believed that the distinction between daytime and nighttime frequency is artificial and should be eliminated. Separate criteria for nighttime frequency were proposed since a patient may be more likely to report this symptom to an examining physician, especially in the early stages of renal disease. Upon further review, however, VA agrees that nighttime frequency is just as indicative of significant disease as daytime frequency, and that different evaluation levels are not warranted. We have therefore incorporated the three levels originally proposed for nighttime frequency with the 40, 20, and 10 percent levels under daytime frequency. Instances in which a person is awakened to void only once a night, however, have not been made compensable, since this degree of frequency does not, in our judgment, impose a disability significant enough to warrant the payment of compensation. One commenter felt that the frequency of the need to change absorbent materials under the criteria for rating voiding dysfunction is not a useful measure of incontinence because: (1) The changing of absorbent materials does not accurately quantify the degree of disability, (2) the wearing of absorbent materials may be inappropriate for paraplegics, and (3) there is no objective method to determine the frequency of the need to change absorbent materials. We do not concur. A person who needs to change absorbent materials often has a greater loss of voluntary control than one who needs changes less frequently. The frequency of changes can be objectively reported either by the veteran or the person providing care, with the frequency of the need for such changes determined by an examining physician. These criteria represent, in our judgment, a satisfactory means to measure urinary incontinence and, since no reasonable alternative has been suggested, we have elected to retain them. For some persons, wearing absorbent materials may be inappropriate; such people require the use of a catheter or some other means to compensate for the loss of control. As previously discussed, the criteria at the 60 percent level addressing the use of such an appliance are adequate to evaluate the disabilities of those for whom the use of absorbent materials is inappropriate.
