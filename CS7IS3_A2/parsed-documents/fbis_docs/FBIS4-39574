A restaurant was opened on the Arbat recently. There was the usual noise, fuss, shouting, and free refreshments. Frenzied crowds of people -- it was nearly a job for the mounted police. A launch! Privatization itself, unlike an individual restaurant, entered our lives quietly and unnoticed. Three versions of the law on privatization were submitted for discussion. The Supreme Soviet voted for the draft submitted by S. Krasavchenko -- the then chairman of the committee for economic reform and ownership. And that was that -- no noise, no shouting, no applause. The big launches started later. Was a blueprint for privatization in Russia formulated? I can testify that it was, I have kept in my archives a copy that was prepared for the press. But Krasavchenko himself persuaded the leadership that wide public discussion would be detrimental to the cause, so the "blueprint" never saw the light of day. Russia was pushed into privatization without a rudder, without sails, and blindfold. The privatization check -- the voucher -- made an even more modest and unassuming entrance. When parliament was on its summer recess, the president brought forth the voucher by means of a presidential edict, dispatching to oblivion the Law "On Nominal Privatization Accounts and Investments." The deputies, on returning from their vacations, naturally made a fuss, got indignant, and instigated an investigation. But it was too late -- the voucher privatization machinery had already begun to turn. This summer the voucher celebrates its birthday -- it is two years old. Its time is up, voucher privatization is ending, and monetary privatization is beginning. A good time to sum up the results and survey the prospects. Fond Memories of the Central Statistical Administration... The results, in brief, are as follows. By 1 January 1994 88,577 enterprises had been privatized, or 56.5 percent of autonomous enterprises. The proportion of privatized enterprises in ferrous metallurgy and chemical and petrochemical industry was in excess of 50 percent, in light industry -- 98 percent, and in trade -- 70 percent. Of 71 million people employed in the national economy, 29.5 million work in the nonstate sector of the economy. Mr. Chubays and some of his supporters draw a hasty conclusion from these figures: Privatization has taken place in Russia and its results are irreversible. And the formal quantitative results appear to confirm this. But the situation is by no means so unequivocal, if you look at how ownership "works" and what proportion of the volume of industrial production it accounts for (Table 1). As you can see, the real results of privatization are by no means as impressive as "Messrs. Privatizers" would wish. State enterprises still hold a leading position in the economy, and it is they that produce the vast bulk of gross domestic product. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Here are some results of economic activity in the countryside by enterprises under various forms of ownership -- Table 2. [In the following table, column A represents "Number of farms (thousands)"; column B: "Gross output (billion rubles)"; column C: "Proportion of production (percentage)"; and column D: "Proportion of land occupied"] Table 2. Proportion of volume of agricultural production accounted for by enterprises under various forms of ownership (1993) A B C D Total 19,597.1 22,300 100 100 Agricultural 27.1 13,826 62 90 enterprises Peasant (private) 270.0 446 2 5 farms Personal plots, 19,300.0 8,028 36 5 including orchards and truck farms One can add to this sorry picture the fact that the intolerable conditions, lack of equipment, and the authorities' indifference and complacency have resulted in the mass collapse of private [fermerskikh] farms: 5,000 in 1992, 14,000 in 1994.... The only sphere in which privatization can be considered more or less to have worked is the trade sphere and retailing. You can see from Table 3 what the proportion of various forms of trade looks like in terms of the total volume of trade turnover. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

As you can see, neither fundamental changes in ownership relations nor major structural changes have yet taken place. Nor have new incentives to labor emerged. That is why it has not been possible to halt the decline in production, which in recent months has become disastrous. But what does privatization look like in its "social aspect"? What are its social parameters? Have the "architects of privatization" achieved the much-publicized goals enshrined in the privatization program? "Formation of a Class of Private Property-Owners..." The formation of a class of private property-owners was seen in the privatization program as the main priority objective of reform and the guarantee of its irreversibility. According to the country's chief "privatizer," A. Chubays, this task has been successfully resolved. "Nobody has disputed, not even our fiercest opponents, that there are at least 40 million private property-owners in Russia today," he stated proudly at the parliamentary hearings in the State Duma. Is it really 40 million? Nearly one-third of the country's population and almost half its working citizens! Where do these figures come from? On closer examination it emerges that all those who have taken part in the process of conversion to share ownership are classed as "private property-owners." If you have just one share you are a property-owner, a capitalist, an active supporter and champion of "market reforms." But that, if you will forgive me, is...cheating. The facts about the rapidly progressing property stratification of Russian society are well known. According to State Committee for Statistics reports, in January 1994 52.6 million people were living below the minimum survival wage level and 26.3 million below the poverty line. (Incidentally, the government immediately "drew its conclusions": The State Committee for Statistics was given a dressing down, and by February the unseemly picture had changed strikingly: The number of those below the minimum survival wage level had fallen to 24.8 million and those below the poverty line to 8.5 million. What success -- and for virtually no effort!) The country's internal market is shrinking rapidly. Television sets, refrigerators, and sophisticated household equipment is gathering dust in the warehouses -- not because people do not want to buy them. They would be happy to buy them! They would snap them up! But they do not have the money. Consumption of basic food products has fallen below all limits, by virtually 50 percent. The Chubays privatization has not created, but destroyed, the middle class -- the natural bulwark of democracy, ownership, the rule-of-law state, and the centrist policy. Cultural figures (with the exception of those who serve the regime), doctors, teachers, scientists, and workers and employees at state enterprises have sunk into an abyss of poverty. The Chubays privatization has not created, but destroyed, the property-owner. The role of the rank-and-file share-owner in the management of production is even less today than at the earlier "socialist" enterprise. The distance between the worker and the product of his labor has not lessened, but increased. The famous "grandmother" for whom Chubays shows such touching concern has certainly discovered what a "dividend" is -- the word is on everyone's lips. What a great discovery! Why should she have known, before, that 3 percent annual interest on her savings bank investment was a dividend too? But how was she, an old woman, supposed to guess, when she went off to vote for Yeltsin and Chubays, that they would deceive her so shamelessly? The predatory privatization casts an entirely different light on the universally slandered and despised Soviet "bureaucrat" -- the manager. Why? As a rule he knew his job, he was afraid of the boss, and he strove to forge a career. He received a wage "no higher than the wage of a skilled worker" and he took bribes in moderation (if at all). Nowadays they know nothing, do nothing, and are afraid of nobody. I say nothing about bribes. Despite the dense curtain of lies and "market" demagoguery, it is gradually getting through to people that they were robbed. True, under socialism they were not called "shareholders," but everyone, if you think about it, was a share-owner in that giant enterprise called the "Soviet Union." Everyone received a guaranteed wage of not less than the minimum established by the state, he was guaranteed free education, health care, travel passes, benefits.... Just imagine for a moment that back then, "under stagnation," an entire enterprise's wages had been held back for three or four months. Unfortunately, our giant enterprise was not always well managed and it lost out in the worldwide competition with the West in the sphere of technical progress. Infringements of human rights occurred in it, and the press trumpeted them across the world. Today it is silent. Because you could hardly find another country where human rights are infringed the way they are in Russia today. In order to rectify matters, it was certainly not necessary to knock the "enterprise" down to its foundations and leave it to the four winds. First of all the traitors and sons of bitches wrecked the Soviet Union, contrary to the people's will, and now, like squirrels, they are dragging into their holes whatever remains from the wreckage. The onlookers who were present were rewarded with a piece of paper -- the voucher -- so as to maintain as long as possible the illusion that in the shareout of the stolen goods, you too will receive some little crumb.
