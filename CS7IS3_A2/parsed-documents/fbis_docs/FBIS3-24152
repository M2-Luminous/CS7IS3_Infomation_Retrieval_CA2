A law on elections is a law on power. When the democrats sat down at the quasi-negotiating table with Durdynets, Kotsyuba, and Novitskiy, they should have understood that the "party of power" would adhere to the agreements previously reached between the blocs of "democrats" and "nondemocrats" only as long as they pertained to secondary aspects. Meanwhile, power is of the essence. On the whole, all the "amendments and additions" in which the adopted law differs from the draft pursue just one objective: to stay in power. Five real mechanisms have been envisioned to accomplish this: 1. Reelection of the powers that be for new terms and the "sneaking in" of new people who are "ours." 2. An opportunity to manipulate the votes of the electorate. 3. A consistent antiparty tenor. 4. The mechanism of financing the elections. 5. The creation of an appropriate informational environment. The Reelection of the Powers That Be for New Terms and the "Sneaking In" of New People Who Are "Ours" The first conclusion is: The law has been "manufactured" to favor not even the nomenklatura as such, but just one of its groups, namely--the group of the speaker of the parliament. Article 14 of the draft provided that "the deputy chairman and nine members of the commission shall be appointed by the president of Ukraine" to the Central Electoral Commission, whereas the law (Article 15) says that "the Central Electoral Commission consisting of the chairman, two deputy chairmen, a secretary, and 11 members of the commission shall be confirmed by the Supreme Council of Ukraine upon presentation by the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The situation is unique: In essence, Ukraine is the only state in the world in which the executive authorities themselves conduct the election of the executive authorities, and actually--the parliamentary majority, which strives to rob not only the parties and the press but also "competitors" from the opposite group of the nomenklatura of as much influence on the conduct of the elections as possible. To a considerable degree, the vain attempts of the nomenklatura to create legislation are focused on a search for a secure way out of the trap into which it has driven itself by passing the decision on the "professional character" of the parliament. It automatically follows from the above that, from the moment the new parliament is elected, neither the directors, nor the kolkhoz chairmen, nor the generals, nor the administrators of the mass media will be able to "shake loose" state subsidies, at least not directly while holding at the same time positions as managers of establishments in the national economy and as members of parliament. However, the nomenklatura cannot yield the parliamentary "battlefield" in the struggle for state funds; therefore, the issue of the need to have "one of our own" in parliament arises. Let us imagine the logic of behavior of a common "worker" (soldier, kolkhoz peasant) in a situation in which his immediate commander (director, kolkhoz chairman) does not quit his job at a certain point before the elections, but merely proclaims his obligation to resign in the event he is elected a people's deputy. If we disregard the touching desire of the current community of people's deputies to protect their director colleagues or their people against the threat of losing their positions in the case of an election fiasco, the goal of this "innovation" in the law becomes more transparent: It is hard to imagine that any "worker" will have the slightest desire to openly come out against the director-candidate at a conference of the labor collective: In the event the manager is not elected a deputy, he will resume his professional duties but, rest assured, with an excellent recollection of who precisely interfered with his occupying the "sweet" seat of a deputy. The revenge scenario is completely up to the director's imagination: He controls leave pay and days off, duty assignments and vouchers, sick pay, and apartment waiting lists. "Our Man in the Parliament": The Legend of a Labor Collective The so-called "labor collective" (TK) claims the role of the "horse" that must carry the nomenklatura people between the rock and the hard place--the desire to receive credit and lack of opportunity for direct representation in the parliament. Incidentally, this notion is without parallel in any legislation of the democratic world in whose labor laws employers, hired workers, and trade unions are very clearly separated. It is a thankless endeavor to roll them into one. How is it that the notion of "labor collective" has migrated from the Ukrainian post-Soviet labor legislation into electoral legislation? If it were not enough that the Law on Elections does not define the labor collective, even the definitions that are found in three other laws provide either an ideologized or a purely production-oriented definition of the labor collective--the "Constitution" ("an element of the political system of the country," "a community of people who are free of exploitation"), the Code of Labor Law ("all citizens taking part in the operation of an enterprise on the basis of a labor contract, bargain, or agreement"), and the Law on Enterprises ("the collective of any enterprise, regardless of form of ownership and number of employees"). Not one of the laws assigns a political and legal role to the labor collective. The demagogic argument that "a person at the place of employment knows better who will protect his interests" is called upon to conceal the real role assigned by the nomenklatura to the labor collective--to manipulate the interests of production in favor of political interests, and then not even its own political interests, but those of the management. The Law on Elections (Article 23, Point 7) also envisions a specific mechanism for manipulating the will of the labor collective. In particular, "when a candidate for deputy is nominated by a labor collective, a petition shall be signed on behalf of the collective by an individual so authorized by a meeting or a conference." It is not noted how many members of the labor collective must be present at the meeting and what particulars should be recorded in the minutes of the conference--that is, everything that is indicated in the Law on Political Parties and everything that distinguishes the latter favorably from the election law. Once again, at issue is the fact that the nomenklatura has simplified the procedure for nominating its candidate as much as possible rather than the antiparty tenor of the election law. Methods for Manipulating the Votes and the Production of "Dead Souls" Chapters regulating the operation of precinct electoral commission have undergone the most amendments and additions, which have wiped out the potential democratic nature of the law. This is not surprising: Ultimately, it is in specific precincts that victory or defeat in an election is decided. The introduction of the so-called voter card on a pattern used in France was one of the most important aspects of the voting procedure proposed in the draft which would prevent abuse of votes. The card was supposed to be numbered; one-half of it was to be traded in for a ballot, and the second half was to be retained by the voter, which hampers potential trickery considerably. In the law (Article 40), the voter card magically turned into the "ballot" for the receipt of which a citizen signs before voting. However, no mechanism is envisioned which would subsequently obstruct the replacing of one ballot with another. A second opportunity to manipulate votes is built into Article 41 of the law. Article 42 of the draft regulates in detail the early voting procedure. If a voter changes the location "of his sojourn during the period between the production of the lists of voters for public familiarization and the election day," "the precinct electoral commission shall, at the request of the voter and upon the presentation of a passport or another document certifying his identity and the voter card (invitation), issue a ballot for which the voter shall sign on the voter roll, and shall mark the date of voting, ...the ballot filled out by the voting person shall be placed by him in a ballot box sealed with lead or wax, ...the ballot box shall be kept by the precinct electoral commission and opened on the general election day." In the law, we see in Article 41 only that "if a voter changes the location of his sojourn during the period between the production of the lists of voters for public familiarization and the election day, he may vote early." The absence of clear-cut regulations on procedures for early voting in the law suggests the thought that a "loophole" is also envisioned here. There is nothing standing in the way of a few hundred nonexistent voters--"dead souls"--voting "early," and there is no mechanism that would make such voting impossible. Possible abuses of the votes of servicemen should be placed in a category by themselves. Thus, the provision on the opportunity for servicemen in compulsory service to vote at the location of their permanent residence or conscription which was envisioned by the draft was "dropped" from the law. Instead, Article 20 "Voter Rolls and Procedures for Drawing Them Up," which regulates drawing up the rolls of voter-servicemen, says that "on 26 February the commanders of military units must bring voter rolls to election precincts." However, it was providently "forgotten" that a military unit (that is, regiment-level or higher) is itself an election precinct and, consequently, the commanders should bring these lists to themselves. If we "tie" this to restrictions on conducting propaganda in military units, which the law also envisions, it will become clear that most likely no effective control at all will be exercised over the real number of voter-soldiers and the freedom of the expression of their will. It is possible to manipulate the votes of the electorate not only by using "early voters," "four-month voters," and the military. If this turns out to be insufficient, the nomenklatura may use another method which Article 42 "Vote Counting at Polling Places" suggests is possible. Point 6 of the article says the minutes of vote counting shall be compiled in triplicate: One copy shall be sent to the district electoral commission, another shall remain at the polling station, and the third shall be displayed for public inspection. Under the circumstances, Western experts consider possible a recurrence of the so-called "Romanian scenario" whereby the first sheet is stolen, the second damaged, and the third forged. That is to say, three copies of the minutes are clearly not enough. However, "if they light up the stars, then someone needs it that way...." This is vividly confirmed by the fact that proposals to draw up five copies of the minutes, two of which would be kept by representatives of the public designated by consensus, did not gain the support of the majority in the Supreme Council. The Mechanism of Financing the Elections It is common knowledge that financing "governs" elections. Obviously, this issue could not escape the attention of the nomenklatura. The law (Article 36, Point 4) specifies that the size of the proprietary electoral fund of a candidate for deputy should not exceed 10 times the minimum salary. It is clear that it is impossible to conduct elections with this kind of money; the authors of the draft also understood this. For this reason, a total of 15 points were "built into" the draft, of which the parliamentary majority kept only eight. For the most part, norms that were supposed to prevent abuses during the election campaign were omitted: It was proposed to set the size of the proprietary fund at 500 minimum wages (an amount with which one could at least try to accomplish something); there was a mechanism for the rejection by a candidate of nonmonetary "presents" that compromise him, for example, paper for printing propaganda materials. A restriction was set forth on the transfer of funds from legal entities and individuals. However, the majority did not pass these wordings, most likely striving to achieve a double objective: to use the money of state enterprises in the election campaign themselves, and to create a situation in which democrats whose search for independent sources of financing immediately became illegal could be compromised. To be sure, the requirement that data on financing be released 20 days after the elections remains, but will it be possible to verify such data? Besides, will this verification make sense given that its results cannot influence recognition or nonrecognition of deputy powers? Since it is clear that in terms of the number of those willing to taste the bread of deputy per capita Ukraine is coming to rank among the first in the world, due financing for the election campaign will become one of the crucial factors of election victories. Creation of an Appropriate Informational Environment Responsibility for informing the public about the course of the elections fully devolves on the electoral commissions, that is, on Plyushch's people. Thus, it is envisioned that a candidate's electoral platform must be published in the local state mass media. However, nothing stands in the way of publishing the platform of one candidate, say, on 1 February, and that of his competitor--on 24 March, that is, three days before the elections. A scenario is also possible whereby the centralized printing of propaganda materials 20 days before the elections in the amount of 2,000 copies per candidate turns from an apparent benefit into the opposite. This may happen if someone makes a mistake in the last name of the candidate, inserts the wrong picture, or confuses something else. The law does not even mention whether it is mandatory to have the materials printed again at the expense of the state and how quickly this should be done. The fact that the parliamentary majority has not passed something mandatory for the nonstate mass media, too, is perhaps due to the parliamentary majority still not believing in the reality of private newspapers and TV and radio broadcasting companies influencing the population, rather than to the fact that the state has learned to understand the difference between private and state property (let us recall the situation involving commercial banks). However, noteworthy "homework" may also be found in the chapters on the operation of the mass media. Thus, Article 18 of the draft, "Organization of Work of the Electoral Commissions" says that "all meetings of electoral commissions are held publicly." The provision concerning all "publicity" was dropped from Article 17 of the law. Instead, "the mandatory notification of all members of the electoral commission about the time and location of a meeting" is ordained, but nothing is said about "mandatory notifications" for journalists, representatives of political parties, and foreign observers. It is not ruled out that they will simply "forget" to notify some disloyal journalists. That the parliament will operate on a professional basis is the most surprising point under the circumstances from among everything enumerated. Nothing stood in the way of the already mentioned directors using an "inseparable bond with the masses" as an argument in favor of the need for a people's deputy to work in production, as they have done in the case of nominating candidates from labor collectives. However, rumors about the number of supporters for combining the art of kitchen maid (on the principal job) with that of member of parliament (during time off from the principal job) increasing catastrophically in the Supreme Council may yet come true in some masterpieces from the electoral kitchen, which we are eagerly awaiting.
