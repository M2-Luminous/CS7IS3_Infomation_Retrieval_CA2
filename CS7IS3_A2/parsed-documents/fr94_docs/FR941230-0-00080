FR941230-0-00080 FR941230-0-00017 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 641 [Docket No. 94113&hyph;4354; I.D. 110194A] RIN 0648&hyph;AH33 Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico; 1995 Red Snapper Specifications AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In accordance with the framework procedure for adjusting management measures of the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), NMFS issues this final rule to reduce the daily bag limit for red snapper from seven to five fish, increase the minimum allowable size of red snapper from 14 inches (35.6 cm) to 15 inches (38.1 cm) for persons subject to the bag limit, and delay the opening of the commercial fishery for red snapper until February 24, 1995. The intended effects of this rule are to maintain the annual total allowable catch (TAC) specifications for red snapper, to prevent overfishing of red snapper, and to ensure that the commercial red snapper fishery is open when demand for fresh fish is at its highest. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995, except that §§641.4(o)(3), 641.7(x), and 641.30 are effective January 1, 1995, through February 23, 1995. ADDRESSES: A final regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) is available from Robert Sadler, Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, FL 33702. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Sadler, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 641. The FMP provides for the Council's annual review and proposed adjustment of certain specifications for the red snapper fishery, such as TAC, bag limits, and other management measures. This final rule will implement those specifications for 1995 that were approved by NMFS. The background and rationale for the measures in this final rule were contained in the proposed rule (59 FR 60124, November 22, 1994) and are not repeated here. Comments and Responses
