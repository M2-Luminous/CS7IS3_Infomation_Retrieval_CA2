This is an entirely wrong concept." With this, I agree. However, Lu's reasoning is incorrect. Hong Kong people want to practise capitalism and much more. We also want to enjoy a system of representative government, human rights and the rule of law. It is precisely because China has an authoritarian government and low respect for human rights, and because it practises rule by man, that people believe that only when the Chinese government becomes less repressive and more democratic will Hong Kong's lifestyle and freedoms be guaranteed. In limiting Hong Kong's desires to capitalism, Lu misunderstands the territory. Chinese leaders may believe that making money is all Hong Kong people care about and that it is, therefore, their reason for wanting to retain the economic system beyond 1997. But the leaders are wrong. The "one country, two systems" concept also means our social, cultural and developing political systems. Lu said on May 6 there would always be a "handful" who thought they could "turn Hong Kong into a political city in order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics". He warned that Hong Kong would then be of "negative value" to China. On May 8, Lu clarified that statement to pro-China trade unionists, saying Hong Kong should not become a base to convert China to democracy. Socialism and democracy are, after all, not mutually exclusive, but Chinese leaders are accustomed to authoritarian rule. The director really meant that China is hostile to democracy in Hong Kong because it fears that democracy might spread. Because of this fear, Beijing sees attitudes towards democracy in Hong Kong as the dividing line between its friends and supposed enemies. Those who are outspoken in their support of democracy have already, in effect, been warned that they will not he allowed to hold any political office after 1997. They are accused of being unpatriotic, even subversive. And perhaps the issue of human rights is also becoming a measure of loyalty to the motherland. Human rights serve to define the relationship between the government and the governed, and to limit the powers of the state over the individual. Individual rights are dangerous to Beijing because they promote values which make Hong Kong the "political city" that Chinese leaders fear. For example, Beijing must find irksome the continued support for the release of the Ming Pao reporter, Xi Yang, who was jailed for 12 years for allegedly stealing state banking secrets. No doubt China's leaders are also beginning to find threatening the continued call for a human rights commission in Hong Kong. Lu said such a body would contravene the Basic Law because it was not set out in the future mini-constitution. Perhaps he conveniently forgot that "other special courts" can be established. Perhaps a rent tribunal might be more acceptable than a human rights version. Lu disputes that Hong Kong people even care about politics. He says that if you ask anyone in the street about their primary concern, 90 per cent will say their livelihoods. But the director misses the point. Concerns for housing, welfare, education, the environment, corruption, law and order, and even equality of the sexes are highly political issues. The formulation and implementation of public policy in Hong Kong is as much about the process as it is about the end product. People expect to be consulted each step of the way, and they expect important issues to be publicly debated. Hong Kong people demanded that the policy-making process should become more open. Now, they have also insisted on being given enough information to be able to assess policies and to hold the executive accountable. It is against this background that Hong Kong wants a more representative system of government. And it is this development that makes Hong Kong a vibrant political city. This is not the work of a "handful" of people, but of all residents of Hong Kong. Lu failed to win the hearts and minds of Hong Kong because Beijing does not want to deal with all these views. China's united-front strategy cannot cope with opposing views. Until this changes, Beijing will continue to pretend that only a "handful" have different ideas about how "one country, two systems" should work.
