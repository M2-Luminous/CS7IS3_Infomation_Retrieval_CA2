FR940711-0-00026 FR940711-0-00003 Many comments, as requested, addressed the Ninth Circuit decision. These comments are as follows: Cal-Almond stated that all of the rules and regulations contained in the interim final rule deprive handlers of their First Amendment rights and suggested that the entire creditable program be eliminated. The commenter asserted that a determination has never been made by the Board as to whether the Order or individual handlers are better at promoting and advertising almonds. The commenter further stated that there have never been any studies conducted to indicate whether the current advertising program is effective and contended that the Department is unable to show that the regulations are required in order to advance the stated goal of selling more almonds and increasing returns to producers. In addition, the commenter contended that the regulations contained in the interim final rule are more extensive than necessary to serve the governmental interest of increasing almond sales. One independent almond handler, Thomas Motta on behalf of Western Nut, stated that if the Marketing Order's advertising program is deemed constitutional at some future date, the Secretary should evaluate what type of advertising program best serves the almond industry. Motta further stated that the Ninth Circuit ruled that compelled advertising violates a handler's First Amendment rights and that regardless of what the Board calls it, it is still forced collection. Motta suggested that the advertising provisions of the order be put on hold until they are proven to be beneficial to the industry and are determined to be legal by the appropriate Court. Another independent almond handler, Grant Ecker on behalf of Waterford Nut Company, stated that he agrees with the Ninth Circuit Court ruling that the regulations hinder handler's efforts to increase sales and returns to growers. He stated that the new Credit-Back program places a larger economic burden on small handlers than the old program did. John Rotteveel, on behalf of Rotteveel Orchards, stated that the current and former advertising programs violate his constitutional rights. He believes that the program is a waste of money and does nothing to increase the consumption of almonds that almond handlers could not do themselves. Finally, Rotteveel stated that there is no way to prove that the advertising programs have increased world demand for almonds. He believes that growers and handlers are expanding these markets without the help of the Order and does not think that the increase in the number of handlers and growers in the United States can be attributed to the Order. Rotteveel suggested phasing out the Order and letting the almond industry run itself. It is the Department's position that the former creditable advertising program and the new Credit-Back program meet each of the criteria set forth in the Ninth Circuit decision which pertain to constitutionality. The Department believes that both programs are authorized under the Act and that the regulations do not infringe upon the First Amendment rights of any handler. Importantly, the Court in Cal-Almond did not hold that all advertising and promotion programs are unconstitutional or illegal on their face. Rather, the court recognized the substantial government interest in promoting almond consumption in order to stimulate the demand for almonds and enhance grower returns. As previously discussed, the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program has been carefully structured so that the rules which govern its efficient administration are no more extensive than necessary to meet the desired goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. Virtually all aspects of the former creditable advertising and promotion program have been modified or eliminated so as to increase efficiency while at the same time imposing a minimum of restrictions on handlers. An additional comment in the form of an exception to another comment was received from Cal-Almond well after the second comment period closed. Because Cal-Almond's comment was received after the close of the comment period, it has not been considered. Another comment was received from the Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA contended that the Secretary did not comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) in issuing the interim final rule. It recommended that the Department perform a regulatory flexibility analysis, which would study the impact of advertising programs on small handlers and would consider alternatives to the program. The SBA further stated that the Secretary's assertion about small entity orientation and compatibility did not meet the requirements of the RFA. The SBA stated that the RFA does not provide exceptions for statutes that are not compatible with its goals. The SBA commented further that: (1) most small handlers sell to ``food processors'' and have no reason to promote fresh consumption of almonds, and (2) advertising expenses designed to increase use by ingredient manufacturers were not creditable under the old program and are not creditable under the new program. Finally, the SBA stated that the Credit-Back program was promulgated with no evidence that it would advance the government's interest, or that it is the least restrictive program needed to enhance almond sales. For these reasons, the SBA indicated that the Secretary should consider alternatives to the current advertising program, including no program at all, or, at a minimum, a program that imposes less restrictions on handlers. The SBA also recommended that promotional efforts targeting ingredient manufacturers should be given the same credit as those targeting fresh consumption. Advertisements resulting from joint participation by a handler and manufacturers or sellers of two complementary products or commodities were eligible for credit under the former advertising and promotion program provided that the brand name was used.
