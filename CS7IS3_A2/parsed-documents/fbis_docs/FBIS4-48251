Hezekiah Bowen, has expressed serious concern over the movement of armed NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] troops in large numbers into the East Harbel area. Gen. Bowen said the infiltration of these troops into Harbel and its surrounding areas poses a serious security risk to the city of Monrovia. In another development, a pickup belonging to the Firestone Plantation Company was reportedly seized by fighters of the NPFL in Harbel after putting the AFL driver at a gunpoint. Gen. Bowen told reporters that all efforts to retrieve the pickup and the arm seized from the AFL driver proved futile. He is therefore calling on ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] to intervene. Meanwhile, ECOMOG authorities say a peacekeeping force has already been deployed in Harbel. They are advising residents not to panic as ECOMOG troops are fully in control of the situation.
