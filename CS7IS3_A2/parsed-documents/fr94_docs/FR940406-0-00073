FR940406-0-00073 FR940406-0-00005 (11) If the local redevelopment authority does not express in writing its interest in a specific property during the allotted 1-year period, the disposal agency shall again notify HUD of the date of availability of the property for homeless assistance. HUD may then list the property in the Federal Register as suitable and available after the base closes following the previous McKinney Act procedures. (12) The listing of base closure property from the 1991 and subsequent rounds of base closures reported to HUD shall contain the following statement: The properties contained in this listing are closing or realigning military installations. This report is being accomplished pursuant to Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, section 2905(b). In accordance with section 2905(b), this property is subject to a one-time publication under the McKinney Act, after which property not provided to homeless assistance providers will not be published again unless there is no expression of interest submitted by the local redevelopment authority in the one-year period following the end of the McKinney screening process pursuant to this publication. (13) The list of 1988 base closure properties that will be reported to HUD shall contain the same statement as paragraph (b)(12) of this section, and shall refer to section 2905(a) of the Act (107 Stat. 1916). (c) Local redevelopment plan. (1) The early formation of a redevelopment authority is critical to the successful reuse of the base. The primary focus of the redevelopment authority should be developing a comprehensive local redevelopment plan. This plan should embrace the range of feasible reuse options that will result in rapid job creation. The local redevelopment plan will generally be used as the proposed action in conducting environmental analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), (42 U.S.C. 4332 et seq. ). (2) Although the statute only requires the local redevelopment authority to submit a written expression of interest within 1 year after the date the property is released from McKinney Act screening, the local redevelopment plan should be prepared within that 1 year period. The plan should at a minimum identify: (i) Parcels recommended to be transferred to other Federal Agencies (whether or not a specific request for such transfer was made by the Agency during the screening period) and their intended uses. (ii) Parcels recommended to be transferred or conveyed for uses such as homeless assistance, public benefit purposes, or other qualifying public purpose conveyance programs and their intended uses. (iii) Parcels, and their intended uses, recommended to be conveyed by: (A) Negotiated sale at estimated fair market value. (B) Conveyance without initial consideration to local redevelopment authorities, with or without recoupment, as provided in this part. (iv) The plan should discuss how it will enhance the prospects for economic development and job creation, if the redevelopment authority intends to request an economic development conveyance. (d) Jobs-centered property disposal. (1) The new property disposal process described in this section and in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section which follow, is designed to rapidly create new jobs, either by taking advantage of a ready market for development of valuable property or by inducing a market through conveyances for economic development, initially without consideration. The procedures described below generally apply to 1993 and 1995 base closures and may not apply to 1988 and 1991 closures which may be well along in the disposal process.
