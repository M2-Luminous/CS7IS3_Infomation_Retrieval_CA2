Welcoming the British visitor, Andrey Kozyrev noted that the two countries' cooperation during the war was closely linked with the port of Murmansk. "We remain allies after the ideological blackout that drew our countries apart," he said. "We are now returning to the natural state of partnership." "You will be the first foreign minister from another country to visit the strategic base of the Russian Navy in Severomorsk," Kozyrev went on. "It is very important that the deadly missiles are no longer targeted at Britain, same as British Trident missiles are no longer targeted at Russia. This too is an example of new partnership." The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry also noted that the meeting of the two ministers was taking place in a private hotel. In his view, this showed that despite all the difficulties, the spirit of enterprise had opened itself a way in this land of great opportunities. "It is particularly interesting to me to visit Murmansk," Douglas Hurd said in his turn. "Older generation Britons, among whom I have many friends, went with the convoys across the dangerous Arctic waters, threatened by German submarines. This was the brightest page in their lives. I am looking forward to seeing the city that, among other things, is the administrative center of the Russian foreign minister's constituency, and to visiting the military base in Severomorsk. The reasons why this is important to me lie both in the past and in the present." D. Hurd said he was confident that Murmansk would attract large foreign investments because of its vast mineral resources and the kray's geographical location.
