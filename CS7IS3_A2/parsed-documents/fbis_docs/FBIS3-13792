The massacre, in which over 65 Palestinians were killed on 25 February at the hands of extremist Zionists, has focused worldwide public attention on Zionist barbarity and on the grave dimensions of that ugly crime. The UN Security Council was supposed to adopt a quick and decisive resolution. However, with feeble excuses and pretexts, such as the need for the Security Council to avoid adopting any stand that might jeopardize the Middle East peace talks, the United States forced the UN Security Council to act outside the legal framework within which it was supposed to act toward such events and developments. It is evident that all this delay in the issuance of the resolution of condemnation by the UN Security Council and the clear U.S.-Zionist coordination were a planned affair designed to encourage the Arabs and Palestinians and force them to rejoin the peace talks. The United States abstained on the second and sixth paragraphs, which affirm the grave consequences that might arise from the continuing heavy casualties among the Palestinians in the occupied territories and the need to safeguard the security and safety of the Palestinians through the application of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Although the new resolution affirms the need to safeguard the safety of the Palestinians inside the occupied territories and the need for the Zionist authorities to prevent the inhabitants of the Israeli settlements from carrying out acts of violence against the Palestinians, and although the Security Council calls on Russia and the United States to take the necessary practical measures to ensure the implementation of Resolution 904, it is unlikely that any essential change will occur in the current course of events inside the occupied territories. The Zionist entity entirely depends on U.S. support. Therefore, this entity will not hesitate to continue its ugly crimes, as it has been doing for over 40 years.
