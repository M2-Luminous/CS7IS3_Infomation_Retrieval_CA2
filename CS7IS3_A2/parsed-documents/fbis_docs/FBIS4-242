Speaking in central Angola, he said UNITA could sign a peace agreement within days. The UN secretary general, Butrus-Butrus Ghali, has reported to the Security Council that the Angolan peace talks are deadlocked, but Mr. Savimbi told a group of especially invited journalists that progress at the talks had been so great that the United Nations was unlikely to proceed with the imposition of new sanctions against UNITA. Mr. Savimbi said he would return to the capital, Maputo [as heard], only if his security could be guaranteed.
