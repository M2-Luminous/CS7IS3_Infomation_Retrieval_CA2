Unliterary Passions Surrounding Last Dash to the South"] [Text] "The publication of Vladimir Volfovich's book Last Dash to the South was pirated! Everything in it is distorted! This is a provocation!" the art critic Irina Sergeyevna Kulikova, who prepared Zhirinovskiy's text for publication, told IZVESTIYA. This strange and unexpected statement by one of the most loyal supporters of the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] seems absurd. In the four months since its publication the book has caused Zhirinovskiy and his comrades in arms nothing but delight. There is only one explanation for this contradiction -- the criminal investigation which the Russian General Prosecutor's Office started against Zhirinovskiy a few days ago. He may be charged under Article 71 of the Penal Code concerning war propaganda contained in the pages of "The Last Dash to the South." The real prospect of spending at least three years behind barbed wire is forcing Zhirinovskiy to look for a way out of the dangerous situation he has found himself in. It seems that it is specifically for this purpose that what at first appears to be a senseless scandal is now being hatched. Ms. Kulikova claims that the book's "sponsors" have perpetrated a forgery. Her arguments sound pretty strange and even illogical, however. "You can see places in the book which have been purposely printed in boldface so as to attract the attention of corrupt journalists, like you IZVESTIYA journalists," Ms. Kulikova said. Struck by the typeface, I asked her about these evil sponsors. "I am not going to give you their names, but, believe me, they are to blame for everything!" came the answer. Apart from the "boldface" in certain places, Ms. Kulikova drew attention to two other terrible circumstances. "Zhirinovskiy's real text contains bits of his speeches, and we removed all the repetitions. But in the pirated book, the text looks as though Vladimir Volfovich keeps saying the same thing, over and over!" Irina Sergeyevna's bitter observation is entirely just, but only from the viewpoint of an art critic. Maybe she does not know that deliberate repetitions in the structure of a speech were considered to be the most successful propagandist device, even among orators in ancient Greece. After all, the crowd does not hear, it feels. In order for the sense of what has been said to be brought home, the same thing has to be drummed into it several times. Carried away by the conversation, Ms. Kulikova said that she personally placed the floppy containing the text of the book in the "sponsors'" hands. This text was simply dictated by Zhirinovskiy. On Kulikova's own admission, she is not so much his editor as a proofreader, and she never changes the sense of what has been said. From the day of publication and up until the end of January, when the investigators from the General Prosecutor's Office finally got down to reading the book, it did not enter anyone's head that this was a forgery. Even Zhirinovskiy's head. Aside from that, there are more rational proofs of identity. The secret "sponsors" are in fact indicated at the end of Zhirinovskiy's book -- the "Pisatel" Limited Partnership and the "Bukvitsa" Publishing Cooperative. It was they who put in an order at Moscow Printing Works No. 13 to publish the book. As Yuliya Mikhaylovna Lobacheva, chief of the production department of this printing works, assures us, the clients' license was perfectly in order. Admittedly, of the 75,000 copies of Last Dash to the South ordered, the printing works only printed 35,000. "You see, we do not take orders without prepayment, and they only paid for half of the print run. We printed 34,000 in the normal cover, and another 1,000 in a prepublication cover, just as they asked. Aside from that, I do not understand how this book can be `pirated' if Zhirinovskiy waves it around at every news conference he holds," Ms. Lobacheva said. These 1,000 copies -- in the prepublication version -- were sold to deputies in the State Duma. From this you can conclude that Zhirinovskiy is unbelievably prudent in matters of propaganda. But the interference of the General Prosecutor's Office upset some of his plans. The sale of the book within the walls of the State Duma, organized by the LDPR leader, in no way squares with the idea of a "pirated" publication. In any case, Zhirinovskiy in no way looks like a victim here. But Ms. Kulikova is so keen on the piracy theme that she has completely rejected the fact of the sale of the book in the State Duma. "Don't believe it, it's lies!" the art critic exclaimed. "There is no such book as Last Dash to the South and there never has been. This is only the second part of Zhirinovskiy's trilogy On the Fate of Russia ripped out of context! That book will be on sale soon." Let us sum up. So, no one has changed the essence of the published text but, admittedly, objections have been made about the typeface. This is evidently not enough to confuse the investigators from the General Prosecutor's Office. Particularly since the title page of Last Dash to the South bears the "V.V. Zhirinovskiy" copyright symbol. Maybe this is a completely different "V.V."? It does not seem possible to ask Zhirinovskiy himself about this. Irina Sergeyevna reported with great satisfaction that he is demanding $100 per minute for interviews. At rates like that you could never save up enough money to get to see the LDPR leader. Incidentally, this constitutes illegal operations with foreign currency. Article 88 of the Russian Federation Penal Code goes as far as execution by firing squad. After you have paid your taxes, of course. But long before my conversation with Ms. Kulikova I had the good fortune to meet with Mr. Vengerovskiy, chief of the LDPR's intelligence unit. In his boss's office he handed me a copy of Last Dash to the South with the words: "Here you will find the answers to all questions!" The cunning nature of the journalist and the feeling of simple human vanity did the intelligence agent a bad turn, and he gladly left a dedication and his autograph on the sleeve. Irina Sergeyevna's reaction to the story about my meeting with Vengerovskiy and his autograph suggests to me that the General Prosecutor's Office will not find it easy going. She immediately changed her stance and started to defend the pirated book, stating that there is no war propaganda in it and that no one intends to attack Turkey or Iran. "Vladimir Volfovich has always been opposed to weapons. He is simply proposing to station Russian military settlements in a corridor leading to the Indian Ocean. You would have to know history. The Cossacks have always defended the Russian state's borders," Ms. Kulikova stated. The fact that Turkey and Iran, as well as Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, which have inadvertently found themselves in that "corridor," do not consider themselves to be part of Russia was not taken into consideration by Irina Sergeyevna. What would happen in that "corridor" is obvious to an idiot. Quests for "pirates" and "sponsors" are not preventing Irina Sergeyevna from now being involved in gathering orders for the translation and publication of the book abroad. "We have had such offers from Britain, Japan, and the United States. But we will choose the ones which are most profitable for us. Those who pay the most will get the publishing rights. Admittedly, I do not remember how many offers we have had and which publishing houses they came from, but we have had offers. One of Russia's representatives at the United Nations is conducting talks on our behalf with American publishers. It doesn't matter what his name is!" Ms. Kulikova stressed. The latest publication offer came from Paris recently. A small French publishing house, F2F, has decided to publish the book Last Dash to the South. The publishing house department which is fortuitously called "Material Evidence" is already prepared to get down to the translation. When Rene Bousquet, an old French collaborationist, was shot in Paris, F2F found and published his anti-Semitic resolutions drawn up under the Vichy regime, during World War II. This publishing house recently published the last issue of PRAVDA when it was banned by Yeltsin during the October events in Moscow. Incidentally, something about the expected royalties and the right to publish. If Ms. Kulikova is telling the truth and Zhirinovskiy himself confirms the "piracy" of the book "Last Dash for the South Seas," then the French will be able to publish it without paying the LDPR leader a centime.
