He stressed that after the complete termination of British colonial rule in Hong Kong on 30 June 1997, the Chinese side certainly will join hands with Hong Kong people in effecting Hong Kong's smooth transition according to the Basic Law and the relevant decisions made by the National People's Congress. Zhang Junsheng made this statement when answering reporters' questions folloiwng a news conference about an international tourist festival in China this year. Zhang Junsheng pointed out: Now, the British Hong Kong authorities may submit or pass whatever bills they like, and this is their business. He reiterated: As there is no agreement between China and Britain, the three-tiered political structure set up by the British Hong Kong authorities definitely will come to an end as a whole, together with the end of the British colonial rule on 30 June 1997. The Chinese Government will re-establish the three-tiered councils of the future special administrative region [SAR] government according to the Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the National People's Congress. The Chinese side and Hong Kong people will be completely able to do a good job in arranging Hong Kong's transition. Zhang Junsheng said: In the past, the British side proposed the through-train arrangement, and the Chinese side accepted it. However, the British side now does not want to see any convergence or any through train by simply removing the rails for the through train. This once again has exposed their real feature of not keeping diplomatic promises. The behavior of the British side has wasted a lot of our time and energy, and also has caused a certain amount of concern to Hong Kong people. As the British side broke its promise and provoked an open debate, Hong Kong society was split and social shocks were caused; certain economic losses also were caused. Zhang Junsheng reiterated that since the British side refused cooperation, we should join hands with Hong Kong people and work more intensively. We will be completely able to properly arrange Hong Kong's transition and set up the SAR Government.
