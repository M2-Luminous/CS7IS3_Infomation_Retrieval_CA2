First and foremost, Europe. We have no doubt as to the strong personal commitment of the new foreign minister, Antonio Martino, who now holds the portfolio once held by his father at a historic moment for both Italy and Europe; and we have confidence in his capacity to to take account of the current situation, devising possible personal changes of key (of a Thatcherite timbre, it has been said) in a Europeanism that must be innate in the son of Gaetano Martino. As we see it, one fact stands out above all the others. The European Union has proved that it can withstand displays of nationalist whims and tantrums from one or another of the major powers at any one time -- first France, then England; when this happens, the process of unification is impaired or slowed down in various ways, but it does not come to a standstill. But the European project, with the Maastricht Treaty as its charter, would suffer serious damage should there be two, and not one, of the major powers making up the Union rowing against the tide at the same time. I have always maintained that we must "be understanding toward the English," make allowances when they flare up or dig their heels in, and give their insular instincts time to adjust to their new European destiny. But if the instinctive reluctance of the English were to find encouragement in another major power, Italy, for instance--if a "Rome-London axis" committed to slowing down the constitutional negotiations that are about to begin in preparation for the 1996 intergovernmental Conference were to be formed--the damage done to Europe would be extremely grave. It would really be tempting providence to place most of the weight of the European project on the shoulders of Germany (which Germany? Kohl is still a giant, but for how much longer?) and of a France of an uncertain political color, as this project will have the difficult task of devising mechanisms for adjusting to the inevitable complexities of enlargement eastward. Continuity Good relations between Rome and London have always been useful in playing down the English sense of isolation in the face of the great Franco-German entente, but only provided that Rome works hard to involve London in the European process, certainly not if it fosters nationalist instincts. This must be the reasoning behind Italy's European policy commitment to "continuity," as announced by the new government. Italy's other, no less crucial, contribution to the European project is to pursue and promote our economy's compliance with the Maastricht criteria. This is in our own interest, even more than it is in the European interest. If we take a look at Europe, and all the more so if we list our other immediate and imminent foreign policy priorities, starting with the Naples summit, hovering between the G-7 and G-8, and potential commitments, including those of a military nature, in the former Yugoslavia, we must stress another fundamental aspect. Following, among other factors, the revolution that has taken place in communications and telecommunications, foreign policy nowadays involves heads of government directly and forces them to take direct responsibility for the major decisions at their meetings. Suffice it to mention the fact that the G-7 summits repeatedly see them seated alone around a table, with their ministers and advisers relegated to seats against the wall or to another room. Little Experience A head of state or government with little experience of international affairs, or with little interest in them -- the case of President Clinton is a glaring example -- weakens not only the action taken by his or her country but the efficiency of the whole international system. I made similar remarks when commenting in this paper on the birth of the De Mita government back on 14 April 1988. I pointed out how the machinery of world politics made it essential that "every head of government assume strong personal responsibility." And I emphasized how this was the area in which De Mita, who was "deeply immersed in our domestic politics, but an `object of mystery' to the rest of the world," would face "perhaps his most difficult personal test in terms of both image and substance," as he would, moreover, have to "throw himself into a hectic round of international summits" (even then!). I recall that Giulio Andreotti, with all his experience, was appointed foreign minister. And they did not have the burden of the "postfascists" in the government to contend with. Just six years have gone by since then, but it feels like a century. History repeats itself; and I have no different words for describing the challenge that new Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, another "object of mystery," will have to face over the next few days and weeks. Do not neglect foreign policy, Mr. Berlusconi; at the end of the day, this is perhaps where your stature as a politician will find its measure.
