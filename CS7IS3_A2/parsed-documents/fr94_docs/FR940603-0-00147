FR940603-0-00147 FR940603-0-00029 When a federal credit union requests an amendment to remove a group from its field of membership, the regional director will determine why the credit union wishes to remove the group and whether the existing members of the group will continue membership. Membership may continue for those who are already members if the credit union has adopted the ``once a member, always a member'' bylaw provision. VI_Spin-Offs A ``spin-off'' occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares and capital of a credit union, are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that one credit union has a field of membership addition and the other has a removal. If the spin-off goes to a new federal charter, the requirements of Chapter 1 apply. (See that chapter for discussion of the field of membership and documentation requirements for new federal charters.) If it goes to an existing federal charter, the requirements of Chapter 2 apply. Spin-offs involving federally insured state credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all affected regional directors and the state regulators, as applicable. The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, as a minimum: •Why the spin-off is being requested. •What part of the field of membership is to be spun-off. •Whether the affected credit unions have a common sponsor or are located within the same operational area. •Which assets, liabilities, shares and capital are to be transferred. •The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions. •The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members. •The proposed spin-off date. The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot. For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers_see Part 708 of the NCUA Regulations_except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off_those whose shares are to be transferred_are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state statute. VII_Professional Conflicts It is important for a credit union, as well as professional organizations such as accounting firms, law firms, real estate title insurance firms and appraisal firms, to avoid the appearance of impropriety when the credit union contracts with a professional organization for services. This is even more critical if the professional organization and/or its employees are members of the credit union. When a professional organization is added to a federal credit union's field of membership, the credit union should notify the professional organization of certain provisions. The following notice is intended to ensure that decisions made by a credit union and the professional organizations serving the credit union are independent of any loan decisions or deposit activities: ``Please be advised that with respect to the addition of the employees of [professional organization] to the [FCU], any lending, deposit and/or other credit union services involving this group's members must avoid any appearance of impropriety and must follow the ethical standards of the profession.'' VIII_Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership VIII.A_General All requests for approval to amend a federal charter must be submitted to the appropriate regional director. In normal cases, the regional director will make a decision on the request within 10 business days. If a decision cannot be made within that time, the regional director will notify the credit union within the 10-business-day period. To streamline the process further, NCUA has instituted two additional procedures_a limited preapproval process and a procedure for easing the workload when making substantial charter changes as with mergers and charter conversions. VIII.B_Streamlined Expansion Procedure (SEP) for Small Occupational Groups In keeping with the goals of NCUA chartering policy to provide service to all eligible groups desiring credit union service, well operated federal credit unions except those designated as ``distressed'' may take advantage of the SEP for adding occupational groups to their fields of membership. To use this procedure, the federal credit union's board of directors must first apply to their respective NCUA regional director for a charter amendment. The charter amendment request must be signed by the presiding officer of the board of directors. The following is a sample amendment for permitting a federal credit union to use the SEP authority: Groups of persons with occupational common bonds which are located within 25 miles of one of the credit union's service facilities, which have provided a written request for service to the credit union, which do not presently have credit union service available, and which have no more members in the group than the maximum number established by the NCUA Board for additions under this provision: Provided, however, that the National Credit Union Administration may permanently or temporarily revoke the power to add groups under this provision upon a finding, in the Agency's discretion, that permitting additions under this provision are not in the best interests of the credit union, its members, or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Once NCUA has approved the amendment and the credit union board has adopted it, the SEP authority may be implemented. The charter amendment permits approved federal credit unions to immediately begin serving employee groups meeting criteria set forth in this section. Under this procedure, there is no formal NCUA action necessary on each group being added.
