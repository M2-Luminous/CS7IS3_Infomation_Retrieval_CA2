The two were jailed a few hours ago, the local news media have reported. Duenas, owner and chairman of the bank board of directors, is allegedly linked to the "laundering" of properties of more than 20 members of the Reyes family, Pichincha Police Superintendent Boanerges Villagomez confirmed today. According to the police, the so-called group "Three Magi" [Los Tres Reyes Magos], headed by wealthy businessman Victor Hugo Reyes, who is under arrest, was the only organization with the characteristics of a "cartel" in Ecuador and was dismantled two years ago. The Reyes family has been facing drug trafficking charges since then. At least a dozen people, including certain retired officers and executives of a local airline, have been charged with these offenses. According to Ecuadoran law, any offense related to trafficking or "laundering" of money obtained through the illicit drug trade brings with it imprisonment for the accused until found innocent. The charges against Duenas are based on a report by a special congressional commission, the police, and the Bank Superintendency, which also ordered the imprisonment of Huidobro. Duenas was arrested a few hours ago in the main building of his bank in Quito during a discreet operation that involved uniformed and plainclothes policemen. In a statement from the Provisional Detention Center, Duenas said that his arrest "is illegal and unjustifiable" and that he will give fuller details in the coming hours. Bank Superintendent Ricardo Munoz has asked the bank's 170,000 customers to remain calm, because "neither the bank's solvency nor immediate liquidity is adversely affected by the arrests." Banco de los Andes has $72.5 million in deposits and a portfolio estimated at more than $85 million. "The investigations," he said, "are directed at events that occurred from 1989 to 1990, and so the bank's current status is not at risk." He added "there should not be a run on the country's banks, because the Ecuadoran financial system is solid and handled with great professionalism and seriousness." According to Munoz, Rear Admiral Duenas had charged investigations were not conducted by order of Congress but, rather, based on exigencies of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Embassy. News reports have stated Duenas also owns at least 52 companies in different sectors, magazines, television production companies, advertising agencies, and shares in several Ecuadoran newspapers.
