Like Francois Mitterrand, who came last February, Jacques Chirac had never set foot in Vietnam. While the president of the republic naturally began his trip in Hanoi, the mayor of Paris was first received in Ho Chi Minh City, previously known as Saigon. In fact, the entire government has just completed a sitting lasting several days in the capital of South Vietnam. Accordingly, it was at the Palace of Unity, the presidential residence of the old regime, that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, flanked by nearly 10 ministers and in the presence of the French ambassador, welcomed Mr. Chirac with the words: "Mr. Mayor of Paris, you are a great Frenchman. What an honor it is to receive you!" No reference here to de Gaulle, then, like in Cambodia, in describing the visit of his "spiritual heir." The general has no place in Vietnamese mythology. What the Vietnamese leaders wanted to show is the relationship between the two trips made by Mitterrand and Chirac respectively, the consolidation of a rediscovered history between the two countries. The speech by Vo Van Kiet, the words spoken by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, the patron of economic "liberalization," during their conversation, or the short speech by the mayor-governor of the city were built up along the same lines: 1993 began with Mitterrand, 1994 with Chirac, that is the real "evidence of our cooperation." Quite obviously, the trip by the president, sanctioning France's return to Indochina, left behind an excellent memory. Mr. Chirac paid him homage: "The president of the republic said that a fresh page had been turned. I believe he was right." And, just as Francois Mitterrand had evoked "the regrettable chapter" of French-Vietnamese history by visiting the site of Dien Bien Phu, Jacques Chirac added: "The year 1994 will also mark the 40th anniversary of the most regrettable episode of our shared history. Let us take care not to forget the past. However, let us also turn to the future, starting off again hand in hand..." While the authorities, overcome with gratitude, multiplied their thanks to France for its development aid and support in reintegrating Vietnam into the international financial community, Jacques Chirac assured them that "the new French government certainly intends to continue, and even consolidate, the policy of its forerunner in this respect." If the Vietnamese leaders greatly stressed the relationship between the dates of the two visits, it was because they themselves felt the need to draw up the balance of their action, a really self-satisfied balance, on the eve of the "national congress" of their party, which is to be held before the end of January. It is clear that the tempo of the "renovation" is stirring up a debate among their executives. How can the political conservatism, which they are keeping in place, and economic activism, for which they are preaching the need, be reconciled? Their faith in the system is expressed in a language which today seems rather anachronistic, exalting the "objectives of the struggle" and the references "to the decisions made by the previous congress." Vo Van Kiet, 71, grew up under the Vietminh apparat and knew how to play the smiling front. He reminded the mayor of Paris that he had himself been the mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, then hardened and dropped the smile to affirm that "the preservation of political stability remains the condition for economic development." Mr. Chirac, who steered well clear of entering into the ideological debate, limited himself to diversifying his message depending on the function of his dialogue partners. In the presence of the mayor of Saigon, he made a real charge against bureaucracy "which is causing a great deal of time to be lost and is costing the people very dearly. Given the political will, this problem can be overcome....but everywhere bureaucracy is the enemy of the people." The French Dream Speaking with economist Phan Van Khai, he listed the "interests" at stake in the relationship between the two countries, highlighting the dual singularity of the French contribution: investment and the transfer of technologies. Full of praise, in passing, for Industry Minister Gerard Longuet, who leaves for Vietnam on Friday in command of a squadron of 40 industrialists, he said: "You will see, this is a boy who probably has a future in French politics. He does not belong to my party. He is the leader of our brother party...." In fact, the RPR president devoted the lion's share of his talks to international policy, especially the balance within the Pacific region, incessantly reiterating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. Vo Van Kiet admitted that he had observed the same concern in South Korea and Japan. Would Mr. Chirac make a public observation on human rights infringements in Vietnam? One sentence uttered to Vo Van Kiet, reiterated that after opening up economically, "the road to a new openness will then be free, an openness which concerns relations between people." However, the French ambassador also delivered a note concerning the "individual [human rights] cases" already raised by Mr. Mitterrand, then by Mr. Juppe last July. The Vietnamese received Chirac: One year away from the presidential election, they took their assurances from this considerable French political figure regarding the continuity of French policy. Jacques Chirac visited Saigon and Hanoi: In both cities, he wanted to consecrate the French dream in Vietnam, particularly by committing himself to joint projects and undertakings using the vehicle of the French language: a visit to the Lotus school (financed by the City of Paris) in Saigon, and to the Viet-Duc hospital in Hanoi.
