Talking to a small group of journalists this evening, Mr. Goh said the objective of his visit was to forge such a strategic economic alliance with India and he had found a responsive chord in the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao. Terming his visit as timely, Mr. Goh said India till now was focusing more on the West and West Asia, and not much on Asia. At the same time, Singapore was looking to the West, as it had invested heavily in China and was looking for opportunities elsewhere. India had a big potential which was still unrealised and its trade and investment flows were minimal. Moreover, the potential for tourism was immense and India too was interested in exploiting this sector to earn more foreign exchange. Singapore could help in this, he said. Kashmir issue: About the political discussions between him and Mr. Rao, Mr. Goh said both had provided an assessment of the situation in their respective areas. He had been briefed about the Kashmir situation, he said, but refused to comment about Pakistan's role in aiding and abetting terrorism there. "Singapore is a good friend of both India and Pakistan. So it will not be proper for me to comment during this visit, as it is a very complex issue." He said it was for India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir problem. "Singapore has no role in it, nor do I see any role for any third party. It is essentially for India and Pakistan to resolve the issue." To a question on the strident western campaign about alleged human rights abuses in Asian countries, Mr. Goh was categorical in rejecting the western concept of human rights. "Asian countries cannot be dictated by western standards. We should have our own concept of human rights since we have to feed our population, clothe them, educate them, house them. All this requires a stable law and order situation. Of course there should be some basic freedoms, but it should be appreciated that most of the Asian countries are in the first stage of development and that for many of them, the concept of democracy is new. Even the western countries had no human rights concept in their early stages of development and industrialisation. Asked about India's role in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Mr. Goh reiterated that India should first develop its trade and investment relations with the Association. A sectoral dialogue with India had begun in this context and once trade and economic relations flourished, India could be given the status of a full sectoral partner, but not a member, he said. On the future of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Mr. Goh was not very optimistic, saying that it had no middle-income country as its member which could generate economic exchanges or capital flows. Moreover, some of the SAARC members had intractable problems between them and this would weigh down cooperation amongst them, he felt. "So I see slow progress for the SAARC, though I hope I am wrong in this assessment." `Consensus emerging': Asked about his assessment on the economic reforms in India, Mr. Goh said that a consensus seemed to be emerging here on the need to de-regulate this economy and reform it. "I say this on the basis of my discussions with politicians and businessmen. Of course, I did not have any opportunity to discuss this with the Opposition parties here, but I feel a consensus is emerging." On the new areas for reforms in India, Mr. Goh said he was looking for more liberalisation in the property laws.
