The three reporters of the Taiwan Public Television Station arrived in Haikou on 7 May. The aim of their visit was to shoot and produce a special television film reflecting the scenery and investment environment of Hainan in a bid to help Taiwan businessmen invest in Hainan. At the request of the guests, Ruan Chongwu gave an account of Taiwan businessmen investing in Hainan. He said that at present, the volume of investment by Taiwan businessmen ranks second among that from outside the border, and the actual investment volume is about $400 million. Talking about the idea of jointly developing Hainan Island in cooperation with Singapore recently put forward by the Taiwan side, Ruan Chongwu said: We welcome Taiwan's manufacturers to come to run enterprises in Hainan at present and in the future, as we did in the past. Talking about trades which most urgently need large amounts of investment by Taiwan businessmen at present, Ruan Chongwu said: Hainan welcomes Taiwan businessmen to invest in any trade, but it is easiest to invest in agriculture at present because Hainan and Taiwan have similar conditions and environment in agriculture. With their technology, products, experience in management, and methods for promoting sales, Taiwan farm owners will find it very convenient to invest in Hainan, and the amount of investment required is relatively less. As a matter of fact, Taiwan businessmen who have already invested in agriculture in Hainan have obtained handsome profits. Also, we are willing to cooperate with the Taiwan side in industry, industries which use new and high technology, and the construction of infrastructure. We have also worked out comprehensive compensation methods to ensure more preferential treatment will be given to enterprises which have invested in basic construction projects. Ruan Chongwu also answered questions on Hainan's planning and development prospects raised by the Taiwan reporters.
