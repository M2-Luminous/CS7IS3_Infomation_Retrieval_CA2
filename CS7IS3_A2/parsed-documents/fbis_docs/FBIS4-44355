Now that the final obstacles have been removed, the way is clear for the new partnership and cooperation agreement to be signed in Corfu by Boris Yeltsin, the leaders of the Twelve EU member states and the European Commission on June 24-25. It marks the most ambitious agreement ever signed between the Russian Federation and one of its major world partners. The agreement, negotiated over one and a half years by the European Commission will gradually draw the economies of Russia and the European Union closer together by lifting trade barriers, offering greater certainty to traders and investors and promoting the direct investment that the Russian economy needs. It also paves the way for negotiations on a free trade area after 1998, while establishing regular political contacts at all levels and promoting respect for democracy and human rights. Welcoming the signature of the agreement, Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for external economic relations, issued the following statement: "By creating a relationship between the European Union and Russia rooted in friendship, cooperation and mutual economic interest, this agreement marks a milestone on the road towards greater economic and political stability across the entire continent. It builds a solid framework based on mutual respect. For European companies particularly, it will encourage investment in Russia by ensuring they are treated as fairly as domestic companies while guaranteeing them the right to repatriate profits earned on the Russian market. And it will help cement reform in Russia by offering the prospect of free trade in the next century if Russia's reforms are sufficiently advanced by 1998." On this occasion Hans van den Broek, commissioner for external political relations, stated: "This agreement will set the European Union's political ties with Russia on a far sounder footing by ensuring that heads of government, ministers and officials meet regularly and systematically rather than on an ad hoc basis as at present. It will establish a regular political dialogue enabling the two sides to consult whenever the need arises. This should contribute to overall security and stability in Europe. At the same time, the agreement, which is based on a shared commitment to human rights and fundamental freedom, will reinforce political reform in Russia." The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement Covers Three Main Areas: - Political dialogue - Trade relations - The investment and business environment. Significant Areas of Agreement Include: - Substantial elimination of restrictions on Russian exports to the European Union - Rules on trade in nuclear materials - Steps to open up the flow of capital and improve conditions for business - Agreement on arrangements to allow banks and other financial services providers from the European Union to operate in Russia - A provision that the agreement could develop into a free trade agreement covering cross-border trade in services, the freedom of establishment of companies and capital movements. One of the bases of the agreement is the commitment by both sides to respect the rule of law, to safeguard ethnic minorities, and to uphold human rights and multi-party democracy, while stating that the establishment of a market economy in Russia is of paramount importance. The Details of the Agreement Political Dialogue The agreement seeks to strengthen political links between the EU and Russia by establishing a regular political dialogue between the two sides. The Russian president will meet the president of the European Council and Commission twice a year, besides regular meetings between ministers and civil servants. Dialogue will also be encouraged at parliamentary level. In addition, a cooperation council has been set up to monitor the agreement, also enabling the two sides to seek to bring together their positions on international issues of mutual concern, and cooperate more closely to ensure that the principles of democracy and human rights are respected. Trade Relations The agreement provides a framework which will allow Russia to become integrated into a wider European economic area. 1998 has been set as the date when the parties will meet to review progress in economic reform and decide whether to move towards a free trade agreement. The agreement does not seek to remove all tariffs right away, for Russia currently has a far higher tariff wall against EU imports than vice-versa, (the average weighted Russian tariff to the EU [European Union] is currently 12-14 percent while the average EU tariff to Russia is under 1 percent) suggesting that Russian industry would need time to adjust before tariffs were removed altogether. The partnership and cooperation agreement also supports Russia's future accession to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a move actively supported by the EU. It does this by already referring to certain GATT provisions while setting up a reviewing mechanism which will allow the agreement to be adapted to accommodate Russia's progressive adoption of various articles of the GATT. The partnership and cooperation agreement confirms the removal of all quotas and other quantitative restrictions on Russian exports to the European Union, with the exception of certain textile and steel products. Russia does not currently impose any quantitative restrictions on European Union imports. however, the partnership and cooperation agreement recognises that Russia may need to introduce certain restrictions, given the extensive restructuring of the Russian economy. Russia therefore may under certain circumstances introduce some restrictions in sectors which are curently being restructured, or where there are serious social problems, or where Russian companies face near elimination of market share or where new industries are emerging. These restrictions, however, can only apply for limited quantities of goods and for a limited time. Any proposed restrictions will be discussed between Russia and the European Union before they are applied. Under the agreement, both sides agree to consult one another before increasing tariffs on each other's imports. This is an important provision. In 1993, Russia exported ECU14.8 billion ($17.4 billion) of goods to the member states of the European Union, representing almost 50 per cent of its total exports. In the same period European Union exports to Russia were worth ECU11.5 billion ($13.5 billion). Since Russia is not yet a member of GATT, Russia is largely free to impose tariff protection. It is therefore necessary to ensure that there is adequate consultation on any proposed increase in tariffs. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement also includes a safeguard clause, similar to that in the GATT, which protects against substantial injury to domestic producers. This means that before curbing imports in a given product, Russia or the EU must show that there has been both a surge in imports and substantial injury caused to domestic competitors as a result -- either through loss of market share or a fall in profits, for example. The agreement also clarifies the terms on which defensive measures may be used against unfairly subsidised or "dumped" imports. In fact the impact of EU safeguards and anti-dumping measures has had only a negligeable economic impact. Only seven products from ex-USSR have faced anti-dumping duties, while a further eight cases are under way. Even if these led to anti-dumping action, the total volume of EU imports from ex-USSR affected would be a mere one percent. The agreement also contains rules on the trade in nuclear materials -- both enriched and natural uranium - an issue which had significantly delayed the negotiation process given the concern of some EU countries about the impact of increased Russian imports on their producers. Trade in nuclear materIals is now covered by the agreement. The two sides will seek to negotiate a separate agreement covering nuclear fuels by 1997. A special safeguard provision will apply to trade in nuclear materials under which the EU will have to show that imports of Russian uranium have either increased greatly, or are causing injury to EU uranium producers, before invoking safeguard restrictions on those imports (i.e. the terms of the previous 1989 ex-USSR agreement) Investment and Business Environment The partnership and cooperation agreement introduces some important initiatives which will improve the ability of companies from the European Union to operate in Russia and also improve the climate for direct investment -- a critical issue given the vast investment needs of the Russian economy. The first steps in opening up the flow of capital have been taken. Direct investment in Russia by companies or individuals from the EU will be freely allowed, as will be the repatriation of such investments and the profits from them, removing one of the major disincentives to foreign companies investing in Russia. As a general principle, European companies will be able to set up in Russia under conditions at least as favourable as other foreign companies, and once set up will be treated at least as favourably as Russian or other foreign companies. The same will be the case for Russian companies in the European Union. Once established in Russia, a European Company cannot be subjected to more restrictive legislation which comes into force up to three years afterwards. Russian banks will be able to establish a subsidiary in the European Union and in return, the Russian market will be progressively opened up to European banks. This is a significant step, given that most foreign banks are currently prohibited from any activity with Russian clients. Moreover, Russia has agreed to abolish a decree by 1996 which would have maintained curbs on foreign banks, while assuring that this law will not apply to those five European banks - Dresdner Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Generale de Banque of France, Ingbank and ABN, AMRO of the Netherlands -- which had already been granted licences to operate in Russia. The agreement also establishes a framework for insurance companies in the European Union who wish to enter the Russian market and also for Russian insurance companies who wish to do the same in the European Union. Conditions for businessmen and employees will be improved. There will be nondiscriminatory treatment of employees once they are legally employed in an EU member state or in Russia. Mobility of key personnel on temporary corporate transfers will be increased and the cooperation council will examine the whole area of business conditions, including the prompt issuing of visas and residence permits. All these initiatives, in both the trade and investment sectors, will be supported by specific arrangements on taxation, competition, approximation of legislation and the protection of intellectual property rights. The partnership and cooperation agreement also fosters economic cooperation in a wide range of areas. The objective of such cooperation is the expansion of the economies of both Russia and the European Union. The European Union will provide support for economic cooperation through the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the CIS] programme, which fosters the development of harmonious and prosperous economic links between the European Union and the new independent states. Through TACIS, the EU has committed some ECU500 million ($588 million) to Russia between 1991 and 1993, mainly to promote nuclear safety, restructure state-run companies, set up public administrations and boost efficiency in farming, energy, transport and telecommunications, as well as providing emergency aid. The partnership and cooperation agreement will only come into force after it has been ratified by the parliaments of the member states of the European Union, the European Parliament and the federal assembly of the Russian Federation. The European Commission will therefore prepare an interim agreement which will allow trade related aspects to be applied as early as possible. Trade Between the European Union and Russia European Union's trade balance (in goods) with the former Soviet Union: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |EU Exports |EU Imports |EU Deficit | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |ECU13.5 billion |ECU17.7 billion |ECU4.2 billion | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |ECU15.8 billion |ECU18.5 billion |ECU2.7 billion | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993* |ECU11.5 billion |ECU14.8 billion |ECU3.3 billion | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |*(Russia only) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The European Union is far and away the biggest importer of Russian goods. figures for 1992 show that the EU's imports from the ex-USSR were 27 times greater than those imported by the United States (637 MECU [million ECU] ), 9 times greater than by Japan (ECU1.9 billion) and 6 times greater than by the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries (ECU3.1 billion). About half of the ex-USSR's total exports are sold to the EU, while some 40-45 percent of its imports come from the EU. Furthermore, the EU has become an increasingly important trading partner both for Russia and for the whole of the ex-USSR since the old system collapsed. In 1993, EU imports from Russia were predominantly minerals (44 percent) and metals (14 percent), wood and wood products (3 percent) chemicals and allied industries (4 percent). The share of imports taken up by products considered especially sensitive to European industry (steel, textiles, nuclear materials, aluminium, fish) is around 11 percent. Russian imports from the EU in 1993 were predominantly electrical and mechanical machines and parts (30 percent), processed foodstuffs (16 percent), vehicles and aircrafts (11 percent), chemicals and allied products (7 percent), optical and medical equipment and other precision tools (4 percent), plastics and rubber (2 percent). Russia accounts for a little over three quarters of the EU's trade with the ex-USSR.
