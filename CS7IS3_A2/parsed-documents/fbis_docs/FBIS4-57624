FBIS4-57624 "drlat099_j_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 19 May 1994 Panama Invasion Victims To Press for Compensation From U.S. Invasion Victims To Press for Compensation From U.S. PA2205035394 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2139 GMT 19 May 94 PA2205035394 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [By Luis Enrique Vasquez] [Text] Panama City, 19 May (NOTIMEX) -- Victims of the 1989 U.S. military invasion of Panama will exert international pressure in an effort to force Washington to pay them compensation, it was announced today by the plaintiffs' lawyers. Gilma Gloria Camargo told NOTIMEX the OAS Human Rights Commission will take the case before the international community as a way to exert pressure on the United States. The lawyer arrived in this capital to inform the victims on the status of their claims and to brief others who were affected by the conflict on the steps they need to take to legitimize their claims. Payment to the first 70 victims was estimated at $250 million, but there are 1,500 depositions to date, which represent more than $1 billion in compensation, Camargo said. Camargo, one of the Panamanian lawyers at the Center for Constitutional Rights Headquarters in New York, said the victims are claiming loss of human life; injuries; and the destruction of homes, household effects, and businesses. "The United States might refuse to pay for damages because it has not subscribed to some human rights agreements. Nevertheless, we believe that the commission can make a recommendation to the OAS court and that we can exert international pressure," Camargo added. The lawyer said the pressure may be exerted in a few days, after the Inter-American Human Rights Commission [CIDH] publishes the acceptance of the Panamanian complaint in its annual report. The OAS accepted the complaint in December, but the United States later requested a review of the case. However, the complaint was ratified by the OAS, Camargo explained. Camargo insists: "The United States always says other countries should abide by international law. Therefore, it also should abide by the law in Panama's case." "Only noncombatant" civilians, who were in this country during the 20 December 1989 armed invasion to oust General Manuel Antonio Noriega, "qualify" as plaintiffs, she noted. Those who meet the requirements may get OAS application forms by presenting the necessary evidence at the Panamanian Human Rights Commission offices. These forms will then "be sent to the Center of Constitutional Rights in New York," she concluded. According to human rights organizations' estimates, the armed intervention cost approximately 2,000 lives and $1 billion in damage. U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have rejected until now accusations made by Panamanian victims of the invasion.
