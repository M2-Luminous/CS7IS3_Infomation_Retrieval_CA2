Raphel, during the U.S. senate foreign policy panel hearing on South Asian affairs. The season of reason seems to have just dawned on Washington politics. The American flip-flop on strategic issues, especially issues concerning the sub-continent never ceases to amaze policy watchers. India is one day a primitive, human rights abuser and becomes a non-cooperative nuclear nation another day, all thanks to the benevolence and quirkiness of Washington ditherers. Till yesterday, President Bill Clinton was testing his writing skills on the Punjab issue and trying his vocal chords on the Kashmir absurdities. As if to prove the promptness of his administration in dealing with strategic issues with immediacy, his staff was very prompt in responding to dubious organisations and painted India as a country of primitive inhabitants bent upon killing each other. Today, suddenly, the Clinton administration comes across precious evidence that India is a very big country, that there is a thriving democracy which has over a long period of time evolved democratic institutions and is in the process of addressing human rights abuses and adhering to international human rights standards. One is certain many Indian hearts swell with pride at hearing such pious outpourings by the greatest democracy on earth. But what explains for the American policy of yesterday? Did policy makers in Washington not realise that India with its continental dimensions, inhabited by different ethnic, religious and language groups, surrounded on one side by a country bent upon stoking the fires of terrorism and separatism, remain incident-free, trouble-free and violence-free? Why has it taken the Yanks so long to realise that the Government of India was doing its best to come to grips with an extremely volatile situation in a manner that at the same time did not lead to much loss of life? Why did it not recognise that the thousands of humans who sacrificed their lives to bring peace to the Punjab were policemen, who became common fodder to the terrorist bullets? Should a developing country spend enormous amounts of money and hire American lobbyists to open the eyes of lords in Washington to see home truths about India? It is pathetic to see a super power which is so indecisive. One only hopes that it does not chance upon some new evidence, suitable to its needs, and change its policy tomorrow. The loser would not be India, for, international community knows by now, the human rights record of India. It is the United States of America that will lose its face. In its own self-interest, the United States needs to evolve a realistic, long-term strategy for the sub-continent.
