The two laws were passed at the closing ceremony of the Sixth Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), over which its chairman, Qiao Shi, presided. The 15-clause investment law is intended to protect Taiwan investors' legal interests in the country's mainland, and promote economic exchanges across the Taiwan straits, according to officials from the NPC law committee. The law stipulates that Taiwan investments will not be nationalized or requisitioned; under special circumstances or for the public good, the state may purchase them through legal procedures and the investors will be reimbursed. The investments, possessions, property rights, profits and other legal incomes of Taiwan compatriots in the mainland are protected by the law and are allowed to be transferred or inherited, the law states. Taiwan investors will receive decisions, positive or negative, from government bodies within 45 days of their applications being submitted, the law also said. Profits and other rightful income of Taiwan investors can be remitted back to Taiwan other regions outside the mainland. "This will guarantee that the interests of Taiwan investors will not be harmed by red tape," a senior lawmaker said. The supplementary decision on punishing "snake heads," as mercenaries engaged in illegal emigrants trafficking have been dubbed, says that the worst criminals may face life imprisonment or the death penalty. This tough supplement to the country's criminal law will effectively curb the crime of illegal emigration and border crossing, legislators said, and order on the country's borders will be better maintained. The new law provides that the worst criminals, recidivists, or ones who cause severe wounding or death to illegal emigrants, may be given sentences of seven years to life imprisonment. Those who murder, wound, rape or sell illegal emigrants whom they organized, or wound or murder border inspectors, may be sentenced to death, according to the law. The NPC Standing Committee ratified nine new deputies' membership of the National People's Congress. Five NPC deputies died since last year, one resigned, and two were deprived of their seats because of corrupt practices. The NPC Standing Committee approved the draft agenda for the 13-day Second Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC, beginning on March 10, and the draft list of the presidium and secretary general of the full session. These will be decided by its preparatory meeting. The committee also approved the work report of the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation at the full session. A draft decision to grant the Xiamen economic zone province-like legislative rights will be further deliberated in the coming national session, according to the meeting. The committee also ratified China's entry to several international treaties and several appointments and replacements.
