The Foreign Ministry, quoted by KEYHAN, confirmed the report but said it had not received an official request. The paper said the request was made to the Iranian Embassy in the Jordanian capital. A Jordanian diplomat in Tehran, contacted by KEYHAN, refused to confirm or deny the report. Tehran broke ties in 1981 after Jordan supported its enemy Iraq in the 1980-1988 war. Iran opened its Amman embassy in March 1991, three months after the two countries restored diplomatic relations.
