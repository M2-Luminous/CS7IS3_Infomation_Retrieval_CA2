Iran and Egypt broke ties after the revolution and maintain diplomatic contact at interest section level. The paper said Velayati, who is due to leave for Cairo on May 30, could meet his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa, but they "would not" discuss improving bilateral ties. The Iranian minister will be accompanied by a high-level political and economic delegation including a member of parliament's foreign affairs subcommittee, Jalal Sadatian, the English-language daily said. Since the revolution Tehran has been represented at international conferences in Cairo through low-ranking officials. The two governments have on several occasions expressed a desire to improve ties, but no breakthrough has yet been made due to the opposition from Islamic hardliners in Iran. The news of a meeting last September between Velayati and Musa in the sidelines of UN General Assembly triggered criticism from radicals.
