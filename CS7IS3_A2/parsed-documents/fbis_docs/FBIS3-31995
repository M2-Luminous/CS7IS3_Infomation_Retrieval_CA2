This MP was approved by 190 votes to 111 in the Chamber of Deputies and by 39 votes to five in the Senate. Now that MP No. 400 has been approved there are still five fiscal adjustment-related MP's pending: MP No. 407 that increases corporate income taxes 5 percent, MP No. 404 that establishes an inspection tax that banks must pay, MP No. 401 that increases the tax on financial operations for investments in the financial market, PM No. 394 that bans the use of Treasury funds at the Central Bank to pay anything but debts, and MP No. 392 on privatizations. Throughout the day the administration managed to get approval for only three of the nine other MP's Congress had to vote on. The obstructionist attitude of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] and the PFL [Liberal Front Party], unwilling to approve tax hikes, was jeopardizing the voting on the main fiscal adjustment measures. The PFL and the PPR broke the agreement they had reached with Finance Minister Henrique Cardoso the week before and asked for quorum verification. Unless there were 252 deputies present (the minimum required) the entire time, the session would be discontinued and it would be very difficult for the administration to get approval for the MP's, which would expire over the weekend. During the morning and afternoon of 26 January, Congress approved MP No. 402 that establishes an income tax on foreign investments in the stock market and the distribution of dividends, MP No. 399 that changes the Rural Land Tax (ITR), and MP No. 406 that reduces the deadline for the collection of federal taxes and contributions. In view of the inflexibility of the PPR and the PFL, Jose Serra, Brazilian Social Democracy Party speaker in the Chamber of Deputies, went so far as to threaten to withdraw the administration's support for the constitutional reform.
