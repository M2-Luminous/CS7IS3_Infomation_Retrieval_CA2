FR940127-1-00020 FR940127-1-00008 Five sources/source categories were identified as contributing to the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment problem in Columbia Falls. In the following table, an outline is presented on these sources, their control measures and associated emissions reduction credit, and effective dates. ␣ 1Source 1Control 1PM&hyph;10 Emissions Reduction 1Effective Re-entrained road dust lFlathead County Rules: ␣ 601 Sanding & chip sealing standards (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 602 Construction and Demolition Activity (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 603 Pavement of Roads Required (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 604 Pavement of Parking Lots Required (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 605 Street Sweeping and Flushing 47% (credit taken only for winter & spring) 10/03/91 ␣ 606 Clearing of land greater than 1/4 acre in size (requires measures to control dust when clearing areas larger than 1/4 acre) (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ Combined controls 130.7 tpy (during winter & spring) s Prescribed burning lFlathead County Rules: ␣ 201 (Open Burning) Definitions (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 202 Materials Prohibited (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 203 Minor Open Burning Source Requirements (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 204 Major Open Burning Source Requirements (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 205 Special Open Burning Periods (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 206 Fire Fighter Training (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 207 Conditional Air Quality Open Burning Permits (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 208 Emergency Open Burning Permits (no credit taken) 10/03/91 ␣ 209 Permit Fees (no credit taken) 10/03/91 Residential wood combustion Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program, CHAPTER VIII, Sub-chapter 3, Voluntary Solid Fuel Burning Device Curtailment Program and Sub-chapter 4, Prohibited Materials for Wood or Coal Residential Stoves (no credit taken) 10/03/91 Industry Plum Creek permit modification # 2667&hyph;M (no credit taken) 1/24/92 Motor vehicle exhaust Federal tailpipe standards (no credit taken) Ongoing due to fleet turnover A more detailed discussion of the source/source category contributions and their associated control measures (including available control technology) can be found in the TSD for this proposed action. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's PM&hyph;10 nonattainment plan will result in the attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. By this action EPA is proposing to approve the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 plan's RACM (including RACT) in its entirety.
