Shoichi Tanaka, [SDPJ Diet member from Kumamoto No. 1 District] member of the SDPJ's Central Executive Committee, rattles on: "I doubt their [the coalition partners] conscience. Restoring our trust in them is difficult, unless, for instance, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who leads the new parliamentary bloc `Kaishin,' former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of the Japan New Party, Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Chairman Keigo Ouchi, and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa of the Ichi-Ichi line, resign from their party posts." Tanaka is a member of the SDPJ rightwing faction, the "Democrats." Based on his stand to maintain the coalition, he has been busily engaged in reaching a consensus on policy issues within his party to coordinate policies with other coalition partners since the birth of the Hosokawa cabinet. Because such was his effort, he feels betrayed all the more. At the end of April immediately after the SDPJ decided to leave the government, AERA interviewed 27 SDPJ Diet members who are in their first or second terms. Most of the SDPJ Diet members viewed the pullout as a matter of course, but the reasons for their "excitement" are not limited to emotional reaction against Ozawa's way of doing politics. Ritsuo Hosokawa [Saitama No. 4 District] stressed: "It has become easier for the SDPJ to make its point. Although we cannot say which party we are going to align with, our course will become clear naturally as we maintain a policy of being fair and just." In other words, now that the Hata cabinet has come into being as the minority governing party, the SDPJ holds a deciding vote, standing between the government and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Such "comfort" is part of the reasons SDPJ members are in high spirits, according to Hosokawa. LDP-SDPJ Union: "Merely an Alliance of Convenience" However, the environment surrounding the SDPJ does not necessarily seem to let it enjoy such a feeling. Kenji Yoshioka [SDPJ, Hyogo No. 5 District] thinks that there will be more Diet members, like members of New Party Mirai [Future] and Jiyuto [Liberal Party], who will leave the LDP, which has lost its political centripetal force as the governing party. Feeling this will lead to the isolation of the SDPJ, Yoshioka warns his fellow party members who are in jolly spirits as follows: "To think that we hold a deciding vote is wrong. If there are going to be more and more Diet members from the LDP joining the coalition, the government will become a major conservative group. To prevent that, among other reasons, we should have remained in the government." While the SDPJ and the LDP are suddenly moving closer to each other since they both became the opposition, the possibility of it leading to birth of a "[LDP-SDPJ] coalition government" is very low. If 206 members of the LDP join with 74 members of the SDPJ, the number combined easily exceeds the lower house majority of 256. At the meeting between LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo on 27 April, they confirmed that the two parties will cooperate in managing Diet affairs. But many young SDPJ Diet members share the view of SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama who warned against further hasty "cooperation between the LDP and the SDPJ:" "We will not let the LDP regain power, nor permit the rise of an LDP-like government." Masanori Goto [Kochi district] said, "Coalition with the present LDP is unthinkable unless its rightwing members leave the party." According to Ryuichi Ikeda [Hokkaido No. 1 District], "The LDP still has its money politics disposition--the former Takeshita faction, for example. Coalition with the whole LDP is impossible." The SDPJ's basic policy toward political reorganization is to assemble "the SDPJ, the DSP, and liberal-minded political forces." In that respect, the scope of alliance with the LDP is limited to the pro-Constitution liberal forces. "LDP-SDPJ coalition," in which the SDPJ aligns with the whole LDP, appears to be "nothing but an alliance of convenience without policies" (Tanaka). SDPJ Divided on "Diet Dissolution" Nevertheless, the LDP's enthusiasm for [aligning with] the SDPJ is really strong. A symbolic scene was seen at a lower house plenary session on 27 April, one day after the SDPJ's decision to leave the coalition. The plenary session was held to discuss the extension of a law regarding a forest reserve, and when Takeshi Takeuchi, chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, stood to explain the purpose of the law, it was LDP members who applauded him greatly. Osamu Imamura [Aomori No. 1 District] thinks the LDP's applause was motivated by an "expectation." "Most LDP Diet members and 70-80 percent of SDPJ Diet members want an election under the present multiseat constituencies deep in their hearts." In other words, the applause of the LDP was its "expectation" for an alliance between the LDP and the SDPJ to overthrow the Hata cabinet, and realize dissolution of the lower house and a general election under the current system, according to Imamura. However, the views of the young SDPJ Diet members are divided on this point because the political reform bills, which stipulate a single-seat electoral system in combination with proportional representation, have already passed the Diet, and transfer to the new electoral system is possible now as soon as new constituencies are drawn up. The argument of Seiichi Kaneda [Hokkaido No. 3 District], in a sense, answers the "expectation" of the LDP: "Once an election is held under the single-seat constituency system, Ozawa's domination becomes absolute. To be honest, the current multiseat constituency system is the best." The view of Izumi Yamazaki [Nagasaki No. 2 District] can be regarded as middle-of-the-road: "Since we voted for the political reform bills, it is difficult for the SDPJ to propose dissolution. Nevertheless, if a problem arises in relation to the DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons program, appealing to the confidence of the whole nation is inevitable." On the other hand, Ryuichi Doi [Hyogo No. 1 District] has a completely different view. "[If the next election is held] under the multiseat constituency system, the SDPJ will "revert to its old self" because it is possible to win a seat even if a candidate is against the introduction [as published] of a consumption tax, which, in consideration of the Japan's future, is inevitable. [An election under the present system] should not be carried out." Confrontation Between the Right and the Left Remains Tax reform will be the largest issue in politics "after the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget." How will the SDPJ cope with the issue since it agreed to consider "indirect taxes" at the policy coordination meeting before its departure from the coalition? The members of the Democrat faction share almost the same opinions. Among them, Taisuke Sato [Aichi No. 1 District] said, "Leaving aside the discussion of whether [tax reform] is right or wrong, opposing any kind of tax reform is irresponsible and we cannot do so because our policy agreement with the coalition is an engagement made with the people." Sato's remark could be taken to mean he may cooperate with the government depending on the content of tax reform. Tatsukuni Komori [Hiroshima No. 3 District], a leftist SDPJ Diet member who voted against the political reform bills, thinks, "Some members of the SDPJ will rejoin the government forces within several months, a year at the latest, assuming that the next general election is held under the single-seat constituency system." Since the SDPJ's pullout from the coalition government was not triggered by a policy issue, the SDPJ at present might appear as if united. However, the picture of confrontation between the right and the left forces within the party remains. The government will attempt to split the SDPJ by taking advantage of Diet members who do not remain members of the SDPJ. Kenjiro Hatakeyama [Akita No. 1 District] said, "If we proceed with further reform of the party, without sticking to the left or the right, SDPJ members can work together as united." But, a persuasive, concrete plan was not heard from him.
