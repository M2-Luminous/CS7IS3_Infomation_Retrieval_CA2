FR940804-2-00162 FR940804-2-00087 3. In connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a UIT, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) are available only where all of the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies which offer their shares ``exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company, offering either scheduled or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company.'' Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) permits mixed funding. Rule 6e&hyph;3(T), however, does not permit shared funding. 4. Applicants state that the relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) is not affected by the purchase of shares of the Funds by the Plans. Applicants note, however, that because the relief under Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) is available only where shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts, additional exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the Funds are also to be sold to Plans. 5. As noted, Applicants state that changes in the tax law have created the opportunity for the Funds to increase their asset base through the sale of Fund shares to the Plans. Applicants state that Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of the Contracts held in the Funds. The Code provides that such Contracts shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance contract for any period in which the investments are not, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department, adequately diversified. On March 2, 1989, the Treasury Department issued regulations which established diversification requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable contracts. Treas. Reg. ยง1.817&hyph;5 (1989). The regulations provide that, to meet the diversification requirements, all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies. The regulations do, however, contain certain exceptions to this requirement, one of which allows shares in an investment company to be held by the trustee of a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company to also be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts. Treas. Reg. ยง1.817&hyph;5(f)(3)(iii). 6. Applicants state that the promulgation of Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act preceded the issuance of these Treasury regulations. Applicants assert that, given the then current tax law, the sale of shares of the same investment company to both separate accounts and Plans could not have been envisioned at the time of the adoption of Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15).
