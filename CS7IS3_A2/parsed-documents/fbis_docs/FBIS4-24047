However, SANDF soldiers were deployed at bases at the Transkei's request to quell the mutiny. This follows rioting last week when soldiers in Port St. Johns and Umtata protested against low salaries and held a senior officer hostage. The officer commanding the SANDF in the Transkei, Major General Themba Matanzima, said 195 Transkei Defense Force members were being held in connection with the mutiny.
