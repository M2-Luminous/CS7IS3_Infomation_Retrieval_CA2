FR940318-0-00056 FR940318-0-00011 Aminorex is orally active but the most common route of administration is via nasal insufflation. It is usually sold as amphetamine or methamphetamine. There has been one death in 1990 associated with aminorex abuse in the United States. Abuse of aminorex produces the same public health risks as those associated with other clandestinely produced stimulants such as methamphetamine with the additional risk factor of pulmonary hypertension. Based upon the investigation and review conducted by DEA and upon the scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation of the Assistant Secretary for Health received in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Acting Administrator for the DEA, pursuant to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811 (a) and (b), finds that: (1) Aminorex has a high potential for abuse; (2) Aminorex has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and, (3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of aminorex under medical supervision.
