These findings regarding the development of average prices are based on data contained in customs statistics and capture not only price developments, but also changes in the quality structure of the assortment of goods involved. The Czech Statistical Office, therefore, introduced a selective price index for foreign trade, on the basis of standard selection methods of price statistics, in which the influences of these changes are excluded to the maximum possible extent. Simpler Conditions The price indexes for imports and exports make it possible to monitor pure price movements, the development of exchange relationships, and the impact of price developments upon the development of imports, exports, and the balance of trade. Price indexes of this type are available only in some countries and the Czech Statistical Office is thus similar to indexes that were worked out during the 1970's and 1980's, but under totally different -- essentially simpler -- conditions resulting from the monopolization of foreign trade. The schematic of the selective index for import and export prices was designed during 1993 in accordance with the standardized system (of the customs duty rate table). In so doing, use was made of exhaustive data provided by customs statistics and a one-time unique selective investigation, which was carried out involving enterprises, joint-stock corporations, and corporations with limited liability which were of importance to Czech Republic foreign trade. Some 998 export items and 797 import items, including products, raw materials, and materials which occupy a significant share in the overall volume of foreign trade and regarding which it is anticipated that they will be long-term objects of foreign trade activities, were included in the index. The selection is expected to undergo minimum changes in order to be able to show actual price developments in foreign trade. Quarterly Determinations Prices are determined on a quarterly basis and reflect commercial parities and prices quoted as "all charges prepaid to border" of the Czech Republic for imports and prices quoted as "all charges prepaid to border" for Czech Republic exports. They are recomputed in terms of appropriate monetary exchange rates and do not contain value-added tax, nor consumer tax. But the price indexes do include the influence of changes in foreign exchange rates and the influence of changes in the composition of foreign markets. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 = 100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Selective Index for 1993 |Index of Average Values | | | |for 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total imports |99.7 |98.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total exports |104.0 |102.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Real exchange relations |104.3 |103.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Those who did the indexes are aware of the fact that a selective index monitors net price movements only based on a limited representative quantity of selective products, whereas the index of average values captures the broader region of commercial commodities; however, the index fully meets the monitored goals. As can be seen from the data in the table, there are no significant differences between the index results for 1993. Results of the Investigation From the indexes acquired, it is clear that price developments in 1993 were moving toward lower prices for imports; compared with 1992, prices declined by 0.3 percent; and there were mainly opposite trends in terms of exports, where prices rose by 4 percent, which is proof of the better assertion of Czech exports in foreign markets. The investigation showed that, in 1993 imports, prices of mineral fuels specifically declined by 10.3 percent. This was mostly accounted for by oil, which is one of the most important raw materials in this group. The surplus in the amount of oil offered on world markets signaled a decline in petroleum prices last year. Also, prices of animal and plant oils declined by 11.5 percent; the price decline in chemicals was more modest at 4.4 percent; foodstuffs and live animal prices declined by 3.3 percent. On the other hand, the prices of various industrial products rose by 8.7 percent; those of raw materials, with the exception of fuels, rose by 4.7 percent, and prices of machinery and transportation devices rose by 3.5 percent. On the other hand, in exports, the prices of various industrial products rose by 16.1 percent, those of foodstuffs by 10.9 percent, and those of machinery and transportation devices by 8 percent. But even here there was a decline--raw materials prices declined by 12.3 percent, prices of chemical industry products declined by 7.2 percent, and prices of mineral fuels declined by 4.8 percent. In terms of current prices, the balance of trade ended up with a surplus of approximately 5 billion korunas [Kc]. Given an unchanged price level, in other words, in comparable prices for 1992, last year's foreign trade activities ended up on the down side with a deficit of approximately Kc9 billion. The interyear development of price relationships thus resulted in 1993 revenues of virtually Kc15 billion.
