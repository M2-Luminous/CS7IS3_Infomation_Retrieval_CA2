Almost certainly that opposition will employ violent methods," an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 20 February on page 24 notes. "The horrific murder of 14 ANC [African National Congress] canvassers in Natal serves notice of what lies ahead." However, "talk of `civil war' is both exaggerated and premature." "Stress fractures are beginning to show in the ranks" of the Freedom Alliance. In Natal Chief Buthelezi's moderates are "falling away" and "among the white right-wingers there are two clearly defined factions led by General Constand Viljoen and by Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg (with the raving Eugene Terreblanche usurping leadership as the posturing becomes more extreme)." "The murder of the ANC canvassers (and the continuing assassination of Inkatha leaders, for that matter) suggests that intervention cannot be far off." It would be "unconscionable" for any "opponent of the election" to use "the resources of the state, whether Bantustan police or rural police and military reservists, to conduct a campaign of violence against the state. The first step is to ensure that such resources are under proper control." SUNDAY NATION Business Responsibliity -- An editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 20 February on page 6 notes that "major business giants have been generating colossal profits under the protection of an apartheid system." "Business must realise that the buzz-word `free market economy' makes little or no sense sense to more than half of the economically active population which remains unemployed, to hundreds of thousands of kids without schools, to millions of people without clean water or access to health care facilities to name a few." "The main protection of our new democracy will be in ensuring that the majority of the population, tha main victims of apartheid's injustices, end with a new more meaningful life with values that underpin commitment and positive faith in a new society." SATURDAY STAR Old South Africa -- "Standerton displayed the worst of the old South Africa this week -- adamant refusal by a magistrate to allow a protest march, police firing shotguns and teargas at a massed crowd, trucks burning in the township. It was a sobering reminder that processes that have taken hold in some places -- negotiated agreements to allow protest, minimum force by the police, active monitoring and marshalling -- are not in place in others," an editorial in the Johannesburg SATURDAY STAR in English on 19 February on page 10 notes. "The powerful men in plattleland [rural areas] towns say they don't want their towns torn apart. But they don't seem to have learnt one of the main lessons of the old South Africa -- that stifling protest is the surest way to guarantee conflict." RAPPORT Optimism Over Settlement Not Unfounded -- "The finer details on the concessions which the government and the African National Congress made this week are still unknown," says a page-22 editorial on the Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 20 February. "But in the main the package sounds like an important step in the right direction of the creation of a true federation in South Africa, with important powers to the provinces." "But the unhappiness in the Freedom Alliance over the manner in which the package was presented points to a deep-seated mistrust of the parties that made the proposals. This suspicion will hopefully be removed this week if the alliance can be convinced of the honest intention that provinces must enjoy greater autonomy in the new dispensation. It is also in the interests of the members of the alliance that they in turn convince the country of their honest intention to reach a settlement in order to remove suspicion towards them." "A true federation is essential if an inclusive solution is desired by all parties," warns RAPPORT. "No party with confederal ambitions should disguise its goal behind pseudo federalism." "Initial indications are that the latest proposals, `self-determination' and all, still have not resolved the homeland issue. And it is not easy. In the absence of concrete proposals in this regard, the most sensible option of moderate right-wingers would be to follow an evolutionary path towards the establishment of an own territory. Clear demands must be presented, which can then be entrenched in a new constitution. It is in this that people like General Constand Viljoen and others need to take the lead. Optimism over an historic constitutional agreement is there thus not unfounded. But time is marching relentlessly on." Choice for Freedom Alliance is Simple -- In an article on page 23 of RAPPORT, Anne-Marie Mischke writes: "By the end of the week the government and the African National Congress [ANC] were able to heave a sigh of relief. They believe they are once again on that very hallowed piece of earth, the moral high ground, where every South African politician has for the past few years been trying to get a foothold. To gain this moral high ground, a politician or a party must be able to say to the world, look, I did the right thing; whatever happens, my hands are clean. So the government and the ANC feel they have arrived there this week, with their package of concessions." "There was much sympathy for the problems facing the two parties, given their unbending negotiating partners who contunually moved the goalposts." "The choice facing the Freedom Alliance is actually simple: Do they want to go ahead with their all-or-nothing attitude, or to they want to accept the concessions and use them after the election for further bargaining? It is the latter strategy which General Constand Viljoen was holding up to the Afrikaner National Front when he was shouted down two weeks ago. The new constitutional principle on self-determination as well as a mechanism for the further consideration of a homeland after the election provide the basis for this strategy. The alliance does, however, not have too much time to decide what they are going to do." "The government and the ANC insitst that the election date is final and untouchable. We all know that in politics nothing is final and untouchable -- but in the minds of the government and the ANC that date is certainly written in stone for now."
