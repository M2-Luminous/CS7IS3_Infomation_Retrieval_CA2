I offer my congratulations to the martyr-nurturing ummah and to the esteemed leader on the auspicious occasion of the 10 Days of Dawn. As our martyr-rearing nation is aware, there was an assassination attempt on the life of our country's beloved president. Many people have expressed concern through personal contact or by telephone. They kept requesting that we should explain the issue more. Although the interrogations are not completed yet, I will explain some of the issues to our dear nation to respond to the request of the people. You know that during the current year global arrogance employed various means to put pressure to bear on the Islamic Republic of Iran and on the Iranian nation. This is because our nation has refused to submit to the pressure exerted by global arrogance, thanks to our people's firm determination, their perseverance and their support for the esteemed leader, the beloved president and the state authorities. This was economic pressure, the fall in oil prices, psychological warfare, efforts to isolate the Islamic Republic regime, efforts to distort the regime's face abroad, psychological war inside the country and assistance given to their elements, who during the past several years have tried to remain lackeys of aliens. In this connection about 24 bombs were smuggled inside the country. But thanks to the vigilance of the hidden imam's unknown soldiers, 20 of these bombs were discovered, but unfortunately four of the said bombs exploded. In this connection 16 people were arrested. Meanwhile two brothers working for the Intelligence Ministry were martyred. Also during the current year, we have arrested about 40 spies, who have had links with Iraq's security service. There have been other security problems this year. Thanks to the efforts of the hidden imam's soldiers, the cooperation of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, the law enforcement forces and other intelligence organs, these conspiracies were unravelled and neutralized and security was maintained in our society. Naturally, because of his effectiveness, because he is an outstanding and vital figure in our revolution, the honorable president has constantly been the target of arrogant blows. It is not the first time and it will not be the last time that such a conspiracy has been perpetrated; they have committed such acts many times. We even saw that they tried to assassinate the popular president of the Iranian nation in the outset of the Islamic revolution. When we identified the main members of the group -- those who are now known to us as the principle perpetrators of that deed -- they are people of bad record, of poor or no faith, irresponsible and corrupt. Some of them also had connections with minigroups. The person who instilled most of the negative thoughts in the mind of Nik-Akhtar [man arrested for attempt to shoot Rafsanjani] was a person named Mortaza Mehrpu, who worked in the police department before the revolution. After the Islamic revolution he was purged and joined the Feda'i-ye Khalq minigroup. He spent some time in prison and was then released. After the minigroup was smashed he became inactive and pursued his own evil aims and had a very bad life. He was addicted to alcoholic drinks and had unhealthy relationships. Nik-Akhtar, himself, after he left secondary school, was an unsuitable person in terms of faith and deeds and morals. Twice he applied to join the [Revolution Guards] Corps, but was rejected. However, with the help of his friends who were also minigroup members he began his national service and was dispatched to Zahedan. There he tried to pretend that he was a suitable person. He made out that he had good points. He tried to take part in religious publicity work, although he did not have a proper faith and did not even perform his prayers. Finally he arrived in Tehran and started working as a reporter in NEGAHBAN magazine and some other magazines. There was another person by the name of Mohammad Musavi-Nia. He is a person who has failed in life and feels dejected. In terms of piety and faith he is very weak. He is a person who is affected by negative issues in the society. He mostly read newspapers which published negative articles and tried to explain those issues in gatherings. There is another person in the group who, for security reasons, I will not name now. He was connected to some foreign embassies. Of course, there are other persons who helped them from the fringes or provided facilities for them. They, unfortunately, worked in some newspapers. If their roles become clear to us we will take serious measures about them. The way they worked was that they initially tried to carry out this deed during Friday prayers. They went to the Friday prayers venue a number of times and reconnoitred the place. They studied Friday prayers programs and those who delivered Friday prayers sermons. Based on information they gleaned from the Friday prayers they discovered which day the honorable president would deliver the sermons. They had planned their action for that day, which coincided with the 10 Days of Dawn period. They thought that if they carried out the deed at the shrine of his holiness the imam [Khomeyni] and on 12 Bahman [1 February] it would be more fitting. They, therefore, tested the weapon they had obtained. Nik-Akhtar and his friend Musavi-Nia went to the shrine of his holiness the imam. Of course, to encourage Nik-Akhtar, Musavi-Nia said let me do it. But eventually Nik-Akhtar said no, I will do it myself. They went there and using ploys they tried to evade the shrine security guards. They entered the shrine. It was the beginning of the speech. The people had not congregated properly yet. When they entered the shrine they saw that they could not go to the front. Based on the information they had received they thought they could do the deed from a distance of 50 or 60 meters. They found a secluded spot and Nik-Akhtar fired at the podium. Of course, the first shot was aimed at the podium. But he got nervous and could not aim the subsequent shots at the podium. He emptied his magazine and threw his weapon down and tried to mingle in the crowd, but the people arrested him. Of course the people were angry and beat him up severely. Other things happened in the place. Apparently some had held him tight and the officers could not take him away from the scene. This is worthy of consideration. We recommend that in such instances the people should allow the officers to take away the accused individual. Otherwise the assailant might be killed. The same thing happened to [Kurush] Nik-Akhtar and the probability of his being killed was very high. Anyway after the arrest, he was handed over to the intelligence forces and the task of identifying the others began. So far in this connection I have come to the conclusion that these are basically adventurous elements, they lack belief, are influenced by negative insinuations, and are mostly individuals who do not go along with the revolution and Islam. They have taken such an action not because of current difficulties, rather they have opposed our system from the beginning and for a long time. Although the organized mini-groups have mostly disappeared, their remnants may come together in circles to exploit the wounds inflicted on society. At this point I wish to thank the Hezbollahi ummah for its cooperation with the Intelligence Ministry. I am also grateful to the intelligence association, the military and law enforcement forces for endeavoring to maintain security in the society. May God grant success to all of us to improve the society's security daily. Despite all the conspiracies, our society, our country is the most safe country in the world. We owe this to all the law enforcement forces, the Guards Corps and intelligence forces in society. May God's peace and mercy be upon you all.
