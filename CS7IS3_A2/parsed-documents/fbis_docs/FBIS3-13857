Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik has learned that the two are 'Oded 'Eran, assistant director general in charge of economics, and Rafi Baraq, the head of the Foreign Ministry director general's bureau. They will return home in less than 24 hours. The Foreign Ministry refused to confirm or deny the report.
