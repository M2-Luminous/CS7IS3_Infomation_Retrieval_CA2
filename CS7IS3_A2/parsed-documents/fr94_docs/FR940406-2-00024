ACTION: Notice of determination not to revoke countervailing duty order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order on malleable iron pipe fittings from Thailand. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202)482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On February 1, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (59 FR 4692) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on malleable iron pipe fittings from Thailand (54 FR 6439; February 10, 1989). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. On February 28, 1994, the Cast Iron Pipe Fitting Committee, petitioners in the original investigation, objected to our intent to revoke the order. Because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). Dated: March 22, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8257 Filed 4&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
