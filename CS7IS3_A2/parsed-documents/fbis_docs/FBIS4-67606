It is envisaged to grant the medical care establishments independent juristic persons status which, according to Minister of Health Tancho Gugalov, will make it possible for them to negotiate the required funds with the municipalities. The fines for not complying with the standards of sanitation and hygiene would be increased, varying from 1,000 to 1.5 million leva. The Public Health Act operating now was adopted in 1973.
