['Abbas] In principle, we oppose this plan, and we have expressed our opposition through various means and in different places, including the PLO institutions, the Executive Committee, the Central Council, and the subsidiary institutions, and also whenever we had an opportunity to criticize this plan or oppose this agreement. This is because we view this agreement as a relinquishment of the constant national principles in which we believe and for which we have offered sacrifices. Our Palestinian Arab people have paid a great price to achieve their aspirations and objectives, which are much greater than the maximum benefits offered by this agreement. This agreement does not achieve even the minimum of our people's aspirations. It was signed under circumstances in which the balance of power was in favor of the enemy by all standards. In brief, when the balance of power is in favor of the enemy, an agreement serving the enemy's interest is the result. [passage omitted] [Al-Dik] What are your future plans for dealing with the new situation in view of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement? ['Abbas] We confronted this agreement even before it was signed. Now, instead of just rejecting the agreement we must work so that this agreement does not turn into the end result of the Palestinian struggle. [Al-Dik] Do you believe that there is an agreement between 'Arafat and the Israelis on not releasing the detainees who oppose the peace march? ['Abbas] Israel has publicly declared this, so it does not need an agreement. However, the PLO leadership, which represents the Palestinian people, cannot sign such an agreement because this leadership does not distinguish between Palestinians and because it is duty-bound to protect the Palestinian people. [passage omitted] [Al-Dik] What will be the [Palestine Liberation] Front's position on the Palestinian police if the latter confronts the Front's elements who attack the Zionists? ['Abbas] The Arab borders are wide, and so is the area on which the Zionists are present. When we decide to fight the enemy, we will certainly choose a way that will keep us away from clashes with our people's sons in terms of the police and security forces. We will also complete our march without involving ourselves in a confrontation with any nationalist Palestinian. [Al-Dik] As a Front, was participation in the self-rule authority offered to you? ['Abbas] Yes, it was directly proposed to us in our capacity as a part of the PLO. Our choice was to join the field institutions that are directly concerned with our people's situation in the self-rule areas. Participation in the self-rule authority, however, was left for the future because it will take a political decision by the organization's bodies. We have not made a final decision on this issue, and we have requested some time to consider it. The final decision, however, will be made by the Front's leadership, although my personal opinion is not to participate. [passage omitted] [Al-Dik] Following the [Israeli-PLO] agreement, is it possible that such agreements can end the state of animosity and conflict with the Zionist enemy? ['Abbas] Of course not. The current solution is fully in line with the present situation, which is not a normal situation. A solution that would end the conflict should necessarily take into account the interests and rights of the Palestinian and Arab peoples. I can see no current solution to the conflict. However, I can see a form of truce imposed by the influential world forces. The extent of these forces' influence may perpetuate or shorten such a truce. [passage omitted]
