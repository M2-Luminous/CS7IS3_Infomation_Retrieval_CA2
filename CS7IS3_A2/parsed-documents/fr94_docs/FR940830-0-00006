FR940830-0-00006 FR940830-0-00003 Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 997 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;997&hyph;2IFR] Clarifying and Updating Provisions Regulating the Quality of Domestically Produced Peanuts Handled by Persons Not Subject to the Peanut Marketing Agreement AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim rule clarifies that peanut handlers not signatory to Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 (Agreement) may store and shell certain Segregation 2 seed peanut lots with Segregation 1 seed peanut lots when such lots are produced under the auspices of a State agency which regulates or controls their production. This interim rule also updates information on the laboratories qualified to perform aflatoxin testing of shelled peanuts. Allowing peanut handlers to commingle certain seed peanut lots reduces the space and costs needed to store seed peanuts. Updating laboratory information should assist handlers in moving peanuts to market. These changes are intended to bring the non-signatory handling requirements into conformity with those specified in the Agreement. DATES: This interim final rule is effective August 30, 1994. Comments received by September 29, 1994 will be considered prior to finalization of the rule. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this rule. Comments must be sent in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, D.C., 20090&hyph;6456, or Fax: (202) 720&hyph;5698. Comments should reference the docket number and the date and page number of this issue of the Federal Register and will be available for public inspection in the Office of the Docket Clerk during regular business hours. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Lower, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456, telephone (202) 720&hyph;2020, facsimile (202) 720&hyph;5698. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This interim rule is issued pursuant to requirements of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. There are approximately 45 handlers of peanuts who have not signed the Agreement who are subject to the regulations contained herein. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. It is estimated that most of the handlers are small entities. Most producers doing business with these handlers are also small entities. Small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. In 1993, the reported U.S. production, mostly covered under the Agreement, was approximately 3.33 billion pounds of peanuts, a 22 percent decrease from 1992 and the lowest level since 1983. The preliminary 1993 peanut crop value is $991.65 million, 77 percent of the 1992 crop value. After aflatoxin was found in peanuts in the mid-1960's, the domestic peanut industry has sought to minimize aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut products. Under authority of the Act, Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 and the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) were established by the Secretary in 1965. The Agreement was signed by a majority of domestic peanut handlers.
