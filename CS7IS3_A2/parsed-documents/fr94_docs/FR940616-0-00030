FR940616-0-00030 FR940616-0-00008 In support of its claim to withdraw section 214.101(d), the AAR alleges that because section 19 of the RSIA requires FRA to issue rules, as necessary, for the protection of maintenance-of-way employees on railroad bridges, FRA is the exclusive Federal agency to regulate this subject matter. Also, the AAR states that FRA does not have the discretion ``to delegate to OSHA a portion of its responsibility to regulate bridge worker safety.'' FRA has not delegated any authority to OSHA through publication of section 214.101(d); characterizing section 214.101(d) as a delegation is simply a misstatement of FRA's relationship with OSHA and OSHA's existing authority to regulate occupational safety and health matters in every American workplace. Rather, FRA has purposefully chosen not to exercise its authority over certain working conditions that OSHA also has the authority to regulate, and over which OSHA has comprehensively exercised its authority. The AAR also argues that FRA violated the APA by not seeking public comment on section 214.101(d), and that this section represents ``a radical departure'' from the NPRM and long-standing policy. On the contrary, this section accurately reflects an extensive discussion in the preamble of the NPRM and its inclusion in the rule text is in direct response to written comments submitted to the docket during the rulemaking. Clearly, those commenters knew the matter was at issue. Notice and comment would be required if section 214.101(d) represented a new regulatory scheme for the enforcement of occupational safety and health standards in the railroad workplace. Clearly, that is not the case. Section 214.101(d) is a statement of FRA's interpretation of the law and is wholly consistent with FRA's previous interpretive statements. From as long ago as publication of the Policy Statement in 1978, FRA has stated that it will exercise authority over working conditions intrinsic to or closely related to railroad operations requiring FRA's unique expertise, and has exercised its authority in some of those areas. All other occupational safety and health matters continue to be governed by OSHA where that agency has exercised its authority over a specific working condition. The AAR concludes that the Policy Statement makes ``the regulation of areas along railroad operating rights-of-way *␣*␣* exclusively the province of FRA.'' This conclusion is incorrect, as it embodies the very ``territorial'' approach to jurisdiction FRA rejected in 1978. The AAR chooses to misconstrue the functional distinction drawn by the Policy Statement as a territorial division of jurisdiction (``fixed facilities such as offices and shops'' as OSHA's versus ``areas along railroad operating rights-of-way'' as FRA's), which it explicitly is not. For instance, as the NPRM in this proceeding clearly states (56 FR 3435), the Policy Statement divested OSHA of authority to regulate the surfaces on railroad bridges, such as track and signal structures, but did not oust OSHA entirely from regulating any working condition that arises on a railroad bridge, as the AAR argues. Also, the plain language of the Policy Statement left the regulation of personal protective equipment with OSHA until FRA chose to exercise its authority in that regard. 43 FR 10583, 10588 (March 14, 1978). In promulgating the initial final rule, FRA methodically considered the hazards bridge work poses; exercised its authority to regulate the use of certain personal protective equipment; and left other working conditions (for instance, exposure to airborne toxins and attendant respirator use) under existing applicable OSHA standards. The areas left to OSHA are those in which FRA neither has, nor can quickly acquire, the expertise necessary for effective implementation of relevant standards. Were FRA to include such matters within its rule without the ability to enforce the relevant standards, it would, as a practical matter, be creating a gap in the protection of railroad workers, which it does not want to do. Moreover, but for respiratory protection, which FRA proposed to include in its rule but ultimately decided to leave to OSHA, FRA never even proposed standards on the matters section 214.101(d) specifies as being included within the areas left to OSHA ( i.e., hazard communications, hearing protection, welding and lead exposure standards). Section 214.101(d) merely states the relationship between FRA's substantive standards and OSHA's; it does not impose a new substantive burden. Whatever substantive burdens OSHA's rules place on railroads are the result of OSHA's exercise of its authority prior to issuance of FRA's rule. This section only attempts to clarify which of those pre-existing standards still apply even after the issuance of FRA's final rule, which displaces some of them. Section 214.101(d) imposes no new substantive burdens and, accordingly, notice and comment was not necessary prior to issuance of this essentially interpretive rule. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the NPRM invited comment on where the jurisdictional lines should be drawn and demonstrated FRA's intent to clarify it. FRA stated: Thus, one question is whether the occupational safety issues presented by work on railroad bridges are so inherent to the railroad environment that FRA alone should regulate them, or whether they cut across industry lines without raising special concerns in the railroad context and thus are properly addressed by general OSHA standards. 56 FR 3434. FRA noted that there was considerable confusion about which OSHA standards applied and that it had placed in the docket various legal memoranda from railroads and railroad associations on this issue. FRA then stated: ``[T]he appropriate federal standards for personal protection, and the identity of the agency responsible for their enforcement, must be crystal clear.'' 56 FR 3435. No participant in the rulemaking can be heard to complain about FRA's having provided the clarification it promised. Therefore, although notice of this interpretive rule was not required, it was effectively provided.
