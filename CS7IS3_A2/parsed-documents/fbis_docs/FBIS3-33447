The authors say that "several peasants were beaten with truncheons and four policemen were injured with stones" during a confrontation between the departmental National Police and peasants closing Highway 3. The article says the peasants were protesting for better prices for their products and against the arrest last week of some peasants in Campos Morombi, San Pedro Department. The article states: "About 50 policemen arrived in the area at 1045 and disbanded the demonstrators occupying the highway without using any type of arms." However, the peasants began throwing stones when police removed tree trunks from the roadway. Police then reacted and beat some of the peasants with truncheons. The peasants, however, closed the road again soon afterward and threw stones at some passing vehicles. The authors say the impasse continued until Caaguazu Governor Mario Soto Estigarribia and national Deputy Silvio Ovelar came to talk with the peasants, promising to address their grievances and to arrange a meeting with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. The authors say peasant leader Jose Ruiz Diaz addressed his fellow peasants, saying: "We will leave the highway now and go home to take our arms in order to get ready for tomorrow," because if President Wasmosy does not agree to our demands "we will close the highway again" and "we will fight the police with the same weapons they use against us."
