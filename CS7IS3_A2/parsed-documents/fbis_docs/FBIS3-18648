The Center Democrats are in an electoral alliance with the Liberal and Conservative Parties for the European Parliament elections. The leader of the Center Democrats [CD], Business Policy and Coordination Minister Mimi Jakobsen, agreed with her policy spokesman, Peter Duetoft, when he announced yesterday that Danish membership in the WEU must be a part of the basis for a new government. "It won't be the deciding factor, but it is one of the points the CD will fight for. It's entirely natural," Jakobsen said. She said that there was nothing new in the fact that the CD is working in favor of membership in the WEU, but the CD's partner in the coalition government, Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party), was not enthusiastic about Duetoft's statement, which he believes is "ill timed." "We have a government and the basis for a government, so I would also like to point out that when putting together a government you can't promise that Denmark will or will not be part of the WEU," Helveg Petersen said. He finds the debate important, but believes it is too restrictive just to debate the WEU. "The WEU is in fact just a very small detail. On the other hand, we do want to have a broad national debate about the entire changed security policy situation in Europe. It's needed," the foreign minister said. The CD will not get unexpected support from the Conservative and Liberal Parties in starting now to introduce membership in the WEU as part of the basis for forming a future government. The Liberal and Conservative parties have in fact just formed an electoral alliance with the CD for the European Parliament elections in June. "It is a completely absurd situation for Denmark to be the only European NATO country that is just there as an observer while the WEU, with the blessing of the United States, has begun to play a role in European security. We must have a discussion about this, something the government has thus far rejected. For that reason it is a brilliant idea for the CD to have made inroads in the discussion," said former Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal Party). The Conservatives' Kent Kirk believes the present foreign minister is neglecting the importance of the WEU. "WEU membership will be a very significant policy element in connection with the creation of a new government," he said.
