While the gap between the two regions is historical, however, it's widening is real. During the current National People's Congress session, although western deputies still called for state support and preferential treatment in terms of policies, funds, and projects, more and more people started laying more emphasis on facing the reality that called for a quick catch up. The phenomenon has unveiled an important fact: the western region is awakening. First of all, it is necessary to point out that there are many difficulties in developing the western region: geographical restraints, relatively poor infrastructure, late start, exodus of qualified personnel and funds to the east, and others. It is completely reasonable for them to request for state help. What is commendable is that more westerners are now focusing their sights on the inner layers of the problems. In what ways has the western region been inferior to the eastern region? -- Lagging behind in thinking and concept. Several deputies from the minority nationalities in Ningxia and Xinjiang have pointed out: While others have been using air travel in pursuing the four modernizations, we have to stop riding a donkey in search of a meal. To accelerate development in the minority nationalities regions along the frontiers, it is essential to continue emancipating minds, renew concepts, overcome the mentality of "a little fortune will be enough to bring a sudden change and not getting rich does not mean no comfort," and really take "conducive to three causes" [conducive to developing the productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, and improving the people's living standard] as the sole yardstick in gauging our work. The change in concept heralds the awakening of the western region. -- Under development of village and town enterprises. Deputies from Sichuan Province stated that, although the production value of Sichuan's village and town enterprises increased 95 percent last year, its absolute quantity is still far less than the developed coastal region. In comparison, the difference of per capita value of total social production among agricultural population between the western and eastern regions is 5,897 yuan, of which segment of village and town enterprises accounted for 84.5 percent. The western region's backwardness lies in village and town enterprises; it is also in these very village and town enterprises where we find potential and hopes. -- Small steps in opening up to the outside world. Western deputies have discovered that, although the doors of the provinces, counties, and mountain villages are wide open, people may still not be coming; yet, despite mountain after mountain and river after river, nothing can block the flow of qualified personnel and funds toward the east. This is mainly due to the role of market mechanisms. According to them, as far as opening up is concerned, there is no such thing as being situated at the rear; what is intolerable is sitting idly at the doorstep and waiting for guests to appear and blaming everyone and everything but oneself. To channel in funds, technologies, and qualified personnel from other provinces and countries, the western region must rely on their own superiority and take the initiative in launching the offensive. What are the western region's advantages? It's resources. Unlike the past, when westerners refer to the definition of resources today, they do not merely mean "the rich natural resources on and under the ground." They have further discovered that its untapped big markets, ample labor supply, existing state-owned large and medium enterprises, "third-line" enterprises, universities and colleges, and scientific research academies and institutes are all valuable resources of the western region. Western deputies said: With help from the state, support from the eastern region, opportunities brought about by a market economy, and joint efforts of the westerners, the western region's resources superiority will certainly be translated into comprehensive economic superiority that will gradually narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions before a sure economic takeoff.
