She said the talks were put back at the request of Geneva security officials. Geneva police will be mobilized on January 15 and 16 because of the scheduled summit there between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to try to further efforts to reach an Arab-Israeli peace. The Bosnian peace talks will be held with leaders from the republic's three warring factions -- Moslems, Croats and Serbs -- as well as the presidents of Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro. The peace talks broke off on December 23 amid Bosnian Moslem demands for more land concessions. Bilateral Bosnian-Croatian talks were held Tuesday in Vienna between Bosnia's Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic in the presence of mediators of the international peace conference on ex-Yugoslavia, Lord Owen for the European Community and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations. The two said as they entered talks they hoped to reach a ceasefire agreement, amid a rise in fighting between Moslem and Croat troops in central Bosnia.
