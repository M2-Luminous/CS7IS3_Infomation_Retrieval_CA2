The prime ministers discussed problems of bilateral security and the security of the Baltic Sea region, the positions of both countries on the Partnership for Peace plan, and the possibilities and areas of cooperation between Lithuania and Sweden. We are grateful to the Government of Sweden for the huge help granted to us in all areas, starting with the Ignalina nuclear power station and ending with environment protection, Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius told the ELTA correspondent. Sweden welcomes the acceleration of the process of integration of the Baltic states. The Swedish prime minister's evaluation of joint efforts by the Baltic states to strengthen the control over the eastern borders, while implementing joint projects on the control over the airspace and maritime borders, was very positive. Sweden will also help us to organize the training of the joint peacekeeping unit. It has been agreed that Sweden, together with other Scandinavian countries, will take part in the drawing up of a project of a trunk gas pipeline from the North Sea to the Baltic states. All the Scandinavian countries have interest in this project. We proposed to Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt that the Baltic Institute in Karlsten should open a branch in Klaipeda. The trade volume with Sweden in the overall balance of Lithuania's imports and exports comprises 3-4 percent. More than 70 Swedish-Lithuanian joint enterprises have been set up. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are setting up a council of ministers of the Baltic states similar to the currently existing Nothern Council of Ministers, which comprises five countries, including the Scandinavian countries. Much attention was given at the meeting to the problems of the Kaliningrad region. It has been agreed to give support in various ways to the so-called Balladour plan and to aspire that a common concept on the demilitarization of this region as a guarantee to our security be formed. Dialogue between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad region is also important; therefore, the possibility of participation in this dialogue by the Western experts was discussed. The participation of Western experts in the preparation of agreements on military transit was touched upon. The experience of Western countries in this sphere is of great value to us; apart from this, the military transit through Lithuania should be coordinated with our neighbors, Adolfas Slezevicius told the ELTA correspondent.
