Anatoliy Zlenko, minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine, stated this in an interview for journalists. In his opinion, it is in the interest of Crimeans and in the interest of Ukraine as a whole to keep everything as it was prior to these elections. I believe, the head of the foreign policy department of our state emphasized, that politicians and those who took part in the Crimean presidential elections will have enough sense and strength of will not to complicate the situation.
