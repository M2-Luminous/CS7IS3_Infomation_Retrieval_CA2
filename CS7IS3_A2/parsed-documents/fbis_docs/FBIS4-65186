The secret ballot produced a result of 91 votes in favor, 42 blank, and one against. 25 deputies were absent from the meeting, including several members of the government and Felipe Gonzalez himself, and the three replacements in the seats of Carlos Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Baltasar Garzon, who did not regularize their status as members of parliament until yesterday afternoon. Alfonso Guerra did not attend, either. This result, in which the Guerraists did not reach 33 percent of the vote, is quite different from that recorded at Carlos Solchaga's election as spokesman 10 months ago, when the former economy minister's candidacy won 89 votes against the 66 of Guerraist Eduardo Martin Toval. This fact means that Guerraism has lost almost 11 percent of its support in the Socialist group in parliament during the past year. Afterward, Almunia played down the poll's significance and stated that he would not have minded if voting had also taken place at Monday's Executive Committee meeting, at which Guerra advised seeking a candidate who would attract greater consensus. However, government sources deemed it "especially undesirable" to force a vote at this time of grave political crisis. [passage omitted]
