America SK1202033794 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD in English 12 Feb 94 p 8 SK1202033794 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD Language: English Article Type:BFN [By staff reporter Yi Kyo-kwan] [Text] Korean businesses are stepping up their investment in North America to adapt to changes in the region's business environment following the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which went into effect Jan. 1. Particularly, Korean manufacturers of electronic appliances and autos are hurrying to set up locally incorporated plants in the region to meet the strengthened regulations for country of origin clause in the free trade agreement. The implementation of NAFTA is expected to affect Korean exports of electronic goods, autos and fabrics as the regulations for country of origin under the agreement have been toughened, business officials said. For example, the new country of origin rules require exporters of color TV sets to the region to use locally produced color picture tubes (CPTs) for 14-inch or bigger sets if they want to enjoy tariff exemption. In addition, the agreement demands that exporters of passenger cars, light trucks, engines and transmissions increase their use of locally produced parts from the present 50 percent to 62.5 percent by 2002 to gain tariff exemption. Accordingly, trade officials here have urged Korean companies to establish locally incorporated production factories in the NAFTA region as soon as possible to stave off these "protectionist" measures. Goldstar Co., one of the leading electronics manufacturers in the nation, will expand the annual production capability of its Mexican plant, GSMX, from the current 700,000 color TV sets to 1 million by investing $10 million, a company official said. To meet the country of origin regulations of the NAFTA countries, the electronics arm of the Lucky-Goldstar Business Group is groping for ways to enter the region along with two electronic parts makers, he said. In a bid to expand its sales of electronic goods in the U.S. market, Goldstar has been restructuring its locally incorporated sales company, Goldstar Electronics International Inc., since 1991, the official said. "Through the revamped sales network, we expect our exports to the big U.S. market to rise continually. After-sale services on Goldstar-made products also will be strengthened across the United States," he said. The company also is planning to set up a $100-million joint-venture factory to churn out TV cathode-ray tubes in Mexico with Samsung Electron Devices Co. and Orion Electronics Co., business sources said. TV cathode-ray tubes to be produced by the proposed Mexican plant could be used in color TVs produced by Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar Co. and Daewoo Electronics Co., all of which hope to expand their market share in the United States, they said. Samsung Electronics Co., the electronics arm of the Samsung Business Group, is expanding the annual production capability of its Mexican plant, SAMEX, from the current 1 million color TV sets to 1.2 million, a company spokesman said. To satisfy the local regulations for country of origin, the company has helped its Korean parts makers set up their own plants in Mexico, and the partners are now supplying SAMEX with main TV parts, he said. Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. is studying a plan to establish a wholly owned plant to produce TV tuners and speakers in Tihuanisi, Mexico, which is close to the border with the United States, at a cost of $40 million, a company official said. Korean automakers have been reluctant to set up locally incorporated plants in North America as the tariffs which the United States levies on imported autos are still low, business officials said. Recently, however, large Korean automakers including Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo have begun considering establishing production plants in the North American region now that NAFTA has taken effect, they said. According to the officials, such proposed, locally incorporated auto plants will also help the automakers expand their exports to South American nations, which are growing rapidly following radical economic reforms. Particularly, Hyundai Motor Co., the auto arm of the Hyundai Group, has already begun expanding its Canadian plant so that it can churn out 100,000 subcompact car Elantras annually from 1995, a company official said.
