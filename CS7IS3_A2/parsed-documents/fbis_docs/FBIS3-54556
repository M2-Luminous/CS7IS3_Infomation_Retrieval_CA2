Thus, for example, Itamar Rabinovich and Muwaffaq al-'Allaf briefly touched on the issue of principles of security on the Golan Heights. Rabinovich suggested that the two men discuss the issue as though an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights had already been decided upon. The Syrian negotiator did not rule out the proposal but has so far refused to hold an open and detailed debate on the issue. Meanwhile, the talks on the Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian tracks are being conducted between the heads of the delegations. It remains unclear whether the expanded delegations will meet next week. In the meantime, not only King Husayn but also Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim, the Qatari foreign minister, took some brave steps toward reconciliation with Israel. He admitted tonight that Qatar was holding trade negotiations with Israel on a large gas deal; however, the foreign minister clearly explained to us this evening that a signed agreement was still a long way off. [Begin Bin-Jasim recording, in English] When we see some advance in the negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, we will take our own action with the second and the third boycott. And about the first boycott, it will have to be taken through the Arab league. [end recording] The minister promised that the Israelis arriving in Qatar for the multilateral talks in April would receive a warm welcome. [Begin Bin-Jasim recording, in English] And I think our people will accept our move and they will even defend the case by themselves. [end recording] The heads of the Syrian and Israeli delegations have also agreed about the definition of the proposed demilitarization of the Golan Heights. This will be a balanced demilitarization that will not obligate Israel to demilitarize large areas of the Galilee in exchange for the demilitarization of the Golan Heights.
