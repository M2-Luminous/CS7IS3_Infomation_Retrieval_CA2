ACTION: Rules of conduct and final supplementary rules for certain public lands known as Ash Springs located in the unincorporated town of Ash Springs along U.S. Highway 93, Las Vegas District, Lincoln County, Nevada. SUMMARY: The rules of conduct and supplementary rules are necessary for the management of activities on public land at Ash Springs, Lincoln County, Nevada. These rules of conduct and supplementary rules would be limited to activities occurring within the following area, hereafter referred to as Ash Springs: Mount Diablo Meridian, Nevada T. 6 S., R. 61 E., Sec. 6 NW1/4NW1/4. DATES: These supplementary rules will become effective on May 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Bureau of Land Management, Caliente Resource Area, P.O. Box 237, Caliente, NV 89008. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kyle Teel, Wildlife Biologist; Telephone number: (702) 726&hyph;8100. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Ash Springs contains the White River Springfish ( Crenichthys baileyi baileyi ) a Federal listed endangered species. A Coordinated Resource Management Plan was developed for the area; one of the planned actions was to establish rules to restrict certain activities to protect the fish species. The proposed supplementary rules were published in the Federal Register on Friday, October 15, 1993 on page 53557. One comment was received from the Nevada Division of Wildlife (NDOW) during the 30 day comment period ending on November 15, 1993. The NDOW expressed concerns that the 2 hour limit was too restrictive and that they would not be able to carry out their necessary duties at Ash Springs within this time limit. They also expressed confusion on the way proposed rule I(E) was written. Authority for these supplementary rules is contained in CFR title 43, chapter II, part 8360, subpart 8365.1&hyph;6. Authority for other rules that could apply are contained in CFR title 43, chapter II, part 8360, subparts 8365.1&hyph;1, 8365.1&hyph;2, 8365.1&hyph;3, 8365.1&hyph;4, 8365.1&hyph;5, 8365.1&hyph;7, 8365.2&hyph;1, 8365.2&hyph;2, 8365.2&hyph;3, 8365.2&hyph;4, 8365.2&hyph;5. The following are the final supplementary rules for Ash Springs: 1. The following actions are prohibited, within Ash Springs: a. Overnight Camping. Camping means the erecting of a tent or shelter of natural or synthetic material, preparing a sleeping bag or other bedding material for use, or parking of a motor vehicle, motor home or trailer for the apparent purpose of overnight occupancy. b. Occupancy or use of Ash Springs by any individual, or any group, is limited to 2 hours during any 24 hour period.

L. 94&hyph;579) as amended at 18 U.S.C. 3571(b)(s). Dated: May 10, 1994. Ronald B. Wenker, Acting State Director, Nevada.
