NP media spokesman Danie du Plessis said the laws that applied to other political parties should also apply to the ANC. Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe's statement that Mr Mandela had offered to hand over weapons found at the ANC's Shell House headquarters once more highlighted that the ANC had become "a law unto themselves", he said. "This incident follows others such as the ANC's treasury department asking the Reserve Bank for finrand access so it could use funds held abroad to buy a Pretoria building. It also asked for import duties to be waived on election materials such as electronic equipment, land rovers and t-shirts," Mr du Plessis said. "If the ANC has nothing to hide, why did Mr Mandela interfere to prevent the police from searching Shell House?" the NP statement said. ANC officials are investigating Gen van der Merwe's claims that Mr Mandela offered to hand over weapons. Enquiries since early Thursday on the statement had still not been answered by the ANC by Thursday afternoon.
