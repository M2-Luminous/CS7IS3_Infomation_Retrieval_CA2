That is the forecast of a group of Novosibirsk scientists. The migration is caused primarily by the reduction in the demand for manpower in connection with the reduction in oil and gas extraction and a marked reduction in capital investments in the extracting sectors. Among those leaving the North a considerable proportion are citizens of nearby foreign parts returning home. The intensive departure of highly qualified specialists and young people has been noted. The migration of the population from northern regions also has positive consequences. People's departure is lowering the level of unemployment and reducing the load on the socioconsumer infrastructure. But scientists note that spontaneous migration will not radically resolve the question of the overpopulation of North Siberia. A considered state policy is needed in this process.
