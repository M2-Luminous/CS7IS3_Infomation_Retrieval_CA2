The 1994 White Paper reports on the achievements of the armed forces and the Department, as well as building on the theme of previous post-Cold War Statements -- the evolution of Britain's defence policy, and the restructuring of its armed forces in response to the changing strategic setting. Mr. Rifkind points out that the restructuring programme under Options for Change, which is now nearing completion, "has not altered the fact that our armed forces remain world class." He added that "we continue our efforts to ensure the greatest military output for the money we devote to defence." The White Paper also emphasises that it is the Government's firm intention, against the background of the Defence Costs Study ("Front Line First"), to maintain Britain's front line capabilities.
