"I am not on bad terms with Mr. Clinton," a Foreign Ministry official quoted Hosokawa as saying in an interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES, which will be published in the spring issue of THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE. "On the contrary, we are getting closer and closer," the prime minister reportedly said. "I really feel that way when I talk with Mr. Clinton." The United States has been turning up the heat on Japan after Hosokawa and Clinton failed to strike a deal in a February summit in Washington on the penetration of more foreign goods into Japanese markets. Hosokawa told the U.S. newspaper that the restructuring of the economy will be the top priority for the nation, the official said in a briefing to reporters. Hosokawa, asked to comment on whether Japan is really changing, reportedly said the nation's political and cultural structures have yet to be mature enough but that signs of change are surely emerging.
