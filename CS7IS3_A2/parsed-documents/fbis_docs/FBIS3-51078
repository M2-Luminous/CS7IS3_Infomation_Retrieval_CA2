I would like to make a few remarks that could serve as a backdrop to the discussion about the reorganization of the FSLN now that it has approved by consensus the constitutional reforms for holding talks with UNO [National Opposition Union] and the government. First of all, we must have a clear idea of the kind of Sandinism that we want to organize. Sandinism is a broad political front based on a revolutionary identity inherited from our Heroes and Martyrs. We are patriots by calling and we identify with the people because we are for social justice and equitable national development that benefits all sectors. We often hear people say: "I am a Sandinist but I do not agree with this or that form of political action" or "I would like to be involved this way." Sandinism is a party to which people from all segments of society belong or with which they identify, but this does not mean that there does not exist a strong detachment of proven, reliable leaders. Second, besides having a wide range of members, the FSLN uses methods of action that represent national, institutional, local, sectorial, economic, trade-union, labor-union, humanitarian, etc., interests. A Vehicle for Leadership In each one of these struggles there are Sandinists who from the rank and file lend it a combative, democratic, grass-roots character. A reorganization must take into account this fact. The FSLN has to be reorganized in a versatile manner. The FSLN's devotion to the people and its potential for governing oblige us to maintain smooth communications with sectors that in keeping with our philosophy represent our natural social base but that for various reasons have drifted away from Sandinism: peasants from the highlands, ethnic groups, young people, merchants, housewives, etc. The reorganization of leadership, intermediate, and rank-and-file structures must take into account the various manifestations of Sandinism, and we must clearly realize that these structures are vehicles for facilitating the exercise of leadership and achieving the objectives of the various struggles. We must bring about a revolution in opportunities for all Sandinists and for the people in general, by expanding them for those who already have them and by creating them for those who do not (the unemployed, the illiterate, discrimination victims, etc.). National structures and local or sectorial leaders must further Sandinist influence without blocking the ideas of the rank and file, by combining individual initiative and creativity with democratic consensus. I lean towards a coordinating structure that does not centralize decision-making, that combines experience with youth; towards a social movement with comprehensive political leadership and equality between men and women; one that moderates rather than coerces; one that is more representative of the social sectors than of nonfunctional structures; one that promotes debate and organizes compliance with resolutions. Among the rank and file we would set up regional, sectorial, interest-group, or trade-union Sandinist assemblies with executive committees. The plenum of such Sandinist assemblies would be organized openly and broadly to serve as a conduit for party life and would listen to individual and group opinions and eventually forge a single collective thought. The rank-and-file Sandinist assembly would meet at least twice a year to make decisions. As for daily political work, action would be taken by economic unit, trade union, social sector, project, commission, symposium, or any other form of organization. Scope and Rank-and-File Debate The primary goal is to bring the people together to defend their interests, to promote the comprehensive development of society and the country, and to seek power in order to achieve our political objectives. A prerequisite for a successful reorganization of the FSLN is to abolish the difference between activist [militante] and member [afiliado]. Under the current conditions of thorough FSLN democratization there ought to be equal opportunities, duties, and rights for all who are part of the Sandinist party organization. Even before the 1996 election campaign I would like to support the idea of establishing minimum channels for partisan political communication among Sandinists in electoral precincts. Ultimately, it is at the ballot box that the party demonstrates the organizational, political, and ideological strength and depth that it possesses to implement its program for the people. The FSLN must embody most of the interests and just struggles of the people. This mean supporting and making room for the emerging sectors of society, especially the ones that wave patriotic, revolutionary, and grass-roots banners. This open debate must be carried to all Sandinists without party membership cards as a first step towards reincorporating them, reorganizing ourselves, and heading down the road to electoral victory with an FSLN that is united amid its well known diversity.
