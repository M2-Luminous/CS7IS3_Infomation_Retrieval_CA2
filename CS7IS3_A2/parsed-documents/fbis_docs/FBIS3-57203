Following is the Ukrainian president's reply to a question of major concern for the entire Ukrainian society -- What are the relations between the president and the Ukrainian Supreme Council in the wake of the tripartite agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament signed in Moscow? [Begin Kravchuk recording] We have satisfied parliament's reservations. This is a very important fact that could no longer be undone. The executive branch was proceeding down the path of implementation and not of obstruction of the parliament's decisions. Yes, we made some compromises and concessions. But how else could you handle this? All of us -- Russia, the United States, and Ukraine -- compromised. That's how it is in politics. Generally speaking, I did expect to meet with the opposition.

[word indistinct] Sold out national interests! However, none of them read the document. I know there always are people like this. But you have to be very careful if you want to be a serious politician, and be a part of big politics. I want them to know that first, politicians draw conclusions only after they have read a document; second, they always reckon with the overall situation, possibilities, and [word indistinct] of Ukraine. Let me tell you the following -- those who propose or call for not bringing nuclear weapons out of the country for Ukraine to become a nuclear country [words indistinct] They want to make Ukraine a hostage and sentence its people to death. Everyone must realize that. And no requests or slogans can change anything, because Ukrainian television has recently shown ministers, [word indistinct], scientists, and other people. They revealed facts proving that Ukraine had made the only possible correct step. [words indistinct] we have to do, we will do without losing our power and [words indistinct] But this [words indistinct] overcome [words indistinct] This might be [word indistinct] wish. (?These are the first steps) Those who so strongly voice their demand that Ukraine remain a nuclear state and keep its nuclear weapons -- whether they want to or not -- turn Ukraine into a hostage, with its people sentenced to death.
