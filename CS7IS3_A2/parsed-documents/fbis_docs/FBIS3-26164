Edouard Balladur will visit Beijing on the first or last week of March, but this visit will be mostly symbolic: The diplomatic and commercial impact of normalized relations between France and China will be gradual. After a quasi-divorce, the reconciliation cannot bring as many benefits as did the "wedding" decided 30 years ago by General de Gaulle and Mao Zedong. Although delighted with his hosts' "quite warm" attitude and "good will," Alain Peyrefitte ended his three-day preliminary mission on a note of caution: "We must be aware that improvements will be gradual." This comment relates to the trade expectations of French manufacturers, who suffered from Beijing's retaliatory policy following the sale of 60 Mirage fighter aircraft to Beijing's rival, nationalist Taiwan. However, improvements -- both commercial and political -- will clearly happen under close supervision from China's rulers only. Of course, both parties seemed to enjoy repeating that "clouds have been dispelled." However, says Mr. Peyrefitte, "one cannot say that the 12 January communique -- which announced a return to normal relations -- settled everything." It is up to the prime minister to "capitalize on that." A Little Help This comment from the former Gaullist minister has probably internal implications as well: Mr. Balladur's trip will be the first French state visit to China since Mr. Mitterrand's, 11 years ago. Things should not happen in Beijing as they did in Riyadh. While it cannot yield as many contracts as Chancellor Helmut Kohl brought back from Beijing in November, Mr. Balladur's visit must not lack panache, as befits a statesman and potential president of the republic. Admiral Philippe de Gaulle -- the General's son and a member of Alain Peyrefitte's team in Beijing -- did not forget to mention in front of Vice Prime Minister Qian Qichen that Mr. Balladur is a "loyal proponent of Gaullist policies." Both invoking the historical credit of the Fifth Republic founder [Charles de Gaulle] -- the first leader of a large Western power to open an embassy in Communist China in 1964 -- and speaking of France's high-technology achievements, Alain Peyrefitte told Prime Minister Li Peng of potential cooperation in fields such as energy, transport, and telecommunications. He also pleaded for French cereal producers: Chinese resentment stemming from the sale of Dassault aircraft to Taiwan did not just lead to a freeze in large industrial contracts; it also resulted in China terminating its regular purchases of French wheat. In retaliation, after having uttered its indignation about the sale of 150 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan, Beijing had actually increased its imports of American wheat. On the Chinese side, the message is twofold. While Alain Peyrefitte insisted that "a new spirit of friendship has been established," a Beijing-based observer of French interests said that "things will not go smoothly; we do not intend to fall prey to such delusions any more." In the meantime, Li Peng said he was "very happy" with the Franco-Chinese detente. His own intervention was reportedly the decisive factor in the difficult negotiation secretly conducted during the Christmas season by UAP [insurance company] president Jacques Friedman on behalf of France's prime minister. These talks made it possible for the "page to be turned." Chinese authorities gave up their demand that the Mirage contract be canceled, while Paris undertook to forbid French firms to "contribute to Taiwan's armament," although it did not forbid to "sell weapons" to the island, provided such weapons are of a defensive nature. The compromise was guaranteed by an exchange of secret letters between the two countries' Foreign Ministries. The "little help" from China's head of government -- who was openly francophile until Western nations ostracized him following the 4 June 1989 massacre -- is not solely due to the fact that he would relish being invited to Paris -- and, five years after Tiananmen, saluting Francois Mitterrand, who had said at the time that a regime which guns down its own young people "does not have a future." Chinese sources explain that Beijing agreed to a compromise with Paris and is likewise seeking an agreement with Washington in order to reestablish a political dialogue with the West. This has already been done with Germany, the whole strategy's alleged motive being to "isolate" Great Britain, guilty of trying to democratize Hong Kong's parliamentary system. Thus Beijing admits it needs to maintain ties with Western countries. Even if that means painting the confession with jingoistic colors. Said the headline of a large Shangai newspaper -- the WEN HUI BAO -- last week: "Western Arrogance Toward China Turns Into Deference."
