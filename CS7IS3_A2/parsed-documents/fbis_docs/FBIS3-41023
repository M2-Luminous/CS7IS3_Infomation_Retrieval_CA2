Deputy Andrejs Pantelejevs today told a news conference that the aim of the visit was to discuss the issues of Latvian national security. The delegation was also received by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. It became clear during the talks that the United States of America viewed the withdrawal of the Russian Army not only as Latvia's internal issue, but rather as a problem of all-European and American security systems. One of the most complicated issues is the fate of the Skrunda radar station. Russia has expressed the wish to use it for another four years and after that, it will scrap it within 18 months. In that case, Russia would withdraw all the troops from Latvia by 31 August this year. That is the best option which Latvia would have to accept, said Deputy Jevgenijs Zoscerinskis. Such a compromise would satisfy all the European countries. Deputy Maris Grinblats for his part assessed the results of the visit very briefly -- they tried to persuade us that the world would be glad if we give in on this issue.
