We believe that all members of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, have similar obligations in the nuclear issue. We are always persistent in our belief that the solution for this complicated issue can only be reached through resolute and serious negotiations between the parties concerned on the basis of equality and respect to each other's independence and sovereignty and to international laws. All actions at variance with that direction will only worsen the already complicated situation, and will harm the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation for the Pacific region which all countries in the region are striving to maintain.
