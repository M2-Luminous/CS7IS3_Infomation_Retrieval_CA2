Should that remedy fail, the party will support what is on offer. Far from vacillating on the reform proposals, the party has arrived at its definitive decision through consultation as its members require of their leaders and as it is consistent with our political creed. To reiterate for emphasis, let me say, the Party is seeking to separate the bill's provisions so that any reference to a one seat, one vote arrangement is confined to all the elected assemblies, other than the Legislative Council. This seems to be the only hope of keeping the doors to British and Chinese negotiations ajar. Our members support lowering the voting age to 18 and allowing National People's Congress delegates to contest local elections. Most of us have no quibbles with any specific point in the partial bill which is supposed to cover the least contentious aspects of the reform proposals as introduced by the Governor in October 1992. What we oppose is any attempt to divide the community, the sabotage of British and Chinese cooperation, and turning our backs on 10 years of confidence-building in Hong Kong. I am not crying wolf when I say there are groups and individuals in our midst who are agitating for confusion in Hong Kong and for a showdown between Britain and China. What the Liberal Party and its friends must guard against is any attempt to undermine Hong Kong and its institutions. Any reform must help our community through to 1997 and beyond rather than be an excuse for someone to usurp power, incite trouble, and another to claim dubious glory. The changes also, must serve a better end than the rewriting of electoral rules to spite the future sovereign. Many have praised the architect of the reforms for his sincerity (just as many have done the opposite). But the world, as most of us can see, is strewn with the rubble of noble intentions. Over the past year, since the reform proposals were introduced, I have seen with dismay deliberate distortions of words and meanings in a raging propaganda war in Hong Kong. A Democrat nowadays urges the Governor to exercise his autocratic powers by disbanding the legislature if it voted against the reforms. Another equal rights advocate demands that retired civil servants be banned from private employment. A self-professed defender of Hong Kong interests is out and about worsening the dispute between Britain and China that will cost--and is costing-- Hong Kong. Tactics are now confused with principles which are these days treated as a commodity. I know many in our society are not apathetic but are wary of politicians seen by them to be too suave and conniving. They have reason for their suspicion for, whenever they analyse the slogans and study the gestures, they find these statements empty and the baby-kissing routine boring. The public cannot be fooled all the time. The Liberal Party could be posturing too and taking radical positions which always attract an audience. Pleading for talks, reconciliation and reason is never as easy to stumping for the opposite. When weighing the merits of issues on logic, the politician has to become a statistician, an administrator, a doer and not an actor. The price of prudence is reservation. How much simpler it would be to react on impulse, to be fanatical, self-righteous and be ready to blame someone else for failures. Doing so, however, would for me be an abdication of responsibility. We must act carefully because the consequences of mistakes are so serious. Now that the reforms have been thrust upon Hong Kong, the public has to treat the subject with calmness and a measure of skepticism. The passion the community feels and the Liberal Party shares is for a better Hong Kong where the people can live in safety, stability and harmony with the future sovereign. I find it deeply ironic that 10 years ago, we of Hong Kong were told by Britain to trust and work with the mainland Chinese--when we had few reasons to do so. Now, with so much contact, business in both directions, and travel also in both directions, we are suddenly asked by Whitehall and the Governor to resist and suspect people north of the Shenzhen River. How is that for confusion, cynicism or callousness?
