FBIS4-33469 "drlat109_q_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Paraguay Congressional Committee To Investigate Oviedo Congressional Committee To Investigate Oviedo PY0606233894 Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 2 PY0606233894 Asuncion ULTIMA HORA Spanish BFN [Text] On 6 June most of the members of the Congressional Investigating Committee on Illegal Activities (CBII) agreed to begin an in-depth investigation of the many reports of Army Commander General Lino Oviedo's involvement in political-partisan activities. By the time this afternoon daily went to press, the CBII was getting ready to formally discuss the issue. The request for the CBII to step in came from Deputies Sergio Lopez of the PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal Party] and Walter Bower of the Colorado Party Reconciliation Movement. The report that the two deputies prepared on the repeated charges against Gen. Oviedo will be submitted at today's session of the CBII. Should it be duly proven that the Army commander has violated the Constitution, the CBII will submit its findings to the courts so that Gen. Oviedo can be tried, and will also ask the national executive branch to remove and retire the general, according to National Encounter Deputy Luis Alberto Mauro. The CBII is controlled by the opposition, which has been constantly criticizing Gen. Oviedo's activities, and by the Colorado Party, which is now bitterly complaining about the role Oviedo is playing in the party's internal power struggle. Committee members Basilio Nikiporoff, Armando Espinola, Fernando Pfannl, Hermes Rafael Saguier, and Luis Alberto Mauro belong to the opposition; Carlos Romero Pereira and Walter Bower belong to the Argana faction of the Colorado Party; and Luis Becker, who recently called Oviedo "little Stroessner," and "gangsters' protector," belongs to the pro-government faction of the Colorado Party. Bearing this background in mind, it is certain that the majority of the CBII members will be in favor of investigating Gen. Oviedo. The only pro-government legislator who could oppose this decision would be Senator Emilio Cubas Grau. Deputy Mauro stated that when last year CBII members accused Oviedo of meddling in politics "we were criticized and told that our attitude was antimilitary. It appears, however, that many members of the various Colorado Party factions now share our position." He concluded: "This proves that our criticisms are objective, and not prompted by antimilitary feelings."
