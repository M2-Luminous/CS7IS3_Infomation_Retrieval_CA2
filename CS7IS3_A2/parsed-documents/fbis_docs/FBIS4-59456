The first regiment was made up of 20 police; the rest will follow. From King Husayn bridge, our correspondent Yusuf Faraj reports: [Begin recording] [Faraj] At 1300 today, a 20-man advance party of the Palestinian National Security Forces crossed King Husayn Bridge to Jericho on Palestinian territory, following a five-day wait at a point close to the bridge. The crossing followed talks between top Palestinian and Israeli negotiators. The regiment will take up position at points already agreed to by the sides. [Jamil Tarifi, head of the Palestinian side to the Liaison Committee with Israel] The first regiment will conduct joint patrols with the Israelis in the Jericho area. [Faraj] And the second regiment? [Tarifi] The second regiment is scheduled to travel straight to Gaza today to undertake security responsibilities in conjunction with forces that crossed via the Rafah border point. The forces due to cross tomorrow will handle security duties in Jericho. We are slated to take over all civilian duties in Jericho. [Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian Security Forces] God willing, tomorrow will see us in complete control over the southern region from the Gaza Valley in the north to Rafah in the south. Then we will have control over the northern part of Gaza, which, God willing, will be completed next Wednesday [18 May]. [Faraj] How do you feel on this occasion? [Yusuf] I am gripped by unusual feelings. The sight of our kinsfolk celebrating is unbelievable. It is a historic, unusual, special day. On this occasion, we thank our brothers here in Jordan for the training facilities they made available to us. We are particularly grateful to his majesty the king, who yesterday visited and inspected the units and extended further moral and material support. This country is ours and its people our kinsfolk. We have always been family, and we share a common future, God willing. [end recording]
