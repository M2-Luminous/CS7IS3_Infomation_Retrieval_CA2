He said: "If our policy goals are the same, it is natural for us to begin by first joining our hands to do that which is beneficial for Japan." Watanabe made his remarks in an appearance on a program broadcast by FNN TV Network the same day. He indicated he plans to continue seeking possible cooperation with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and other party members. Watanabe disclosed his views, saying: "Under a single-seat constituency system, there will eventually emerge two large political parties." He then pointed out: "I doubt whether the current coalition alliance would merge into a single party." He thus disclosed his expectation that those advocating similar policies will eventually form an alliance.
