For a multilateral dimension in foreign policy. In an interview with LE DEVOIR, new Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet surveys Canadian diplomacy and the important issues it will have to tackle. In the first of a series of two articles, he discusses peacekeeping issues and explains the cardinal pillars of Canadian foreign policy. It was Canada that invented and introduced to the United Nations the concept of "peacekeeping," an accomplishment which earned Lester B. Pearson a Nobel Prize. But today, Canada has misgivings about following the UN's lead into the field of peace enforcement and deployment of blue helmets into war-torn countries. The brief detention of 11 Canadian soldiers by Serb militiamen in Bosnia just before Christmas prompted Ottawa to express its misgivings publicly. In a recent interview with LE DEVOIR, the newly installed minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Andre Ouellet, shared his thoughts on the subject. "Traditionally, the United Nations was invited to send peacekeeping contingents into regions where the opposing sides had decided to make peace.... In the last 18 to 24 months, the United Nations has been led to involve itself in conflicts (without) the approval of local authorities. This is a completely new dimension, and Canada must ask itself whether it has the means to intervene militarily in countries where there are active conflicts." Peacekeeping (on the "Cyprus" model) versus imposition of peace (as in Bosnia): This is not the only tough question with which Canadian diplomacy is wrestling. There is also debate over the size of contingents deployed. Mr. Ouellet assures us that Canada still has the intent and the means to participate in traditional peacekeeping missions that do not demand excessively large numbers of troops. "But 2,400-man military missions in the former Yugoslavia, where maybe there is some hope for peace but not much of an ongoing peace process: That's very expensive. I am not saying no; I am not saying we should reject the concept of humanitarian intervention. But we must be cautious along that path. And we're going to have to delimit Canadian interventions very precisely." Mr. Ouellet notes there are some situations where "one can play an important role with as few as 15 people--technicians, experts--facilitating deployment of an effective peace force." For all that, Canada is not turning its back on the UN. To the contrary, it plans to be "very much present and very active" in the international organization. "But these are general concepts. The way these concepts are applied needs to be reassessed," the minister says. Amid all the excitement that surrounded the unveiling of a new government, one small detail might have escaped even the most attentive observers: Canada's diplomatic establishment is now called the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, having abandoned the old "External Affairs" tag inherited from its link to the British Crown. A simple name change, it ought to have been made when Canada first assumed full sovereignty in the conduct of its international relations. "It's just a way of catching up with reality," says the new chief of Canadian diplomacy. Catching up with reality, elaborating a policy that conforms better to the new international situation and to domestic imperatives: This is a priority objective for Minister Ouellet, who announced his intention of organizing a forum next March to discuss Canadian foreign policy and defense issues. More than ever, a mood of reevaluation is in the air. "We think it necessary, in the new world context, to have a broad public debate on all these questions," said Mr. Ouellet. "We want an open, Canadian-style debate, instead of the old decisionmaking system based on telephone calls between Ottawa and Washington." As an opposition party, the Liberals had criticized the Conservatives for having clipped the wings of Canadian diplomacy and made it subservient to the United States, narrowed its focus to the American continent, and relied excessively on Brian Mulroney's special ties with the then-tenant of the White House. Now in power, the Liberals are reaffirming their intention to restore the multilateral dimension to Canadian foreign policy. "We will not be continentalists. We want to concentrate our efforts and initiatives on the three pillars of Canadian diplomacy: our relations with the United States, of course, but really with all the Americas; our transatlantic relations with an enlarged Europe now building closer ties to the countries of East Europe; and our Asian and Pacific relations, which have stayed on the back burner for too long." In the framework of this "three-dimensional" diplomacy, Canada places great importance on expanding its relations with the countries of the former Warsaw Pact. In face of insistent demands by some of those countries--Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic--for entry into the Atlantic Alliance, Canada opposes undue haste and favors requiring them first to meet the democratic standards upheld by NATO member countries. When it comes to the perceived stiffening of Russian foreign policy in the wake of the ultranationalists' electoral breakthrough--"a protest vote," according to Mr. Ouellet--the minister aligns himself with those who believe in standing up to Moscow. Many European chancelleries reject any thought of opposing the Russians; they believe that if Moscow "vetoes" the entry of Poland or Hungary into NATO, its wishes must be honored. Minister Ouellet is not of that persuasion. He describes himself as concerned to avoid giving the impression of yielding to Moscow's opposition. "The Russians are pressing their objections very energetically, but if we do nothing, we risk seeing the old hegemonies reestablished. We must take care not to re-create, by default, a situation which in years past we deplored and considered regrettable. Inaction on the part of the Western countries only encourages Russia to reaffirm and reimpose its hegemony over its neighbors." On the delicate issue of Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic which several European countries recognized this month even though the United States continues to follow a "wait-and-see" policy, Mr. Ouellet laconically observes that the question is "being studied." [4 Jan pp A1, A14] [Text] In this second and final installment of his interview with LE DEVOIR on the future of Canada's foreign policy, Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet shares his thoughts on the political crisis in Haiti -- a country where Canada plays an important role -- and the steps that should be taken to resolve it. Convinced that the Haitian military leaders who overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will not voluntarily let go their grip on power, Ottawa proposes tightening the screws to force their hand. "At this time, the military leaders are not prepared to cooperate in resolving the crisis," said Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet in an interview with LE DEVOIR. "They are deliberately stalling for time because they know time is on their side. Thus, concrete new initiatives are required. If we remain passive, we won't succeed." Minister Ouellet admits the Haitian crisis is not moving rapidly toward resolution--indeed, it seems to be worsening. He says Washington is partly responsible for this state of affairs. Taking the Americans sharply to task, Mr. Ouellet opines that their confused and contradictory policies have strengthened the military's position. "The fact that statements coming out of the State Department were being contradicted by the Pentagon may have contributed to strengthening the (Haitian military's) conviction the Americans would not intervene." In December 1990, Canada welcomed the accession to power of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti's first democratically elected president. Since the 30 September 1991 military coup that forced Aristide into exile, Canada has played an important part in efforts by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations to mobilize support for President Aristide and his restoration through diplomatic means. Although Minister Ouellet considers a military solution totally out of the question and relies rather on sanctions to achieve the objective, he maintains that Canada bears a special responsibility toward Haiti "because it is very close to us, because many Haitian nationals live in Canada, because Quebec religious figures have been working in Haiti for many years, because there are deep-rooted ties." After two years with no apparent progress, the foreign minister suggests it is time for Canada to abandon its passive stance and "lean on the Americans." "They need to start speaking with one voice. Because the State Department says one thing, then the military and the CIA say something else. After that, they need to be persuaded to act." High on the list of concrete steps recommended by Mr. Ouellet is the formation of a Haitian police force. Canada suggests a good beginning would be to provide training for police officers "who could become a counterweight to the military." "As long as the military exercise complete hegemony over the country, they're going to impose their own rule," says Mr. Ouellet. "The balance of power needs to be changed." The Governor's Island Pact signed last July by President Aristide and General Cedras, commander in chief of Haiti's Armed Forces, called for measures to be implemented last fall to separate the police from the Army. So far, the Haitian military have blocked this reform. Minister Ouellet proposes to move ahead now on training of Haitian policemen--in Canada, if it cannot be done in Haiti. The core of the police force could be constituted by the presidential guard that provides protection for President Aristide in Washington. All of its neighbors have taken up the call for democracy in Haiti, but not to the point of strictly enforcing the UN sanctions against the Haitian military. One of the weakest links in the pro-Aristide coalition is the Dominican Republic whose land border with Haiti on the Isle of Hispaniola is used to circumvent the oil embargo. Mr. Ouellet thinks that if sanctions against Haiti are to have any chance of success, the Dominican Republic must be induced to enforce them to the letter. "We need for everyone to stand united and severely tighten the screws on the Haitian military. We would also like to persuade the Dominican Republic to take an active part in these efforts." Referring to Canada, France, the United States, and Venezuela--the countries that compose the group known as the "Four Friends of the UN Secretary General on Haiti" and serve as advisers on the Haitian situation--Mr. Ouellet thinks the Dominican Republic should be persuaded to join the "Four Friends" group.
