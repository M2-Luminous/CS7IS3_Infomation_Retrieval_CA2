This was disclosed by a Foreign Ministry source. Giving a reason for this decision, the source noted the "Tokyo Declaration" issued by Japan and Russia last October confirms the validity of the 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration, which clearly states the return of two of the northern islands to Japan. The source said: "Basically, this is an issue that should be discussed bilaterally from now on." The government also appears to be thinking that separating the territorial issue from the Russian aid question would be more helpful in gaining understanding of the international community [on its policy over Russia]. Words of support for a "settlement" of the northern territories issue have been included in political declarations and chairmen's statements three times since the Houston summit (in the United States) in 1990. But at the Tokyo summit held last year, direct reference to the dispute was avoided on the ground that "this was already a known fact among G-7 (seven industrialized) nations." Instead, a political statement issued by the summit expressed hope that Russia will "promote diplomacy based on the principle of law and justice." The issue of how to handle the matter was raised again this time because Russia is now expected to take part in political discussions in the Naples summit. However, the government apparently has arrived at the decision because "the course of negotiations has already been set" (according to the source) by the Tokyo Declaration issued when Russian President Boris Yeltisn visited Japan last fall. The government is also aware that the summit-participating nations want to keep declarations and statements issued simple this time, and appears to be giving consideration to Russia, which is expected to join political discussions at the summit.
