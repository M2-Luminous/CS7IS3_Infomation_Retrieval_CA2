FR940405-1-00101 FR940405-1-00013 OSHA's estimates are based upon the exposure profile (presented in Table VI&hyph;3) and OSHA's quantitative risk assessment (discussed in detail in the preamble to the proposal). The OSHA estimates of lifetime risk of death attributable to exposure to ETS in the workplace range between 0.4 and 1 for lung cancer and between 7 and 16 for coronary heart disease, per 1,000 exposed employees. OSHA's estimate of the attributable risks suggest that all baseline cases of lung cancer and coronary heart disease will be prevented due to elimination of exposure of nonsmokers to ETS in the workplace. Table VI&hyph;6 presents estimates of the incidence of work-related cases avoided of lung cancer and heart disease following either the banning of smoking in the workplace or limiting smoking to designated smoking areas. OSHA estimates that approximately between 5,583 and 32,502 cancer deaths and 97,700 to 577,818 coronary heart disease deaths related to occupational exposure to ETS will be prevented over the next 45 years. This represents 140 to 722 cancer deaths per year and 2,094 to 13,001 heart disease deaths per year. 3. Costs Savings OSHA has also preliminarily determined that the estimated number of deaths or illnesses prevented understates the actual benefits that would occur under the proposed standard. Significant additional economic benefits, apart from the lives saved and illnesses averted, are anticipated most of which can not be quantified at this time.
