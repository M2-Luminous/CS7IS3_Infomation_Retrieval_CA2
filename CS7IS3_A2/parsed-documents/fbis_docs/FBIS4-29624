This roundtable commission's meeting was a continuation of the roundtable meeting held at the Chhanghsu-on royal residence on 27 and 28 May 1994 in line with the fourth provision of the joint communique issued by this roundtable meeting which proceeded under the august chairmanship of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the venerated king of the Cambodian nation. The presence of the KOC delegation at this latest meeting was further irrefutable proof to show that the National Assembly and the Royal Government, the legal institutions born out of the elections and the constitution, had the goodwill and most unshakable determination to find a peaceful solution to the remaining Cambodian problems with the aim of bringing peace for the people, because this peace constitutes the key factor for bringing about happiness and development in the nation in conformity with the august desire of the venerated king. During this discussion, we once again voiced our solemn support for the agenda of the meeting graciously set by His Majesty the king on 5 June 1994: namely, 1) an unconditional, immediate, and permanent cease-fire in all of the territory of the KOC; and 2) the minimal policy program, which was a proposal of the Khmer Rouge. The KOC delegation agreed to this cease-fire with a high sense of responsibility. At the same time, the delegation also proposed that the cease-fire should begin on 30 June 1994, at noon, or in the early morning of 30 June 1994. However, it was most regrettable that the august initiative raised by His Majesty the king in pleading for an unconditional, immediate, and permanent cease-fire in all of the territory of the KOC -- a most necessary and urgent requirement for the Cambodian nation and people -- was made conditional by the Khmer Rouge, who wanted to reject it once again despite the earnest pleas made by the samdech supreme patriarch and Samdech Mohakhousananda for them to accept this cease-fire. The Khmer Rouge continued to raise the same unreasonable and unrealistic arguments and demanded that the participants of the meeting divert their attention to discussing their proposal instead, which in reality was an excuse for the Khmer Rouge to carry on their "fighting while negotiating" strategy to prolong the war. As a matter of fact, besides refusing to agree to a cease-fire schedule, the Khmer Rouge also ambiguously talked about the composition of a cease-fire supervision commission, using it as a condition to set the cease-fire schedule, which is completely contrary to the august idea of His Majesty the king concerning an unconditional, immediate cease-fire. Moreover, the Khmer Rouge also raised the issue of a competent technical commission to supervise the cease-fire without by any means trying to specifically describe this commission. Through this meeting with the Khmer Rouge, it could be seen even more clearly that the Khmer Rouge have no desire whatsoever to find a solution for ending the remaining Cambodian problems through peaceful means. The impasse resulting from the categorical inflexibility of the Khmer Rouge caused the roundtable commission's meeting to conclude on 16 June 1994, at noon, without any specific and positive results that could be used as a basis for us to agree on for the holding of further meetings and talks with the Khmer Rouge. This will be in line with the idea of His Majesty the king, who had warned before the meeting that he would not initiate any more roundtable meetings. Phnom Penh, 17 June 1994
