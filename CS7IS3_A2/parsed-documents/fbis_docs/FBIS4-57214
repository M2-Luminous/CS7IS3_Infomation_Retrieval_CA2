It is a dead-end operation, the MIDH president asserted in our microphone: [Begin Bazin recording] The 11 May operation has no serious basis, neither on the constitutional level nor on the level of relations with other nations. Furthermore, the fact that it closes the door to dialogue inevitably complicates and delays the solution to the crisis. In regards to the embargo -- in other respects as reprehensible -- far from lightening the consequences, it is going to exacerbate getting supplies, the impossibility of export, increasing prices, the exchange rate of the gourde, unemployment, and, in a more general way, the living conditions of the huge majority of our compatriots whose survival in the current situation depends every day on a miracle and challenges all rationality. The 11 May operation is therefore a dead-end situation. MIDH rejects it. Today there is no longer time to cloud the issues by adding fuel to the flames. In these worrisome hours when we are openly threatened by foreign military intervention, the priority of priorities for every Haitian should be to do everything possible to spare the country new crises and tough humiliation. Therefore, each of us should agree to sacrifice part of our pride and our ambition and consent, in good faith, to a realistic compromise which reinforces the chance of democracy and safeguards our independence. The nation expects the effort of such a compromise. The nation is not resigned to the inevitable. It is, on the contrary, convinced that with a minimum of courage and a sense of responsibility nothing is impossible and that from now until 21 May, we would be spared an escalation toward absurdity and distress.
