In a statement here today, Dr. Najm described this step as one that "will not help stability in the region" and denounced what he called "the double standards adopted by the Security Council on Arab issues." The Iraqi delegate denied that Iraq had proposed to swap some Kuwaiti detainees with some Iraqi defendants detained in Kuwaiti prisons on charges of attempting to assassinate former U.S. President George Bush. He added that this is completely untrue because Iraq has no Kuwaiti detainees.
