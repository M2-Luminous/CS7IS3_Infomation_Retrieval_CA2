The decision not to involve the labor central in PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential campaign is not the only difference separating the new leadership from the aggressive political stance adopted by Jair Meneguelli for the past 11 years. Vicentinho has confirmed the opinion of political scientist Francisco Weffort of the PT, who "opposes corporatism." During an interview with JORNAL DO BRAZIL, the new CUT president, following the evolutionary line of the Brazilian labor movement, defended his independence from the state and the need to end the compulsory labor tax. The compulsory contribution is inherited from Getulio Vargas' New State interventionist policies. The labor policies implemented by Vargas were inspired by Mussolini's fascist Carta Del Lavoro and have influenced Brazilian labor legislation. Through the labor compulsory tax, his policies prompted the creation of both workers unions and managers unions. The subordination to and tutelage of the state was the greatest contradiction in a labor movement that is trying to be modern and at the vanguard of Brazilian workers' thinking. By suggesting that the CUT and affiliated unions should exist on the voluntary contribution of their members, Vicentinho introduced a risk component that must be extended to other workers' federations and managers' unions. The compulsory contributions of million of private workers, public servants, and public company employees, which today dominate the CUT, have been the main source of workers and managers unions' economic and political power. Thus, it was not strange to see acrid and even mortal disputes over these considerable funds. We must also note that the decision of the new labor leader follows a Progressive Renewal Party proposal to create a Congressional Investigating Committee to investigate CUT and PT relations and the origin of the resources of the labor central. By what authority does the PT condemn contributions by managers' unions and companies to political campaigns if the CUT maintains direct links with PT candidates? The new order within the CUT does not preclude investigations into past activities. The CUT is the most powerful of the four national labor federations. It embodies 2,235 urban unions and 741 rural unions, representing approximately 18 million workers and has an annual budget of $11 million. The labor movement needs to control its economic and political power and, particularly, to prepare for the possibility of no longer being in the opposition, but ready to become part of the ruling class. The end of compulsory contributions will not rid the Brazilian labor movement of fascist attitudes. It will also be necessary to end the practice of deciding on strikes in assemblies where only the most radical elements are represented. Vicentinho wants more democratic assemblies and condemns the practice of calling general strikes in public administrations without very good reason. He suggests alternatives such as strikes in key areas of a factory to stop the production process without forcing everyone to stop work. The Federal Supreme Court ruled that strikes will be illegal in public service companies until Congress regulates Article 37 of the Constitution permitting strikes by public servants. This and Vicente Paulo da Silva's presence at the head of the labor central that rules over state companies' workers unions should trigger changes in the labor movement. The new CUT president has already said Brazil must not look merely inside, adding that public workers must also realize that a wave of productivity and efficiency is sweeping the world today.
