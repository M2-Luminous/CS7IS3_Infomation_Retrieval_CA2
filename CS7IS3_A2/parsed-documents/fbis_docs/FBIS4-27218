FBIS4-27218 "dreas104_a_94051" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Three-Phase Optical Cabling Project Announced Three-Phase Optical Cabling Project Announced OW3105065794 Tokyo KYODO in English 0606 GMT 31 May 94 OW3105065794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A Japanese Government advisory panel on Tuesday [31 May] proposed a three-stage scheme to build a nationwide optical-fiber telecommunications network by 2010 as part of efforts to facilitate the shift to an information-oriented society in the next century. The scheme would create jobs for 2.43 million people by boosting Japan's multimedia market by 56 trillion yen to 123 trillion yen by the targeted year, said the Telecommunications Council, an advisory body to the posts minister. The council said the telecom project would help correct the over- centralization of information in Tokyo, quicken economic restructuring in Japan through the creation of new business and expand leisure time of the Japanese people as a result of an expected diffusion of "satellite" remote offices. The scheme is also designed for the efficient use of natural resources and energy, contributing to a solution of environmental issues, one of the biggest global problems toward the 21st century. In the recommendation presented to Posts and Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa, the council called for the laying of a core optical-cable network linking the prefectural capitals by 2000, in a first-phase project that would cover 20 percent of the nation's population. A second-stage network should be built by 2005 to connect cities with populations of over 100,000 for a population coverage of 60 percent, the council said. Nationwide hookup is set for the year of 2010 when Japan's population is expected to peak, it said. Apart from the three-stage scheme, an optical cable network to link major public organs, like schools, libraries, hospitals and welfare facilities, should be built by 2000, accompanied by the development of application software for use at such institutions, the council said. "Based on the council proposal, the posts ministry will push for various measures to implement the program, including further deregulation in telecom fields and an ample amount of budgetary allocation by the Finance Ministry, an official at the posts ministry told a press conference. Tuesday's proposal has been apparently prompted by "the information superhighway scheme" unveiled earlier by the United States. As under the U.S. scheme, the Japanese project is expected to provide a wide range of multimedia services in the next century, which the council says would make Japanese people's livelihood "dramatically more comfortable." As possible multimedia services under the scheme, the council cited remote medical checking, video-on-demand services, home shopping, electronic libraries, virtual reality leisure parks, interactive access to administrative information and remote education services. The proposed optical-fiber network is projected to cost 53 trillion yen when the single-star (SS) system, the most sophisticated optical cable networking method, is used at subscribing companies and households, the council said. The cost would be lower at 33 trillion yen if networking is done with a combination of the SS system and a less sophisticated system, a more practical approach in view of Japan's current technological level. The council said the private sector should play a key role in developing related application software. But government support is also necessary in the inititial stage of networking that focuses on infrastructure improvement. The task of laying the core part of the fiber cable network should be basically entrusted to either telecommunications companies like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) or cable television operators, the council said. The posts ministry official avoided stating a specific role by NTT in the fiber project, noting that further discussion needs to be conducted to decide who should take charge of the task. "To create a business environment that maximizes competition among various sectors would eventually serve the interest of general users," the council said. It said interest-free loans and tax incentives should be provided to entities participating in costly infrastructure improvement projects in the scheme. The optical-fiber network scheme is most likely to produce various social, legal and security problems that the Japanese people have rarely experienced in the past -- those uniquely inherent in the nature of multimedia services. Among them are an unintended violation of individual privacy and intellectual property rights. The legal framework should be upgraded to cope with these problems, the council said. The council also called for the standardization of telecom equipment and systems in accordance with international standards. The concept of "universal services" should be introduced for the new telecom scheme, in which services are equally offered across the nation at reasonable prices, the council said.
