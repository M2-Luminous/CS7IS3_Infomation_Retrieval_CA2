It has been hailed by many as a move that will be good for America, good for Vietnam, and good for the international community. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has described the U.S. position as good news, adding that it will help Vietnam grow and prosper. And indeed it will as inflow of foreign investments into Vietnam, especially by American businessmen, will become a key factor in restructuring and boosting the country's economy. The lifting of the embargo, imposed three decades ago, has been long overdue. In the United States, it has been a delicate issue because the Vietnam War had taken a heavy toll on the American servicemen's lives -- 61,000 in all -- and there are some 2,238 soldiers listed as missing or (?counted) as prisoners of war. The U.S. President has said that he has made the move to lift the embargo not for economics, but because he thought it was the best way to get the fullest possible accounting of those missing, referred to as MIA. Whatever the reasons, it is a wise, bold, and pragmatic move despite the fact that there may be many Americans who are opposed to the measure. But it is the first step toward normalization of relations between the two countries. It is good that Vietnam has plenty to gain from the lifting of the embargo. Even when embargo was in place, Vietnam achieved a 7.5-percent economic growth. Now with the embargo lifted, the country's economy is expected to grow by more than 10 percent this year.
