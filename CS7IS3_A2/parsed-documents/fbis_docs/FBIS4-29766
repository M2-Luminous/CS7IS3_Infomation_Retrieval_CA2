However, they absolutely support a North-South summit. The result of a telephone poll conducted by Media Research--a public opinion survey organization--among 1,000 men and women above the age of 20 throughout the country, except Cheju Island, showed that concerning the true intention of North Korean President Kim Il-song for proposing a North-South summit, 76.3 percent of the respondents said his proposal is a one-time [ilsijogin] proposal aimed at getting out of the present crisis, including sanctions against North Korea. Regarding the possibility of the actual holding of a North-South summit, 50.8 percent, over half of all of the respondents, gave a negative reply. In particular, 64.7 percent, the absolute majority, responded that UN sanctions against North Korea should be continually pushed ahead. Thus, a considerable number of people showed a wait-and-see position on the summit. Meanwhile, concerning the holding of a North-South summit itself, 92.8 percent, the absolute majority of the respondents, support the holding of the summit, and 65.7 percent assessed that the North-South summit would bring about positive results for a solution to the nuclear problem and for attaining cooperative relations between the North and the South. Moreover, 56.1 percent of respondents replied that the summit would make positive contributions to the issue of national reunification, thus showing considerable expectations for the North-South summit.
