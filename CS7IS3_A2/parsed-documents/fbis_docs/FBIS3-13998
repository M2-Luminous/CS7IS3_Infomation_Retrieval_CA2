This is the induction of the leader of the opposition in Parliament as the head of the Indian delegation to the current session of the United Nations human rights commission in Geneva. Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee spoke at the Geneva meeting not as a partisan leader but as the accredited representative of the government and the public of this country. It signifies there is a remarkable unity within the country on the Kashmir issue as it stands today. But more important is the Indian reaction to the exploitation of the Kashmir issue in the strategic game of the big power. On the face of it, this unity in approach is a Christmas gift from Mr. Bill Clinton and his administration. Mr. John Mallot, Ms. Robin Raphel and Mr. Clinton have spoken so volubly on Kashmir that even the most obsequious among Washington's friends in India find it difficult to accept the Clinton administration's attitude to India on the Kashmir issue. Criticism has not been confined to charges of human rights violation by India's security forces in the Kashmir valley. The U.S. administration has called into question the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India and tried to brand it as a civil war on the lines of Afghanistan. No criticism has been levelled against Pakistan's support, both material and political, to the militants in the valley demanding secession from the Indian Union. It is this blatant abetment of armed secessionism that has now made New Delhi aware of the basics of U.S. policy and helped to bring about a degree of unity within the country. The assumption on which New Delhi was working until last year was that after the Cold War, there would be a realisation on the part of Washington on the need to accept India as the more durable and reliable entity in south Asia. It was also assumed Pakistan's geostrategic importance in the region had gone down with the disappearance of the Soviet Union. For one thing, the huge, complex democracy that India happens to be is too difficult to manage and manipulate for any power however formidable it may claim to be. Even the opening up of the economy by the Indian authorities at the specific behest of the International Monetary Fund-World Bank bosses sitting in Washington does not provide that insurance for the policy makers in the state department and the Pentagon. Second, Pakistan's importance to the Pentagon has been reinforced by the emergence of a whole cluster of central Asian republics rich in mineral wealth. Also the two sensitive zones of the Chinese strategic defence, namely, Tibet and Sinkiang are contiguous to Pakistan and Kashmir as well. As the entire drama of resumption of an elected regime unfolded in Pakistan, it was clear the authority of the military junta has not really been liquidated. It has assumed a fresh significance in a changed context. It is in this context one felt the repeated implorings by New Delhi with Washington to declare Pakistan a terrorist state was both unreal and pathetic -- rather demeaning to the self-respect of the country. It is good to notice the Indian representative rebuffed the offer of third party mediation in Kashmir by the Organisation of Islamic Countries [OIC]. The OIC has long declared its support for the secessionists in the Kashmir valley. The key to the settlement of the Kashmir crisis lies in the hands of the government and leaders of political parties. They have to take the initiative in talking to the militant groups and their fellow travellers in the Kashmir valley. They should arrange a round table in which all the concerned parties -- including most certainly the representatives of the Pandits who constitute a significant entity in the Kashmir valley -- are invited. Incidentally, it was a welcome move on the part of the Pandit community to place its case before the Geneva meeting. This move makes it abundantly clear the alleged violations of human rights in the Kashmir valley do not go along the Hindu-Muslim communal divide. For long, the Indian stand has been that Kashmir is an internal matter for India. The reality has been this is true in parts. The international aspect of the Kashmir question is related to India having taken the Pakistani armed attack on Kashmir on the very morrow of independence to the UN. No doubt this aspect of the question has to be tackled at the international level and cannot be wished away. If the burden of New Delhi's case is that all the trouble in Kashmir is due to Pakistan encouraging the militants, then it will be giving in to Islamabad's strident clamour for internationalising the Kashmir question. It is therefore all the more imperative the Indian leadership takes a bold initiative to open dialogue with the militants, treating them as fellow citizens however embittered they may be. It is time the statesmanship displayed by the prime minister in unifying Indian opinion for a common stand on Pakistan's diplomatic offensive on Kashmir was projected at home. This way a common approach towards the Kashmiri people, however intractable the militants among them might be at the moment, can be forged. *
