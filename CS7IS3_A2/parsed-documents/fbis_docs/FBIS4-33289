It could not be any different. Even though this is a period of relative calm, the enemy is combat-ready on the other side of the fence. The people of Guantanamo cannot forget that sad privilege. The exercise allowed command posts and defense councils to demonstrate their skills in command and cooperation, as well as in directing operations, and the fight. Juan Carlos Robinson Agramonte, president of the provincial defense council, affirmed that Moncada II-94 was more than a defense exercise; it also contributed to accelerating the work being done to repair the damage caused by the recent rains and the efforts to build over 500 homes for the people affected, marked the restart of the sugar harvest, and highlighted efforts to restore the provincial road infrastructure, for which heavy earth moving equipment is needed to speed up reconstruction of bridges and sewers.
