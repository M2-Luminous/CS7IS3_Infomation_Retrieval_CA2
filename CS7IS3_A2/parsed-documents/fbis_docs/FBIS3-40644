The government had already hurt our farmers, and the textile, drugs and insecticides industries, but has now definitely caused an impediment for our production sector and thus to the nation's security itself. Not only that but now there are big question marks on India's economic and constitutional sovereignty. In a way, the republic has been brought to a laughable state, where the honor of the country, its achievements, and its very future have been laid at stake for a very long time ahead. GATT was established right after the second World War to establish and maintain international trading, with limited powers to oversee specific areas such as boundary-taxes and trade commercial agreements. Agricultural services, intellectual property rights, and corporate mergers were not in its purview. Thus GATT could only control matters upto our borders, and beyond that, it had no control on what went on inside a country especially with its economy. But, the new treaty makes it possible for it to have a say in many of our internal economic policy matters. It will be useful to briefly review the old GATT and why it is being revised prior to entering a discussion of the detrimental effects the new treaty is going to have on the third world, especially on India. Among the advanced and rich nations, uncontrolled rivalry, and competition had been frequently interfering with the functioning of GATT. The U.S. was getting very frustrated. Its principal position in many areas in international trade had started to be challenged. In the areas of industries, machinization, automobiles, electronics, and agriculture, the advanced place held for ages by the U.S. was starting to be challenged by such countries as Japan, Korea, Germany, Taiwan, and Singapore, whose products were of equally good quality, enabling them to compete in international markets. This necessitated coming up with a new market control strategy for the U.S. It figured whatever losses it was facing in the areas of automotives, electronics, and industrial machinery, could be made up by introducing into the world market, services in banking, insurance, technology, travel, and agriculture. Since the West and Japan had monopolised technology, it became necessary to develop safeguards of rights in agriculture, services, and intellectual properties, and to incorporate them into the GATT. Based on these concerns, a review of GATT was initiated by the U.S. It should be kept in mind that the kind of techno-economics the West has developed necessitates a constant market and flow of capital to feed it. It was figured that by bringing in the issue of intellectual property rights a control could be exercised over the market availability, but unless there is unimpeded entry into areas of banking, insurance, and the share market, capital flow and profits may not be available to the desired extent, through royalties, etc. The multinational companies were already in search of this. U.S., multinational firms, and other affluent nations came together in setting the ball in motion for a complete review of the GATT. They understood that if along with general agreements, specific requirements such as the TRIPS [Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights] were to come under the purview of GATT, they could gain an uncontrolled supremacy over the third world. Rich nations would then be able to control their capital, market, and natural resources. This was a smooth way to obtain a certain standard of living for twenty percent of the world's population, by bringing the other eighty percent of humanity with all their God given resources under complete control and to render them ineffectual for the longest period of time. This was a modern treaty which could inconvenience the majority for the convenience of a privileged minority. The Third World was ensnared in this treacherous net. The beginning of GATT talks was in Uruguay. There, the poorer nations made their objections to including TRIPS, agriculture, etc., in the treaty. It was the same with the Punta-del-Vista. India and Brazil had attempted to keep these issues out of GATT. We don't know what really happened after the round of talks in Montreal, but India and Brazil drifted apart, and India agreed to including TRIPS, services, agriculture, and genetics in GATT's realm in April 1989. Possibly the increasing pressure by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank or maybe the need India felt for loans to keep the budget balanced, were the factors that were ultimately responsible for India giving it up. An indebted nation loses its economic sovereignty. This is a burning example of that fact. India lost a golden opportunity to lead the other poor nations out of this quagmire. The Congress government has lost our economic soverignty in modernizing our economy. Then matters got fairly easy for the designers of the GATT, and under Arthur Dunkel, some new proposals to replace the old were drafted. This draft was referred to as the Dunkel draft or Dunkel proposals. The most recent debate has been of the clauses of this draft. Not all of the rich countries were in support of these proposals either. Their respective national interests mattered. The European interests were quite different. Two requirements sprung up: One, to bring about a consensus amongst the western nations, and two, to make the poor countries accept the proposals. By the fifteenth of December, the last round of talks were concluded, and the rich countries managed to reach an understanding. Following the adaptation of the basic program resulting from the GATT talks, these affluent countries started to draft special jargons and interpretations for a series of industries. Simultaneously, a lot of force was applied in making the GATT decisions internationally acceptable by offering the Dunkel draft to be adopted as it was or with review. The GATT talking group is going to be proclaimed an MNO [Multi National Organization]. For conflicts within member nations, this MNO will be the authority issuing resolutions. In the UN, the voice of poor nations was heard vey little, and many decisions made to protect these countries' interests, but now this MNO may supersede the UNO. This new authority will eventually prove a threat to our sovereignty. The Commerce Minister and his colleagues have tried to explain to us in the Parliament that adopting the Dunkel proposals will enable us to play a greater part in the international market. They say that by not adopting this we will get left out. It should be remembered that when GATT was created in 1947, its objective was to expand world trade. In the past forty years, how much improvement was made by the rich participants? India's part lessened. In 1947, India gained independence, and at that time its export was 3.5 percent [of the world market share], and it has since reduced to .5 percent. The G-7 countries form 12.3 percent of the world's population, with 66 percent GDP, and 54 percent exports. India's population is 16.2 percent, GDP only 1.0 percent, and exports only 0.5 percent. The truth is that the rich nations of the world support an international economic policy of absorption and take-overs. They do not want to give it up at any rate, and do not want their comfort level to be reduced even a little bit, even if 80 percent of the world remains hungry, destitute and diseased. It does not matter if they are suffering from famine, or dying like flies due to a severe shortage of medicines. French President Mitterand condemned this attitude in 1991, in a conference of 150 nations, and called it the rape of the poor nations. The fact is that in none of the eight rounds of GATT talks did advanced nation broach the subject of their authoritative behavior, they did not want to participate in anything that even remotely resembled such criticism. So where has GATT membership taken us to? The bottomline is that while our markets opened up to the world, our exports kept getting lower and lower. Therefore, when Sutherland announced the successful completion of the Uruguay talks, and the members opened bottles of champagne claiming that from now on every country's income will increase, and that everyone's trade will improve, it was the lie of the century. Well, if everyone meant everyone of the G-7 countries, then that of course is quite a different thing. After signing the treaty on international trade, there will be an increase of $213 billion in profits, and according to the World Bank, 60 percent of it will go to the rich nations. India's share will be $4 billion, which is 2 percent of it. The eastern European nations' share will be only $700 million, and Africa's will be lesser. This treaty will internationalize production and the profits will go directly to the multinational corporations, because they will be the directors of the production operation. Fiscal capital will replace labor capital, which will prove unprofitable for a fund-poor nation like India. Broadcasting industries' new channels will propogate consumerism, and the developed nations will secure their market in the developing nations.The direct disdvantage of this will be to indigenous industries and its workforce.
