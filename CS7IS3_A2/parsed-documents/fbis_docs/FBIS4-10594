ANEP General Manager Juan Hector Vidal has said that the necessary efforts are being made to begin free trade with Mexico. Negotiations between Costa Rica and Mexico have been concluded, and, according to Mr. Vidal, the same trade relationship will prevail between Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador -- countries which comprise the northern Central American triangle. [Begin recording] [Vidal] Individual negotiations are provided for in the general agreement protocol signed last year in Guatemala. We know Costa Rica and Mexico signed last week, and we are now trying to sponsor a northern triangle, in conjunction with Nicaragua, to speed things up and achieve the same conditions that Costa Rica now has with Mexico. Otherwise, if we do not achieve the same conditions, preferential treatment for Central American imports and exports could be lost. Moreover, we risk a diversion of trade and investments to Mexico given the advantages offered by the treaty with Costa Rica. [Lemus] What will happen to the CA-4 Group [Central American Four]? [Vidal] Well, a political decision has been made to expedite the negotiations. You may remember that a large Mexican delegation of private entrepreneurs and government officials met with their counterparts from the northern triangle countries -- meaning Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- four weeks ago. That was a visit... [pauses] I wouldn't characterize that as an exploratory visit; it was a visit to establish the rules under which Mexico would be willing to negotiate. We now need to define the conditions under which we are going to negotiate. A trade and investment agreement is not reached on the basis of impositions but through negotiations. Accordingly, we are trying to inaugurate, under the auspices of the ANEP, a seminar on rules of origin that are essential to these kinds of negotiations, because this is how rules are established for national products that are being traded. [end recording] Mr. Omar Rodriguez, a member of the ANEP, said that in El Salvador's case, ANEP held a seminar on Monday to explain the rules of product origin as they apply to free trade agreements. [Begin recording] [Rodriguez] The rules of origin seminar was organized by [words indistinct] and the ANEP to provide training -- for Salvadoran businessmen and government officials -- on rules of origin, which is basically the most important issue in free trade negotiations. [Lemus] What are rules of origin? [Rodriguez] Rules of origin define the nationally-produced components of each product prior to its exportation. In the case of products included in a free trade agreement, rules of origin define the country of origin's share in manufacturing the product that is being exported. This is important because it is meant to prevent three-way trade -- in other words, that finished products be taken from a given country to, let's say, Honduras so that Honduras can export it to Mexico as a Honduran product, when in fact it is a product manufactured in another country. This is what rules of origin try to prevent. [Lemus] As for free trade agreement, it is known that Costa Rica has already signed something with Mexico. [Rodriguez] Costa Rica already signed a free trade agreement with Mexico. This does not include other countries in Central America. The northern triangle countries -- Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras -- have organized joint negotiations with Mexico. They will try to come to some agreement as soon as possible, eventually establishing a relationship with the United States and possibly with Canada. [end recording] Last week Costa Rica signed a free trade agreement with Mexico. Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador will do so jointly when these countries' authorities feel conditions are favorable.
