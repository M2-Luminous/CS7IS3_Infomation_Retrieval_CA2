Based on the current situation, people have expressed many views on the causes of the sugar industry's loss in 1993-1994. It is generally believed that the main cause is the raw material insufficiency, that the cause of the raw material insufficiency is the peasants' unwillingness to grow beets, and the causes of peasants' unwillingness to grow beets include, firstly, the use of white slips, secondly, the selling difficulties, and, thirdly, the irrational price ratio. Those views have some merits. The sugar industry provincewide needs roughly 6 million metric tons of beets each year. Last year 4.2 million metric tons of beets were procured; this year only 2.2 million metric tons can be procured, representing less than one-third of the processing capacity. This shows that the raw material insufficiency has developed to such a point that it must be resolved. For sure, problems such as being paid with white slips, selling difficulties, and low efficiency do exist. But, in my view, those do not constitute the essence of the issue. First, facts have proven that the sugar industry still makes losses even in years when there is sufficient raw material. During the 1991-1992 sugar-making period, 6.8 million metric tons of beets were procured, but the industry as a whole still incurred a loss of 590 million yuan. This shows that the sugar industry's losses are not completely caused by raw material insufficiencies. Of course, some may say that the situation in the 1991-1992 sugar-making period was special, because the beets' sugar content was low, with the content being only 13 percent which was 3 percentage points lower than in normal years. Such was not really the case. Even if the sugar content had been 16 percent, resulting in the production of an additional 200,000 metric tons of sugar, only 410 million yuan in losses would have been made up, according to calculations based on that year's sales price of 2,050 yuan per metric ton, and there would still have been a loss of 180 million yuan. Second, the problems of being paid with white slips and selling difficulties have been widespread problems in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products over the last dozen years or so but not problems peculiar to beet procurement, and therefore cannot explain why peasant's enthusiasm for growing beets has been especially low. Third, the view that the price ratio is irrational because the current net returns on beet growing are lower than on soybean or potato growing may not be scientific either. In fact, the beet procurement price of 155 yuan per metric ton is not low at all. Currently the arrival beet price (procurement price plus freight) is 220 yuan per metric ton on average. According to calculations based on the assumption that 9 metric tons of beets are needed to make 1 metric ton of sugar, just the beet part of the cost of 1 metric ton of sugar will be 1,980 yuan, which is already higher than the sugar price on the international market. As shown here, the beet price has reached the point that it can no longer be further raised in view of the comparison with the international market. The fundamental cause of the problem is that the gap between the standard of our province's beet-growing industry and the average world standard is too large. At present, the average per mu yield of beets for the world is 4 metric tons, with the sugar content being around 20 percent, while the developed countries' per mu yield of beets can be as high as 5-6 metric tons. However, our province's per mu yield of beets has been kept around 1 metric ton ever since 1949, with the sugar content being around 14 percent. That is, in terms of quantity, a 4 mu plot in our country equals a 1 mu plot in those countries; in terms of quality, 3 metric tons of our beets equal 2 metric tons of their beets. In the past, the effort to raise peasants' enthusiasm for growing beets did not focus on increasing per unit area yield, but was consisted of repeated raising of the price. The price has been raised from 60 yuan per metric ton in 1972 to 155 yuan per metric ton now, resulting in a price increase of 260 percent; but peasants still have no enthusiasm. We have now arrived at the end of the road of raising peasants' enthusiasm through raising the price, and a further price increase is sure to result in all sugar refineries being closed. Furthermore, in view of the current situation, an increase of a few dozen yuan in the per metric ton price of beets will not resolve the issue of peasants' enthusiasm. To make peasants achieve returns on beet growing equal or similar to returns on soybean growing, it would be necessary to increase the price by more than 100 percent in view of the current situation of per mu yield. But, such a price would be obviously unbearable to sugar-making enterprises. From a historical perspective, the comparatively high returns on soybean growing at the present time has not been entirely caused by a high price. In the 1970s the province's per mu yield of soybeans was only slightly more than 150 jin, but by 1992 the per mu yield had been raised to 230 jin. If the per mu yield of soybeans had remained at the level of the 1970s, the per mu revenue, as calculated on the basis of the figure of 0.8 yuan per jin, would have been 35 yuan lower than the per mu revenue of beets. The comparatively high returns on soybean growing have been caused mainly by the increase in per unit area yield based on scientific and technological progress. As demonstrated above, our provincial sugar industry's fundamental way to get out of the predicament is to modernize the beet-growing industry, so as to reach the average world standard as soon as possible. Only in this way would our provincial sugar industry be able to successfully enter the world market and remain undefeated in competition after our country's signatory state status in the GATT has been restored. Surely, raising per unit area yield would call for hard work, and is different from price increase which can be achieved through making a decision. But, increasing per unit area yield can produce the real effect of increasing the productive forces; price increase can alleviate immediate, urgent difficulties, but cannot fundamentally resolve the issue. It is necessary to utilize the foremost productive force in the effort to develop the productive forces. This approach represents not only the sugar industry's fundamental way to get out of the predicament but also the fundamental way to make our province's dairy, flax-growing, and wheat-growing industries embark on the road of benign development and improve their own efficiency. It is high time that our province did really hard work to develop the rural productive forces.
