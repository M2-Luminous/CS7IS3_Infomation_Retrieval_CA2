Do you think that the Council will actually succeed in bringing about a cease-fire in Yemen? [Al-Asnaj] The UN Security Council certainly has a responsibility; it also has influence with which it can guarantee states' compliance with its resolutions. This has been made clear in more than one country: Iraq, Korea, and many other tense areas. The UN Security Council has succeeded in guaranteeing adherence to the UN Charter's provisions on crises and tension. What is happening in Yemen is a war in all senses of the word. The states that sponsored the draft resolution that was unanimously adopted by the highest UN authority are directly concerned with what is happening in Yemen, with its pan-Arab and national security aspects and with the safety of the region's people. They are interested in eliminating the causes of tension that hamper the development of our Arab societies. [Riyad] The entire world community is awaiting the outcome of the mission of Lakhdar Ibrahim, who is heading the fact-finding committee. Do you believe that his task will be easy? [Al-Asnaj] The task is certainly not easy, but the UN resolution makes it easier. One side has accepted the provisions of the UN resolution and its unconditional implementation with no reservations or delays. The other side has announced that it accepts the resolution but has so far raised obstacles and made excuses to avoid responding. I believe that Sanaa will find the noose tightened around it. I think it has to declare its actual position and its real intentions: Whether or not it will recognize the Yemeni people's right to determine their own fate, live in peace and safety, and scorn rulers who endanger their lives and public institutions. Sanaa is fully responsible for its decision to stop or continue this war. If it continues, the war will certainly not be in Sanaa's interest, because the international community will have taken a certain stance to deter the advocates of war in Yemen. [Riyad] Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal said during the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign ministers that a continuing state of war in Yemen would reflect negatively on the Gulf states and that if it continues, the Gulf states will take certain measures to deal with it. What measures did he mean? [Al-Asnaj] Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal was expressing the Saudi Kingdom's and the GCC's stand and their actual vision of the dimensions of this grim war and its serious repercussions on the region to which we belong. No political analyst would be surprised by al-Faysal's remarks, which express concern and a desire to eliminate the causes of tension and war in Yemen. Once again, it is Sanaa's responsibility either to continue to be a source of tension for Yemen and the region or to live in harmony with the region's people and respond to the Arab will. Egypt, Syria, and all the GCC states have said that the war in Yemen must stop and that everyone should return to the negotiations and find a political solution, after first unconditionally stopping the fighting. [Riyad] You have accepted appointment as deputy prime minister and foreign minister. What is the nature of the job you have been entrusted with at this stage? [Al-Asnaj] Whoever accepts responsibility at this stage must sincerely seek joint action with all the good elements in the Arab world--the shrewd leadership of which is embodied by the Arab Republic of Egypt, President Husni Mubarak, and all our brothers in the GCC--to end the state of war in Yemen and resume talks on a political solution that avoids hegemony, control, and military ambitions, for which there is no room in today's world. [Riyad] There is talk about a federation between the north and south. Is this matter contemplated? [Al-Asnaj] All these matters will be considered once the frenzied war stops. The political leadership in Sanaa insists on this war. It lost its legitimacy the minute it declared that war. [Riyad] Thank you Mr. al-Asnaj. [Al-Asnaj] Thank you.
