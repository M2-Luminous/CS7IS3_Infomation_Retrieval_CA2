Relating to Permanent Approval of the Modified Trading System Pilot Program November 22, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on October 21, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on November 14, 1994. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested persons. 1 In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange requested permanent approval of the Modified Trading System pilot program, rather than a one-year extension as originally proposed. See Letter from Arthur Reinstein, Attorney, CBOE, to Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated November 14, 1994. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE is requesting permanent approval of its Modified Trading System pilot program (``MTS Pilot Program''). 2 The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. 2 Id. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to obtain permanent approval of the Exchange's MTS Pilot Program. 3 Under Exchange Rule 8.80(a), the MTS Pilot Program has been authorized by the Commission to operate through November 30, 1994. 4 The proposed rule change would amend Exchange rule 8.80(a) to delete the expiration date for the MTS Pilot Program that is contained in the rule. 3 The Pilot Program was originally approved by the Commission in 1987 as a two-year pilot program. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24934 (September 22, 1987), 52 FR 36122 (September 29, 1987) (``Exchange Act Release No. 24934'').
