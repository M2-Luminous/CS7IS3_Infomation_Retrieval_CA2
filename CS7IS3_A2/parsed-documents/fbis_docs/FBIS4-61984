He has told the world that he is prepared to work to have the Karabakh dispute peacefully resolved, providing the Armenians agree to withdraw from Azerbaijan's occupied territories, the peaceful people are allowed to return to their property, the state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia is reinstated, and Karabakh's administrative, political, and economic status is outlined. But the Armenian occupiers, who pretend to support peace, do not intend to withdraw from Azerbaijan's territory. Instead, they want to intensify and broaden the war. They want to occupy more territory in Azerbaijan. The Armenian leaders' adventuring initiative during the past few days is disgusting. The ruling circles in Armenia and the political parties that support them have decided to establish Armenian cities and towns in Azerbaijan's occupied territories, including Kelbadzharskiy, Kubatlinskiy, and other rayons, by transferring Armenian families from Armenia and several CIS countries to settle in them. How do the Armenian ruling circles plan to achieve that? As the first step, they have allocated land to the families they have already transferred to the rayons. They have given them long-term and interest-free credits and exempted their sons who reach conscription age from military service. They have also met the travel expenses of the Armenians who arrive to settle in Azerbaijan's rayons and taken measures to educate their sons in Armenia and several countries in Europe. All that is a part of a planned adventurist policy to seize Azerbaijan's territory. Azerbaijan's people must know that policy's intentions and objectives. Azerbaijan's president, leaders, and people will not allow them to achieve their goals. The Armenian occupiers' policy is a defiance of the entire world. Considering that, Azerbaijan's people, regardless of their nationality, religion, and social standing, and regardless of which political party they support, must rally around the Republic's president and wage a united struggle against the occupiers. That is what is required.
