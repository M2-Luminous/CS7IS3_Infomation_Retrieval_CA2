This is unacceptable to the Chinese side, and the operation of a human rights commission will certainly be terminated after 1997. Zhu Yucheng said this yesterday afternoon when questioned by reporters while he was attending the news conference on the sale of Beijing's Fenglian Square. When answering reporters' questions about a human rights commission, Zhu said: "As far as Hong Kong residents' human rights are concerned, their duties and rights are all fully guaranteed by the Basic Law. Therefore, we hold that the establishment of a human rights commission in Hong Kong is, first of all, a violation of the Basic Law; and that will also create many hindrances to a smooth transition. That is unfavorable to Hong Kong's smooth transition." He added that although Hong Kong Governor Patten repeatedly talks about the necessity of cooperation between Britain and China, the issue of a human rights commission shows that he is in fact setting up new obstacles to Sino-British cooperation. This is unacceptable to the Chinese side. Zhu Yucheng pointed out that if the British Hong Kong authorities really set up a human rights commission in Hong Kong, the Chinese side will never recognize it, and the human rights commission will certainly be unable to continue operation after 1997. In addition, when asked about whether Hong Kong civil servants of foreign origin may achieve Chinese citizenship, Zhu Yucheng said that the Preliminary Working Committee is now considering this issue, and it is believed that a solution acceptable to all parties concerned will be worked out. When attending another public occasion earlier yesterday, Zhu Yucheng was asked about the issue of the new airport. He said that the Chinese side has never changed its attitude, and always hopes that an agreement between the Chinese side and the British side may be reached at an earlier date. He pointed out that as Director Lu Ping of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office had said, the problem that the Chinese side and the British side are now trying to solve remains the financial arrangements for the new airport project.
