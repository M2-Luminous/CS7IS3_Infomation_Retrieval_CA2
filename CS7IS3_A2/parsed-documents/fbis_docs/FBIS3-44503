FBIS3-44503 "drchi003_p_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-003 Document Type:Daily Report 5 Jan 1994 Central-South Region Review of Guangdong Radio `Hotline' Program HK0501042594 HK0501042594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] On Sunday, 2 January, Hong Kong Bureau monitored the "Today's Hotline" program, a listener call-in show carried daily on Guangzhou Guangdong People's Radio Network in Mandarin from 1035-1200 GMT. Reception ranged from fair to poor. The following is a summary of the program. 1. The program opens with a brief introduction by the program host, Wen Tao. He invites listeners to call in to recommend topics for discussion. As a New Year token, the host says he will dedicate a song to the first caller of the day. 2. While waiting for the first call, a song in Mandarin, "Goodbye My Love," sung by Hong Kong-Taiwan singer Teresa Teng, is played. 3. A Miss Pan, a hairdresser from another province who works with a hairdresser parlor in Guangzhou, calls in to complain about the practice by local parlor owners to retain workers by delaying payment of salaries. She says one of her friends, also a hairdresser, has not received her salary for the last six months, and when she asked her employer to pay off the salary in arrears as she was going to pay a home visit during the coming Chinese New Year season, her employer refused to pay but tried to persuade her to stay with the parlor during the current high season. Miss Pan says she herself is also facing a similar case at the moment. 4. A Mr. Zhang, a migrant laborer working in Guangzhou and planning to pay a home visit during the Spring Festival season, calls in to urge the traffic control authorities to pay more attention to keeping good traffic order during the present passenger high season. He complains that many drivers who are eager to make more money always try to take as many passengers as possible and drive as fast as possible, without paying the least attention to traffic regulations. 5. A Hong Kong-style Cantonese pop song is broadcast during a break. 6. A young man called Little Ma calls in to complain that construction work going on in Huadu city near Guangzhou is causing very serious air pollution. He calls for more attention to the air pollution problem and urges construction companies concerned to carry out their duty to minimize pollution. 7. A Miss Liu says she often comes across motorcades on highways around Baiyun Airport and, whenever such motorcades pass by, the police never fail to drive other road users out of their way. She says most motorcades are convoys for high-ranking government officials who claim to be servants of the people. She compares these motorcades to emperors' and senior mandarins' convoys in imperial China of the past. As civil servants, officials should try to minimize the inconvenience caused to the public while they are travelling, she says. 8. A French song is broadcast before the brief newscast. 9. Newscast at 1100 GMT. 10. Commercial break. 11. The "Today's Hotline" program resumes at 1109 GMT. A Mr. Jiao calls in to complain that the bus fare varies tremendously, from 8 to 15 yuan, for a trip between Guangzhou and Heshan. He wonders why the public bus company does not set a uniform bus fare for the route. 12. A Miss Sun, who recently experienced a road accident, calls on the police to intervene promptly in settling disputes arising from traffic accidents. 13. Commercial break. 14. A Mr. Zhang calls in to review the results of the Dongfeng Road traffic control program that has been implemented for three months. 15. The program host dedicates a song sung by Hong Kong songstar Jacky Cheung to this Mr. Zhang, who is said to be a long supporter of the program. 16. A Mr. Duan, who is also an old friend of the program, complains about the poor management of the town gas supply to the civil servant residential quarters at Guangzhou Avenue. He criticizes the town gas corporation for poor service. The host asks him to write the radio station a letter giving details of his complaint so that the station can refer the case to the authorities concerned for a settlement. 17. Brief newscast at 1130 GMT. 18. Commercial break. 19. The program resumes at 1140 GMT. A Mr. Chen calls in to inquire about the law and regulations defining the ownership of rural land. He wonders whether the government of his home village, Douwen village in Puning county, is authorized to dispose of plots of land at its discretion, and he charges the village government with abusing power. 20. A Miss Zhang complains that the Shuqian Road branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank often refuses to render a money exchange service, which she said is a legitimate function of the bank. 21. A love song sung in Mandarin. 22. A Miss Chen who is a philatelist complains about the Guangzhou Philately Company. She says she has a philately stored value card which entitles her to the privilege of buying newly released stamps. However, when she and many other philatelists went to Guangzhou Philately Company to buy the Art of Zheng Banqiao memorial stamp series that was released in October, the company refused to sell the stamps to them. Meanwhile, she found out that these stamps are available at philately stalls in town, for quadruple the original price. Miss Chen asks the philately company to respond to her complaint. 23. A Miss Lu who works for a Taiwan company's Guangzhou office says she went to the Liuhua district post office on 12 November to remit a sum of 5,000 yuan to Hubei. The remittee had not received the money by 26 November, so she asked the post office to refund her money. She had still not received a refund two weeks later, so she visited the post office again on 13 December. Again she found her case was not properly attended to. She is getting impatient and she asks for a prompt reply from the post office. 24. Lobo's "How Can I Tell Her I Love You" is heard before the end of the program.
