That is what the Secretary of State on the Elchibey Administration, Ali Kerimov, has told Interfax. Kelekiy is the home village of ousted President Elchibey. In Kerimov's view, government forces are attempting to disarm the Ordubad garrison which is loyal to Abulfaz Elchibey. The local authorities, with their heavy representation of the opposition Popular Front, have sent protests to Baku and Nakhichevan. Ali Kerimov holds the Baku Administration led by President Aliyev responsible for the negative developments in Ordubad. The press center of Azerbaijan's Ministry of Internal Affairs says, however, it has had no information on developments around Elchibey's home village.
