Speaking in a Slovak Television discussion program "Kroky" (Steps), Moravcik said that there was no reason for Russia to feel threatened by a possible eastwards expansion of NATO. He said the apprehension could be removed by the signature of a package of agreements between Russia and Nato. Russian Ambassador to Slovakia Sergey Yastrzhembskiy said that the Partnership for Peace plan had dispelled Russia's fears of a new power division of Europe. He said that a large portion of the Russian society, brought up in the totalitarian faith that the NATO countries were its major enemies, disagreed with the pact's expansion. To overlook this would strengthen the positions of Russian ultra-nationalist forces, Yastrzhembskiy stressed. If this situation is to be coped with, no "overhasty" expansion of the pact must be allowed, Russia must be given an active role in the implementation of the partnership, a treaty between the alliance and Moscow could be signed. U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia Theodore Russell said that Moscow's fears could be best dispelled if Russia joined the Partnership for Peace. Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak said Slovakia was intensively drafting a law providing for civil control of the Armed Forces, one of the conditions of the partnership. Under the law, two thirds of the Defense Ministry's staff are to be civilians. Russell praised the Slovak approach to the plan. Moravcik confirmed once again that Slovakia's goal was fully-fledged membership of NATO, adding that the Partnership for Peace was the "entrance gate" to it.
