Guntis Ulmanis related that during the meeting with Walesa they also discussed bilateral cooperation between the two countries on a European scale, as well as issues related to the process of the withdrawal of the Russian Army and the Skrunda radar station. Problems concerning minorities in Latvia have also been discussed. Latvia has to look for grounds to prevent it from being accused of ethnic cleansing and violation of human rights. During the talks, cooperation between the two countries in defense, trade, and the economy was also examined. The Latvian president noted that it would be necessary for representatives of the ministries of foreign affairs and the councils of ministers of the two countries to meet in the near future. The Latvian and Polish prime ministers will have to meet to conclude a cooperation agreement between the two countries. Polish President Lech Walesa for his part told the news conference that the heads of the two states take the same approach on the most important issues, therefore, it is possible to tackle many problems together. Walesa stressed that Latvia and Poland also have a common mission in guaranteeing security and welfare in Europe. Speaking of the influence of Russian foreign policy on European security, the Latvian president explained that on the one hand it is a megaphone policy, especially in relation to the countries which were once parts of the USSR, but on the other hand, it is Russia's real policy. Ulmanis added that in the event that the policy set forth in Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's speeches is implemented, the Baltic countries will be directly threatened. Guntis Ulmanis expressed the opinion that Russia's attitude toward the NATO Partnership for Peace program is not clear either, because on the one hand Russia apparently supports it, but on the other, Russia's action in that direction cannot be seen.
