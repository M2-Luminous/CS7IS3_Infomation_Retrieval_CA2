FR941206-2-00010 FR941206-2-00006 Best Information Available (BIA) In investigations involving imports from non-market economy countries, unless respondents request and qualify for separate rates, we apply the same rate to all exports from that country. Since neither respondent in this case qualified for separate rates, they will be treated as a single respondent for purposes of assigning an antidumping margin. Although the respondents did attempt to cooperate with the Department's requests for documents during their respective verifications, they were not able to provide the full range of documentation necessary for the Department to establish the accuracy and completeness of the information provided (see verification reports). Therefore, the Department must assign a dumping margin on the basis of BIA, pursuant to section 776 (b) and (c) of the Act. In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department applies a methodology which has been upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Allied-Signal v. United States, 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Specifically, in the case where there is only one respondent, and that respondent has been cooperative, the Department assigns as BIA the higher of (a) the estimated margin found in the preliminary determination, or (b) the margin in the petition. (Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 54 FR 18992, 19033 (May 3, 1989)). Accordingly, the Department is using as BIA the estimated margin calculated in the preliminary determination ( i.e., 163 percent). Verification As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we attempted to verify information provided by respondents by using standard verification procedures, including the examination of sales and accounting records, and selection of original source documentation containing relevant information. However, as noted above, we were not able to verify the accuracy and completeness of the respondents' submissions. Critical Circumstances On June 10, 1994, we preliminarily found that critical circumstances exist for the two respondents in this investigation. Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act, we based the preliminary decision on a finding of (1) a petition margin (123.02 percent) in excess of 25 percent, and (2) a massive increase in imports. It should be noted that the second part of this finding, a massive increase in imports, was based on BIA because one respondent, Nikopol, did not provide adequate information (59 FR 14852, June 17, 1994). For the final determination, we have received no information that would lead us to change our preliminary determination of critical circumstances. We have continued to use BIA as the basis for our determination with regard to a massive increase in imports, and we determine that critical circumstances exist for all exporters in this investigation. Interested Party Comments Comment 1: The petitioners assert that the Department should assign a BIA margin at a rate higher than the petition rate of 125.3 percent because the petition rate was not high enough to induce the respondents to prepare for the verifications. The petitioners propose that BIA should be based on the amended preliminary determination margin of 163.00 percent because that margin is based on data supplied to the Department by the respondents.
