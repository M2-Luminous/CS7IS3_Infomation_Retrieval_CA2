It is estimated that as soon as the president enters office, the administration will request an amendment to the Budget Law for 1994 to reduce appropriations and allocations which it considers superfluous and unnecessary. Abdon Vivas Teran, economic adviser of the next administration and member of the transition team, has pointed out that one of the priorities is to deal with the problem of the budget deficit. That will require carefully adjusting the balance between government income and expenditure. Public spending is one of the variables which have the most decisive influence on the level of aggregate demand. Consequently, he commented, it has a significant impact on the maintenance of adequate rates of growth of Gross Domestic Product. At the same time, by carefully managing that element it will be possible to have a decisive impact which will lead to a decline in the level of inflation and interest rates and the small scale devaluations through which until the exchange rate between the U. S. dollar and the bolivar has been set. He stated that the traditional policy of expanding demand tends to limit the scope for reconsidering public spending. Reducing the level of spending to a reasonable extent and, at the same time, reexamining the rest of the budget is another way of saying that we have to reform the Budget Law of 1994. Vivas Teran said that, "The study conducted by the technical team of the new government indicates that a reduction on the order of 150 billion bolivares of public spending is an objective which can be achieved over the very short term. These adjustments," which are rather limited, "will not be oriented toward the investment area nor toward the socially productive area (education, health, and public security)." He indicated that cuts will be made in appropriations and allocations which have continued to reflect exaggerated levels of spending, such as for automobiles, travel, highways, aircraft, celebrations, and publicity, among other things. Vivas Teran stated that the president elect has announced a 30 percent reduction in spending on the security of the Presidency and on the secret appropriation of the Ministry of Internal Relations. He rejected the allocation of 60 million bolivares for expenditures related to his inauguration. Vivas Teran was asked, "Will the bureaucracy be pruned?" He answered: "Yes. Within the goal of reducing the budget by 150 billion bolivares consideration is being given to the elimination of some unnecessary services which probably are duplicated elsewhere. Hence the urgent need for restructuring existing institutions." He added that action to reduce spending should be accompanied by a series of measures to increase public receipts. These increases should complement the program of reforms aimed at modernizing and placing income tax collection on a better technical basis, as well as other, ordinary tax receipts, including the collection of duties by the customs service of the country. Specifically, these involve the following: - The adequate management of the whole income tax system (without as yet introducing changes in the law which must be approved by Congress), creating an autonomous income tax system and strictly controlling tax collections. This would make it possible for the Ministry of Finance to collect about 260 billion bolivares in 1994 in this category, as compared to the 131 billion bolivares collected up to the end of 1993. - The next administration should, as a matter of preference, concern itself with tariff collections made by customs offices. It will be necessary to bring up to date a technical cooperation agreement which Venezuela has already signed with the United Nations for trade and development (UNTAC) to modernize the tariff system. Unfortunately, the most intractable focus of corruption in the whole system of government tax collection is in the customs offices. It is essential to wipe out this system of corruption and make changes in management personnel. In his opinion the efforts which have been made in this direction have been very limited. He stated that receipts by the Treasury from tariffs amounted to 115 billion bolivares in 1993. It is estimated that, with the changes to be made, customs receipts could rise to 350 billion bolivares. In this way the new government, through the application of ethical and administrative principles, will be able to obtain from income tax and customs receipts sufficient resources (about 610 billion bolivares) to resolve the budget deficit to a large extent.%Urgent action should be taken on taxes which are owed but not yet collected and on any tax measure which the government may approve, including those tax cases which have already been decided favorably in the appropriate courts. According to a report from the Hacienda Publica Nacional [National Treasury] for 1992, the cumulative total of all of the potential receipts by the Treasury under this heading amounted to 400 billion bolivares. The most worrisome aspect of this situation is that there has been no will to collect these taxes. Corruption is of such magnitude that frequently obligations to pay are allowed to lapse. The state can and should begin a healthy and sensible tax collection policy, using law firms and entrusting them with handling this task. Their services would be paid for by a negotiable percentage of the tax collections which they make.%Presenting to Congress as soon as possible changes in income tax legislation, including: (a) eliminating or substantially reducing authorized legal exemptions, especially those which protect the financial sector; (b) slightly increasing the taxes due on corporations. The maximum now is 30 percent. It could be raised to 32.5 percent; (c) reducing the impact of direct taxation by enacting income tax legislation before providing for some other type of tax to replace the burden of indirect taxes on the people. Vivas Teran warned that the collection of income taxes in Venezuela amounts at most to 2.0 percent of Gross Domestic Product. In 1993 it did not amount even to that much. In the United States, for example, income tax collections amount to 10.8 percent of total government income; (d) immediate substitution of the Value Added Tax by a tax on the consumption of luxury articles which would exempt from payment all products of common use by the people and which could start from a given unit value and rise higher. Abdon Vivas Teran, expected to replace Julian Villalba as president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, considers that the policy of privatization should be used more as an instrument aimed at correcting structural deficiencies in the distribution of income and property, in the provision of services, and in the level of government efficiency by helping to relieve the excessive burden of the external public debt, rather than as an automatic instrument to compensate for the budget deficit. Therefore, he added, these processes should guarantee access to property, both by those who work for companies which will be subject to these transactions as well as by persons turning out production inputs, as in the case of the agricultural sector. He was asked: "At present does the program for participation by the workers provide for the sale of between 10 and 20 percent of the shares in a company to the workers?" He replied: "I am inclined to review and broaden this program, without suggesting that what has been done so far is not good. It could be better. Furthermore, privatization tends to reduce the portfolio of shares owned by the state. The most advisable action is for a substantial part of those assets to be earmarked to pay debts owed by the nation over the long term. In this way the balance sheet of the Treasury would be protected under optimum conditions. Vivas stated: "It is clear that our task cannot be to privatize in part and to open another portfolio of unprofitable assets in the hands of the nation. On the other hand everything which adds significantly to the burdens of the state and which could be better handled by the private sector, by mixed private and state companies, or by associations, would be perfectly viable. In the case of companies owned by the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana, not all of them, in my view, are strategic. Initially, these companies could have a different form of management through mixed private and state firms." He recalled that the administration of Carlos Andres Perez emphasized to the public the view that state-owned companies are not viable and that they are a useless and costly burden. Vivas Teran said: "That is a picture which may be true in part, but it is not the whole truth. In some cases the condition of state-owned companies has been deliberately worsened to make the process of privatization easier, taking into account the fact that public opinion was going to react angrily against companies which were not providing the service expected. That is totally correct and, of course, that cannot be the philosophy of the new government." Vivas Teran stated that, "We are not going to ruin state companies just to sell them for bargain basement prices. We are going to move them into the private sector at a good price, because they are productive and efficient and not because they have been deliberately bankrupted by state administrators."
