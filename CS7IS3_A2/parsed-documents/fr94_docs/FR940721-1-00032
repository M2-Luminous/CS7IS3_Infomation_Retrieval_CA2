FR940721-1-00032 FR940721-1-00010 The site was placed on the NPL in March 1989. In April 1989, prior to the start of the RI/FS, the site was subject to an unauthorized excavation by the principals of C&J Leasing, leaving two large holes and three stockpiles of soil and waste material. The drums that were believed to have been previously buried may have been removed at this time, or earlier, and taken off-site. An extensive follow-up investigation failed to determine where the drums may have been taken. In October 1989, EPA initiated the RI/FS. Results from the RI indicated that the contaminants at the site were confined to the waste disposal trench, with the exception of some low levels of contamination in the sediments of the small pond. The total volume of waste material and contaminated soil and debris in the disposal trench was estimated at 1,250 cubic yards (i.e., contained in the area of 140 feet by 40 feet and to a depth of 6 feet). The waste was determined to be non-uniformly distributed and comprised of soil mixed with a light-colored, friable, plastic-like residue and/or a similar synthetic matter, crushed drums and plastic bags (drum liners) contaminated with the same or similar plastic residue, and some wood debris. The primary contaminants found in the trench area were various phthalates (i.e., bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-n-octylphthalate, and di-n-butylphthalate), phenols (i.e., 2,4-dimethyl phenol, and 4-methylphenol) and VOCs (i.e., benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, xylenes, and 4-methyl-2-pentanone). Lead, which was found at elevated levels during limited testing by EPA in 1986, was detected above background levels in only one sample during extensive RI sampling. Lead was also found at significantly elevated levels during EPA's post-RI sampling in 1991. A wide variety of PAHs were also found in the disposal trench and in surrounding surface soils. Since the PAHs were attributable to the old railroad bed (due to their association with products used for railroad construction, operation, and maintenance, as well as where the PAHs were located at the site), they were considered to be background. While some of the waste materials in the trench were in direct contact with the shallow ground water, the contaminants were found to be bound in the waste material and/or adsorbed to the adjacent soils and, therefore, were not migrating to the ground water from the trench. Extensive chemical analysis of the eight local residential wells (serving twelve residences) during the RI confirmed the prior results (i.e., that no contaminants from the site had migrated to these wells). Seven ground-water monitoring wells (four shallow and three deep), including one well in the center of the trench, also indicated no migration of contaminants from the trench to the ground water. Testing of the water in the small pond indicated no migration of soluble contaminants from the site. The low levels of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and lead found in the sediments in the pond were attributable to overland soil transport by surface-water runoff. The RI concluded that the potential for direct human and animal exposure, as well as the potential for future contaminant migration to the ground water and surface water, existed at the site and there were no permanent controls in place to prevent contaminant migration from the trench as a result of any deterioration or disturbance of the waste. Following completion of the RI/FS, site security was upgraded by EPA. The upgrade included installing two locked gates, additional fencing, and posting of warning signs to restrict access of unauthorized persons. Also at this time, EPA performed additional sampling at the site, in preparation for the off-site disposal/treatment of the contaminated soil and debris. On March 28, 1991, a Record of Decision was signed, selecting as the remedy for the site the excavation and removal of approximately 1,250 cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris, followed by its transportation to a permitted, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act-compliant waste management facility for treatment/disposal. The selected remedy included backfilling the trench with clean soil, re-vegetating the area, and quarterly monitoring of the ground water and downgradient residential wells for a period of one year. In addition, no remediation of the small pond was necessary because of the insignificant amount of contaminants in the sediments and because of the adverse impact excavation would have on the pond and its ecosystem.
