Apparently nobody was injured, according to eyewitnesses. The incidents involved several hundred people and some 10 people were arrested. Shortly before midnight, the situation in the area was calm. A large number of people, dressed in civilian clothes and wielding nightsticks, presumably members of the so-called "rapid response brigades," a semi-official action group, could be seen in the area. At the time, there were no diplomatic officials at the U.S. Interests Section and the "Marines" were making regular patrols of the place. The incidents that arose at the end of the afternoon had been preceded by minor episodes of violence early Friday morning when the Cuban police closed a street adjacent to the U.S. diplomatic office to traffic because of the unusually large number of people present there. The situation around the building throughout Friday, however, appeared to be normal. Apparently the incidents were started by a false rumor that quickly spread throughout Havana that the U.S. Interests Section, acting out of character, would give an immigrant visa to all Cuban citizens who requested it. A spokesman for the U.S. diplomatic office told AFP that the rumor was "absolutely false," and assumed this was part of a "provocation" resulting from a "hostile offensive." The spokesman said that no Cuban citizen had been able to enter the diplomatic building.
