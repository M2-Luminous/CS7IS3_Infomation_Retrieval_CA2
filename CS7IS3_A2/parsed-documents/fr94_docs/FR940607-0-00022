FR940607-0-00022 FR940607-0-00007 Example 3. The Collection Branch of a Service Center of the Internal Revenue Service determines in the matching process of various Forms 1099 and W&hyph;2 that taxpayer C has not filed an individual income tax return. The Internal Revenue Service sends notices to C requesting that C file an income tax return. C does not file a return, so the Service Center's Collection Branch prepares a substitute for return pursuant to section 6020(b). The calculation is sent to C requesting that C either sign the return pursuant to section 6020(a) or file a tax return prepared by C. C does not respond to the Internal Revenue Service's request and the Service Center's Collection Branch issues a notice of deficiency based on information in its possession. C does not file a petition with the Tax Court and does not pay the asserted deficiency. The Internal Revenue Service then assesses the tax shown on the notice of deficiency and issues a notice and demand for tax pursuant to section 6303. After receiving notice and demand, C contacts the Collection Branch and convinces Collection to stay the collection process because C does not owe any taxes. The Collection Branch recommends that the Examination Division examine the tax liability and make an adjustment to income. The Examination Division then redetermines the tax and abates the assessment due to information and arguments presented by C at that time. The costs C incurred before the Collection Branch are incurred in connection with an action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect a tax. Therefore, these costs are incurred with respect to a collection action and not an administrative proceeding. Accordingly, they are not recoverable as reasonable administrative costs. Costs incurred before the Examination Division are reasonable administrative costs; however, C may not recover any reasonable administrative costs with respect to the proceeding before the Examination Division because, as of the date the costs were incurred, C had not previously presented all relevant information under C's control and all relevant legal arguments supporting C's position to the Collection Branch or Examination Division personnel (the appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel under ยง301.7430&hyph;5(c)), and thus, the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified based upon the information it had. ยง301.7430&hyph;6 Effective date. Sections 301.7430&hyph;0, and 301.7430&hyph;2 through 301.7430&hyph;6, other than ยง301.7430&hyph;2(c)(5), apply to claims for reasonable administrative costs filed with the Internal Revenue Service after December 23, 1992, with respect to costs incurred in administrative proceedings commenced after November 10, 1988. Section 301.7430&hyph;2(c)(5) is effective March 23, 1993. PART 602_OMB CONTROL NUMBERS UNDER THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT Par. 3.
