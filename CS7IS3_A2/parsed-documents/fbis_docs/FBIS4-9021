The two presidents met at the two-day Central European summit in Litomysl, East Bohemia. In Litomysl, Havel told Klestil that according to all analyses, the Temelin project was the only chance for the Czech energy industry, and its level would be equal to that of Western facilities of its kind. Havel said he was sure that it was necessary to complete the power plant so that brown coal mining and burning could be cut down. Havel also promised Klestil Prague would provide Vienna with every necessary information on possible emergencies. The Austrian Press Agency APA has reported that Havel said that no more nuclear power plants would be built in the Czech Republic after the completion of Temelin. APA quoted Klestil as saying that Havel thought the Czech Republic would shift to other forms of energy production within 10-15 years. Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy estimates the minimum operation-life of the Temelin power plant at 25-30 years, his spokesman told CTK.
