Shcherbakov: "We Have the Resolution. We Do Not Have the Fuel"] [Text] Last week the federation council passed a resolution on priority measures to secure the fulfillment of spring field work in the Russian Federation in 1994. The document, which was signed by V. Shumeyko, is short, consisting of only two points, but it would be difficult to overestimate its significance. In it, the federation council proposes that within a two-week period, the government of the Russian Federation solve the problem of allocating credit to the agroindustrial complex for the first six-month period in an amount equalling 6 trillion rubles, including 3 trillion rubles for the first quarter. In this way the upper house of the Russian parliament showed itself to be more generous than the government, which in its recent resolution on the economic conditions for the functioning of the APK [Agroindustrial complex] operations in 1994 was able to allocate only 5 trillion rubles for this purpose. Recall how many critical barbs the mass media, which considers itself to be democratic, directed in this regard at the government's deputy prime minister, A. Zaveryukha, who is responsible for the agricultural sector. By doing this, they said, the government was pushing the country into a new inflationary spiral. Of course it is gratifying that the upper house of parliament has finally shown some concern for peasant needs. But the question immediately arises: Where were you before, respected deputies? After all, it is well known that the spring day feeds the year. Well, all right, perhaps before the snow melts the people of the north will see the effects of this document. But what about the people of the Kuban, Rostov and Stavropol? Incidentally, at a point at which the resolution of the federation council had not yet been signed, the farmers of Krasnodar Kray, having poured the last liters of fuel into tractor tanks, were already able to fertilize 200,000 hectares of winter crops out of a total of 1.5 million hectares. Winter crops were resown on 20,000 hectares where they had perished completely or were thin. This work must be done on a total of 300,000 hectares. Will farmers complete it successfully? It is no accident that on 1 March the new government commission on spring sowing and harvesting in 1994, chaired by the RF government's deputy prime minister, A. Zaveryukha, met for the first time this year. The discussion at the meeting was very alarming. Russian agricultural workers must carry out spring sowing on 67.4 million hectares, which is 4 million hectares more than last year. This can be explained by the fact that last fall for a number of reasons fewer late-fall plowed fields were raised and winter crops were not sown on 4 million hectares. In addition, due to crop loss it is necessary to resow winter crops on 2 million hectares. V. Shcherbak, first RF deputy minister of agriculture and food, noted in his speech that Russia's agricultural enterprises have somewhat smaller supplies of spring crop seed, especially corn. Yet this did not evoke as much concern among commission members as did the shortage of tractors, agricultural machinery and spare parts, oil and lubricating materials, mineral fertilizes and chemical plant protection agents. It is this, noted the meeting participants, that can seriously affect the course of spring field work. As of early February one out of four tractors and trucks and about one-third of plows, cultivators and sowers were in a state of disrepair. As for diesel fuel and gasoline reserves in enterprises, prior to the beginning of the current sowing period they were significantly smaller than in preceding years. Specialists confirm that uninterrupted equipment fuel supplies during spring field work is impossible if enterprises do not have a diesel fuel and gasoline reserves for at least 25 days. At the present time enterprises have only 350,000 tonnes of diesel fuel compared to the norm of 1.3 million tonnes. Operations data from the RF Ministry of Agriculture and Food confirm that about 30 percent of enterprises have completely expended their available fuel reserves. One fifth of enterprises have only a 3-5 day reserve. Especially alarming is the curtailment of fuel reserves in regions and enterprises located at a distance from railroad stations because it is impossible to transport anything during the spring period when roads are bad. In the opinion of commission members, the situation involving supplies of mineral fertilizers, seed-treatment chemicals and pesticides to enterprises for spring sowing is equally serious. Even if we supplied enterprises with a minimum quantity of mineral fertilizer calculated on the basis of 27 kilograms of active substance per hectare, we would still have a shortage of 2.9 million tonnes of mineral fertilizer. In storehouses the remainder comprises only 400,000 tonnes. In January-February enterprises were able to procure another 200,000 tonnes. Thus, total reserves equal only 21 percent of the minimum needed. Let me remind you that just 5 years ago kolkhozes and sovkhozes applied 12.8 million tonnes of fertilizer to the harvest. This year they probably will not apply even 3.5 million tonnes. Because of insolvency, village goods producers owe chemical combines 70 billion rubles. As a result, in order not to stop production, a significant portion of the fertilizer that is so needed by agriculture is exported. In order to stop this negative process even for a short time, the commission has decided to make a proposal to the government on halting the export of all forms of mineral fertilizer produced in Russia for a period of 3 months beginning 10 March of this year. "Yes, this is not a market solution," noted Deputy Prime Minister A. Zaveryukha, "but we have no other today. Otherwise, we will leave the domestic goods producer without fertilizer, and this means without a harvest." Commission members have given a great deal of attention to the financial problems of agriculture and its related branches of industry and to the deterioration of the system of mutual accounts and payments. The commission has complained about the Central Bank and the RF Ministry of Finance concerning the non-fulfillment, in its opinion, of the government's directives on the order for issuing credit to village goods producers and for canceling interest on such credit. The commission noted a number of specific measures that would make serious corrections in the course of preparing for and carrying out spring sowing.
