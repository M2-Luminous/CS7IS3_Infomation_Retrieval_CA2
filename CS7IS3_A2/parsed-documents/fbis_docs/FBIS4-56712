Regardless of this, the Electoral Tribunal [TE] has the duty to caution citizens that these polls are based on approximations, which in turn are based on questions answered by citizens who voted and who have varying degrees of credibility. Even though the polls themselves may have been conducted with rigid scientific parameters, these are nevertheless only polls and are not based on true events. Because of this, all polls have a margin of error, therefore there is no room for claiming victory. We also wish to caution that once this information is shared with the people, no person who may be favored by these polls may violate the TE's provision that states that all demonstrations, gatherings, and caravans are totally and absolutely forbidden, according to the law, until 1200 on Monday, 9 May 1994. We reiterate it is absolutely essential that no one should celebrate any sort of triumph, because other groups could do the same and clashes between these groups could endanger the peace we have enjoyed all day long. Only the results released by the TE, which will be based on true election results from the voting tables and only the National Vote-Counting Board can, according to the law, release final and definitive official results. The TE takes this opportunity to reiterate to the citizens its pledge to issue authentic and unquestionable results regarding the national elections held today, 8 May 1994. Many thanks.
