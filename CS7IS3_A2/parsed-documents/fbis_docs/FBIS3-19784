Addressing Conservatives in Poole last night, Mr Hurd said there was no guarantee that Britain would reach agreement with its EU partners on a new voting system when foreign ministers resumed talks on the issue next week. "If we are to move forward as a Union of 16, it should be on the basis of as widespread consent as possible," he said. "That is the best way to avoid conflict and bickering on a permanent basis." He said that the British public wanted the government to exercise judgment in the interests both of Britain and Europe. EU member states propose that the threshold for the "blocking minority" should rise from 23 to 27 votes when four new countries enter the Union next year. Britain and Spain are opposing this, although both are being offered a compromise that would allow a minority of states to see a two-month delay in decisions. Meanwhile, pressure intensified on the government yesterday to accept that its citizens should have a continuing right to initiate individual cases in the European Court of Human Rights. Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, in a Commons debate on the Council of Europe, warned that Britain's reputation would be damaged if the government tried to insist that it should remain a conditional right subject to review at five-yearly intervals. He said that Turkey, whose record on human rights would not commend itself to the British people, was the only country to have adopted a similar attitude. Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, Foreign Office junior minister, said the UK government was still considering a suggestion that the right should be made mandatory.
