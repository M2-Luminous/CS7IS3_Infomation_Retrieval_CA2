He is asking for extra help from Paris in paying some of the salary arrears of his civil servants. Idriss Deby was received at the Elysee yesterday evening. Among other subjects he raised with the French head of state was the Aouzou Strip, which is still occupied by the Libyans. Idriss Deby claims to be conciliatory about this matter, at least for the moment, as he said when he left the Elysee: [Begin Deby recording] We do not feel that there is any threat from Libya, even if we are of course worried. We have not heard any very clear reaction about any threat from Libya with regard to the decisions of the International Court of Justice. What is certain is that Libya agreed by common consent, as we did, to sign the Algiers framework agreement of 31 August 1989, and we also submitted the case by common consent to the International Court of Justice. On behalf of Chad I am glad that right was found to be on our side. This is what is important for us: that the national and international public knows today that the Aouzou Strip belongs to Chad. Libya committed itself, and we are relying on its good faith and on its written commitments. [end recording]
