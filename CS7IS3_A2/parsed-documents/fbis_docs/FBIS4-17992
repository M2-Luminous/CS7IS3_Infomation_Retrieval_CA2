This is the fourth year since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the leaders of the nuclear republics have still not reached agreement on the division of nuclear weapons. These weapons, used as a deterrent until recently, are being turned into an instrument of political blackmail. Those who stand to lose from this are our own security, and the thousands of servicemen serving in the missile forces. Formally, anything located on Kazakhstani territory belongs to Kazakhstan. At the same time, Alma-Ata [Almaty] has acceded to the offensive arms reduction treaty and does not regard itself as the owner of nuclear missiles. However, as a result of the cooling of relations between Kazakhstan and Russia, which followed the rejection of Nazarbayev's concept of the ruble zone, nobody is currently able to clearly define the nuclear weapons' status. The nuclear weapons concerned are 104 of the world's most powerful strategic missiles -- the SS-18 -- deployed in two divisions on the territory of Kazakhstan. The prevailing view is that these are Russian divisions. However, unlike in other armies, no state flag is flying above the headquarters. Admittedly, the main orders and the wages come from Moscow. Both the officers who have sworn allegiance to Russia, and the men who have taken the Kazakhstani oath and whose knowledge of Russian is poor, but who serve under Russian service regulations, are being paid in Russian rubles. [Unidentified Russian officer addressing servicemen] No. 12 Platoon don gas masks! [Gerasimov] At the same time, Alma-Ata is also issuing menacing orders. Their implementation has resulted in the accumulation at nuclear bases of an impermissibly large number of warheads which have come to the end of their guaranteed service life. [Akhmet Khashchegulgov, missile division commander] The accumulation of nuclear warheads in the missile division is in excess of the set norms. This is primarily the result of a decision by the leadership of the Republic of Kazakhstan banning the removal of nuclear warheads, missiles, missile fuel components, and other types of hardware from the territory of Kazakhstan. [Gerasimov] According to our information from the Russian Government, the explanation for this stance adopted by Alma-Ata is President Nazarbayev's intention during his upcoming visit to Moscow to demand compensation for the highly enriched uranium contained in nuclear charges. In addition, strategic missiles offer a good bargaining chip in the political horse-trading between the two states whose relations are far from straightforward. Officers here take the view that nuclear safety can be guaranteed only if their divisions are given the status of Russian military bases. For some reason, they believe here that this will be resolved during the upcoming meeting between Yeltsin and Nazarbayev. Perhaps when this meeting has taken place, the local Kazakhstani authorities will stop cutting off the electricity and water supply to the military garrisons. In that case officers' children will no longer have to freeze in schools and kindergartens, and the officers on duty will no longer have to struggle to maintain the survivability of the nuclear missiles. Commanders will be able to find the money needed to repair heat supply networks, and the pipes for this work will no longer have to be flown in from Moscow. To Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Kryukov and Major Vasiliy Salashnov, who are on alert duty deep down under ground, empty shelves in the garrison's stores are nothing new. Just like their comrades, they are constantly ready to implement orders. Nonetheless, most of the officers are dreaming about returning to Russia where conditions of service are more comfortable. Many of them remain in Kazakhstan only because of speedier promotion and because 12 months of service counts for 18 months here. Meanwhile, certain circumstances seem to indicate that Kazakhstan's leadership is not really seeking to improve relations with Russia. So, for example, a strategic installation -- a Kazakhstani air defense unit located near the missile division at Derzhavinsk -- is completely snowed under. When the Kazakhstani air defense troops were still Soviet troops they protected the nuclear missiles from air attacks. Now the station is deserted. A Kazakhstani-U.S. joint venture for extracting high-grade metals from missile silos, which are being taken out of service, is being set up in Alma-Ata. It appears that the Kazakhstanis trust Moscow less and less. The Russian authorities, in turn, are taking no steps toward a rapprochement with Kazakhstan.
