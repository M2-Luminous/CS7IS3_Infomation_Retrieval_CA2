She said the country's foreign trade volume would be about $200 billion by the end of the year, a steady increase from the $190 billion projected for 1993. China was gripped by an import boom last year that inflated the country's trade deficit to around $10 billion. Meanwhile, China's exports were put in a spot by higher export costs and a more profitable domestic market. The 13 percent growth rate in China's gross domestic product last year was the main cause of the import spree, which in part triggered the devaluation of renminbi yuan at the country's swap markets. The State-decreed foreign exchange rate at swap markets was $1 to 8.7 yuan (compared to the official rate of $1 to 5.7 yuan), but the actual rate plummeted to $1 to 10.86 yuan last June. By then, the bulk of China's hard currency trading had been dominated by the swap market prices. So Chinese foreign trade companies faced higher purchasing prices for exports. At the same time, exports were hit as Chinese companies chose to trade in the booming domestic market and avoid the relatively sluggish international one. Economists said slower economic development in 1994 and a healthier foreign exchange rate system will help China balance its foreign trade.
