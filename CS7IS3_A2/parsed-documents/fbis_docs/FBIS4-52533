This is in regards with U.S. reinforcements that are to be deployed to areas of the ROK Second Army in the event of an emergency and to protect related equipment. The step was taken upon the request made by the U.S. forces in the ROK in early April to put into written form the ROK-U.S. consultations on the ROK Second Army's wartime operations. The Second Army, which controls most of the rear with over 100,000 force-in-beings and one million reserves, covers the broadest area among the three ROK Armies.
