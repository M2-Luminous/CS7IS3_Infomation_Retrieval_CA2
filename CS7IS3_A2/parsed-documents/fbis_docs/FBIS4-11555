FBIS4-11555 "drlat083_a_94016" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Medical Certificate Statistics Discussed Medical Certificate Statistics Discussed 94P20684B 94P20684B CSO [Editorial Report] Havana TRABAJADORES in Spanish of 11 April 1994 on pages 4 and 5 reports that approximately 4.8 million medical certificates were issued in 1993. This represents an estimated 60.2 million missed workdays. The article reports that while this represents a reduction in comparison to 1992 figures, the economic costs rose from 181.8 million pesos to 192 million pesos. The State Committee for Labor and Social Security (CETSS) explains the discrepancy by noting that more days off were prescribed per certificate due to the optical neuritis epidemic, which affected 58,000 people, a conjunctivitis epidemic, and "other ailments." However, the article says, the neuritis epidemic accounts for only 3.31 percent of the more than 60 million workdays lost. The tourism industry has a lower rate of absenteeism and issues fewer medical certificates even though the workers "are exposed to the same viruses, the same epidemics, and work hard, although not as hard as construction workers or cane cutters," the article explains. Dr. Ramon Crespo Almeira, secretary general of the health workers union, said that, while most doctors are conscientious in issuing certificates, measures have been taken against those who have not followed the rules. Crespo also explained that it is up to administrators in the work places to verify certificates and to investigate other causes of absenteeism instead of "blaming the doctors."
