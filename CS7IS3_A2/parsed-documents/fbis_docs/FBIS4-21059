This is our newscast's confidential report. The serious dispute between Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and U.S. Government authorities in the past days, added to his differences with top officials in President Cesar Gaviria's government on all his recent actions, has brought up the possibility of his resignation. According to information obtained by this newscast, de Greiff is seriously considering the possibility of officially tendering his resignation next Monday, when he returns from the United States. Entirely trustworthy sources have asserted that the prosecutor general will resign because he is disappointed with, what he has called, the Colombian Government's lack of solidarity to confront the strong criticism by U.S. authorities who accuse him of being weak in his negotiations with the drug traffickers. This newscast has also established that next week, the prosecutor general will also present a long document where he will clarify his actions with legal arguments and point out that all his measures have been in accord with the strict implementation of the new criminal law. Prosecutor General de Grieff and the Supreme Court chief justice met today to talk, precisely, about the need to change this law for a stronger one. In addition, de Grieff will declare that the Prosecutor General's Office is hindered in continuing the investigation of the case of the attack on the Avianca plane and will ask the government to appoint ad hoc officials to this case, which caused his differences with the United States to increase.
