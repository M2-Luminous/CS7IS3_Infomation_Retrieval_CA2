CIB, as provided for under the yet to be ratified Investment Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia, is empowered to provide its opinion on the settlement of disputes. However, as far as possible, the disputes should be settled amicably through consultation between the parties in question. Should CIB not render any opinion within one month from the first request to provide such an opinion, or in the event of a disagreement by one of the parties with the opinion, the dispute shall be definitely settled through binding arbitration here, in accordance with the rules of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). This shall apply unless other arbitration procedures and places have been agreed upon by the parties or are provided for under an international treaty. In the event an approved company intends to end its activity in the kingdom, it will have to inform the CIB through an official letter, mentioning the reasons for such a decision. The Audit Department of the Cambodian Development Council (CDC), shall have the responsibility of examining the cause of the dissolution intent and also to ensure that the company's potential creditors, suitors and taxes are properly settled before the entity can be officially dissolved. Once the company's liabilities are being settled, it can transfer the remaining proceeds of its assets overseas or use them in the kingdom. However, in the event that the dissolving company had used machineries and equipment which were imported duty free for less than three years, the company will have the obligation to pay the duties applicable to those machineries and equipment. Among the incentives provided for by the Investment Law is the provision for a corporate tax rate of nine percent, non-taxation on the distribution of dividends or profits or proceeds of investments. A corporate tax exemption of up to eight years depending on the characteristics of the project and the priority of the government will also be considered. The corporate tax exemption shall be applicable from the year the project derives its first profits and a five-year loss carried forward shall be allowed where applicable. These are some of the provisions made in (?39 sections of the) "Investment Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia" which will act as the catalyst for industrial and investment growth in this nation.
