FR940412-0-00037 FR940412-0-00007 Benefits of the rule are avoidance of midair collisions during periods of extremely high barometric pressure. These meteorological conditions increase the risk of midair collision resulting from the inconsistency of altitude measurement. Although the FAA searched and did not find any midair collisions occurring under high barometric pressure, the combination of low visibility conditions, such as at night or in fog, and lack of consistent altitude measurement increases the risk for all aircraft in the airspace system under high barometric conditions. The rule will reduce that risk during such weather conditions by establishing uniform procedures to reduce confusion and to prevent inadequately equipped aircraft from flying into these conditions. Pilots always risk a midair collision in busy airspace, and high barometric pressure heightens that risk. In Alaska, the FAA recorded 28 near midair collisions from 1987 through 1989. Although the FAA cannot precisely quantify the increase in risk, it is apparent that the risk of midair collisions increases substantially when pilots do not know their precise altitude as under high barometric pressure. Additionally, the FAA estimates that the number of aircraft flying in such conditions will increase by 30 percent over the next 10 years. The combination of increased risk due to high barometric pressure and a nearly one-third increase in aircraft operating under these conditions makes a midair collision much more likely. Without restrictions under high barometric conditions, there is a potential for at least one midair collision. The discounted value of avoiding just one midair collision over the next 10 years is $5.0 million. The FAA estimates the discounted 10-year cost of the rule to be $3.0 million. This cost is the highest possible cost assuming that all landings during extremely high barometric pressure are restricted. Aircraft with more sophisticated avionics will be able to land even with restrictions in effect. Also, aircraft could land under VFR conditions. The benefit of avoiding just one midair collision over the next ten years has a discounted value of $5.0 million, greater than the estimated cost of the rule during that period. International Trade Impact Analysis All foreign and domestic aircraft would be equally affected by this rule. Hence, this rule will have no effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States. The rule also does not affect the sale of United States products of services in foreign countries. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) ensures that government regulations do not needlessly and disproportionately burden small businesses. The RFA requires FAA to review each rule that may have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The FAA criteria set ``a substantial number'' as not less than 11 and at least one-third of the small entities subject to the rule. Among air carriers, a small entity is defined as one that owns, but does not necessarily operate, 9 or fewer aircraft. The criteria set ``a significant economic impact'' as follows: $101,988 for scheduled air carriers with 60 or more seats; $57,011 for scheduled air carriers with fewer than 60 seats; and $4,011 for unscheduled operators. It is possible that in certain cases the cost of delays to small entities might exceed the threshold. However, the number of small entities that this rule might affect is difficult to estimate. At any rate, only those small entities in Alaska are likely to be affected by the rule since almost all extremely high pressure occurrences take place in Alaska. Of the 77 part 135 commuters with 9 or fewer aircraft in the United States, 15 (or 19 percent) are located in Alaska. In the case of unscheduled part 135 operators (air taxis) with 9 or fewer aircraft, only 6 percent of the 2,634 such operators in the United States operate in Alaska. In each instance, the proportion of small entities exposed to costs under the rule is considerably less than one-third. Thus, the FAA determines that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Federalism Implications The regulation herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not significant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The regulations is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).
