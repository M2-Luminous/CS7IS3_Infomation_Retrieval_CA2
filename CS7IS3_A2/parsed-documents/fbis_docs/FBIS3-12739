The purpose of the meeting was to make technical arrangements for the committee's work prior to its first public meetings next week. Attorney Shomo'el Kassar has made an appeal to the Higher Court of Justice asking it to issue an order to prevent the official committee from beginning investigations into the criminal incident that took place at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. The appeal said investigating this case is wholly rejected, since, to date, no committee of inquiry has been formed to investigate several bloody incidents against Jewish citizens. Our legal affairs correspondent Moshe Matlih said Attorney Kassar attributes the formation of the committee to political reasons.
