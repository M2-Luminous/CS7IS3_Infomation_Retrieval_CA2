This delinking policy is the beginning of a change in U.S. policy toward China and will be helpful in strengthening and expanding bilateral cooperation in economic relations and trade and the vigorous economic development in Asia-Pacific region, and promoting understanding and ties between peoples of the two countries. The Chinese Government was the first to set out separation of human-rights issues from the MFN trading status. At first, the U.S. Government did not accept it, while believing that the linking policy was the most powerful weapon to add pressure on China, assuning that China, to acquire MFN status, would inevitably make concessions to the tough pressure from U.S. intervention in China's internal affairs. Tremendous changes in the world situation have taken place over the past five years as well as in China's economic strength. Among the world industrial powers, the United States is the only one that continues to intervene in China's internal affairs by means of human rights, whereas other countries have expressed their position on the need to separate human rights and economy; consequently, the United States has found itself isolated from its allies. At the same time, owners of some 100 largest U.S. firms share the belief that China is a huge market, and they wrote to Clinton demanding a change of the linkage policy. Still greater changes have taken place in Asia; many government leaders of Asian countries and regions are unable to accept the U.S. policy of linking human-rights issues to MFN trading status. They support extending the MFN trading status to China without conditions, while criticizing the United States for jeopardizing free trade. Asian countries believe that should the United States succeed in intervening in China with human-rights issues, it would do the same in the rest of Asia. Failure to extend MFN trading status to China would inevitably harm the Chinese economy, but Asian countries and regions would suffer from still greater losses, because the Asian economy is closely linked to the Chinese economy. When the United States has dealt with China with human rights as a means, they demanded Clinton abandon such linking. It is rarely seen that Asian countries and regions take the Chinese side with a clear-cut stand. A just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support. Clinton had to review his practice of forcing China to yield by means of an executive order with additional conditions. Because Clinton is facing not only China, but also many allies, he must avoid self-isolation among Asian countries, the surfacing of anti-U.S. sentiments in the region, and entering a cul-de-sac. China is a sovereign country; of course, China will never obey the executive order of a foreign president. If Clinton had issued another presidential executive order with additional conditions, how would the U.S. President get out of the predicament next year, how would he end the show? That is a very realistic political issue. A statesman must inevitably foresee the future, and he must know others and know himself. Clinton has come to see that Bush's tactics remain feasible, it is not advisable for the President to stand up front where there is no leeway to turn around; that being the case, separation of human-rights issues from the MFN is the best choice, while discarding the issuance of another executive order is also a wise measure for protecting himself from something unfavorable. Among his cabinet, officials in charge of defense and national security, as well as the treasury, commerce, and agriculture are for unconditionally extending MFN trading status to China, and the Secretary of State has been doing his best to seek a way to mutual concessions. How should we account for the surfacing of a delinking policy in the U.S. Congress? First, China's national strength is not to be underestimated. Just like Clinton put it yesterday: "China is the world's fastest-growing economy; the protection of U.S. commercial interests is the decisive factor in making this decision." In addition, "China possesses nuclear weapons, veto power in the United Nations, and is an important power in both Asian and world security"; furthermore the two sides share many common interests, including non-nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula and environmental improvement. The second reason is China's success in pursuing a peaceful foreign policy of independence and taking the initiative in its own hands. Five years ago, nobody expected that peaceful diplomacy could have scored such tremendous effects. Today, those who want to isolate China find that the isolated is not China. Clinton said: The extension of the MFN trading status "will avoid the isolation of China while making it possible for us to establish ties and communicate with China." The why China has won friends lies in the fact that it treats others on an equal footing, safeguards peace, and refrains from pursuing hegemonism. However, by no means will China allow foreign intimidation and accept foreign orders. The third cause lies in changes in the world situation in the post-Cold War period, and it is not advisable to maintain the means of the Cold-War days. Faced with a pluralistic world, the United States has failed to find solution to many domestic issues, nor has it been able to settle issues in Somali and Haiti. The United States must coexist and cooperate in consultation with China in friendliness to cut back troubles; only then, will it be possible to realize arrangements for maintaining U.S. interests. There are all the advantages but no disadvantages for the United States to cooperate with China. The fourth cause lies in the fact that if the United States wants development with a focus on the next century, there is a need to maintain economic relations with China, who is likely to become a power in economic relations and trade in the 21st Century. The United States will lose the Chinese market, whereas Western Europe and Japan will enter it; as one subsides here, another will rise, how can the United States maintain its advantages in the next century? People in the United States require their government to take the lead in adopting a pragmatic policy for the U.S. economy. After all, Clinton does have a long-range view, and has changed his hegemonist policy toward China; that is an action worth welcoming. In the second half of this year, a comparatively pleasing trend is likely to surface in Sino-U.S. relations.
