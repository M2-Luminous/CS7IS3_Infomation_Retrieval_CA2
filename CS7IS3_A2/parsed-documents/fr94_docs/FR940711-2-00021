The NFPA standards are known collectively as the National Fire Codes. Often, the Office of the Federal Register approves the incorporation by reference of these standards under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Revisions of existing standards and adoption of new standards are reported by the technical committees at the NFPA's Fall Meeting in November or at the Annual Meeting in May each year.
