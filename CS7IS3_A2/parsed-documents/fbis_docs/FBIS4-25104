[words indistinct] Kotlov, section chief in the ministry's Information Department, said in an interview that legal restrictions and the potential public outcry would prevent a deal from being struck. "Article 50 of the law on the protection of the environment states that no nuclear waste can be brought into Russia from abroad. Furthermore, President Yeltsin signed Special Decree Number 452 in [date indistinct], which explicitly bans this kind of toxic material from entering the country," Kotlov said. Following his recent visit to Russia, Taiwan Power Co. Chairman Cang Chung-chien announced in Taipei May 29 that Taiwan might send both low and high-level nuclear waste to Russia in the future. Chang specifically mentioned that Russia's Kurchatov Institute can process low-level nuclear waste and spent fuel. Russian ecologists were originally alerted to the proposed deal through a report in the Moscow daily IZVESTIA, which said Taiwan officials participating in a scientific conference on nuclear technology in St. Petersburg held initial talks with the representative of an unnamed research center that manages 10 nuclear waste dumping sites in Russia. Russian ecologists claim Mainland China and Sweden both received similar offers to process Taiwan nuclear waste, but said Beijing did not bother to reply and Stockholm flatly refused. Kotlov said that in theory, nuclear waste from atomic power stations constructed overseas with Russian technology and assistance could be brought back to Russia under certain conditions. He [word indistinct], however, that the possibility of revitalizing cash-strapped projects with funds from potential Taiwan contractors might be considered, but only if "there were an official request." But he also explained that construction of facilities to process nuclear waste stalled after [words indistinct] due to lack of funds. He said that although funding for nuclear waste storage and disposal projects would soon be re-examined in the state Duma, "it is unlikely the work will resume in the next few years" due to cuts in the [words indistinct] budget.
