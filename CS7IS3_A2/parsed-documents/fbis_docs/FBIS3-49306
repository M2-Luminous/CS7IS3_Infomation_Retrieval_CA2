Its capital of 40 million korunas, otherwise quite negligible in this field, merely supports the company's relevant activity, said RDP Press Spokesman Jiri Vich in an interview with us. The RDP Group does not have an actual plan of activity. Its foreign trade ventures are regulated by the business law and the other laws the government has adopted in this sphere. In view of the delicate nature of the arms production issue, he stated that "substantial and regular" consultations are held with the Foreign Ministry. Furthermore, Deputy Trade and Industry Minister Radomir Sabela takes part in all of the board meetings. It cooperates with Jan Ruml's ministry in testing new products. "We ensure that our activity is clean and above board," says Jiri Vich. As far as the customers for our arms plants' products are concerned, the Czech Army apparently is interested in 200 of the modernized CZ 2000 tanks. However, the military will have a clearer idea about the kind of hardware it needs sometime in the middle of this year. The RDP is keeping in touch with the Defense Ministry and its experts. The governments of the Baltic republics are also potential customers. The first contacts were forged with them during Foreign Minister Zieleniec's official visit. "We are looking for serious customers that are not under an embargo," concludes Jiri Vich. The RDP Group is not a trust and has no ambitions to become one. According to its press spokesman, it is trying to "keep together the special teams of experts we have." It believes that the chances of success in the market environment, first and foremost, for the smaller enterprises with a high percentage of special (read military) production will increase in a "geometric sequence" by means of advantageous cooperation. "We are their entrepreneurial device," said the spokesman, when he described his company's relationship with its shareholders. Apart from modernizing the T-72 tank (the new product is called CZ 2000), the RDP Group is planning the "Overland" project. This is a military all-terrain vehicle with a Peugeot engine and transmission produced in cooperation with a French partner. At the moment, it is being tested by the Interior Ministry. Meanwhile, a secret product, "MARREL," apparently should make a contribution to the environment. So, to civilian production. Jiri Vich emphasized that the RDP Group wants, prospectively, to coordinate only 20 percent of military production up to the year 2000. Current production is dual, which means that some elements can also be used in the civilian sector. Jiri Vich commented that the RDP Group is negotiating, first and foremost, on the transfer of "know-how" and new technology to the Czech Republic. Let us hope that weapons will not journey in the opposite direction toward regions where the entire democratic world does not want to see them.
