FR940216-0-00193 FR940216-0-00010 BUTA=Emissions of 1,3-butadiene in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. POM=Polycyclic organic matter emissions in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(8) of this section. (ii) The percentage change in winter toxics performance in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 shall be given by the following equation: For Phase I: TOXICW%=[100%×(TOXICW^58.36 mg/mi)] / (58.36 mg/mi) For Phase II: TOXICW%=[100%×(TOXICW^120.55 mg/mi)] / (120.55 mg/mi) where TOXICW%=Percentage change in winter toxics emissions in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 from baseline levels. (3) Year-round toxics performance. (i) Year-round toxics performance in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 shall be given by the following equation for reformulated and Clean Air Act baseline gasolines: TOXICY1=[(0.396×TOXICS1)+ (0.604×TOXICW) ] TOXICY2=[(0.396×TOXICS2)+ (0.604×TOXICW) ] where TOXICY1=Year-round toxics performance in VOC Control Region 1 in terms of milligrams per mile. TOXICS1=Summer toxics performance in VOC Control Region 1 in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. TOXICY2=Year-round toxics performance in VOC Control Region 2 in terms of milligrams per mile. TOXICS2=Summer toxics performance in VOC Control Region 2 in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. TOXICW=Winter toxics performance in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. (ii) The percentage change in year-round toxics performance in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 shall be given by the following equations: For Phase I: TOXICY1%=[100%×(TOXICY1^54.50 mg/mi)] / (54.50 mg/mi) TOXICY2%=[100%×(TOXICY2^54.09 mg/mi)] / (54.09 mg/mi) For Phase II: TOXICY1%=[100%×(TOXICY1^107.00 mg/mi)] / (107.00 mg/mi) TOXICY2%=[100%×(TOXICY2^106.71 mg/mi)] / (106.71 mg/mi) TOXICY1%=Percentage change in year-round toxics emissions in VOC Control Region 1 from baseline levels. TOXICY2%=Percentage change in year-round toxics emissions in VOC Control Region 2 from baseline levels. (4) Exhaust benzene emissions shall be given by the following equation, subject to paragragh (e)(4)(iii) of this section: EXHBZ=BENZ(b) + (BENZ(b) × Y BEN (t)/100) Y BEN (t)= (w 1 × N b ) + (w 2 × H b ) ^ 1 × 100 where EXHBZ=Exhaust benzene emissions in milligrams/mile Y BEN (t)=Benzene performance of target fuel in terms of percentage change from baseline. BENZ(b)=Baseline benzene emissions as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the appropriate phase and season.
