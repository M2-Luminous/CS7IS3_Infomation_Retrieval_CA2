"Organizational-presentational" was how Academician Vladimir Pirumov, chairman of the SC and vice president of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, defined its tasks. The creation of such a structure in the system of the highest state authorities is an unprecedented step for Russia. As Vladimir Pirumov declared, there is an insistent need today for the shaping of official policy in respect to the protection of man, society, and the environment against the ever-increasing impact of a variety of dangers. The preliminary structure of the research work of the SC will include such sections as foreign policy, defense, economic, and environmental security and the fight against crime and information security. In addition, the Scientific Council is being entrusted with tasks of legal and information-analytical support for the activity of the machinery of the Security Council, the preparation of analytical material, and scientific expert evaluation and tutorials on various federal programs. In the geopolitical situation in which the present Russia has found itself, it is no longer possible to adopt the principle of the separate assurance of security for each enumerated sphere. This is becoming a truly comprehensive, systemic problem. On the other hand, it is impossible to protect each and everything--there are neither the money nor the forces. The need to determine priorities in the sphere of security is absolutely obvious. The difficulty of the work for the SC will be primarily, evidently, finding the resultant of these varidirectional vectors of interests. It was for this reason that there was such a long and careful selection of the composition of the Scientific Council. It consists of 27 persons. They include, for example, Anatoliy Alekseyev, chief of the Russian Federation MVD Academy, Sergey Dyakov, chief of the Russian Federation FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] Academy, Vitaliy Zhurkin, academician-secretary of the Department of Problems of World Economics and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Nikolay Karlov, chairman of the VAK [precise expansion unknown; possibly Supreme Arbitration Commission] of Russia, Yevgeniy Severin, general director of the All-Russia Scientific Center of Molecular Diagnostics and Treatment, and Vyacheslav Senchagov, rector of the Economics Academy of the Ministry of Economics of Russia. The other members of the SC are also burdened with no less high degrees, titles, and positions. It is anticipated that five "branch" groups will be created within the SC: public health care and environmental safety, assessment of foreign policy activity and defense and information security, conversion, and economic, and a public and state security group. The work plans of the SC for 1994 include discussion of measures to limit the exodus of specialists and figures of science and culture abroad, questions of scientific and technological cooperation with foreign countries, a strengthening of the legal and organizational principles of the use and protection of Russia's scientific achievements, and scientific and technological problems of the equipping, arming, and special outfitting of servicemen. Initially, however, members of the SC will, evidently, be dealing with more prosaic matters. It was felt at the first meeting that a system of interaction of the SC and the Security Council has yet to be worked out. In addition, the efficiency of the work of the Scientific Council could perfectly well be reduced unless problems of a purely internal nature are avoided. Thus it is contemplated that the SC will be centrally funded (according to information available to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, it will receive approximately R3 billion in 1994). The client of the work will be the Security Council. And although it is stipulated that this money must under no circumstances go to subsidize this department or research institute or the other, only a specific group of executants, it will, perhaps, be very difficult to avoid lobbying attempts on the part of members of the SC for their "own" structures. The integration of existing efforts in the sphere of security in the programs planned for execution by the SC will be no less complex a problem. And, finally, lest the SC become a kind of elite club of Moscow intellectuals, it will be necessary to give serious thought to how to make rational use in its work of Russia's regional research.
