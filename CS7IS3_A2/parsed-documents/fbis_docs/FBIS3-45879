But the two sides skirted Seoul-Beijing route, leaving it unsettled and agreeing to continued charter services. South Korean Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae said these agreements, reached at working-level contact last week, will be made final at the aviation talks next month in Beijing. Because the Seoul-Shanghai service is unsettled, the aviation agreement would have to be a temporary one, officials explained. The two countries also left untouched the number of airlines to service the Seoul-Beijing route and the beyond rights, putting them aside until next month's aviation talks, they said. The aviation agreement is expected to be signed during President Kim Yong-sam's Beijing visit late March, and the Seoul-Beijing service may commence as early as April. The control transfer point had blocked a successful agreement when Beijing insisted on ignoring the 124 degrees longitude drawn by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and moving it to 125 degrees. China conceded on the Beijing route at 124 degrees but insists on 125 degrees for Shanghai. The charter flights will have to keep using the corridor set up by Japan-China aviation agreement until further negotiations. The 124 degree agreement for Seoul-Beijing will hopefully set precedent for flights linking South Korea with northern China such as Qingdao and Shenyang, officials said.
