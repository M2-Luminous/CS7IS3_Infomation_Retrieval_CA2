Miguel Alfonso, a Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman, referring to the U.S. State Department report issued last week, told the media: "It is belated, but we welcome it." The spokesman said that the Foreign Ministry does not yet have any official analysis of the document, which is being analyzed by the Directorate of Multilateral Affairs. Alfonso announced, though, that this "recognition" of Cuba's official policy for the control of drug trafficking "is somewhat belated." The U.S. State Department report pointed out "efforts the Cuban Government has made to prevent drug trafficking in its territorial waters and air space." The document also praised the steps the Caribbean nation has taken in this direction and noted that the Cuban authorities have reinforced their antidrug-trafficking struggle. The Cuban spokesman stated: "Our government's policy on the struggle against drug trafficking is long-lived."
