According to data from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, from December 1992 through January 1994, 167 homes of Ingush and 107 of Ossetians were blown up, and more than 100 people were killed. Arms purchases and attacks on military facilities continue. Many times the situation has been on the verge of renewed armed clashes due to a failure to provide accommodations for refugees in Ingushetia and Northern Ossetia. Both sides continue to preserve their paramilitary formations--"officially" in Northern Ossetia and "unofficially" in Ingushetia. The leadership of Northern Ossetia explains its refusal to disarm the republic guard (presently termed "units for safeguarding economic facilities") by virtue of the absence of borders with Chechnya and attacks on economic facilities by armed individuals from Chechnya. Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the State Committee on Nationalities and Regional Policy Affairs, noted that until such time as the sides engage in constructive negotiations, "Russia is financing the conflict." We should add that in 1993, R100 billion from the federal budget was appropriated to finance accommodations for refugees, and R23 billion--for upkeep of the provisional administration. The positions espoused by the parties have not undergone any special change. The Ingush side has not abandoned the idea of the return of Prigorodnyy Rayon--Article 1 of the Constitution of Ingushetia, approved 27 February 1994, states that it is the objective of the state to effect the return by political methods of illegally seized lands. As before, the Ossetian side believes that the status of Prigorodnyy Rayon within Northern Ossetia must be consolidated in order to resolve the conflict, and following this must come the demarcation of Ingush borders. The North Ossetian leadership is insisting on the need for a political assessment of the events of 1992 and on holding the initiators of the conflict accountable. An agreement was reached at the latest bilateral talks of 2-3 April on the return of Ingush refugees to four villages: Chermen, Dangaron, Dachnoye, and Kurtat in Prigorodnyy Rayon, as required by the Russian Federation presidential edict of 13 December 1993. However, Northern Ossetia is declaring its readiness to accept only those Ingush who "did not participate in the conflict." In this regard, in the opinion of the Ossetian side, resolution of this issue should be comprehensive, i.e., should take into account the problems of 47,000 Ossetian refugees from Georgia and consideration of the opinion of the rural (Ossetian) population that remains in Prigorodnyy Rayon. From all appearances, the leadership of Northern Ossetia intends to torpedo resolution of the problem of returning Ingush refugees to their homes. This is seen by the slogan advanced one year ago of the "impossibility of joint habitation" of Ossetians and Ingush. The Ingush side, in turn, supports the introduction of federal rule as the only measure capable of resolving the problem of phased return of the Ingush to Prigorodnyy Rayon. Most representatives of federal structures of power also consider it necessary to introduce federal rule in the territory inhabited by the Ingush in Prigorodnyy Rayon. However, they are not raising this issue at trilateral meetings out of fear of destabilizing the situation in the region. In addition, the legal basis is lacking at present for effecting federal rule in the territory of a nation-state formation in the Russian Federation. A full settlement of the conflict is impossible at the present stage. To stabilize the situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, it would be advisable to drag out the question of demarcation of borders of Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia, since a "definitive" resolution one way or another with respect to borders could aggravate the situation in both republics and lead to new armed conflict. It is necessary in the zone of conflict to return to the idea of creating a "purely Ingush" enclave of villages. Judging from the decree adopted by the Northern Ossetia Supreme Soviet on the "impossibility of joint habitation of Ossetians and Ingush," the Ossetian side supports such a decision. The Ingush side will likely come out against it since they are counting on a return to the borders of 1944. However, creation of a "purely Ingush" enclave of villages in the development of local self-government will in time enable resolution of the problem of forming a broad autonomy of Ingush in Northern Ossetia and will thus remove the question of clashes of the Ingush populace with "Ossetian" organs of authority, which was the immediate cause of the military operations in 1992. In the future, the "Ingush enclave" could fall within a dual jurisdiction--subordinate to Northern Ossetia for administrative matters, to Ingushetia for cultural affairs. It is necessary that efforts begin in the construction of housing and in the return of refugees to control of the federal authority. In this regard, the financing of such measures must be public and effected directly out of the federal budget. Otherwise, it is highly likely that the leadership of Northern Ossetia will reject the return of Ingush refugees under pretext that the construction was proceeding "at the expense of the republic budget" (although the budget of Northern Ossetia in 1993 was subsidized by the federal budget to the extent of 57 percent) and that its organs of authority have the right to decide which refugees--Ossetians from Georgia or Ingush--are to be settled into new homes. The search for a resolution to the conflict must be based on bringing the situation and the legal norms regulating it into conformance with the general federal laws and Constitution of the Russian Federation, not on historical research from various points of view. One of the most immediate tasks of the Federal Assembly is to draw up a legislative base to allow the federal center to effectively play the role of arbiter in the event one of the sides refuses to seek compromise. In addition, it is necessary to develop a legal basis for the interrelationship between the center and regions in order to overcome the lack of regulation of the activities of local organs of authority on the part of the federal center. Periodic hearings in the Federation Council on settlement of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict could become an effective mechanism of accelerating the procedure for coordinating the positions of the sides. This measure would enable the federal center to avoid ill-considered decisions in the region, exert pressure on the conflicting sides prior to the formulation of general federal legislation on conflict resolution, and avoid accusations of application of a unilateral approach in resolving the crisis.
