Work committees concerned are preparing to submit reports on the three chapters -- the state, the state structure, and the head of state. Even before the National Convention was convened, the SLORC had told the delegates they were to guarantee a leading role for the military in Burmese politics. However, the military may not get all their demands, says Larry Jagan, who is currently in Rangoon. There are reports that, as the closed-door meetings of the work committees continue, more differences over the state structure are emerging. Deliberations are being made as to which zones, areas, and divisions should be granted the right of self-administration. There has been no decision on the states with the right of self-administration and the Wa are reported to be distraught over the matter as they had demanded a separate independent state. They had said that they would not give up arms if they were not given statehood. It is not clear whether they will be satisfied with an offer of the status of a self-administered area. The issue of self-administered areas would involve a division of the Shan State, and the SNLD, the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, had strongly protested over the matter. Well-informed sources say that they are expected to raise the problem when they present a report early this month. The problem is expected to become more complicated when the delegate representing Kachin [Kachin Independence Army] 4th Battalion at the National Convention discusses the matter of granting it a self-administered zone within the Shan State. According to well-informed sources, the Kachin delegate is expected to demand a separate and independent self-administered zone within the Shan State. The SNLD is not expected to accept such a demand. As the Kachins have been given a state with the right of self-administration, the organizers of the National Convention are duty-bound to reject the demand. The Burmese military authorities want to avoid direct criticism against them at the National Convention and they certainly do not like publicity for the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy [NLD]. Both the SNLD and the NLD severely criticized the military administration in their submissions last year. The reports prepared by them have to be submitted to the authorities before their submission to the convention. Each delegate group has to submit its suggestions for approval before submission to the convention. According to reports in Rangoon, there was a reference during the discussion in the conference hall to the NLD in describing the democratic forces as a spent force of the past; however, the NLD was able to rebut it, saying they are not a spent force of the past. The military authorities were reported to be embarrassed by the incident. It is clear that the military authorities are (?taking measures) to prevent such incidents. [passage omitted]
