I think that we should link our work to give the impression that there will be a common presidency, or at least a continuous presidency, for 12 months." The remark was made yesterday by Francois Mitterrand during the press conference held during the 63d Franco-German summit in Mulhouse. Sitting at his side, Chancellor Kohl confirmed: "We intend to work with the French to ensure that our two terms as president turn into one period of 12 months." The two heads of state and of government thus clearly went further than French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wished. The previous day the latter used a spokesman to describe the Franco-German tandem as a "dual presidency making it possible to link work over a year through joint operations and projects." Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand insisted: "Europe will never have experienced such a long period of continuity." Paris and Bonn have already prepared for this term of office which starts on 1 July. For two days, the Franco-German partners reviewed the problems of security and stability in Europe, the problems of immigration, and the strengthening of Community institutions, the fight against unemployment, and economic recovery. One of the high points of this meeting, which distinguished it from the "previous 62," according to Mr. Kohl, was the fact that the two "locomotives of Europe" wanted to settle the issue of the eastern and southeastern high-speed trains. In reply to the impatience of the Central and East European countries which want to join the EU, Francois Mitterrand said: "I see no obstacle to speeding up the membership process for newcomers, provided the European rules are respected. There are no preset limits on European expansion." But, both Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl stressed that "the important thing is that the interests of the candidates do not conflict with our achievements, and that Europe should make progress." Anxious to stress this "harmony," Chancellor Kohl welcomed "the remarkable atmosphere of the Mulhouse summit. The problem with this type of consultation is that it often leads to nothing spectacular. But the sensational thing is precisely this normality in Franco-German relations within the framework of European developing European unity," he noted. Musical Chairs This perfectly rehearsed duet also applied to the candidates for the mandates which are expiring in European and international organizations. With regard to the replacement of Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, Francois Mitterrand explained: "The exchanges of views will continue until the Corfu summit (on 24 and 25 June -- LE FIGARO editor's note). We will probably be ready to support the same candidate after consultations with our 10 partners." The chancellor smiled knowingly. European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan will be nosed out by Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. The British candidate could inherit the post of secretary general of the World Trade Organization, which will take over from GATT. Paris would apparently not oppose that. Unless, members of the entourage of one French minister stressed, he insists on replacing Jean-Claude Paille, whose mandate as secretary general of the OECD is coming to an end. Paris would like Mr. Paille to be given another term of office. This huge game of musical chairs is far from being settled. Another position to be allocated is that of secretary general of the Western European Union, and that of secretary general of NATO. The Germans and French have drawn up a list of names with a view to the Corfu summit, while "avoiding giving the impression of imposing their candidates on the other Europeans," one of the French prime minister's advisers explained. Far from these negotiations, the French president finally issued an invitation to Germany: "I announced today that I had the intention of inviting the European Army Corps to the 14 July celebrations. And, consequently, the German, Belgian, Luxembourg, and Spanish officials who are already part of or about to become part of the corps." Chancellor Kohl immediately "accepted" this invitation "with gratitude," indicating his intention of being present on the Champs-Elysees on France's national holiday.
