The 14.5 per cent growth over the first month of 1993 (adjusted for holidays) indicated a rare recovery of the nation's exports, which were teetering throughout last year, trade officials said. The General Administration of Customs put last month's exports at $4.8 billion. Imports soared by a massive 42.3 percent to $5.7 billion in January. Customs officials did not say whether China will be able to sustain a trade balance for this year. The country sustained a deficit of $12.2 billion last year, the first since 1989. According to Customs, January's export surge was still led by foreign-funded enterprises, which numbered more than 170,000 nationwide by the end of 1993. Their exports rose 55.2 percent to $1.49 billion, or 31 percent of the nation's total. At the same time, exports by State-run and other types of enterprises managed a 2.5 percent growth to reach $3.3 billion, Customs said. This compared favourably with last year, when exports posted negative growth partly due to high export costs. Most of these enterprises shifted to a more lucrative domestic market buoyed by a 13 percent growth rate in the gross domestic product (GDP) last year. Customs officials said China's move to curb credit since last July and the unification of foreign exchange rates last month were major factors behind the export growth. The exports of finished industrial products jumped by 18.7 percent to $4.04 billion, while those of primary products dropped 3.9 percent to $760 million. Broken down, the exports of garments, machinery and electronic products grew by some 22 percent each. But the exports of traditional high-growth items, like shoes, luggage and dolls plateaued. Crude oil, oil products, coal and other fossil fuel sectors saw exports go down, but still some other primary products like foodstuffs saw an increase in exports. The country's exports via barter trade plummeted 37.5 percent from January last year to $80 million. It was the barter trade, which enjoys certain preferential tax policies, that had attracted a considerable part of China's exports last year. But barter trade usually does not produce foreign exchange for the State coffer. The country obtains foreign exchange cash mainly from general trade. The exports in this form saw a sharp recovery last month to $2.18 billion, up 18.9 percent. Overall, China's exports are apparently on the way to a steady growth, but analysts said the State-run companies have yet to make further progress. It is still not easy to root out a deficit should exports fail to chalk up a higher speed, especially when imports are continuing to surge, trade officials said. But Customs showed that the import boom was led by the foreign-funded enterprises, which do not use the State's foreign exchange reserves. Imports by these ventures jumped 116 percent last month to $1.07 billion. And the imports of raw materials for processing rose by 46.2 percent to $2.14 billion.
