Vasilyev: "On the Verge of Bankruptcy"] [Text] Today we can characterize the economic situation in which a majority of farms find themselves as being on the verge of bankruptcy. We are once again convinced of this fact after acquainting ourselves with the report entitled "Operational Results of the Agro-Industrial Complex and the Tasks for 1994," as prepared for the government by Minselkhoz [Ministry of Agriculture] of the RF [Russian Federation]. Many agricultural enterprises, as emphasized in this report, have not been paying wages for 3-4 months; for all practical purposes they have not been carrying out repairs on equipment, since they are unable to purchase spare parts and they are not supplying mineral fertilizer or accumulating fuel and lubricating materials for the spring sowing work. Some farms are even unable to purchase seed. There have been instances of funds not being available for acquiring the fuel needed for delivering the livestock products produced to the consumers. For the most part, this critical situation in the rural areas has been conditioned by a considerable weakening in state support. During the 1991-1993 period, investments in agricultural production installations have declined by a factor of roughly sevenfold. Over the past two years, there has been a sharp decline in the capital-labor ratio and the equipment workload has increased. And the damaging trend towards a decline in state assistance is continuing this year. Thus, approximately nine trillion rubles' worth of centralized credit resources are needed for farms, including private farms, the organizations which provide services for them and also food and processing enterprises for preparing for and carrying out spring field operations and also for their accounts with agricultural producers for products delivered last year. Plans call for only one-ninth of the mentioned amount of funds to be allocated for these purposes during the first quarter of this year. And for development of the agro-industrial complex, Minekonomiki [Ministry of Economics] and Minfin [Ministry of Finance] call for a limit to be placed upon centralized capital investments, financed from the republic budget of the Russian Federation, in the amount of 2.8 trillion rubles. In comparable prices, this amounts to only 55 percent of the limit for 1993. Meanwhile, the requirement for centralized capital investments for 1994, for carrying out the state special purpose federal programs and decrees for the support and development of individual regions for agriculture alone, according to estimates by Minselkhoz economists and as adopted by the government of the Russian Federation, exceeds 37 trillion rubles. Thus, state support for measures aimed at strengthening the logistical base for agriculture is in essence being discontinued and the carrying out of all programs adopted, including such an important one as "Improving Soil Fertility," is being delayed. An analysis of the status of affairs in the agro-industrial complex, conducted by Minselkhoz specialists, reveals that the branch's crisis is intensifying. And this year, if the government fails to undertake the radical measures needed for strengthening the agricultural economy, we may witness a drastic decline in agricultural production.
