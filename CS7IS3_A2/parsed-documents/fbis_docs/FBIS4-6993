He made the latest call at the opening of a seminar on general mining in Jakarta on 6 April. A serious review is needed considering that Indonesia's foreign loans have nearly reached the threshold of a psychological limit of U.S. $100 billion and which could have an influence on the donor countries. This means that if the foreign loans exceed the limit, then the donor nations will reconsider giving Indonesia more loans. The amount will then be reduced. Minister Affif said the national economy did not experience a negative impact even though the country's foreign loans "should have received serious attention." The indicator which was presented was that the inflation rate was lower than last year, the foreign exchange reserves have reached U.S. $12 billion and could support imports for at least five months, the national banking lending rates have returned to normal, and the transactions deficit continues to decline. During the 1993/94 fiscal year, the transactions deficit stood at only U.S. $3 billion, or around two percent of the Gross Domestic Product, GDP; while during the 1990/91 fiscal year, the deficit stood at 3.7 percent. The ratio between the transactions deficit with the GDP stood at two percent which was considered a safe deficit level for any nation. The amount of foreign loans cannot be used as a yardstick to determine the seriousness of the national economic situation. All will depend on the country's economic resources. Indonesia is currently feeling the heavy burden of foreign loans. Such a burden can be seen, for example, from the numerous financial allocations it must set aside in every annual budget to pay interest and repay foreign loans. The financial allocations set aside for repaying foreign loans are continuously increasing annually. For example, during the 1994/95 fiscal year, 42 percent of the routine expenditure will be allocated for repaying loans. It will be more beneficial if such allocations are utilized for improving the welfare of government employees or toward contributing to allocations for development. The heavy burden of repaying foreign loans does not necessarily mean that the burden was caused by the increase in loans. Another cause was the appreciation of foreign currency, particularly the yen. The Japanese yen's rapid appreciation against the U.S. dollar caused Indonesia to suffer a 40 percent loss in foreign loans, particularly in yen currency. Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad stated that "our debt burden is increasing even when we are asleep." First, attention should be directed toward the yen's continuing appreciation which shows no signs of declining. Japan's huge trade surplus with its major trading partners and the deadlock in Japan-U.S. talks will definitely become potential factors for the yen's appreciation. More caution is needed in pursuing developments. There is a need to scrutinize the management of foreign loans from time to time. Second, the business circle's commercial loans have spiralled in recent years. The loans taken by the private sector within a brief period accounted for 40 percent of Indonesia's total foreign loans. It is very heartening if we view it from a different angle because the business circle was successful in acquiring financial resources on its own from international monetary sources. But on the other hand, the loans they took were only short-term with high interest rates. This further contributed to the country's heavy burden of balance of payments for foreign loans. In this connection, it is only appropriate that the business circle positively realizes the situation. The business circle should practice self-restraint when taking out loans. They should only apply for limited and affordable loans which can be repaid, or loans for projects which can bring in foreign exchange. All this would greatly contribute toward preventing the national economy from being enmeshed in difficulties. It is a fact that a drop of water will definitely not cause a catastrophe. But if a drop of water is added to a brimful glass of water, then an overspill is unavoidable. It will be wise and good if certain planned mega projects are temporarily shelved. Serious attention is greatly needed on the question of foreign debts. The danger a country faces is not from its foreign debts, but more so from its supporting economic capabilities. This can be observed through the country's ability to bring in more foreign exchange through its exports. People know that the debt service ratio [three preceding words in English], DSR, has exceeded 30 percent. In fact, we are concerned about the recent export developments. First, non-oil exports are beginning to face competition everywhere since its rapid growth over the last decade. Its rapid climb is currently facing a slight decline. Thus, we have exposed our export problem. In this connection, we would like to point out the need to employ other steps in trying to safeguard our exports and also to secure a "safe level" due to foreign debts. Whether we like it or not, this is the hurdle that we must overcome. Our national economy will suffer if a unilateral step is taken regarding the utilization of funds derived from long-term international loans.
