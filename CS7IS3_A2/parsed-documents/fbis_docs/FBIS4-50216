It had been standing orders to pay strikers' wage demands in state-owned factories, but in several cities banks and administrations have refused to do so. Beijing sources said yesterday the State Council was taken aback by their refusal. The sources said incidents of industrial unrest were occurring once or twice a week in depressed sectors, such as coal and textiles, in Hubei, Hunan, Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces. "To prevent the strikes and protests from developing into political incidents, Beijing has ordered lower-level governments to satisfy the demands of workers whenever possible," an industrial source said. "However, numerous local leaders have refused to pay, either because they have no money or they think the practice, which often involves printing money, would exacerbate inflation." The source said in most cases Beijing had been able to confine strikes by using a carrot-and-stick approach a combination of the pay-up policy and the deployment of police to prevent workers from spreading their action to other factories. But it is understood the State Council is worried about the labour situation worsening in the wake of cities refusing to hand out money to pacify strikers. At the same time, the authorities are being confronted with protests by civil servants in rural areas, many of whom are paid only three or four times a year. Chinese sources said more than a dozen counties in Hunan could only pay civil servants irregularly, leading to poor morale and go-slow protests.
