The meeting of the three in Belgrade is attracting a great deal of attention, particularly because of the Gorazde drama and the latest NATO threats to the Serbs in Bosnia. Only a few days ago Akashi told Butrus-Ghali that he would not talk to Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic unless, as he said, the attacks on Gorazde were to cease and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] members were to be released. Akashi also made his meeting in Belgrade conditional upon a total cease-fire in and around Gorazde. At the moment the only thing that is certain is the fact that the Serb Republic has declared a unilateral cease-fire, so the question now arises as to whether this move was sufficient for Akashi to change his mind.
