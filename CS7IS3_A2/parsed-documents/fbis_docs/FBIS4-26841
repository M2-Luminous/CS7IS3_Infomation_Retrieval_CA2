During a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the first implementation of the "five principles of peaceful coexistence" in foreign affairs, the Chinese premier said China would continue to oppose interference in its internal affairs "under the pretext of human rights." "The affairs of a country should be managed by its own people who have every right to choose their own social system and course of development suited to their national conditions," Li told a gathering of foreign emissaries at the Great Hall of the People. But the premier added "developed countries have the responsibility to help the underdeveloped ones shake off poverty" and blamed an "irrational international economic order and exchange of unequal values" for the difficulties developing countries face. Li said more funds, technology transfers and favorable economic policies from developed countries would lead to economic growth and social stability in the developing world. The five principles are "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence," Li said. The principles were first implemented in 1944 in joint statements issued by India, Myanmar [Burma] and China. They have been China's unilateral guiding principle in foreign affairs ever since.
