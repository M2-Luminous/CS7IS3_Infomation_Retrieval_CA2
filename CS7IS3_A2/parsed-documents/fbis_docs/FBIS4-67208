FBIS4-67208 "jptdd021__l94061" JPRS-TDD-94-021-L JPRS Narcotics 10 May 1994 EAST ASIA THAILAND Marijuana, Opium Cultivation in Northern Provinces Detailed Marijuana, Opium Cultivation in Northern Provinces Detailed BK1005102094 Bangkok MATICHON in Thai 10 May 94 p 12 BK1005102094 Bangkok MATICHON Thai BFN [Text] Police Colonel Thatnarong Winyanrat, commander of the Border Patrol Police Unit No. 34 in Tak Province, said during an interview that he agreed with the Office of Narcotics Control Board's [ONCB] report labelling Tak, Phitsanulok, and Chiang Mai Provinces as the major marijuana-producing areas in northern Thailand. He pointed out that over 75 percent of the area in Tak is mountains and dense jungles suitable for marijuana cultivation by hill tribes such as at Pang Sangkasi, Vang Tamlung, and Phaphun villages in Na Bot District and Na Khiri village in Muang Tak District. Police Colonel Thatnarong added that capitalists from the northeastern region and upper part of the northern region will normally give marijuana seeds to tribesmen to begin cultivation at the beginning of the rainy season and provide the necessary instructions to ensure a bumper harvest. Marijuana is compressed into bars and sent by trucks to Chiang Rai Province from where the drug will be shipped down the Mekong River to the Gulf of Thailand for export to foreign countries and sale in domestic markets. The officer said: "Our unit has been coordinating with the northern branch of the Office of Narcotics Control Board in search of marijuana plantations in the northern provinces. We destroyed not less than 15 tons of the grass worth millions of baht during each crackdown operation. However, the authorities also faced numerous difficulties because all the plantations are located in remote and mountainous areas which enables the culprits to flee before their arrival." Meanwhile, Suphong Manatphaibun, deputy governor of Nakhon Phanom Province, disclosed that the provincial administration does not have sufficient information to confirm the ONCB office's claim that Nakhon Phanom is the largest marijuana-producing area in the country. However, he admitted that there are some marijuana plantations in the province. Several portions of the drug found in the province were smuggled into the country and authorities have been instructed to launch regular search and suppression operations. Sub-lieutenant Prawat Athipanya, deputy governor of Sakon Nakhon Province, expressed his disagreement with the report by the ONCB Office saying Sakon Nakhon is one of the three largest marijuana-producing provinces in Thailand, noting that small plantations are scattered in the mountainous areas of Kut Bak District and Phuphan reserve forest. Unlike other provinces, Sakon Nakhon does not have any big investors engaging in marijuana cultivation. The provincial administration has ordered that continuous suppression operations be carried out throughout the province. Sub-lieutenant Praswant said: "Most of the grass is grown in Tha Uthen District of Nakhon Phanom Province and in Laos, where Lao farmers plant marijuana along the bank of the Mekong River. We can clearly see the plants from the Thai side." He disclosed that Sakon Nakhon is no longer a marijuana transit point due to intensified suppression operations by provincial officials. Banphot Piamdi, director of the Narcotics Control Center in the northern region, revealed that opium cultivation remains the big problem in the 17 northern provinces. The total acreage used for opium cultivation in 1993 was as high as 16,000 rai [2.5 rai is equivalent to one 1 acre]. Marijuana cultivation was first introduced to Sukhothai, Phitsanulok, Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai Provinces in 1987 and later spread to other nearby provinces. Tribesmen have found it easier and less complicated to grow marijuana than opium. Moreover, they can earn more from planting marijuana. More tribes people have now shifted to planting marijuana, but most of them plant the crop for their own consumption and sale in small quantities. Marijuana is not as big a business here as it is in the northeast. Witthaya Kaeopharadai, Phalang Tham MP from Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, said people should not think that the U.S. drug charge against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong is politically motivated, adding that Thanong has acted correctly in appointing lawyers to deal with and clear himself from the U.S. accusation. Asked about the thesis by an ONCB official on police involvement in drug trafficking connections, Police General Prathin Santipraphop, director general of the Police Department, replied that the topic is not unusual. In the past, several police officers and officials of other government agencies have been arrested on drug charges.
