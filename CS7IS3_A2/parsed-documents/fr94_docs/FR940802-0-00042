FR940802-0-00042 FR940802-0-00008 4. Provisions of Today's Rule Regarding the Shoulder Season As discussed above, EPA does not expect today's rule to result in increased ozone exceedances during the shoulder season. However, EPA recognizes that States may wish to further restrict the times during which ethanol blended into RFG would receive credit toward the renewable oxygenate requirement in order to address their unique air quality problems. As a result, EPA will extend the non-commingling season, during which oxygenates such as ethanol which demonstrate commingling-related increases in RVP will not receive credit toward the renewable oxygenate requirement, to any or all covered areas within a State at the State's request, subject to certain limitations as discussed below. California is not subject to the preemption of state and local fuel controls under section 211(c)(4) of the Act and, therefore, has broad flexibility in adopting its own state fuel control programs. While other states are subject to these provisions, they can also implement their own fuel control programs if they are approved as part of their state implementation plan (SIP) as being necessary to attain the national ambient air quality standards. As a result, the states could take action on their own without petitioning EPA to modify its program. However, this petition provision allows the states the additional flexibility of having the federal fuel control program modified (in this limited manner) to adjust to their unique air quality needs. The request for extension of the non-commingling season must be signed by the Governor of the State for which the extension is to apply. The petition must include evidence demonstrating that each of four criteria have been met. First, the petition must include data collected subsequent to the implementation of the renewable oxygenate program showing that an increase in oxygenates which produce commingling-related RVP increases (such as ethanol) has occurred in the fuel sold in the petitioning State during the shoulder season, and that this increase is likely to continue. Second, the petition must include evidence demonstrating a pattern of violations during the shoulder season of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards over the previous three years, based on ozone monitoring data, which would warrant the extension being requested. In effect, this second criterion would require that the pattern of ozone violations extend into the shoulder season. Third, the petition must include an analysis demonstrating that the pattern of ozone violations is likely to continue even with implementation of all other ozone air quality control measures and programs currently planned by the State. Fourth, the petition must demonstrate that its findings were made by the Governor through a process that was responsive to public input and that included public notice and an opportunity for a public hearing. These provisions are intended to provide States with air quality concerns the ability to prevent any direct or indirect increase in VOC emissions during the non-summer season, while simultaneously providing assurance that any such extension is granted only for those areas where restrictions on blending ethanol and other commingling oxygenates may help address a genuine air quality problem. Once a valid petition is received satisfying the noted criteria, EPA will publish a notice in the Federal Register and tentatively establish the non-commingling season as requested by the governor and the effective date for the new restrictions on blending of commingling oxygenates. These restrictions will take effect on the first day of the next complete non-commingling season beginning one full year after the petition is received. If a petition is received within three months of the publication of the notice in the Federal Register which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator either that the four criteria were not met or that the change to the non-commingling season is not feasible by the effective date in the notice, EPA retains the right to either reject the State's request for an extension or extend the effective date by up to two additional years, based on analysis of the information contained in both petitions (the State petition and the opposing petition). For example, a satisfactory request to extend the non-commingling season to encompass April which is received by the Administrator on April 20 of, say, 1997 would take effect on April 1, 1999 if no opposing petitions were submitted. Any changes in the duration of the non-commingling season as a result of these provisions will be enforced at the terminal, as discussed in section IV. It should be noted that the criteria discussed above imply that the non-commingling season will not be extended prior to 1997 for any State. H. Program Benefits The reformulated gasoline program promulgated December 15, 1993 will increase fossil energy use due to the need to reduce RVP, the increased production and use of oxygenates, and fuel economy losses resulting from fuel reformulation (as discussed in 59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994, and the Regulatory Impact Analysis found in Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;12). As explained below, the use of renewable oxygenates in reformulated gasoline under the renewable oxygenate program being promulgated today should reduce the fossil energy used by the reformulated gasoline program, particularly in the long term. Today's renewable oxygenate program also helps assure that the RFG program is compatible with long-running national policies and programs to obtain the benefits associated with the use of renewable fuels and could, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, result in decreased imports of MTBE. Furthermore, the renewable oxygenate requirement will help assure that the environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program will be achieved and has the potential to enhance those benefits, as discussed more fully below. And finally, the renewable oxygenate program offers the potential for reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the future as more efficient renewable oxygenate production technologies are introduced.
