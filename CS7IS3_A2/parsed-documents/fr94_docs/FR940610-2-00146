FR940610-2-00146 FR940610-2-00073 On September 13, 1993, the Licensee responded to the Demand for Information indicating that he did not intend to perform licensed activities or to use the strontium-90 source in his possession, or one in anyone else's possession. Further, in a telephone conversation on June 2, 1994, with Mr. Charles M. Hosey of the NRC Region II office, Dr. Velasquez agreed to the provisions and to the issuance of this Confirmatory Order. I find that the Licensee's commitments as set forth in that conversation are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these commitments the public health and safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments in the telephone call of June 2, 1994 be confirmed by this Order. IV Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 81, 161b, 161i, 160o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations at 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR parts 30 and 35, it is hereby ordered that: 1. For a period of three years from the date of this Confirmatory Order, Guillermo Velasquez, M.D., shall not supervise or engage in any way in NRC-licensed activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities which are conducted pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licensees conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20. 2. For a period of three years from the date of this Order, Dr. Velasquez shall provide a copy of this Order to any prospective employer who engages in NRC-licensed activities (as defined in 1. above) prior to his acceptance of employment with such prospective employer. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the employer is aware of Dr. Velasquez' prohibition from engaging in NRC-licensed activities. 3. The first time Guillermo Velasquez, M.D., is employed in NRC licensed activities following the three year prohibition, he shall notify the Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, 101 Marietta Street, NW., suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia 30323, prior to engaging in NRC licensed activities including activities under an Agreement State license when activities under that license are conducted in areas of NRC jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20. The notice shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the NRC or Agreement State licensee and the location where licensed activities will be performed. The Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon a showing by the Licensee of good cause. V Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order, other than the Licensee, may request a hearing within 20 days of the date of its issuance. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at same address, and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, 101 Marietta Street, NW., suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia 30323 and to the Licensee. If such a person requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d). If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Confirmatory Order should be sustained. In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in section V above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 3rd day of June 1994. James Lieberman, Director, Office of Enforcement.
