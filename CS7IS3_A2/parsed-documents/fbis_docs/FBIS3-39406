You have been described as a "lustful" person and an "agent." Can you describe how you feel as you prepare to leave Turkey? [Chernyshev] I told myself when I arrived in Turkey that I was "a man first, then a politician and diplomat." I still feel the same. My lengthy stay is described in Russia as a "forgotten mission." But I have become very familiar with Ankara. Relations between Turkey and Russia have always been favorable, despite the reports that have been published in various newspapers. Of course, I have been troubled by the reports that were published against me. Such is the fate of diplomats. My new appointment is a promotion. I will visit Turkey frequently because my field of study is the Black Sea, Caucasus, Central Asia, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. [passage omitted] [NOKTA] Russia has moved to redeploy the troops it withdrew from the independent republics. Moscow recently decided to dispatch troops to Georgia and establish bases there. Does Russia wish to reestablish its former strength in the region? [Chernyshev] True, we withdrew our military forces from the republics in the Caucasus some time ago. Of course, we did not withdraw them all. The disintegration of the former Soviet Union left those republics without military forces. They do not have their own armies right now. Their security problems must be solved. Agreements have been reached with those republics at their request. Turkey has similar agreements with the United States. In accordance with those agreements and on the basis of the consent of the CIS republics, the Russian border guards have assumed the responsibility of guarding their borders in Central Asia. That must not be seen as an imposition by Russia. The countries concerned will meet Russia's expenses one way or another at some point. That means guarding borders will not be free. The repayment may not be in the form of cash. It may be in the form of particular convenient measures. Several newspapers have claimed that Russia's approach is aimed against Turkey and other countries. That is not true. Russia's military units have not been deployed for an offensive purpose. Russia will maintain a symbolic presence of 23,000 troops in the Caucasus. [NOKTA] You said in a statement two years ago that "you are afraid of the pan-Turkic ideology." Do you still fear that ideology? Isn't the pan-Slavic ideology a threat? [Chernyshev] Aggressive nationalist and separatist trends existed in the past. Unfortunately, they still exist now. The pan-Slavic, pan-Arab, and pan-Turkic ideologies, including fundamentalism, remain. Placing these extreme trends under control is very important. We have a common understanding with Turkey on that. We are prepared to cooperate to struggle against extreme trends. [NOKTA] Can you comment on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's approach? [Chernyshev] As far as the pan-Slavic, pan-Russian, and pan-Nazi trends are concerned, Zhirinovskiy can be regarded as an example. His statements conflict with our official foreign policy. They have nothing in common. His views are not binding on Russia. But they will be considered. As far as politics are concerned, Zhirinovskiy has no horizon or perspective. He has gained popularity because of the problems created by reforms. Compared with the work the political parties carried out to explain the differences among them during the election campaign in Russia, Zhirinovskiy's campaign was very rudimentary. While waiting for a miracle amid the difficulties at the time, the people voted for that primitive [ilkel] man. But he has only 64 of the 450 seats in parliament. Zhirinovskiy's party has no serious officials. Literally speaking, he is a one-man show. [NOKTA] Reports say he will visit Turkey soon. What does he expect to achieve through his visit? He has said Russia has a dangerous weapon that is more effective than a nuclear bomb. Is that true? [Chernyshev] Does such a weapon exist in the world? No, Russia has no such weapon. Zhirinovskiy is just talking. That's all. Not only has he spoken against Turkey, but against several other countries. This has harmed Russia's relations abroad. I have no information on his visit to Turkey. But I believe we should also work with him. We must understand him. He sometimes says he "loves Turkey." But he also says he is "opposed to Turkey." You have similar officials in Turkey. But I talk to officials like him. [NOKTA] Can you comment on the common interests between Turkey and Russia and on where things clash? [Chernyshev] Turkey has agreed that Russia has long-standing and wide-ranging interests in its relations with the CIS and the republics in Central Asia in the political, economic, and cultural fields. Russia has agreed that Turkey has gradually increasing interests in the region. No clash between the interests of Turkey and Russia can be allowed to take place. Any inclination by either country to move the other out of the region will be obstructed. [NOKTA] Foreign Minister Kozyrev has said that the clashes in the Balkan region and the tension created by religious differences may kindle a third world war. And a difference of opinion exists between Turkey and Russia on Bosnia. [Chernyshev] We have condemned the massacre in Bosnia. No national war based on religious differences is being fought in that country. The fighting has been caused by the mistakes of the past. Extremist elements must be blamed for the war. Everyone wants to be independent. But they all lived together in the past. I agree that the sides did not enjoy equal rights. The Bosnians are of Serbian origin. But they adopted the Islamic faith 500 years ago. Most of them were atheists under communist rule. Basically, we are Orthodox people. But you should ask who follows the Orthodox faith in Moscow? The people would not know. It is an artificial separation. Independence is very costly for the peoples. Independence without funds and resources will create problems. How will the minorities exist? Independence is very costly. [NOKTA] Should the concept be abandoned? [Chernyshev] What should be considered first is the issue of territorial integrity. That should be followed by minority and human rights. There will be upheaval if everyone wants to become independent. A third world war may break out. A serious threat exists. The issue of the independence of Bosnia and Karabakh may cause upheaval in the world. So a threat exists. [NOKTA] There was upheaval in the former Soviet Union. Has that threat been warded off? [Chernyshev] The disintegration of the Soviet Union was a serious mistake. Everyone is suffering now. An effort is being made to correct that mistake. Please forgive me for saying that only stupid people like us are clamoring for "independence." But I have no use for such an independence. The most important thing is to learn to live together. That is difficult to achieve. Such independence may be a concept in principle but it should not apply in practice.
