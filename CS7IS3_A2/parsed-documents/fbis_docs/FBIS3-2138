Six corrupt elements were punished. Wang Lixin was sentenced to death according to the law with political rights deprived for life on charge of embezzlement. He was executed recently in Bayannur League. Li Junping, guilty of embezzlement, who surrendered to the police with a tremendous amount of money, was leniently sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve; and Liu Xirong and Xie Hailong was sentenced to life imprisonment with political rights deprived for life and 13-year imprisonment, respectively. Rui Liuyuan and Jiang Liguo, who took bribes, were sentenced to life imprisonment with political rights deprived for life and a nine-year imprisonment, respectively. Wang Lixin, former accountant of the savings bank of the Wuyuan County agricultural bank in Bayannur League, embezzled more than 210,000 yuan from the funds of the bank and the savings of the bank depositors from February 1991 to May 1992. He used the money for gambling and drugs and returned merely some 30,000 yuan after the case was discovered, incurring a loss of more than 170,000 yuan to the state. Li Junping, former accountant of the Delingshan office of the Urad Middle and Rear Joint Banner agricultural bank in Bayannur League, colluded with jobless Liu Xirong and Xie Hailong to embezzle more than 860,000 yuan from the bank from December 1992 to April 1993 by means of "receipts of postal money transfer of the region" he owned. He surrendered himself to the police with 380,000 yuan of the embezzlement money in June 1993 and returned all the money later when the case was discovered. Rui Liuyuan, former deputy director of the transportation section of the Baotou city aluminum plant, took advantage of business ties with a certain unit in Jiangsu Province to abuse power to sell 140 tonnes of aluminum ingot with the approval of Jiang Liguo, deputy director of the plant. He took bribes totaling 200,000 yuan, of which 155,000 yuan was taken by himself and 45,000 yuan given to Jiang. In addition, Jiang also owned $20,000, whose sources were not clear. Wang Lixin, Xie Hailong, and Rui Liuyuan refused to accept the first rule and lodged an appeal. After the trial of the autonomous regional higher people's court, the appeal was rejected and the original rule was maintained.
