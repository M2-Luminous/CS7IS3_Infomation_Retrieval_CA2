The command says that, in line with the Karadzic-Akashi agreement, the Serbian forces are today continuing to withdraw to 3 km from the center of Gorazde, while heavy weapons have been withdrawn to the agreed distance of 20 km. [passage omitted] Serbian military sources say that scattered Muslim forces are withdrawing from the center of Gorazde and regrouping in Orahovica, northwest of the town, probably planning to link up with their forces on Mount Igman near Sarajevo.
