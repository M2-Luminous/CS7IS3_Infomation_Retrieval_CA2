FR940204-1-00013 FR940204-1-00001 F. Review Under Section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Authorization Act Section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 788) imposes certain requirements when a proposed rule contains commercial standards or authorizes or requires the use of such standards. The commercial standards proposed today incorporate commercial standards to measure the energy consumption and range of electric vehicles. The commercial standards are the Society of Automotive Engineers Electric Vehicle Energy Consumption and Range Test Procedure J1634. DOE has evaluated the promulgation of these standards in light of the public participation criteria of section 32(b). The Department is unable to conclude whether development of these standards fully complied with section 32(b) regarding the manner of public participation. Finally, as required by section 32(c), DOE will consult with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission concerning the impact of these standards on competition, prior to prescribing final test procedures. G. Review Under Executive Order 12778 Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency subject to Executive Order 12291 to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. The DOE certifies that today's proposed rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 474: Electric power, Energy conservation, Incorporation by reference, Motor vehicles, Research. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, DOE proposes to amend part 474 of chapter II of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below. Issued in Washington, DC, on January 14, 1994. Christine A. Ervin, Assistant Secretary, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
