He was replaced by a principal inspector of the Treasury, Mampassi Tsika, the radio added, without giving the reasons for the dismissal. A senior civil servant close to the Congolese Presidency told AFP that the government accused Mr. Ayina of the "centralization of power and an absence of transparency in his activities." The public treasury collects about 7 billion CFA francs (70 million French francs) every month, representing regular income and oil royalties for the Congo. Several trade unions have recently denounced the poor management of state incomes and the abusive expenses of public treasury funds.
