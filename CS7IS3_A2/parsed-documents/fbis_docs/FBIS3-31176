There have been 40 book shops in Pristine but now there are 6 or 7 where the booksellers are Serbian or Montenegrin and only publications in Serbian-Croat language can be bought. The present attack is not the first one against the Albanian book. The chauvinistic Serbian insanity is going on and it is trying to destroy everything in the Albanian culture and art fields.
