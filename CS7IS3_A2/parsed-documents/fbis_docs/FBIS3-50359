[Huebel] Mr. President, there are many unsolved problems between Poland and Slovakia: We have only nine border crossings, while there were 40 of them before the war. Slovak korunas cannot be legally exchanged in Polish banks and, vice versa, your zlotys cannot be exchanged in Slovak banks. Neither the "Carpathian Euroregion" nor the "Tatras Euroregion" projects have made any progress. A joint Polish-Slovak bank still does not exist, and signatures are also missing on the treaty on prevention of double taxation and protection of investments. We have not correlated our customs policy. When are these problems going to be solved? [Walesa] I said once that, by the year 2000, Poland will remove all borders that separate our country from its neighbors. The border should be marked only by good directional signs and computers so that every traveler can choose the best alternative route for the remainder of his trip. I am doing everything in my power so that no border stands between us by the year 2000. Only, we must even our standards by then. People are like communicating vessels: If there is a difference in levels, a Niagara Falls forms. He who has seen them knows how the water thunders, falls heavily, and finally shatters. If the levels match, however, there is no movement, and it is completely safe. That is one of the reasons we should well consider our differences, so that we can reach this safety. If we even up wages, prices, standards, roads, and computers, our unification will be so fast we will not even notice it. Therefore, let us collaborate to even up the standards of our communities, and the border will not be needed. [Huebel] I will ask a somewhat unpleasant question now: Why do the representatives of our countries--Poland and Slovakia--meet so infrequently? After all, the Slovak Republic has been here for more than a year, you have not come for an official visit, the Polish prime minister has not been there, either, and this visit by President Kovac is the first significant visit in our mutual relations. Will that be amended? [Walesa] Yes, of course. I have said many times that both you and we have numerous domestic problems now and are engrossed in them. It has to be kept in mind, however, that we are building an economic and legal structure, and the presidents and the other officials have so many worries that they do not have time for anything else. We will try to rectify this, but we can manage only if we succeed in solving our problems. We will then have time also for "external" issues. [Huebel] Mr. President, would it not be possible to use precisely the Polish-Slovak cooperation as an example to the West that something exists here and that the Visegrad Group has good prospects because of this cooperation? [Walesa] Of course, I take it! The situation calls for this. It calls for our initiating something. It calls for our relations to be the best, better than between other nations. Again, however, it must be done. There is no doubt that the politicians and the leaders understand each other. We really get along well and speak as in a single voice. On the other hand, we have no idea of technical, ministerial, and directorial solutions--i.e., of a technical concept how to do all of this. Unfortunately, so far we have not found a method to accelerate it all. There are no contradictions; we just do not know. [Huebel] The stability of our region and the success of the cooperation of the Visegrad Four depends to a great degree on Hungarian-Slovak relations. How do you feel about the problem of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia and the "Gabcikovo" issue? [Walesa] This problem is here to stay. If the process of European integration were faster, this problem would not exist. That is because the European principles and various treaties state that everyone has the right to freedom and his characteristic features--but within the borders of integral Europe. Under such circumstances, no one would attempt a division, even if certain groups wanted to preserve their specific features, but, as I say, in a single house! Because these attempts at agglomeration are not very successful, new attempts at division ensue. Therefore, I believe that we will be able to enter Europe together, rather than go on subdividing. These partitions are not necessary.
