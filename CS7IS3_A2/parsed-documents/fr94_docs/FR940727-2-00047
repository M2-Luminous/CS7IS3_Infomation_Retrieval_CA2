FR940727-2-00047 FR940727-2-00026 Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from respondents L&S Research Corporation and Scott Chinery. The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order. Body Building Products The Commission's complaint charges that the respondents deceptively advertised Cybergenics Total Body Building System and Cybergenics for Hard Gainers, two body building products. According to the complaint, the respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that either or both body building products: (1) cause users to lose more body fat and gain more muscle than non-users; (2) cause users to lose body fat and gain muscle more rapidly than non-users; (3) cause users to gain more muscle than users of other body building products; (4) have been demonstrated by scientific research to cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (5) work for all people; and (6) are new and unique. Weight Loss Products The Commission's complaint also charges that the respondents deceptively advertised there weight loss products, Cybergenics CyberTrim, Cybergenics Mega-Fat Burner, and Cybergenics QuickTrim. According to the complaint, the respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that one or more of the wright loss products: (1) cause users to lose body fat and weight more rapidly than non-users; (2) cause users to lose weight and lose or burn more body fat than non-users; (3) cause users to lose more body fat and weight than users of all other weight loss products; (4) cause users to lose weight more rapidly than the users of all other weight loss products; (5) are superior to other appetite suppressants; (6) suppress hunger and the biochemical message stimulated by the catabolism of fat; (7) cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (8) contain an ingredient, chromium picolinate, that has been clinically proven to reduce fat and lower cholesterol; (9) are new and unique; (10) cause users to maintain weight loss longer than non-users; (11) cause maturing women to lose more weight than non-users of the product; (12) are easy to use; and (13) have been demonstrated by scientific evidence to cause users to lose more fat and weight, and to gain more muscle, than non-users. Use of Testimonials The Commission's complaint also charges that statements and depictions, including ``before'' and ``after'' pictures, in the respondents' advertisements for their body building and weight loss products, represent that the testimonials from consumers who use the advertised product reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members of the public who use the products. According to the complaint, the respondents did not have a reasonable basis for this representation. In addition, the complaint alleges that the use of a picture of a man in an advertisement for Cybergenics Total Body Building System ``before'' and ``after'' he used the product for six months is false and misleading. The man pictured in the advertisement, according to the complaint, was a champion body builder prior to the time when the ``before'' picture was taken and, therefore, is not typical of users of the product, and his results as shown in the ``after'' picture are not typical of the experience of ordinary members of the public who use the product.
