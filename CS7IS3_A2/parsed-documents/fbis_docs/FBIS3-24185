They were referring to the scheduled dedication of a pillar--a "symbol of reconciliation"--in Volgograd on 14 May, almost half a century after the end of the war, in accordance with a Russian-Austrian agreement. The campaign against the monument, according to the organizers of the press conference, is being joined by the whole leftwing and communist press. Petitions have already been printed. Signatures will be collected by the party obkom. Activists will also go to enterprises to collect signatures. An open letter from the Central Council of the Officers Union "To the Veterans of the Battle of Stalingrad, Public Veterans Organizations, Patriotic Movements, and Patriots of Russia" is being distributed to protest "the erection of a monument that is hostile to our people." A delegation from Austria, headed by Vice President Walter Seledetz of the "50th Anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad" committee and Vice President Hugo Mueller of the "Black Cross" society, was in Volgograd at the time. The "Black Cross," which is leading the search for the remains of soldiers who fell in battle, will also be erecting the pillar in Volgograd. It is supposed to have the following inscription: "This monument is dedicated to all of the victims of the Battle of Stalingrad of 1942-1943. It is a reminder of the suffering of the soldiers and civilians who fell here. The monument was erected with contributions from the Austrian people. We ask that the soldiers from Germany, Austria, and all other countries who fell here be granted eternal peace on Russian land." The Austrian delegation held a press conference to voice the same request for "eternal peace on Russian land." There was one other interesting detail: The "Black Cross," according to Hugo Mueller, has learned the identity of all of the Soviet soldiers who died in Austria. The number turned out to be much higher than the figures in official records. More than a thousand requests have already been received from people wishing to attend the dedication ceremony for the "symbol of reconciliation" on 14 May. The organizers of the protest campaign are alleging that the Volgograd administration decided in secret to erect the monument and to locate it in the square in the center of the city. "There was nothing secret about it," Volgograd Administration Deputy Chief Svetlana Antonova responded. "There was constant coverage of the talks and the preparations for the dedication ceremony in the local press. Apparently, however, the time is right for a political campaign." The leaders of the "opposition" to the reconciliation monument are not certain they have the support of the majority of people in Volgograd, however, and are willing to compromise: They would agree to a monument, and even a chapel, outside the city limits. I do not wish to offend the veterans who bore the weight of the war, but will the "symbol of reconciliation" and the request for "eternal peace on Russian land" really diminish their distinction? Nevertheless, the constant propaganda has even divided the veterans themselves. At the end of last week Volgograd Mayor Yuriy Chekhov met representatives of public organizations and political parties to discuss the issue of the reconciliation monument. The appeals of the mayor and democratic parties for the avoidance of confrontations were rejected. A new phase of the campaign began--a move to the exertion of strong pressure on government officials.
