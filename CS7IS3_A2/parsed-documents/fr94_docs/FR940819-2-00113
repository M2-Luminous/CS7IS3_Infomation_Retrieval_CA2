FR940819-2-00113 FR940819-2-00067 The administrative law judge found that on January 13, 1989, before the Albany County Court of the State of New York, Respondent was convicted of one felony count of a violation of falsifying business records in the first degree, which falsification referred to the dispensation of controlled substances. Respondent was sentenced to five years probation which included a provision that he not dispense any controlled substances from his office. Subsequently, on November 12, 1990, Respondent voluntarily surrendered his DEA Certificate of Registration, AB7544314, for cause. On May 29, 1991, Respondent and the New York State Board of Health entered a stipulation and order which found that during the period February 1983 through November 1987, Respondent dispensed 9,850 dosage units of Schedule II controlled substances without preparing a prescription; failed to make records of dispensing 5,060 dosage units of controlled substances, and had made 32 false entries regarding controlled substances in nine patient care records. Respondent was assessed a civil penalty of $30,000, of which $15,000 was stayed. On January 22, 1992, the Commissioner, New York Education Department, Board of Regents, granted Respondent's application for a consent order with the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct. The consent order suspended Respondent's medical license for a period of six years, stayed execution for five years and placed his license on five years probation. As a result, Respondent was not licensed to practice medicine in the State of New York for a period of one year beginning January 27, 1992. Respondent's medical license was restored on January 28, 1993. At the hearing in this matter, Respondent testified that after his state conviction, he was concerned that his wife not be prosecuted or charged with any violation of law. He stated that his wife, who had also been his office employee, had been sick and was having problems with drugs. There was no indication that Respondent used drugs himself. Respondent claimed that he voluntarily submitted to random drug testing and monitoring, that he never tested positive for drugs; and that he will continue to be monitored for another four years. Respondent stated that it was his opinion that his wife had taken the amphetamines, but he did not know how much. Respondent testified that he attempted to counsel his wife for chemical dependency, and he did not get her help earlier due to the fact that he had a very high profile psychiatric practice in town. His wife subsequently got involved with a rehabilitative program, now holds a top nursing job, and has been ``clean'' from drugs for a number of years. Respondent conceded that he made a mistake in the way he handled things and stated that it was an error in judgment to stonewall or attempt to cover up his wife's abuse of controlled substances. Respondent felt that he paid for this mistake and is still doing so. The administrative law judge found that Respondent is currently employed as a staff psychiatrist for the State of New York. Respondent presented testimony from his peers and supervisor that he was well-liked, extremely motivated, hard-working, knowledgeable, and that he was considered exceptionally competent, an excellent clinician, and made positive contributions to the state institution and his patients. Respondent's supervisor was of the opinion that Respondent could competently assume the responsibilities of a DEA registration. Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), the Deputy Administrator may revoke a registration if he determines that such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors shall be considered:
