This was revealed by several staff members of the party. The prime minister so far has said he is for a "moderate multiparty system," but he appears to have come to think that if the coalition parties are to continue in power by defeating the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the next general election conducted under the heiritsu-sei combining the single-seat district system and the proportional representation system, there is no choice but for the coalition parties to come together and form a new party. This concept on forming a large floor group shows that the prime minister is changing his course toward the "two-party system" advocated by people like Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. This can be said to be proof also that his differences of views with people like Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who support a moderate multiparty system, are becoming prominent. There is no doubt that this matter will have a large impact on the political scene. It was early this month that the prime minister disclosed his concept of forming a large floor group. He instructed General Secretary Arai and other officials to conduct a study on it. According to a JNP staff member, the prime minister asked: "Can we not form a large floor group by combining Shinseito, Komeito, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] as we are forming a joint floor group with Sakigake [Harbinger] now?" Subsequently, General Secretary Arai reported this to an informal meeting of the JNP Diet members on 16 February. But by that time it was known that the prime minister had decided on an early cabinet reshuffle in order to remove Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from his post. As a result, the Diet members in the meeting were more interested in maintaining the joint floor group with Sakigake, and failed to come up with a conclusion regarding the idea of forming a large floor group. The concept of a large floor group stands on the premise that most of the existing five floor groups will make it through the next general election, gathering around Hosokawa as their axis, even though some of their members may fail. While this concept ties in directly with the idea of a new political party being promoted by people like Ozawa, it stands against Takemura's idea of "strengthening ties with liberal forces within the LDP, the SDPJ and the DSP, while drawing a line with the two parties -- Shinseito and Komeito." The concept of forming a large floor group is likely to have some influence on the cabinet reshuffle which the prime minister wants to bring about later this month.
