The trial of the 1991 coup organisers was declared over after the Russian State Duma proclaimed an amnesty to the plotters. However, the prosecution appealed against the decision saying that any trial which is already under way is to be completed by passing a guilty or non-guilty verdict. If the verdict is guilty, the accused will then be amnestied.
