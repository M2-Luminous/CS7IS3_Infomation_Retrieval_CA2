Kavtarashvili; UDC 528.344:629.783] [Abstract] Satellite geodesy holds decisive advantages over other forms of geodesy, e.g., coordinates can be transmitted thousands of kilometers very rapidly, and gravitational-field parameters can be ascertained with a relatively small number of ground stations. The accuracy of satellite measurements increased dramatically with the use of satellite altimetry. The Geo-IK satellite is the centerpiece of Russia's space-based geodesy program. It flies in a circular orbit with inclinations of 74� and 83�, with its longitudinal axis aimed at the center of the Earth. The service life of the satellite is less than a year, and one or two are always aloft. The satellite is equipped with a radio altimeter, an electronic interrogator system relay, a timing and signalling system, and laser corner reflectors. The next-generation Geo-IK-2 is under development. The Kosmos-192, a navigation satellite launched in 1967, was followed in 1979 by the Tsikada system. The successful use of low-orbit satellite navigation systems by maritime consumers has attracted attention to satellite navigation. A system that could be used by aviation, maritime vessels, ground-transportation systems, and spacecraft, however, would enable the user to ascertain three spatial coordinates instantaneously, velocity vector, and accurate time without an interrogator. The GLONASS high-orbital navigation system, consisting of 12 satellites in two orbital planes is serving well, but efforts are under way to make it and the GPS system compatible.
