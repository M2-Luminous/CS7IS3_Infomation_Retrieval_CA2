Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev spoke to reporters after meeting with his South Korean colleague, saying that the proposal would be examined in Seoul. He noted that a special group of experts might be formed in the near future to work out a conceptual framework of security in the region. The two defence ministers also discussed problems concerning North Korea. Grachev expressed Russia's worry over North Korea's nuclear programme, saying that it would be best if the Republic continued to adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. He reported that the two sides discussed various ways of putting pressure on North Korea so that it did not abandon the treaty, in order to avoid creating additional security problems for the Korean peninsula and other areas as well. In November 1992, President Boris Yeltsin travelled to Seoul, where he signed an agreement on principles of relations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of South Korea. This document has determined the further development of their bilateral relations, Grachev pointed out. During the current negotiations, the two sides agreed on the necessity of continuing close military cooperation between Russia and South Korea on a higher level, announced Yi Pyong-tae. He said that the talks had revealed a common determination to not permit a worsening of the situation on the Korean peninsula or in North-east Asia as a whole. The danger in this direction comes from North Korea's position on the nuclear question, he declared. "We believe that North Korea should adhere to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and become a full and responsible member of the international community," the South Korean defence minister stated. The military ties between Russia and South Korea will serve as confidence- and security-building measures both between the two countries and on the Korean peninsula, stressed Yi Pyong-tae. If the security of the Korean peninsula is ensured, that will contribute to the security of the whole world, he declared.
