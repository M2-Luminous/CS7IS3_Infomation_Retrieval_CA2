[Selivanov] A criminal gang specializing in the export of enriched uranium produced at CIS countries' nuclear industry facilities was detained during the operation. A total of 240 capsules containing 1.5 kg of radioactive material were confiscated. Of late law-enforcement bodies are increasingly coming up against criminal activities with a clearly pronounced nuclear bias. The impression is that the protection of enterprises producing nuclear components leaves much to be desired. Lowering of the nuclear safety standards is fraught with the most serious consequences in our time. The attempt to smuggle out radioactive material which was foiled in Odessa is another reminder of the urgent need to adopt prompt interstate measures in this area.
