The problems of population, environment, and development have drawn attention from various countries in the world in recent years. To counter the global economic, social, resources, and environmental problems, the Chinese Government took the lead in initiating and convening a ministerial conference on environment and development of developing countries in Beijing in June 1991. In June 1992, the UN held an environment and development summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and adopted the "Rio Declaration on Environment and Development," the "Agenda 21," and other documents. Premier Li Peng attended the summit and, on behalf of the Chinese Government, promised to fulfill the "Agenda 21" and other documents. According to this commitment, 52 departments under the State Council, including the State Planning Commission and the State Science and Technology Commission, jointly worked out "China's Agenda 21," or the "White Paper on China's Population, Environment, and Development in the 21st Century." In line with China's basic conditions and development strategy, the document sets the general strategy, policy, and measures for the coordinated and sustainable development of economy, society, resources, environment, population, and education. It will become a guiding document for China in making its long and mid-term plans for national economic and social development and will form important goals and contents of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the 2010 program. Meanwhile, the document has also demonstrated the Chinese Government's actual action and principled position in earnestly implementing the "Agenda 21." The meeting also discussed and adopted, in principle, the "(Draft) Outline Program of the State Industrial Policies for the 1990s."
