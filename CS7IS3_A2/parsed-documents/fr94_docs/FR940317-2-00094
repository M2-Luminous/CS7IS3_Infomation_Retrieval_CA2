FR940317-2-00094 FR940317-2-00061 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33752; File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Fee Structure for the Mutual Fund Networking Service March 10, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on January 26, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish a revised fee for providing the Mutual Fund Services Networking position files. The proposed fee change will provide for a more equitable allocation of fees among members of NSCC. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In mid 1993, NSCC determined that the initially established fee structure for providing Mutual Fund Services Networking position files was no longer appropriate. On August 18, 1993, NSCC filed a rule change 2 which consisted of a waiver of $99 of the $100 fee charged to members for excess Networking position files. That filing indicated that the waiver would continue while NSCC determined a more appropriate fee. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish a revised fee for the Networking position records. The new fee structure is based on the number of records received by a participating broker and the number of subaccounts the broker maintains on the system. Effective January 1, 1994, for billing in February 1994, the new fee is $1.50 per thousand records received by a broker in excess of the number of subaccounts the broker maintains on Networking. NSCC will not assess a charge when the difference between these numbers is 5000 records or less in a month. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32912 (September 16, 1993), 58 FR 49536 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;12]. The proposed fee change will provide for a more equitable allocation of fees among members, so the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
