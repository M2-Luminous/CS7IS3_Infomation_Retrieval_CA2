A heated debate between factions preceded the approval. Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the lower chamber security committee, who submitted the bills to legislators, noted that the need for their adoption is predetermined by the fact that crime in Russia has substantially changed its forms and substance. According to the chairman, the number of the convicted for bribe- taking substantially decreased as compared with the 1980s, which indicates that legislation is utterly outdated. He stressed at the same time that mobs, using loopholes in the present laws, "influence the adoption of political decisions up to the level of member republics of the Russian Federation". Ilyukhin reported that he has information showing that the underworld is laying hands on 55 per cent of capital and 80 per cent of voting shares in the country. The chairman stressed that the bill was drafted by specialists from the Prosecutor's Office, courts, the tax service, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service. He noted that, in the opinion of foreign experts, measures in the bills aimed at fighting bribe-taking and corruption are "very lenient". Representatives from the Russia's Choice, Yabloko and Russia's Women factions opposed the adoption of the bills in the first reading. Their main arguments were that the bills indicate an extremely broad range of people who can be held responsible for bribe-taking and corruption, while the state should, in fact, ensure control over incomes of the entire population. Ilyukhin's opponents claimed that the mechanism of the bills will not permit to bring to court high-ranking grafters. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) supported the bills on the whole but suggested that they should be finalised, taking into account remarks at today's debate, and adopted in the first reading in the near future. Advocates of the bills noted that their opponents poorly studied the documents and intend to dump them. They also claimed that fight against bribe-taking and corruption should be started from the lowest levels and that all law-breakers should be put in the dock, irrespective of their posts whether he is an engineer at a house- repair administration or a high-ranking politician. LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed a special opinion, noting that the bills are necessary. Nevertheless, their adoption will be useless. "The Duma is not ready to fight corruption in its ranks," he underlined. "Therefore, it cannot fight corruption on a nation-wide scale," he claimed. This notwithstanding, Liberal Democrats voted for the adoption of the bills in the first reading.
