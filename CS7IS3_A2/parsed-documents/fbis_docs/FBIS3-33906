The official, who asked not to be identified, said that if the document is not signed before the month of Ramadan [approximately 10 February] it will mean that the YSP is buying more time to prepare for separation. In his statement to AL-AHRAM, the official expected a violent military confrontation between the two sides if the crisis is not resolved. He noted that YSP media are now paving the way for separation. The official's statement coincided with growing speculation by politicians and observers in Sanaa that the antagonist political forces are preparing to divide Yemen once again into two parts and perhaps more, as Hadhramaut is expected to secede from the southern part. Informed Yemeni sources that asked to remain anonymous said separation is now a matter of time and of who will bear the responsibility before history and the Yemeni people. The sources said: The two poles of government, the GPC and the YSP, are accusing each other not only of escalating the crisis but of actually preparing for military confrontation if separation intentions come true. The sources said that before inaugurating the Hadhramaut oil project, the YSP raised the cost of the project by $300 million without the Council of Ministers or the Presidential Council knowing about it. The additional money, according to the sources, was used to buy weapons and ammunition in preparation for the possible confrontation. For its part, the YSP accused the GPC of buying some $20 million worth of weapons and ammunition from Romania without the knowledge of the prime minister, who belongs to the YSP.
