SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 23, 1994, the Service published a Federal Register notice announcing the availability of draft stock assessments for Service species (i.e., polar bear, Pacific walrus, northern sea otter in Alaska, West Indian manatees, California sea otter, and northern sea otter in Washington State) and the PBR workshop report (59 FR 43353). The stock assessments are required under new Section 117 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act as amended in 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;238). A summary of the draft stock assessments specifying geographical range, regional designation, minimum abundance estimate, PBR level, estimated annual average human-caused mortality, and whether or not the stock would be regarded as strategic or nonstrategic was included in the Federal Register notice. The PBR workshop, composed of National Marine Fisheries Service and Service scientists, was convened to develop an initial approach for promoting consistent national interpretation of parameters to be used in draft stock assessments, including the calculation of PBR levels. The initial comment period for draft stock assessments for Service species and PBR workshop was scheduled to end on November 21, 1994. In response to concern that the public comment period was inadequate, given the scope of the issues surrounding the stock assessments and the PBR workshop reports, the Service hereby extends the comment period and welcomes comments received by December 1, 1994. Subsequent to the close of the extended period, the Service will provide copies of public comments to members of the Alaska, Pacific, and Atlantic Scientific Review Groups, as appropriate, for their consideration prior to the next scheduled meeting of these groups. Comments must be received in the appropriate office as identified in the ADDRESSES Section above by December 1, 1994, to be fully considered. Therefore, those submitting comments close to that date should FAX their comments or call to ensure receipt of their comments. Dated: November 8, 1994. Mollie H. Beattie, Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28230 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;M
