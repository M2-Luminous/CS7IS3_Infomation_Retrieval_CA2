Having established a Tariff and Customs Council, on Wednesday the ministers will approve the proposed tariff rates for some products and on Thursday, as members of the Economic Council, they will discuss the mechanism for joining the trade agreement. A source close to the meeting said that "the region paid $1.6 billion in tariffs in recent months." Economy Ministers Delmer Urbizo of Honduras, Enrique Cordova of El Salvador, and Pablo Pereira of Nicaragua participated in the discussions. Costa Rican Economy Minister Roberto Rojas and Guatemalan Economy Minister Eduardo Gonzalez also participated, and they will discuss options to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States, which could begin with parity for some benefits of the North American treaty. The ministers will analyze the report titled "Commercial Relations Between Central America and the United States," to which NOTIMEX had access. The report establishes the negotiation of "parity" for some benefits or "full-rights" participation in the trilateral treaty. According to the report prepared by consultant Harold Rodas upon request from the UN Development Program (UNDP) and the Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration (SIECA), "the United States' commercial policy towards the region is not clearly defined." The area's concern is apparent, and that is why efforts are being made to maintain the tariff benefits received from the United States and even to expand them in view of the benefits Mexico obtains by commercial agreements since NAFTA became effective in January. The report asks: "When will Central America break the chains of dependency on a preferential system? Is the region prepared for the challenges of reciprocity?" According to Rodas, these questions arise because there "is an abyss between the political will and factual reality." Regarding the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), through which the United States imports 4,300 duty free products from 139 countries and territories, the officials will review the 15-month extension approved by the United States which ends on 30 September. This preferential scheme seeks to sponsor beneficiary countries' economic and industrial development, and its legal base on a worldwide level is derived from Article IV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The beneficiaries can export eligible products duty free to the United States, as long as they comply with norms of origin requirements -- above all having a national value-added rate of 35 percent and a certificate of origin. The UNDP-SIECA report, presented to the ministers on Wednesday, also examines the so-called Caribbean Basin Initiative sponsored by the United States. The initiative's goal is to increase local and foreign investments in non-traditional sectors, support economic diversification, and expand exports. The preferential system is more extensive than the GSP because no conditions are set on competition or graduality. However, the initiative excludes certain important categories, such as textiles, oil and oil derivatives, canned tuna, shoes, and leather articles. A country can lose its Caribbean Basin Initiative benefits by not cooperating in the struggle against drug trafficking, being communist, or expropriating U.S. citizens' assets, businesses, societies, or associations. The benefits may also be lost if a country does not maintain an extradition treaty with the United States. The Central American economy ministers will analyze measures against disloyal competition implemented by different countries. The officials began talks on Wednesday following a detailed report by SIECA Secretary Rafael Rodriguez Loucel on the 31st SIECA Directors Meeting, which ended yesterday.
