However, the opposition People's Front abstained, its leader, Zenon Pozniak, said. State Secretary for Commonwealth Affairs Vladimir Zalomay said the ratification "will be of huge importance for shaping the country's foreign policy and become a new step by Minsk on the way to consolidating the CIS and raising its efficiency." For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who also supports the ratification of the CIS basic agreement, dwelt upon the prospects of relations with Russia and a monetary union with Moscow. He said that "despite all difficulties, Belarus has an economic potential enabling it to negotiate with Russia on equal terms." The Prime Minister said that some of the Russian politicians who see the union as a handout to Belarus were wrong. He said Belarus had never lived at the cost of others and that the monetary union would not resolve its problems but create an economic environment for removing artificial barriers to bilateral cooperation. Kebich strongly attacked Zenon Pozniak's accusations of Russian imperialism carried by the parliament-sponsored NARODNYA GAZETA newspaper. The Prime Minister said that an overwhelming majority of Belarusians opposed to the country's self-isolation wanted a union with Russia.
