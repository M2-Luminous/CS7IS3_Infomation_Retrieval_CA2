The Cuban president invited the 215 emigrants from 29 countries to a reception following the closing session of the meeting that began on 22 April on an initiative by the Cuban Foreign Ministry. Alfonso confirmed the invitation during a meeting with the press, during which he reported on the participation of Vice President Carlos Lage, who spoke about the current economic situation and the country's outlook, which has worsened with the disappearance of the European socialist bloc and the tightening of the U.S. economic blockade. According to Alfonso, Lage said the Cuban emigrants will not be kept from investing in the island, but said that future meetings will determine the mechanisms that will be applied in that regard.
