[Padulina] It is not a secret that Russian-Baltic dialogue is difficult. This is how ambassador (Vasiliy Svirin), the head of the Russian delegation, estimates negotiations with Estonia. [Begin (Svirin) recording] It is difficult for me to speak about the prospects of the negotiating process in 1994 because I am a head of the state delegation of Russia at the negotiations with the Republic of Estonia. The fact is that recently the Estonian side has been aiming to protract the negotiating process. Thus, a question is arising whether the Estonian delegation is going to stop the negotiations. We have the basis for such thoughts. On 17 November the Russian delegation made a proposal to hold the next round of negotiations in Moscow in the middle of December 1993. December is over but we have no answer despite our reminders. Thus, at the Russian-Estonian negotiations we have the same situation as at sport competitions: The ball is in the court of the Estonian team; we are waiting for its response. [end recording] [Padulina] There is no such tension with Latvia as with Estonia. But there are the same issues at the agenda of negotiations. Ambassador (Aleksey Zotov) comments on them. [Begin (Zotov) recording] The state delegation of Russia believes that the main issues of the negotiating process with Latvia are to complete the coordination of all documents which will determine the legal basis for the withdrawal of Russian troops. And the second series of problems is connected with the protection of rights of the Russian-speaking population. The Latvian leadership did not want to speak about this at our negotiations. They explained this by the fact that they did not have a law on the citizenship. Now this law has been introduced and is under discussion. We would like to hope that the fate of more than 1,000,000 Russian-speaking people who are permanent residents in this country will be decided according to the standards which Latvia has undertaken to respect when it joined the United Nations and the Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe. [end recording] [Padulina] As far as the most difficult question -- the withdrawal of Russian troops -- is concerned, we managed to reach agreement with Lithuania on this issue. Ambassador (Viktor Isakov) comments on the priorities in the Russian-Lithuanian relations now. [Begin (Isakov) recording] I think that the negotiating process with the Lithuanian republic is going on normally. We have reached certain results. However, despite the signing of a trade and economic agreement with the Lithuanian Republic and an agreement on vehicle transport, our citizens and our organizations still have some difficulties in Kaliningrad when they cross Lithuanian territory. Because of this, the main problem will be to elaborate and sign an agreement on mutual visits and an agreement on transit which would replace provisional rules which exist now. We hope that the negotiations will be resumed in the near future. [end recording] [Padulina] I spoke with these three Russian diplomats on telephone and asked them the same question: What do you expect in the new year? And I received rather different answers. As a whole they reflect the difficulties in relations between Russian and the Baltic countries. But all the same, I believe that the main reason is the accumulated estrangement and mistrust toward each other. Will we be able to have normal inter-governmental relations? In spite of everything the new year gives us such hopes.
