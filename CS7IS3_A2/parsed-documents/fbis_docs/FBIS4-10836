Within the ensemble of measures adopted so far, self-employment and the resolution that regulates it comprise an important step in stimulating and promoting each individual's creative initiative and in resolving a number of community problems that the state currently cannot resolve. Historically -- because of organizational reasons, lack of control, and the absence of alertness and rationale -- these problems have been resolved in neither an efficient manner nor in keeping with the community's needs. This process of developing self-employment is a clear signal of flexibility and pragmatism. It expresses something deeper -- that is, to address and resolve economic problems through equitable methods without returning to administrative and bureaucratic styles that have already been shown not to work. The measure's economic significance will be proven by its ability to absorb part of the official and unrecorded unemployment the economic crisis and adjustment measures have aggravated and will predictably aggravate in the future; to reduce the fiscal burden and its impact on the GNP; to stimulate small enterprises and services; and, in turn, to discreetly improve the people's standard of living. Moreover, this measure is greater than the sum of its parts; it is important because of the synergy it can generate when implemented along with other measures already in place or measures that will be implemented in the future. We must not overlook that like every other economic measure, this measure, along with its benefits, will also generate a series of disagreeable effects that must be corrected in due time. The following analysis is only a first draft of the study of a very new phenomena that ultimately and undoubtably will benefit the economy and Cuban society. The promulgation of the decree-law overrides and somehow negates an old and tiresome controversy (in Cuba) concerning the theoretical question of whether or not monetary-commercial relations should be used to build socialism. Consequently, the resolution on self-employment means promoting private initiative to satisfy the needs of the population based on market economy mechanisms. Likewise, any automatic association between the existence of private enterprise and the market with social anarchy is also proven wrong by recognizing that order, organization, and control are key factors for the adequate functioning of this phenomenon. Planning, organization, and control methods, as well as ways and means, cannot be based on a single or set pattern or be divorced from the community's reality. Requirements from control mechanisms, state institutions, government, and the population (as clients) will be based on legal, economic, and health regulations, in accordance with the limits imposed by the market. Trying to establish prices, quantities, and the quality of production and services without taking into consideration the real economic needs would be a mistake. The idea is not to subordinate to the market but, rather, to use the market in a necessarily intelligent and flexible manner. The liberties granted to local governments can play a significant role (nonadministrative) in creating socio-psychological and political conditions to encourage initiative and creativity to exploit the economic, political, and social reserves that this economic measure entails. In this regard, the regulations issued by the provincial government of the city of Havana can contribute to expanding and consolidating this new activity when contractual relations between self-employed workers and state enterprises (in other words, between socialist systems and systems of private ownership) with regard to the sale on consignment of products by the self-employed, rental of buildings or space within a building, and rental of space in public areas or places and sites of festivities and fairs. Self-employment will be effective to the extent that the supply of products and services it generates is stable and systematic. This aspect is linked to sources supplying the products necessary for this activity. The stability and authenticity of supplies is undoubtedly one of the aspects that could be questioned. A stable supply of component parts would be the result of a combination of personal resources obtained through legal individual efforts; local, territorial, and state efforts; and so on. The process must develop with state supplies and legal supplies obtained outside the free market and speculation. It is relevant, however, to analyze some aspects that could become deterrents to growth in production and income that this law could promote. The way in which the measure is explained in the resolution introduces a sense that it is possible that the measure could negatively affect the expansion of this activity, which is considered necessary in light of today's reality in the nation. The total prohibition imposed on university professionals who are not allowed to work on their own could be a negative factor for the efforts to improve the country's economy, considering they represent a large number in relation to the size of the economy and their predictable structural reorganization. The Cuban state has always guaranteed professionals employment and a salary. Today, however, this is extremely difficult, and in some cases only a nominal salary can be guaranteed and graduates are not given jobs commensurate with their individual aspirations. Authorizing these professionals to perform said duties would represent an alternate way of promoting the satisfaction of those interests, encouraging creativity, and their employment in tasks that would have a direct repercussion on the population. This would also signify an alleviation of the fiscal situation, although not significant. If in fact the elimination of worker subsidies (because of the current economic difficulties) in proportion to the amount of the income is perfectly appropriate, it does not seem possible to implement at least in the near future, given the impossibility to corroborate the amount of earned income. If in fact the prohibition for unemployed persons in areas with a deficit of state workers to accept such chores turns out to be explicable, it is not the adequate solution for such a deficit, and it introduces an external economic element as a solution for a problem that can be resolved within the framework of the economy. The territorialization [territorializacion] of solutions is undoubtedly a fact that allows flexibility in the process. It can also turn into some kind of restraint, based on subjective interpretations of particular local situations. For instance, the regulations of the provincial government of the city of Havana establish a suspension in the issuance of new self-employed work permits for producers of fast foods, collector-vendor of agriculture products, producer of dairy products, collector of raw materials, and chauffeur, all of whose tasks generate supply of goods and services that are scarce in the capital and impossible to provide through the state supply. The law makes no reference to family work. Nevertheless, self-employed work in many of the permitted activities in fact tends to lead to family organization in its execution. State control over the commercialization process, although necessary, could also become a factor of constraint, and it somehow contradicts the acknowledgement of the supply and demand mechanism to set prices. In the meantime, the lack of reference prices in many activities or otherwise the general alteration of the relative price system established by the current situation questions the determination of the high nature of any price. With regard to middlemen, the expansion of these tasks generates naturally the appearance of these occupations so in the future it would be preferable to regulate them. The Economic Dimension of Self-Employed Work Time is still too short to quantify the effect of this measure in great detail. However, some reflections on this issue would be interesting. The measure is promulgated within a very complex context, in which the depth of the economic crisis gives it an apparent tactical character (which the very text of the resolution somehow asserts). However, the character and dimension of this crisis, which exceed what is merely circumstantial and turn it into an event of deep structural importance, gives it a significance that exceeds what is simply tactical. It, thus, has to do with the impossibility of enjoying the advantageous relations that the country had with the socialist sector, the need to insert itself into world economy, and the impossibility of upholding the socialist development that had been predominant throughout all these years, which has obliged reevaluating different types of socioeconomic methods to be able to maintain the achievements of socialism. As long as the national economy is in the process of improving its efficiency and the government sector remains preponderant, self-employed work must become not only an alternative to supply, wherever it is insufficient, but also an economic activity which, due to its dimensions and the manner in which it relates to the rest of the economy, cannot be carried out efficiently by government production organizations. In addition, the state's reorganization, which has to be implemented to augment said efficiency, will also oblige it to redefine sectors and types of production in this field and to readjust the forms of operation in accordance with efficiency parameters that are indispensable to survive and progress. Self-employed work is also a "mattress" that will help soften the negative effects of such readjustments. In this sense, it is good to point out that up to the first days of last December, there were, according to some estimates that have not been officially confirmed, approximately 100,000 self-employed workers throughout the country. Should the average annual income be 5,000 pesos (undoubtedly a conservative figure), its impact on the GDP would amount to 500 million pesos; that is, about 5 percent of a 10 billion [currency not specified] PSG [expansion unknown] budget. Should the predictions made by some officials who believe that there will be 300,000 self-employed workers in 1994 materialize and should we estimate an average annual income of 4,000 pesos, then the resulting 1.2 billion pesos, a very significant amount for the national economy, would represent 12 percent of the GDP. In terms of employment figures, these potential 300,000 self-employed workers represent 8.5 percent of the country's work force. In this case, however, we must take into account that there are some state workers included in this figure. At any rate, the amount is not insignificant in this scenario either. Finally, we will have to consider the fiscal effect of this measure. Given the current estimate of the fiscal deficit and the fixed taxes levied on these activities, which average 36 pesos in taxes per activity, collections will amount to about 3.5 million pesos, which in turn increases the revenues of the secondary budget [presupuesto no significativo]. This is why tax collection must be reconsidered as far as conditions allow it. Should tax collection reach 10 percent of total revenues created by this sector and using the aforementioned 1.2 billion pesos as a base, the difference with the collection level that is currently charging fixed taxes would be substantial, and the 120 million [currency not specified] contribution to the budget would represent 3 percent of the current budgetary deficit. The Political Effect The political meaning of this economic measure is not less important. Along with other internal measures such as the decriminalization of foreign exchange tenure and the reorganization of agricultural production methods, it would also mean the recognition of the starring role that the population is playing with regard to these changes, whether as subject or as object. This creative initiative phenomenon by a population segment introduces a new and clear element to the shaping of the popularity of the economic politics of resistance and development that was implemented as a result of the worsening of the current economic crisis and broadens the concept of national unity. On that ground, such phenomenon can contribute to maintaining national consensus and the identification with the revolutionary project. This contribution would be possible as far as the dynamics of this process serves as a demonstration, whereby the population will be able to understand that the material and spiritual well-being must be forged by the creative work and initiative of each one of us, without expecting that all our needs and expectations could be met by the socialist state, as has been the case so far. These measures reintroduce an old economic policy: the relations among the individual, collective, and social issues in the pursuit of national interests. The balance of this system of interests is vital for the economic reconstruction of the country. To assume that social issues can survive without considering individual interests is as old as falling into the old liberalism trap and accepting that what is good for the individual is also good for society. The same mistake would be made if collective and social issues were routinely identified. The balance among these three systems of interests lies in recognizing the place that each one of them occupies in the economic arena and in the national sociopolitical weave. This is a very difficult task that will require constantly using the trial and error test as a suitable identification formula. Time and the government's ability to work out this system of interests without affecting the dynamics of each one of us will allow us to evaluate the real connotations of this measure.
