But it will require a high environmental profile on Sweden's part. That is the assessment of the environmental consequences of membership. This is not an unequivocal endorsement of membership. The issue of the EU and environmental policy is much too complicated for that, Anders Wijkman, chairman of the Environmental Consequence Committee, said when he presented the committee's report. The committee's analysis was based on a 10-year perspective of the consequences of EU membership, the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, or staying out of the EU. The conclusions have been summarized in the form of the answers to three questions: - How will Sweden's chances for an independent environmental policy be affected? Conclusion: Little difference, no matter which scenario Sweden chooses. Needed: No hesitation in utilizing all possibilities to exert influence. "An overcautious interpretation of the EC rules could lead to a kind of self-censorship in which we set narrower restrictions on our actions than are necessary. It would be better to stretch the limits even if it involves the risk of a court test," the committee members wrote. "We have discussed in detail the value of remaining outside as a model in the California style. Tough environmental rules cannot be created internationally, individual countries must take the lead. But it would require a very strong economy and a powerful Riksdag majority behind environmental measures for this to work. As these prerequisites are lacking, the difference between joining and staying outside is very small," Wijkman said. - What are Sweden's possibilities of influencing the EU's environmental policy? Conclusion: Greatest with membership. Needed: An offensive strategy and resources. "We must distinguish between our chances of exerting formal and informal influence. But with our scant 4 percent of the votes in the Council of Ministers we have little chance of contributing to a qualified majority. A passive Sweden will have no influence on the EU's environmental policy at all. By maintaining a high profile we can have great informal importance as members," according to Wijkman. - How will environmental conditions in Sweden be affected? Conclusion: Membership will involve the biggest problems. Needed: More far-reaching measures. EU membership will lead to increased growth. This can result in an increase of as much as 10 percent in carbon dioxide and nitric oxide emission, according to the committee's calculations. "The EU is responsible for 60 percent of the nitric oxide fallout over Sweden, and its carbon dioxide emission is 40 times higher. If we can contribute to changes in the union's environmental efforts, it could compensate for the increased Swedish emissions," according to Per Kagesson. The committee concluded that radical rethinking with respect to energy, traffic, and the purpose of growth is required. This applies to both Sweden and the EU. "My conclusion is that consideration for the environment and environmental policy is no barrier to joining the EU," Wijkman summed up.
