At the same time, it will push ahead with the export of construction, installation and operational technologies for nuclear furnaces to Southeast Asia and the development of new materials for aircraft. These short- and long-term plans were contained in a Chongwadae [presidential offices] report submitted yesterday by Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung on his ministry's New Year policy programs. According to Kim, South Korea has now emerged as the world's 10th largest user of nuclear power and it is high time that it engages in effective "nuclear diplomacy." Along this line, he said, the "Nuclear Control Center" will be set up under the umbrella of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) to initiate preparatory measures for South-North nuclear inspections. "In an effort to become more responsible in the application of nuclear technology, the center will concentrate on formulating new and improved policies," Kim explained. In the area of research and development, the minister told President Kim Yong-sam that a total of 322.4 billion won will be invested into the development of new materials and precision chemical technologies. "One of the main areas of emphasis in research is to localize technologies which are critical to the enhancement of the international competitiveness of the domestic agricultural industry," he elaborated. The development of new integrated materials for aircraft will be tested and put into the commercial market by next year after necessary testing procedures are completed. Along with the tangible research, the minister said 221 billion won will be invested until the year 2010 for the introduction of technologies which are on par with those in the world's seven most advanced countries. Under the long-term plan, a total of 10 technologies related to bioengineering will be developed so as to help the nation gain a competitive edge in the international market, Kim observed. He said his ministry will also focus on encouraging foreign research organizations to open up operations here so as to ignite joint research projects with local companies. On the other hand, 40 of the nation's most qualified research personnel will be dispatched abroad to pick up advanced technologies for domestic application. At the university level, the ministry will seek to increase the investment in basic sciences from the 7.6 percent last year to 12 percent in 1998, introducing such new areas of research as space technology. Addressing issues surfacing as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Kim said the financing of research projects will be overhauled with particular emphasis on intellectual property rights. The minister said a greater portion of the budget will be funnelled into the development of environment-related technologies such as alternative coolants to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to halt further environmental pollution and assist in efforts to reverse the damage.
