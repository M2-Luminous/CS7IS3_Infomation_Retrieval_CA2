Shlomi Eldar reports that five such centers were opened today and thousands have been swarming to them since the early morning hours. The centers will be open all week, and 4,000 policemen will be selected. Those selected will undergo training at existing facilities in the Gaza Strip, including a beach facility which used to be the Ansar 2 prison camp. To date there are about 2,600 policemen in the Gaza Strip. Tomorrow they will be joined by about 250 additional policemen from Algeria. Few are leaving Judaea and Samaria for work within the Green Line, and a mass demonstration was staged in Janin today against the continued closure. Many residents paraded the streets, complaining that the prolonged closure has caused grave economic distress, and that many are unemployed and have no means of livelihood. Some of the participants even criticized the PLO leadership which, so they claim, deals with Gaza and Jericho only and has abandoned the remaining residents of the territories. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 29 May adds that "in a commitment to the Gaza Strip Palestinian police, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] is trying to stop acts of revenge and killing against those who collaborate with Israel. Correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that this commitment was published in a manifesto disseminated by Hamas in the Gaza Strip."]
