Jean-Louis Debre, assistant secretary-general of the dominant right-wing party Rally for the Republic (RPR), brought the race for presidential elections in May 1995 into the open when he said of the package: "Good, but could do better." Balladur is flying high in opinion polls as favourite of the French to succeed President Francois Mitterrand, well ahead of Chirac. Chirac is president of the RPR and Balladur a member of the same party. In a statement to the daily LE MONDE Tuesday, Chirac ally Debre criticised the package for not exempting firms from social security charges so as to create jobs. "This does not correspond with the different policy we want as far as employment is concerned." The cautious package, which was decided at a much-trumpeted government seminar on Sunday, was mainly aimed at the key motor and building industries. Car owners will be offered a 5,OOO franc (850 dollar) bonus if they exchange a 10-year-old vehicle for a new one. An interest rate cut was announced on government-backed house-buying savings schemes in an attempt to encourage new property purchases by spending rather than saving. Limited measures for job creation were also announced. The package earned faint praise from the other component in Balladur's governing coalition, the centre-right Union for French Democracy (UDF). Charles Millon, leader of the UDF's parliamentary group, said the package was "nice," but "short-term", and called on the government to "start basic essential reforms." On the left, opposition Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard said the measures were "not up to the job." France has an unemployment rate of 12 percent and rising, and about 3.3 million are out of work. The government is forecasting a 1.4 percent rise in gross domestic product in 1994.
