This is nothing new for Pakistan. This is the third time in a series when Pakistan repeated the performance. For the first time it moved such a draft resolution at the UNHRC session in Geneva last year and for the second time at the 48th session of the UN General Assembly in 1993. Despite much propaganda and all the fanfare that followed, it refrained from tabling such a draft. On all these occasions it failed to mobilise necessary support. India hopes that these failures would induce Pakistan to look at all outstanding Indo-Pakistani bilateral issues, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in a constructive way and agree to start talks with India with a view to settling the issues bilaterally. This hope was expressed by the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. Krishnan Srinivasan, at his first-ever press conference here on Thursday that lasted for about 30 minutes. Mr. Srinivasan also hoped that Pakistan's response to the six non-papers India gave to Pakistan and the Indian response to Pakistan's two non-papers would be constructive and soon the Foreign Secretary-level dialogue would resume. Giving the details of what happened in Geneva on Wednesday, the Foreign Secretary stated that the Iranian resolution, which facilitated the Pakistani withdrawal, was unilateral. Claiming that India was always confident of winning the vote, Mr. Srinivasan stated "we wanted the vote to be held at the earliest" as we were confident a majority of those voting would go against Islamabad. He said the withdrawn resolution stood automatically lapsed and Pakistan would have to start de novo at the next session of the UNHRC. This was confirmed by the United Nations secretariat as there was confusion whether the resolution was deferred till the next session. Mr. Srinivasan said although Pakistan had announced its intention a day earlier to amend the resolution by dropping the reference to sending a fact-finding mission to Kashmir, it remained in its original form till the last moment. The dilution of the resolution was intended to gain the support of more countries as a majority of them did not want to get involved in a territorial issue. Also, the resolution had not mentioned the country to which the fact-finding mission would go. Before the resolution was withdrawn, Iran made a statement that India had agreed to facilitate the visit of a group of Ambassadors of Islamic countries to visit Kashmir. Besides Iran, 15 countries, including China, Syria, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tunisia, Libya, Nigeria, Brazil and Australia, asked Pakistan to withdraw the resolution. He denied that there was any linkage between the Pakistani withdrawal and the Iranian suggestion for team of Organisation of Islamic (OIC) countries Ambassadors' visiting Jammu and Kashmir. The Iranian suggestion was not binding on India. But any Ambassador stationed in India, excepting those of Pakistan and Libya, could visit any part of India, including Jammu and Kashmir, and report to his government as fact-finding was the normal duty of an Ambassador, the Foreign Secretary asserted. "They are most welcome to do that," he added. Mr. Srinivasan pointed out that Ambassadors of 10 countries, including four Islamic nations, were already in Kashmir Valley to see things for themselves. One of the Islamic nations was Senegal, the present chairman of the OIC. Three others, including Iran, were to join them but could not do so due to preoccupation. There was no restrictions. India was prepared to extend whatever help these Ambassadors require, he added. Mr. Srinivasan said that there was no scope for Iran or any other country on to mediate the Kashmir issue. Referring to Iran's statement at Geneva on Wednesday that it would continue to work towards resolving the Kashmir issue, Mr. Srinivasan made it clear that India was neither bound by it nor did it constitute mediation. India had not made any compromises on the issue, he stated emphatically. He added that Iran had made the statement on its own initiative and New Delhi would welcome it if Teheran succeeded in persuading Islamabad to create a climate for a constructive dialogue between India and Pakistan. The Foreign Secretary lauded the role of Iran and China in persuading Pakistan to withdraw the resolution unconditionally. Mr. Srinivasan said Pakistan, despite making at a prestige issue, had to withdraw the resolution unilaterally because of lack of support. The Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had telephonic talks with many heads of government and State to enlist support for her country's resolution. The Pakistan government even deputed senior ministers and officials to various countries for this purpose. He said the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to Germany and the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh's meeting with the European troika and French leaders helped to place the Indian viewpoint more clearly and lucidly. These interactions proved vital for support to the Indian stand. He said India had been able to convey the cause of human rights violation in the State and Pakistan's attempt to internationalise the issue in violation of the Shimla agreement. He said there was a great transparency in "our policy towards Kashmir."
