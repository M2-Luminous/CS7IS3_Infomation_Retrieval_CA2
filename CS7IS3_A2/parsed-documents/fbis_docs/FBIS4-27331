AERA has obtained a document that reveals a package of measures under secret examination by the Japanese Government. The outline of the package of measures to prepare for a state of emergency on the Korean peninsula, which the Japanese Government is now secretly examining, has come to light. If the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against North Korea, how will the Japanese Government deal with them?" If a war breaks out, how will Japan cooperate with U.S. Forces? AERA has obtained the document revealing how relevant ministries and agencies are now working on to map out the package of measures. (Refer to tables on pages 14 and 15.) Commenting on the package of measures, a cabinet Secretariat official has said, "As Japan's measures to deal with international crisis, the package of measures is the largest in scale since Japan was defeated in World War II." Relevant ministries and agencies have recently briefed the Foreign Affairs Division of each ruling coalition party on the package of measures. The top government leader is aware of the package of measures. The document lists all areas where Japan cannot cope with the emergency under laws and ordinances currently in force and clearly indicates what sort of legislation is required to cope with the emergency. North Korea is promoting its nuclear program in Yongbyon, 90 km north of Pyongyang, and it appears to be expanding underground facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been trying to check North Korea's nuclear facilities in accordance with a safeguards agreement concluded between the IAEA and North Korea as required by the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but North Korea is still refusing to permit IAEA-sought inspections of its nuclear facilities. The United States has intervened in the standoff between North Korea and the IAEA in an effort to alter North Korea's attitude through dialogue. However, North Korea has triggered the war of nerves instead by using its nuclear card, and the "on and off" negotiations have continued for more than two years. Some have therefore begun arguing for economic sanctions by the UN Security Council and non-UN economic sanctions imposed by such concerned nations as Japan, the United States, and South Korea. Japan Bans Remittances, Trade, and Exchange of Visits With North Korea Under this situation, North Korea has been developing the Nodong-1 missile capable of hitting any part of Japan. Last year, it test-fired the missile into the Sea of Japan. Its leadership has continued its criticism of Japan. Meanwhile, during his meeting with then Prime Minister Hosokawa last November, President Clinton reportedly took the issue of continued illegal outflow of huge sums of the yen from Japan to North Korea. According to the same cabinet Secretariat official, the Japanese Government is prepared to enforce economic sanctions by establishing a countermeasure headquarter two or three days after the UN Security Council votes to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. So far, the government and the ruling coalition parties are working on details of the package on the assumption of four situations: 1) Japan's cooperation on economic sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council; 2) Japan's assistance to the U.S. forces when the United States and South Korea go into a state of war with North Korea; 3) Japan's transport of refugees; and 4) Japan's defensive actions or "Japan's self-defense war" in accordance with Article 76 of the Self-Defense Forces Law. The private views of officials who have been involved in compiling the document are incorporated in the tables. It is legally possible for Japan to ban or restrict the remittance and investment by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan to North Korea; Trade; and the exchange of visits by ships, aircraft, and personnel between Japan and North Korea, but there is a possibility that the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] will strongly react against such measures. Nonetheless, the Japanese Government will be able to put the measures into effect whenever the top government leader makes a decision on them. It is still difficult for the Japanese Government to draw a conclusion on how to deal with reentry into Japan by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan after their short visits to their relatives in North Korea. If the Korean residents residing in Japan are banned from returning to Japan where they have their base of livelihood, Japan would be criticized from the humanitarian point of view. What is impossible or difficult under laws and ordinances currently in force are the activities of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] to back up the economic sanctions and Japan's assistance to the U.S. forces engaged in combat.

The SDF cannot carry out these activities in either open sea or Japan's territorial waters. As a result, the argument is surfacing on the need to amend the SDF Law. If the SDF undertakes naval interception and check of ships near sea waters where North Korea wages sea battles with the United States and South Korea, it would be dragged into the sea battles. The amendment to the SDF Law may breach the Constitution depending on how the SDF Law is amended. Unlike the Gulf war, for which Japan made financial and material contributions, and the peacekeeping operations (PKO) in Cambodia, for which it sent its units, Japan would be a country involved directly in the emergency on the Korean peninsula. Japan will choose between letting the SDF carry out activities as it is or organizing a PKO unit. It also will decide whether to refrain from taking part in activities outside Japan while joining the economic sanctions. It will not adopt an attitude of indifference toward the emergency. Laying of Mines in the Sea -- Under current law, the SDF can participate in removing mines from the sea if it is not known which country laid the mines. If the SDF is to remove the mines laid in foreign territorial waters for amphibious landing operations, it must amend the SDF Law. It is hard to see the SDF's removal of mines as a self-defense act and the SDF's involvement in the removal of mines will most likely be seen as an act breaching the Constitution. A minesweeper of the Maritime Self-Defense Force was sent to the Persian Gulf only after the Gulf war ended. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Bills to allow the dispatch of SDF airplanes overseas have been submitted to the Diet, and the dispatch of war vessels also has been discussed. But the prospect of these bills becoming law is dim. Government Is Studying Mobilization of SDF in an Emergency Legislation for Emergency Cases -- Besides the review of the SDF Law, the revision of relevant laws and ordinances, as well as the enactment of new laws, will be taken up for discussion. For example, when the government urgently needs to construct a surveillance facility somewhere, it has to obtain landowners' consent if the place is a private forest. Whether or not legislation to allow emergency land expropriation is necessary to save the government the trouble of obtaining such consent will likely be discussed. A noticeable point in the government's study of the DPRK issue is the inclusion among subjects for detailed study of Articles 76 and 77 of the SDF Law, which stipulate ordering the mobilization of SDF troops and standby for mobilization. The study of these articles is aimed at clarifying conditions under which Japan can wage a "defensive war." Although the current law allows the government to expose tax evasion by Korean residents in Japan, to do so will unexpectedly be difficult for the government. According to the (1991 issue of) Chongnyon, a brochure published by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], the Commercial and Industrial Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a Chongnyon-affiliated organ, reached a five-point agreement with the National Tax Administration Agency 18 years ago. The first point stipulates that "all issues concerning Korean businessmen's taxes should be resolved through consultation with the Commercial and Industrial Association of Korean Residents in Japan." Is there any connection between "tax evasion" by Korean residents in Japan, which the government plans to expose when sanctions are imposed on North Korea, and this agreement? Money Flow, Tax Evasion Will Also Be Targets of Economic Sanctions Moreover, what is the connection between the flow of money from Japan to the DPRK, which the United States is also closely watching, and "tax evasion" in Japan? The National Tax Administration Agency has so far denied the existence of the five-point agreement. But when sanctions are imposed on the DPRK, the agency will need to disclose the facts about the agreement so it can expose tax evasion in a fair manner. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has seldom told about specific measures to cope with possible Korea crisis since his term as foreign minister. But at a House of Representatives' Budget Committee session on 24 May, he made remarks suggesting the possibility of Japan engaging in activities other than those to be carried out under a UN resolution. His remarks indicated that the government is steadily promoting the study of measures to deal with an emergency case.
