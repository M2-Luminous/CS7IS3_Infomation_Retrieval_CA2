FR941117-0-00220 FR941117-0-00014 E. Disclosure of Coverage by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation In order to reduce investor confusion concerning a firm's SIPC coverage, 74 the Commission proposed to amend Rule 10b&hyph;10 to require affirmative disclosure, if applicable, when a broker-dealer is not a member of SIPC and when an account is carried by a non-SIPC-member broker or dealer. Generally, the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 requires broker-dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act to be members of SIPC. Certain types of broker-dealers registered under Section 15(b), as well as all broker-dealers registered as government securities brokers and dealers under Section 15C of the Exchange Act, are excluded from SIPC membership. 75 74 SIPC, a non-profit, membership corporation, was established under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970. SIPC is funded by assessments on its members and interest earned on fund assets. The fund is used to protect securities customers of SIPC-member broker-dealers that fail financially. 15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq. For example, in the event of the failure of a SIPC member firm, SIPC provides protection up to $500,000 for claims for cash and securities (although claims solely for cash are limited to $100,000) of each customer. 15 U.S.C. 78fff&hyph;3(a)(1). 75 In addition to government securities brokers and dealers, the following broker-dealers are not required to be members of SIPC: (1) Persons whose principal business in the determination of SIPC (and with Commission approval) is conducted outside the U.S.; and (2) persons whose business consists exclusively of (a) the distribution of shares of registered open-end investment companies or unit investment trusts, (b) the sale of variable annuities, (c) the business of insurance, or (d) the business of rendering investment advisory services to registered investment companies or insurance company separate accounts. 15 U.S.C. 78ccc(a)(2)(A) and 78lll(12). Many commenters addressing this issue supported the Commission's proposal to inform customers when their broker-dealers are not SIPC members. 76 Other commenters generally agreed with requiring the disclosure, but disagreed that the confirmation was the appropriate disclosure medium and suggested that non-membership status in SIPC be disclosed in a periodic account statement or opening account document. 77 Commenters opposing the disclosure initiative argued that the disclosure would be misleading to investors in that they would believe that they are at greater risk when dealing with a non-SIPC firm. 78 The Investment Company Institute (``ICI'') argued that requiring ``negative disclosure'' concerning the lack of SIPC coverage is contrary to the reasons certain persons are exempted from the membership requirement in the first instance_namely, excluded broker-dealers present limited risks to investors because they do not hold customer funds. 79 76 See, e.g., Letters from Ronald S. Plaine, President, Comerica Securities (undated); David M. Beckius, Vice President/Sr. Attorney, Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (July 14, 1994); and William E. Kramer, Assistant Vice President, Nomura Securities International, Inc. (July 15, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 77 See, e.g., Letters from William E.

Fenn Putman, Chairman, PSA (June 21, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 78 See, e.g., Letters from Lawrence J. Latto, Shea & Gardner (June 17, 1994); and Peter C. Clapman, Sr. Vice President/Chief Counsel, College Retirement Equities Fund (June 15, 1994); to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 79 See Letter from Paul Schott Stevens, General Counsel, ICI, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 15, 1994). See also Letter from Fred J. Franklin, Vice President/Chief Compliance Officer, Aetna Life Insurance and Annuity Co., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 14, 1994). The Commission, consistent with its authority under the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993, 80 is adopting the proposed amendment to ensure that customers are not led to believe that their accounts are subject to protection beyond what actually is the case. 81 This disclosure is relevant and meaningful to investors. Further, the confirmation is the best vehicle to convey this information to customers on a transaction-specific basis, particularly in situations where a customer is dealing with affiliated broker-dealers and one or more of the affiliates is not a SIPC member. 80 15 U.S.C. 78O&hyph;5(a)(4). 81 The legislative history of the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 discussed SIPC coverage and the exemption from SIPC coverage afforded to government securities brokers and dealers. The Government Accounting Office noted that the gap in SIPC coverage could be confusing to investors and recommended, among other things, that the lack of SIPC coverage be disclosed. The amendments ultimately took a disclosure approach and authorized the Commission to require disclosure of non-SIPC status of government securities brokers and dealers. S. Rep. No. 422, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1993). The same reasons to require this disclosure of government securities brokers and dealers applies to other broker-dealers that are exempt from SIPC coverage. The Commission agrees, however, that certain instances exist where this disclosure should not apply. 82 For instance, the ICI stated that in some cases when a broker-dealer contracts with an investment company for the distribution of fund shares, customers purchasing such shares will send their purchase money directly to the fund's transfer agent. 83 The transfer agent then will issue shares to the customer against receipt of the purchase money and send the money to the fund's custodian bank. In this situation, customer funds are not handled by the broker-dealer. In addition, the ICI argued that the transfer agent or fund underwriter, when sending the confirmation on behalf of the broker-dealer, may not know the SIPC status of a particular broker-dealer. Accordingly, the disclosure provision contains an exclusion that is intended to apply only in cases where the non-SIPC broker-dealer does not receive or handle in any form customer funds or securities in connection with a purchase or redemption of registered open-end investment company or unit investment trust shares and the customer sends its purchase money or securities to the fund, its transfer agent, its custodian, or its designated agent, none of whom are associated persons of the broker-dealer. Furthermore, checks may not be made payable to the broker-dealer, and the broker-dealer may not handle any customer checks in connection with the transaction. Otherwise, the broker-dealer would be required to disclose its non-SIPC status. Therefore, if a broker-dealer, including a fund underwriter, receives customer funds or securities and promptly forwards funds or securities to the investment company, transfer agent, custodian, or other designated agent, the confirmation would have to disclose the non-SIPC status of the broker-dealer. 82 Some commenters believed that the proposed disclosure was inconsistent with a letter, Letter regarding Benjamin M. Vandegrift (Dec. 21, 1993), issued by the Division of Investment Management. The disclosure requirement adopted today recognizes the position taken in the letter, reserving the right to revisit SIPC-related disclosure issues. 83 See Letter from Paul Schott Stevens, General Counsel, ICI, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 15, 1994), at 2, n.5.
