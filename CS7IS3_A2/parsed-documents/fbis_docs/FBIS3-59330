Developmental Characteristics of Foreign Commercial Investment Enterprises In recent years, the Fujian Provincial Committee and the provincial government have announced a series of important measures for opening and reform, which have taken the work of using foreign investment to a new level of development. In just 1992 alone, there were 3,113 foreign commercial investment enterprises approved throughout the province, with contracts for $6.351 billion in foreign capital, actual use of foreign capital amounting to $1.416 billion. These three quotas indicated, respectively, increases of 1.6 times, 3.4 times, and 1.2 times again over the previous year. From January to July of this year, 2,998 new foreign investment enterprises were approved throughout the province, with contracts for $7.203 billion in foreign capital, and $1.58 billion in capital actually received. These were, respectively, increases of 1.41 times, 2.63 times, and 1.42 times again over the same period last year. In recent years, the development of foreign investment enterprises in Fujian has had the following new special features: A. Foreign investors were mostly the "three types of overseas Chinese," i.e., Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries, with a steady increase in investors from other countries and regions. Eight million overseas Chinese came from Fujian, as did 800,000 residents of Hong Kong and Macao, and 80 percent of Taiwanese' residents' original family home was Fujian. With expanded opening up to the outside and improvement of the conditions for investment, they have been eager to invest in their hometowns, and have become the main body of foreign investment in Fujian Province. Up to July, 1993, investors from 32 countries or regions had invested in Fujian. If calculating on a basis of approved contracted foreign capital, capital from Hong Kong and Macao constituted 55.8 percent of the total, capital from Taiwan made up 24.9 percent, with 19.3 percent coming from other foreign countries and regions. In recent years, industrial and commercial business people from Europe, the United States, and Southeast Asia have had optimistic views of the excellent investment circumstances in Fujian, so investors increased rapidly. Among newly approved investment projects in 1992, 54 were American, with contracted capital amount to $144 million; nine were Canadian, with contracted capital amounting to $36.66 million; 65 were from Singapore, with contracted capital amounting to $200 million; 73 were from the Philippines, with contracted capital amounting to $149 million; 17 were Malaysian, with contracted capital amounting to $41.63 million; 17 were Indonesian, with contracted capital amounting to $34.2 million. B. There was an increase in the number of major foreign investment projects, a big breakthrough in attracting major investors. In recent years, there have been many achievements in the work of inviting tenders, resulting in a series of visits to Fujian by some large financial groups with considerable influence overseas, and some important industrial business people. These were to negotiate investment in large scale construction and development. Preliminary statistics indicate that there are 10 major investment projects throughout the province which have gross capital of more than $100 million, and 163 investment projects with over $10 million in capital. What is especially inspiring is that these big financial groups and investors have shifted from mostly checking out the investment environment into an actual development and construction period. The success rate of negotiations is higher, projects are implemented quickly, and one by one a large group of major projects have commenced establishment and operations. There are 38 major projects of over $10 million which have gone into production in Fuzhou, and most of the big projects in such cities as Xiameng, Quanzhou, Putian, and Zhangzhou, have gone into production one by one. Foreign capital investment construction along the entire first line of the coastal area is displaying a robust situation. C. The scope of foreign capital investment has expanded further, with the direction of capital developing toward tertiary industries. Since 1992, foreign capital investment has developed into multiple areas, in projects involved with over 90 industries, including agriculture, forestry, poultry, fisheries, the feed industry, coal industry, metallurgy, building materials, electricity, mechanical manufactures, textiles, shoe manufacturing, plastic products, bamboo and wood processing, furniture, paper manufacturing, the chemical industry, chemical fibers, printing, traffic, transportation, electric power, real estate, food, hotel information inquiry, health, sports, literature and art, broadcasting and television, public affairs, and finance, etc. In particular, pushed by the reform and opening in China and guided by industrial policies, some big business people have not hesitated to put considerable amounts of money into renewal of the older districts of cities, helping to develop such public concerns as traffic, electric power, etc. and vigorously developing such tourism and shopping facilities as hotels, shopping centers, retail sales outlets, holiday villages, high class vocation centers, large scale entertainment places, etc., which touched off a wave of tertiary industry development. Looking at the industrial structure of foreign investment, among the currently approved amount of foreign capital, 1.9 percent went into primary industry, 67.8 percent went into secondary industry, and 36.8 percent went to tertiary industry. The rate of investment for this tertiary capital had obviously increased. D. The open coastal areas dominate investment distribution, but this is gradually spreading toward the mountainous regions inland. Fujian's open coastal area has very favorable conditions, such as nearness to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, convenient traffic and favorable policies, etc., so it is still a hot spot for foreign investment. Up the end of July, 1993, among 11,038 foreign investment projects throughout the province, the city of Fuzhou had 2,516 projects, with agreements for $7.52 billion in foreign capital, and $663 million in foreign capital actually in use; Xiamen had 2,009 projects, with $5.286 billion in foreign capital agreed upon, and $1.286 billion actually in use; Quanzhou had 3,386 projects, with agreements for $4.06 billion in foreign capital, and $583 million actually in use; Putian had 654 projects, with agreements on $1.748 billion in foreign capital, and $234 million in foreign capital actually in use; Zhangzhou had 978 projects, with agreements on $1.33 billion in foreign capital, and $212 million in foreign capital actually in use. With the overall investment environment improved and the open areas expanded, foreign investment has moved steadily inland to the mountainous region from the coastal area, there has been a rapid increase in the number of investors engaged in mining, forestry, tourism, etc., and a group of foreign investment projects have developed along the mountain railway line. Among these, Longyan had 328 projects, with agreements on $318 million in foreign capital, and $40.23 million in foreign capital actually in use; Ningde had 354 projects, with agreements on $261 million in foreign capital, and $83.92 million in foreign capital actually in use; Shanmin had 347 projects, with agreements on $210 million, and $33.24 million in foreign capital actually in use. E. Investment form was initially the single project type, but gradually developed into a series of developments, opening up regionally. In the early part of the 1980s, foreign commercial investment in Fujian was dominated by scattered manufacturers, with single projects. In the middle and later years of that decade, there appeared a series of trade developments, and in the 1990s regional development has taken a more complete form, with land packet development becoming an important pattern in foreign commercial investments. Up to the end of May, 1993, the province had approved 79 parcels of land for foreign commercial development projects. The contracted amount of land to be developed in these areas in the near term is 48.34 square kilometers, with $1.828 billion in foreign capital. In these parcels of development areas, the imported projects will have a higher starting point, with complete supporting public facilities such as water, electricity, roads, posts and telecommunications, pollution control, etc., and most of projects can be developed and built in the time framework specified in the contracts. At present, 34 projects are under construction, and 12 projects, including Rongqiao, Hongkuan, Yuanzai, Majia, Panlong, and Zhenshi, have gone into production or are close to completion. Basically, the pattern followed has been rolling development -- develop a packet, construct a packet, then profit from it. Take for example, the Rongqiao Economic and Technical Development Zone in the city of Fuqin: during the five years after it was established, the State put only 2 million yuan into it, while foreign investors put in $596 million yuan; an enterprise group was formed in the development area, which established and constructed 107 foreign capital enterprises, and 58 enterprises had gone into production, with forecast earnings of 2.5 billion yuan annually, and $300 million in foreign currency. Also, in Fuqin's Hongyuan Investment Zone, since it was established over one year ago, 10 square kilometers were developed in the first phase, and 17 initial projects were listed in the plan, a large group of projects, including a flower mill, paper manufacturer, a petroleum plant, etc. In an intense campaign of preparation for the establishment and construction of a 30,000 ton port, they are building an infrastructure in the zone, such as water, electricity, posts, roads, etc., and a start has been made on all of these. F. It accelerates gathering foreign commercial investment enterprises into groups, and further improves their technical and managerial level. In recent years, some foreign commercial investment enterprises have gradually developed into groups on the basis of making higher profits. Large groupings of powerful enterprises have organized and built up enterprise groups, such as the Fuyao Glass Industry Corporation, Ltd., and Yongdexing Corporation, Ltd., continuously enlarging the enterprises' degree of grouping. In cities where foreign enterprises are concentrated, there has been formed a pattern of trade association and specialization alleys. Foreign capital enterprises in Jinjiang are enthusiastically applying themselves to building a "shoe city," a regional shoe production center and large scale specialized shoe trade market which will spread across the country with production, operations, wholesale and retail sales all combined in one entity. In Fujiang's open coastal areas, there has been a wave of development, a "shoe city," "fashion city," "umbrella city," "toy city," "packing city," etc., with different special features. In addition, the technical structure of foreign investment enterprises has obviously improved. A group of enterprises concentrated as to technology and capital were established in succession in the past several years. Take for example, the Guanjie Electricity Enterprise in Fuqing: its imported electric terminal indicator production line can produce 200,000 terminal indicators per year; the high technical level of its facility and the size of its production scale can be termed first class in the same industry in the nation. With enterprises becoming more specialized and automated, many foreign investment enterprises are computerizing their routine management operations, inviting a large number of people with specialized qualifications and knowledge of modern enterprise management. Their attention to building an enterprise culture has brought their operations and management to a new level. G. Gaining considerable notice has been the high rate of independent capital enterprises and the phenomenon of state owned enterprises "grafting" foreign capital to increase the proportion of independent capital investment. At present, it occupies 60.7 percent of foreign capital enterprises. All of Fujian's prefectures and cities have also selected a group of state-owned enterprises to "graft" foreign capital, implementing multiple forms of joint ventures in plants, workshops, foreign investor purchasing, leasing and foreign investor contracting, importing the operational system of foreign capital enterprises. The Hong Kong Zhongche Investment Corporation, Ltd., is carrying out a joint venture with 41 state-owned enterprises in the city of Quanzhou, which will be a "total" remolding, with a total investment of 1 billion yuan. This action has had the positive effect of alleviating the financial burden on Quanzhou's city government, changing the operating system of state-owned enterprises, promoting Quanzhou's state-owned enterprises, readjusting and promoting the level of industrial structure. This has attracted attention from all sectors. II. We Cannot Ignore the Role That Development of Foreign Investment Enterprises Has Played in Fujian's Booming Economy and Social Progress The abrupt rise of foreign investment enterprises in Fujian has had a positive effect in promoting Fujian's opening and reform and socioeconomic development, chiefly manifested as: A. Furthering the adjustment and perfecting of the socialist ownership structure, bringing new motivation and vitality to development of the domestic economy. The rapid development of foreign investment enterprises has fostered new competition in the main body of the domestic economic system, and causing the single ownership structure in Fujian province to start to shift to a multiple level ownership structure in which the public ownership system is dominant. It has formed a new developmental pattern in which state ownership, collective, township, foreign capital, individual, and private ownership enterprises promote and spur on one another, and stimulated the domestic economy's rapid development. During January to July of this year, Fujian had a gross output of 46.154 billion yuan in agriculture and industry, an increase of 36.6 percent over last year, including 16.11 billion yuan industrial output achieved by foreign investment enterprises, a 56.8 percent increase, and 35 percent of the province's industrial output above the township level. Among newly added industry in the province, foreign investment enterprises occupied 47.4 percent. The arrival of a great many foreign enterprises has become the conduit for efficient allocation between the international and domestic markets, and for two types of resources, in such industries as electricity, shoe manufacture, building materials, machinery, light industry, the food trade, etc. Foreign investment enterprises and the state-owned, collective, and township enterprises are supporting each other to form a batch of close or semi-close joint stock enterprise groups guided by the international market, centered on export products, and linked by economic benefits. To take the shoe industry as an example, foreign investment enterprises took eight world famous sports shoes as their chief product, and brought the products of more than 1,000 State owned, collective, and township shoe manufacturing enterprises into the international market. B. Accelerating readjustment of industrial structure, promoting improvement and replacement of product mix. The development of foreign investment enterprises has presented new challenges and vitality to industrial structure adjustment in Fujian, remolding and developing not only such traditional industries as electricity, shoe manufacturing, clothing, toys, gold and silver jewelry, beverages, feed, machine processing, medicinal chemistry, etc., but also appearing in a batch of new products which are suitable for both domestic and overseas markets. These industries, which include electricity, plastics and rubber, shoe manufacturing, building materials, and clothing manufacturing, etc., have become mainstay industries in Fujian. This has greatly accelerated the process of industrial structure adjustment, and improved the structure and distribution of trade. The boom in foreign investment enterprises has led to the replacement of a group of older enterprises in Fujian, refinement and distillation of traditional technology, and brought the quality, design, modeling, and packing of products to a new level. A large group of products have won either the international gold prize, or the national, ministry, and provincial titles for excellence, and are selling well in the domestic and overseas markets. C. Increasing the state's revenue income, promoting the public matters of society's development. There has been an annual increase in the amount of revenue from foreign investment enterprises throughout the province, and these have become an important channel of Fujian's revenue. In 1992, 1.1 billion yuan in various revenues were turned over by foreign investment enterprises, which was one-seventh of the provincial revenue income; this is expected to rise to 1.4 billion yuan in 1993. In addition, numerous foreign investors have enthusiastically aided in the development of such societal welfare and public affairs matters as education, health, sports, cultural, roads and electric power, etc. They have been generous with contributions of money or materials, and have made greater contributions to the modernization of their hometowns. D. Importing a batch of advanced technology and equipment, promoting a scientific and technical boom. In recent years, the direction of foreign capital investment has begun shifting from labor intensive industries to capital and technology intensive industries. The technical level and amount of science and technology in imported equipment has improved greatly, with some enterprises imported facilities and technology attaining the international advanced level of the 1990s, so it has greatly accelerated the pace of Fujian industry's becoming more scientific and technical. Meanwhile, foreign invested enterprises have invited a large number of scientific and technical personnel to China, combining their favorable capital situation with the cheap science and technology of the mainland, in an advantageous merger to cooperate on preparing new technology and developing new products, to produce a very strong competitive power in the international market. It can be said that foreign investment enterprises have been in the forefront of enterprise technical progress in Fujian Province, and the "point man" in promoting scientific industry in the province. E. Development of an export-oriented economy, promoting links between the economy of Fujian and the international market. Foreign investment enterprises are Fujian's bridge and link to the outside, and are an important pillar of Fujian's export oriented economy. Among Fujian's 4,300 foreign investment enterprises which have gone into production, as many as 3,000 are export enterprises. Through their flexible operating system, foreign investment enterprises rapidly linked international and domestic production features, producing goods which promptly entered the international market, rapidly promoting foreign trade and export increases in Fujian. Among a $4.2 billion foreign trade and expert volume in the province in 1992, the self operated exports of foreign investment enterprises was $1.814 billion, which was 42.43 percent of the gross provincial exports; among gross provincial exports of $2.812 billion during January to July of this year, the self operated exports of foreign investment enterprises was $1.389 billion, which was 49 percent of the gross. Of the surplus in the balance of foreign exchange, in 1992, $567 million was transferred to the market, and $279 was paid in, making for a foreign exchange net of $288 million. Foreign investment enterprises' management model and operating systems were affected chiefly by international practice and adjustment of international market operational regulations, and had a positive learning effect on speeding up enterprise reform in Fujian and building the socialist market economy. Some of the state-owned, collective, and township enterprises in Fujian imported the scientific management model of foreign investment enterprises, but insisted that there be the following preconditions: public ownership and distribution according to work; establishment of an operations system with responsibility; rights and profits be unified; implementation of regularized production and management, standarized technological management, and systematic personnel management. All operations and management had to comply with international practice which improved production and economic benefits of enterprises, and laid a good foundation for connecting Fujian's provincial economy with the international market as soon as possible after joining GATT. F. Wider channels and means of employment, and easing the societal pressures from job-seeking. So far, the province's foreign investment enterprises have hired 530,000 employees, which was 9.8 percent of hires in all of society. The rapid development of foreign investment enterprises not only brought jobs to a great many of the urban unemployed, but also made use of a large group of rural society's surplus labor force. This played an important role in reducing the State's investment in employment, easing societal pressures from job-seeking an promoting social stability. G. Promoting the concept of opening among the people of Fujian Province, and building closer relationships with the Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan region and with neighboring countries. The development of foreign investment enterprises has promoted the concepts of opening and the market economy among the people of Fujian, nurturing and training a group of talented, export-oriented people familiar with international economics and trade, and good at operations and management. Meanwhile, building closer contacts between Fujian and with the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, has strengthened mutual understanding and friendship, which was helpful to the country's unification and peace, and has been helpful in promoting direct and early "three communications" between the two banks of the straits, as well as being helpful in consolidating and developing warm friendships with neighboring countries. Overall, after 15 years' of reform and opening to the outside, foreign investment enterprises have continued to widen the spheres of their operations, and with the rapid expansion of the scope of their operations, and development of their economic power, they have become an important pillar of the Fujian provincial economy, having a decisive effect on such fields as industry, real estate, hotel services, etc., and the city construction trade in Fujian province, and have been an indispensable force in Fujian's modernization. The 15 years of hard work not only embodies the hard work of vast numbers of cadres and masses, but also the enthusiastic support and contributions of compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and also foreign investors, a positive development. The establishment and development of foreign investor groups has been a leading factor in our flourishing economy and our social development.
