FR940527-1-00217 FR940527-1-00014 Table 2 shows the historical percentage changes in the capital price proxies employed in the CIPI. These proxies are: the building cost index maintained by the Engineering News-Record (ENR) for the costs of fixed assets; the machinery and equipment component of the Producer Price Index (PPI&hyph;11) for moveable equipment; the average yield on domestic municipal bonds from the Bond Buyer index of 20 bonds (Muni); the average yield on Moody's corporate bonds (AAA); a composite of Muni and AAA indexes (Combined Muni/AAA); and the residential rent component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI Rent) for other capital costs. We applied the relative weights from Table 1 to the appropriate historical percent changes in capital price proxies listed in Table 2 to generate the current year prices for the CIPI depreciation sector listed in Table 3. For example, the FY 1995 moveable equipment index component percentage change of 1.9 percent in Table 3 represents the average of the percentage changes in the moveable equipment price proxy (PPI&hyph;11 in Table 2) for the previous 10 years (that is, FY 1985 through 1994), weighted by the relative weights listed for movable equipment in Table 1.
