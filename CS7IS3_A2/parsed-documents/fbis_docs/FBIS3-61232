Such was the leitmotiv of the speech of the chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of State Property at a press conference in the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs press center on Zubovskaya Ploshchad in Moscow. It has come to pass despite the oppposition of functionaries of all bureaucratic levels and all political forces. Anatoliy Chubays appeared as if in the role of a Grandfather Frost who had given presents to many Russians. Today, Anatoliy Chubays declared, 67-70 percent of all former state enterprises in the sphere of small-scale privatization (malaya privatizatsiya) (stores, everyday services, hotels) have become private. As for large-scale privatization (bolshaya privatizatsiya), about 11,000 of the 14,500 largest state enterprises had been registered as joint-stock companies by the end of the year. More than 600 check investment funds, which help the citizens of Russia to take advantage of their privatization checks, are operating in the country. On the whole about 110 million Russians had already taken advantage of their privatization checks at the end of 1993. More than 55 million of the country's citizens have become stock holders, i.e., private owners. Some 600-800 check auctions, in the possibility of the large-scale conducting of which not only our home-bred skeptics but even many foreign experts even recently did not believe, are held in Russia every month. More than 7,000 enterprises have gone through check auctions. On the basis of all this, the chairman of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property concluded, we can give a firm guarantee that the last privatization check of a Russian citizen will be utilized by 30 June 1994. Well, what will happen in July when the voucher disappears, the journalists asked A. Chubays. To this Anatoliy Borisovich answered merrily that he personally doesn't like the word "disappear," but rather--"will triumphantly conclude its functions"... As for further plans, a new stage of so-called paid privatization (platnaya privatizatsiya) awaits the country, when state property will be sold off no longer for privatization checks issued to everyone free of charge, but solely for money. "But don't the intentions of the government to give up voucher privatization from the middle of next year contradict the idea of the social protection of the citizens of Russia under reform conditions?"--RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA put such a question to A. Chubays. "The government doesn't intend to give up voucher privatization," Anatoliy Borisovich answered without batting an eyelid. "On the contrary, it intends to implement in full those obligations which it voluntarily undertook beginning with the August (1992) presidential edict which the Supreme Soviet attempted to revoke three times and which your newspaper and other such publications repeatedly severely criticized. Our plan is to discharge our obligations despite any criticism whatever of any political forces." And such majestic dignity, such passion for social justice resounded in these words that my first impulse was to go up to Anatoliy Borisovich, shake his manly hand and... to confess in the presence of everyone to all that he would just wish. But then, when the magic of his words dissipated in the air of the well ventilated conference hall and those present again were able to soberly evaluate what had been said from the stage, an inner voice stopped me: we were talking about different things. I asked about what will happen from the middle of next year--that is, after the completion of voucher privatization and not before it! And Mister Chubays himself had just now talked again about the triumphal conclusion of the check's functions. Since nevertheless the idea of the social protection of the population, the principle of social justice will then be fulfilled? Or will only the "money bags" be admitted to the division of the most tasty remains of the state pie (the leftovers--the sweetmeats), and will the destitute majority of Russians, who have created this wealth by their own sweat and blood, have to just smack their lips at someone else's feast? In point of fact Mister Chubays simply didn't give an answer to this question. Why? Is it because he did not catch what in fact they asked him (with whom doesn't this happen...)? Or because he had nothing to say essentially? Although one may think that he answered precisely and clearly: the remaining property will be sold off for cash. Naturally, to those who have it. Including to the one who has become rich from machinations with vouchers. That is why the chief Russian privatizer so coldly "kicked" RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. And was it not in order to divert the attention of the hall from problems of social protection and to turn it to anxious thoughts about perfidious "opponents of reform"? The chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of State Property continually emphasizes that, according to the data of sociological surveys, more than 60 percent of Russians simultaneously approve his privatization offspring. There it is, he says, the people's love, the support of the people of labor. But if everything is in fact so good, why then did this strange people vote so in unison against the "Russia's Choice" bloc, one of whose leaders is the respected Mister Chubays? Why then did Gaydar, Chubays and others start fussing so after the elections, promising the people considerably more concern about their social rights than now? Or were these promises only words? As for the favorite references to sociological questions, then here we haven't a leg to stand on. The fact is that these same sociologists predicted a smashing victory for "Russia's Choice" in the elections. Would it appear that the sociologists are asking the wrong people?
