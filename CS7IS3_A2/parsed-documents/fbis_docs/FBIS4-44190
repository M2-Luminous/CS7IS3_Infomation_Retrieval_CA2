The best result for the Greens is useless if the Social Democrats do not succeed in improving their chances considerably. Thus, Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer instructed his colleagues at the Laender Council during the weekend [25-26 June] to spare the SPD in the next few months. Not so much to please their own supporters but to attract Scharping's voters, the Greens are trying to get rid of the last elements of their image as a middle-class nightmare. One liter of gasoline should only cost five German marks once sufficient three-liter cars are available. The withdrawal from NATO has been postponed to the distant future, and everything that costs money will be calculated carefully. This sounds like an appeal to the floating voters of the center parties and seems to be addressed to Scharping's supporters: Nobody should any longer have to vote for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union out of fear of a coalition between the SPD and the Greens. The message of the Laender Council of the Greens was that by no means do the Greens want to be responsible if the Kohl government should not be voted out of power on 16 October. The following impression is strengthening: The more the Greens orient themselves toward reality, the more social democratic their programs become. In practice, the ecological party has the task of forcing the SPD to implement its own program. For the Greens, the alternative for 16 October is clear: Kohl/Kinkel versus Scharping/Fischer, and "continuation of the current situation" versus "change."
