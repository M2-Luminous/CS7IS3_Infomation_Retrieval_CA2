FR940725-0-00111 FR940725-0-00013 (6) The State must indicate the number of unduplicated beneficiaries to which it intends to provide waiver services in each year of its program. This number will constitute a limit on the size of the waiver program unless the State requests and the Secretary approves a greater number of waiver participants in a waiver amendment. (7) In determining the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a waiver year, for waiver estimates that apply to persons with mental retardation or related conditions, the agency may include costs of Medicaid residents in ICFs/MR that have been terminated on or after November 5, 1990. (8) In submitting estimates for waivers that include personal caregivers as a waiver service, the agency may include a portion of the rent and food attributed to the unrelated personal caregiver who resides in the home or residence of the recipient covered under the waiver. The agency must submit to HCFA for review and approval the method it uses to apportion the costs of rent and food. The method must be explained fully to HCFA. A personal caregiver provides a waiver service to meet the recipient's physical, social, or emotional needs (as opposed to services not directly related to the care of the recipient; that is, housekeeping or chore services). FFP for live-in caregivers is not available if the recipient lives in the caregiver's home or in a residence that is owned or leased by the caregiver. (9) In submitting estimates for waivers that apply to individuals with mental retardation or a related condition, the agency may adjust its estimate of average per capita expenditures to include increases in expenditures for ICF/MR care resulting from implementation of a PASARR program for making determinations for individuals with mental retardation or related conditions on or after January 1, 1989. (10) For a State that has HCFA approval to bundle waiver services, the State must continue to compute separately the costs and utilization of the component services that make up the bundled service to support the final cost and utilization of the bundled service that will be used in the cost-neutrality formula. (g) The State, at its option, may provide for an independent assessment of its waiver that evaluates the quality of care provided, access to care, and cost-neutrality. The results of the assessment should be submitted to HCFA at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the approved waiver-period and cover the first 24 or 48 months of the waiver. If a State chooses to provide for an independent assessment, FFP is available for the costs attributable to the independent assessment.
