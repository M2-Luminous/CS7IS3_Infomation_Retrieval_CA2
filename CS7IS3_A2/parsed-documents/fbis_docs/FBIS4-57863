Yesterday, Insulza discussed the situation on the Caribbean island with U.S. Ambassador Curtis Kamman, whom he summoned to disclose the Chilean stance regarding this subject of continental interest. Referring to the meeting, Insulza said: "I think everyone (the countries) is aware that military action would be inappropriate." President Bill Clinton has mentioned the possibility of direct action to restore democracy in Haiti. Moreover, Insulza stated that Chile regards the appointment of a president in Port-au-Prince other than Jean-Bertrand Aristide as unacceptable. Insulza explained that an agreement was reached with the U.S. ambassador to channel any actions referring to the situation in Haiti through multilateral organizations such as the OAS and the United Nations. Insulza voiced support for the blockade against Haiti, noting that it entails neither food nor medicines. He added: "For many years this is all the people of Haiti have had access to." Insulza also disclosed that the Chilean ambassador to Haiti, Luis Larrain, is currently in Santiago for consultations, but that he will soon return to Port-au-Prince.
