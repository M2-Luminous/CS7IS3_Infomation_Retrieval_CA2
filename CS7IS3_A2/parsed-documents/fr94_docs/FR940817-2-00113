The petitioner proposes that bohenin be the common or usual name for this triglyceride. DATES: Written comments by October 17, 1994.

Lin, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;206), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;418&hyph;3103. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 201(s) and 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 321(s) and 348(b)(5)) and the regulations for affirmation of GRAS status in ยง170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Fuji Oil Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan, has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0407), proposing that a triglyceride containing behenic and oleic acids be affirmed as GRAS for use as a tempering aid and as an antibloom agent in chocolate and chocolate coatings. The petitioner proposes that bohenin be the common or usual name for this triglyceride. The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in ยง170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and ยง170.35 is filed by the agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation. The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the Federal Register in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c). Interested persons may, on or before October 17, 1994, review the petition and file comments with the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments should be filed and should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that would be helpful in determining whether the substance is, or is not, GRAS for the proposed use. In addition, consistent with the regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation by review of and comment on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice. A copy of the petition (including the environmental assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: August 5, 1994. Fred R. Shank, Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20129 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
