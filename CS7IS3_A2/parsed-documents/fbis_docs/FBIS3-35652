Moscow Thinks It Is Time for Azerbaijan To Stop"] [Text] The foreign ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia are scheduled to meet early next week in Moscow. Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned this from sources at the Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry. It is expected that the negotiators will continue to discuss the Russian plan for a peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. So far, the Russian side has not managed to have all parties to the conflict approve the plan: Yerevan and Khankendi (Stepanakert) backed Moscow's initiative in principle, but the Baku authorities set a precondition for approving the peace plan. In particular, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov ruled out a constructive dialogue with the Armenian side until the republic's occupied territories are liberated. It is precisely this demand that caused a postponement of the meeting of the Russian, Azerbaijani, and Armenian presidents scheduled for 25 January. No new date for the summit has so far been announced. Notably, Moscow's call on the conflicting parties immediately to cease fire along the entire front line came at a time when the Azerbaijani Army regained the initiative for the first time in many months and managed to advance significantly along the northern and southern axes. In January, Azerbaijan reestablished control over settlements in Agdara and Kelbadzhar districts, which had earlier been occupied by Armenian units, and also a highway from Agdara to Ter-Ter and Kelbadzhar. Moreover, according to preliminary reports from the combat zone, in the past few days Azerbaijani troops came close to the Kelbadzhar-Lachin road. In the front's southern sector, an offensive on Fizuli, a district center, continues. To all appearances, Yerevan and Khankendi did not expect a large-scale offensive from the Azerbaijani side. According to the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, military units made up primarily of undertrained recruits were urgently moved from Armenia to the combat area. Despite that, the Armenian side continues to retreat. Azerbaijan's military successes have drastically boosted President Geydar Aliyev's approval rating, and currently it is clear that Aliyev's New Year promise to the nation that all the occupied territories will be liberated within a few months was based on the head of state's firm confidence in the national army's ability to carry out offensive operations. While officials in Moscow and Yerevan keep speculating about how Aliyev managed to strengthen his army within so short a time, the Baku authorities keep silent and do not rush to deny reports carried by a whole range of Russian publications that the bulk of the revitalized army is made up of Afghan mujahidin. Moscow's urgent appeal to stop combat operations has presented the Azerbaijani leader with a difficult dilemma: Either to make concessions and to agree to negotiate with the Armenian side, or to ignore Russian diplomatic pressure. In the former case Aliyev risks losing support of the republic's population; in the latter he might force Moscow to look for different methods of pressure on the current Azerbaijani leadership.
