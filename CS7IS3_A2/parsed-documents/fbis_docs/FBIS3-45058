The six-lane expressway will require an investment of 3.6 billion yuan, to be jointly provided by the highway administration of the municipal government and the Tianhe Company from Hong Kong, the officials said. The expressway, starting from the Madian cloverleaf on the northeast and ending at the Badaling Great Wall, one of Beijing's chief tourist attractions, will also greatly improve Beijing's link with Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, which now account for one- fifth of the traffic flow to the capital, the officials added.
