Tubdain, director of the regional department of public health, said that Tibet's population was expected to rise to 2.5 million from 2.2 million at the end of 1993. He said that the birth rate in Tibet was 23.4 per thousand in 1993, compared with the nation's average of about 11 per thousand. "Tibet's population has more than doubled to 2.2 million since the early 1950s," he said, adding that Tibetans account for 90 percent of the region's population. The region's population rose by 36,000 during the 1992-93 period, he said. The average life expectancy of Tibetans is currently 65, up from 36 in the early 1950s, he said. Tubdain said Tibet does not implement the family planning policy in the farming and pastoral areas. "Another factor was that Tibetans enjoy free medical care," he said.
