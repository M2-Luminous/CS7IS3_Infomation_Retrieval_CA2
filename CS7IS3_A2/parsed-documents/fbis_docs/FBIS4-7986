Jovanovska: "Snail-Like Steps of the White House"] [Text] "Do we have diplomatic relations with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] or not?" "Who is the U.S. secretary of state, Stephanopoulos or Christopher?" "Who is shaping U.S. policy toward this republic?" "Whose interests is President Clinton protecting?" These are almost unavoidable questions at present briefings in the State Department, threatening to make our small country a big subject for discussion. The whole U.S. press has numbered the "Macedonian question" as one of the weak points of President Clinton, even the pro-Democratic THE WASHINGTON POST, which could not keep quiet about the inexplicable -- and by U.S. standards timid -- attitude of the leader of a superpower, who had the courage to threaten China, North Korea, Japan, and the European Community, while he always has to feel the "pulse" of the Greek lobby whenever Macedonia is mentioned! Until what point will the establishment of diplomatic relations between Macedonia and the United States go at a "snail's pace" and why did the United States allow itself to be at the tail end of all those who long ago normalized their relations with this state? These are dilemmas in which our republic is most interested, particularly after the appointment two days ago of Victor Comras as chief of the U.S. liaison office, because whichever way we try to understand and interpret it, it still is not an embassy, and it still is not a diplomatic penetration. Although it is difficult to find answers from this distance, judging by what various official and non-official sources say, there is a conflict of interests (political) between the State Department and the White House, due to which, as Comras himself stated, the decision on full diplomatic relations is yet to come. In order to confirm this claim, it is worthwhile making a small recapitulation. Namely, as a result of synchronized recognition by the EEC countries and of stronger pressures by the State Department for recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations with Macedonia, on 9 February the White House announced its decision to approach this action, naming a number of conditions which were positively met in President Kiro Gligorov's reply. Soon Secretary of State Warren Christopher conveyed an unequivocal message saying that "the United States is interested in maintaining the integrity and stability of Macedonia," explicitly stating that any possible attempts at its destabilization would be met with U.S. countermeasures. In the meantime, Victor Comras was appointed future ambassador to Macedonia. However, nobody knew until yesterday when he would come, and on what position. After all, it seems that the March meeting with the Greek priests and influential Greek Americans, one of whom is a big financier of the Democratic Party and the other an adviser of the President himself, who is doing his best to "conceal the traces" of the "Whitewater" affair, was fatal. The outcome is known -- as Senator Frank McKloskey stated publicly, and the White House implemented it tactfully, the United States froze the establishment of diplomatic relations with Macedonia, appointing Matthew Niemitz as special envoy, who was designated to find a solution for the dispute with Greece, something that cannot be solved for two whole years. Apparently, the new formula of Clinton and Stephanopoulos is to link the establishment of diplomatic relations with the negotiations -- with the aim of keeping the question permanently open, and to avoid the inconvenient pressures from the one or the other side, even from the inside, from the State Department, which is still on the "Macedonian line," assessing the prolongation as a great danger for the stability of the region. However, despite the great influence of the Greek lobby (particularly its money and votes), it is difficult to understand that a destructive policy, as is the Greek in this case, can deserve the support of a country which is pledging for democracy and peace, which is subordinating its foreign policy to the state, national, and generally accepted interests. Moreover, all the U.S. efforts to protect Macedonia from the spreading war are undermined by Greece with its embargo and other actions. The visit of Shalikashvili to Macedonia was obviously the axis of the "equilibrium" which should keep balance between the non- establishment of diplomatic relations and the determination to maintain the statehood of Macedonia, and at the same time it represents an indirect reply to the revealed Greek plans for the creation of a security zone in Macedonia under some more convenient circumstances. However, Macedonia is no more satisfied with indirect support and "slow recognition," especially because it is evident that the "slow pace" is misinterpreted and misused, turned back on the United States as a boomerang, if it really means what it publicly states and if there are no other reasons for the tactics. For now, the arguments that President Clinton is making cautious diplomatic moves with the aim of maintaining peace are very strong, as well as that U.S.-Macedonian relations are moving upwards, which becomes more evident if we remember his firm stance when he entered the White House more than a year ago. In a way, the statement of spokesman McCurry is another confirmation, according to whom "a number of steps should be taken" -- not stating exactly until when and how many. Nonetheless, the disposition in the United States and the growing critics of Clinton's "Macedonian policy" can speed the pace, because with such an internal conflict, with such critics in the press, and with such a freedom-loving public opinion, it is becoming hard to endure.
