The total sum will be 120 million U.S. dollars, the State Science and Technology Commission revealed today. "China develops high technologies mainly on its own strength, but it also welcomes assistance from abroad," said Huang Qitao, deputy director of the commission. The country started building its high-tech industry in 1988, under the "torch plan". Last year there were more than 10,000 high-tech firms nationwide, with 700,000 workers. Among them, 4,000 are overseas-funded companies. Domestic sales and exports of high-tech products will make up 25 percent of China's gross national product and export volume by the year 2000, according to the government blueprint. The new materials, energy, biological technology, electronics and information industries, and environmental protection are highlights on China's high-tech plan.
