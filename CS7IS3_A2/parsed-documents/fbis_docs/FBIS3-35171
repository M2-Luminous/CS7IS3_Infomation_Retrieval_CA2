Had this been true, U.S. national security would appear fragile and more like a paper tiger just when various U.S. sources testify to the opposite. Ambassador 'Imran said what is true is that the continuation of U.S. threats and UN sanctions against Libya represent a threat to stability in the Middle East. He noted that the Arab League is continuing its efforts to settle the Libyan-Western crisis in a way that would protect Libya's dignity and sovereignty and remove the misunderstanding between it and the countries concerned. Ambassador 'Imran added that what has been clear since the first UN Security Council resolution was issued against Libya is that the Western countries have exploited the Security Council and the international situation to pass resolutions without fear from any party. He expressed the view that these resolutions are contrary to the UN Charter, the constitution of the international organization, which confirms the right of every state to exercise sovereignty over its own territory. He explained that these resolutions set a serious precedent which shakes the confidence of the nations in this organization. For this reason the Arab League has called for a suitable solution to this crisis.
