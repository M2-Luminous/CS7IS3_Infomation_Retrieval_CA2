Following last night's meeting with government officials, the Chapare coca growers were today satisfied with the progress. [Begin coca growers' leader Evo Morales recording] At the start of the meeting, the government apologized to coca growers for having accused them of producing drugs. [end recording] He added that the government is also willing to end the forceful eradication of plantations: [Begin recording] This will definitively ease social tension in tropical Chapare and prevent confrontations. This is basically what we have accomplished. It is not enough. Discussions should go deeper into the technicalities and the institutional framework of alternative development to see how the government can guarantee funds for true alternative development. [end recording] Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, adviser to coca growers, said the end of forceful eradication in return for peasants joining the voluntary eradication plan -- which involves financial benefits per eradicated hectare -- is a trap by the government. In an effort to prevent coca growers from signing an agreement to this end, Barrenechea went today to the Labor Ministry where a final meeting is being held to consider the subject. [passage omitted] Coca growers have backed down on their decision to sign an agreement on the topics agreed upon last night. They will not agree to any type of eradication. They admitted, however, that there are new illegal coca farms in Chapare. They said they will defend them, because -- as they put it -- the government is to blame. [Begin Morales recording] In the face of the unfulfilled promises and the lack of alternative development, we have no alternative but to plant coca. The peasants are not to blame for planting coca. It is the free market policy, the free importation policy which is encouraging coca growing, not just in Bolivia but in the entire Andean region. [end recording]
