Hence, the problem of foreign exchange system reform must be placed high on the government agenda. Commenting on Shanghai's strategy for economic development, Shanghai CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) members, who are now attending the second session of the eighth municipal CPPCC, believed that the reform of the foreign exchange system will have different impact on the economy of different areas. For Shanghai, which is set to develop itself into an international economic, trade, and financial center, the reform will mean more opportunities for development, they said. Shanghai is presently the place where China's biggest stock exchange and biggest foreign currency swap center are situated. As China opens wider to the outside world, especially as it presses ahead with the foreign exchange system reform, spot foreign exchange markets, forward foreign exchange markets, and offshore financial markets will certainly be set up in turn. If Shanghai plans to become an international financial center, an important task is to energetically create conditions to establish itself as a center of all these financial markets. Shanghai CPPCC last year organized financial and trade experts into several panels to conduct investigations and studies. These panels presented their findings report at the current CPPCC session. The report entitled "Free Exchange of Renminbi and Shanghai's Financial Status" proposed principles for free exchange of renminbi: Unifying exchange rates of renminbi and relaxing control over foreign exchange. Free exchange of renminbi can start with the current account of international payment and then apply to capital account. Non-resident convertibility should be allowed first and then resident convertibility. Along this line, renminbi will finally become international money. To this end, the key task is to expand exports at a greater pace, strike a balance of international payments, and manage to reserve more foreign exchange. In addition, efforts should be made to stabilize currency values at home to lay a solid foundation for free exchange of renminbi. Shanghai should, in line with present conditions, relax control over foreign exchange and vigorously develop a national foreign exchange market to create the necessary conditions for achieving free exchange of renminbi. To achieve this, the findings report tabled specific plans: With the support of the People's Bank of China, setting up a national foreign currency swap center in Shanghai and gradually changing it into a spot foreign exchange market; instituting a well-managed unitary floating exchange rate system; setting up a forward foreign exchange market in Shanghai as soon as possible; appropriately relaxing control over foreign exchange; making loans in renminbi to certain foreign-funded financial institutions; and exploring ways for opening a limited offshore financial market in Shanghai.
