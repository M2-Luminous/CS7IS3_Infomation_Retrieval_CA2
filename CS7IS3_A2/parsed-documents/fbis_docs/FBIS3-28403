Yi is here to attend a meeting of chiefs of Korean overseas missions. The board of governors has expressed deep concern that North Korea rejects not only special but also general inspections. If this goes on, the IAEA's dignity will be stained and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) itself may be compromised, leading the board's member countries to share the position that the IAEA should take firm action against Pyongyang, Yi said. "Unless the contacts between the IAEA and North Korea bring a concrete solution on nuclear inspections by Feb. 21, the day the board of governors meets, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix will report to the United Nations Security Council that the IAEA can not guarantee that nuclear materials in North Korea won't be used for military purposes," Yi said. Yi envisioned two scenarios: The IAEA will adopt a moderate resolution if North Korea agrees to nuclear inspections by Feb. 21, or the agency will have to report to the UN Security Council on the matter if a solution is not found by then.
