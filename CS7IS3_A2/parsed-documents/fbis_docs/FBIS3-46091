They carefully listened to the deputies' views. In a group discussion held by the Aba autonomous prefectural delegation, provincial party Secretary Xie Shijie said that the province must never miss opportunities in the 1990's, otherwise Sichuan will suffer serious losses. After listening to some deputies' remarks, Xie Shijie said: The difficulties of the three minority autonomous prefectures and remote areas have received the close attention of the provincial party committee and government, and we are now discussing methods and measures with every one of you to resolve them. But the efforts of the central and provincial authorities alone cannot help completely resolve problems. I would like to quote Deng Xiaoping: Development is a fixed principle. In time of financial difficulties, you should not compete with other prefectures but should find ways suitable for yourselves. You can encourage individual and private economic sectors to development township and town enterprises with a free mind. The three autonomous prefectures have strong points in resources and should pay attention to the commodity economy. On economic development in ethnic prefectures, Xiao Yang said in a group discussion of the Ganzi autonomous prefectural delegation: Let us develop methods together, but to develop the economy is a fixed principle. In economic development, the three autonomous prefectures can rely on Chengdu and Chongqing. The provincial authorities are seeking ways for this to help ethnic prefectures with their development. Vice Governor Xu Shiqun attended a group discussion on education held by the Nanchong delegation. He listened to the deputies' views on government educational work. Xu Shiqun said: In making an economic leap, Sichuan must hold firm to the orientation of socialist education, give prominence to primary education, and make a success of the nine-year compulsory education. But some localities have not put this into effect. I hope every one of you will supervise this. There are still some problems to resolve in education, such as inadequate investment in education and low salaries for teachers. Now detailed regulations are being worked out for the implementation of the Teachers Law. In the future, the improvement of the teachers ranks will proceed under the legal system. While holding a group discussion with the Deyang delegation yesterday afternoon, Provincial People's Congress Chairman Yang Xizong and Governor Xiao Yang pointed out the need to resolve new problems emerging in the course of development. After listening to the remarks of some People's Congress deputies on the peasants' difficulties in selling their products due to an imperfect market mechanism, Yang Xizong expressed his full concern by saying: How to guide the peasants into the market is a new issue in the course of development and is also a problem we should work hard to resolve in our future rural economic development. First, we should do a good job in providing market forecasts and guide the peasants in arranging their production according to market information. Second, we should form an entity of trade, industry, and agriculture and improve all kinds of service in coordination with this. Third, we should establish a reserve system and a risk-bearing fund. A deputy named Li Yongshou said that because tax evasions are serious, Deyang City is ready to form a local taxation bureau. After hearing this, Xiao Yang remarked: This is very good, tax evasions must be resolved. You can work out a plan to form the bureau as soon as possible.
