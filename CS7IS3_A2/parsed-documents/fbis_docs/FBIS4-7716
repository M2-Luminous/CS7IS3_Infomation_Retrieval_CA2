The statement says that eight criminal acts of murder were committed in the specified period and that 16 people, mainly Muslims, lost their lives [as received]. Regarding claims by some foreign agencies that the murders were part of ethnic cleansing in and around Prijedor, the statement says that these were criminal acts by hitherto unidentified perpetrators, against whom criminal charges have been filed. "Teams of Ministry of Internal Affairs and security organs of the Srpska republic army are working intensively on collecting data in order to identify and arrest the perpetrators of the crimes," the statement says and adds that all possible preventive measures are being taken to stop any further escalation of crime. The interior ministry points to the fact that the events in Prijedor took place during the Muslim spring offensive, which -- through the crimes committed -- demonstrated that the Muslims were prepared to use all available means to achieve their goals. This contributed to the escalation of the interethnic conflicts in this area, where such conflicts had not occurred for a long time. The RS interior ministry appeals to all international institutions "which have influence in the area" to use it to protect the Serb population in the areas controlled by Muslims. They particularly demand that prisoners be treated according to international law. In this way extremists among the Serb people can also be opposed more effectively and better protection can be given to the Serb people and all citizens living on the RS territory, the statement says in conclusion.
