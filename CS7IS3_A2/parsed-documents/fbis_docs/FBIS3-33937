FBIS3-33937 "drnes022_c_94007" FBIS-NES-94-022 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Feb 1994 Egypt Political Islam Review: 'AQIDATI 25 Jan NC2801202394 NC2801202394 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] In its 25 January issue, Cairo 'AQIDATI publishes on pages 1, 12, and 13 a 1,200-word report on a new experiment started by the Awqaf Ministry involving setting up "fatwa boxes" in the its mosques, where ordinary people can place any questions that require an Islamic legal ruling. A 75-word report on the front page cites the mufti as denying a report published by a Gulf paper that included his name on a list of those who are defending British writer Salman Rushdie. Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi asked, "How could I defend a person who is mentally deranged and who had the nerve to mock Islam and its teachings and to ridicule God's prophet?" He then asserts that the Gulf paper's report was baseless, adding that he personally boycotts anyone who gets in touch with Rushdie. The paper also carries a 200-word report on page 2 saying that the secretariat general of the Higher Committee of Islamic Propagation in al-Azhar and the Awqaf Ministry are preparing for a series of intellectual meetings and seminars to be held during the month of Ramadan. The report says that these meetings will discuss major issues such as drugs and how to combat them, Islam and the environment, social problems, Islam and the extent of the comprehensive development, and unemployment. The discussions will also include other major issues, such as "the issue of apostasy, its gravity and controls, and also Islam's call for security and stability, as well as the nation's unity in its capacity as the safety valve and the challenge." The report adds that "the regiments of propagation, leaders, and writers will visit the governorates throughout the month to discuss these issues, with the participation of the moderate Islamic societies and there will be a special emphasis on the villages to rid them of false ideas." A 2,500-report is carried on pages 4 and 5 detailing the proceedings of a seminar organized by 'AQIDATI at the Arab Language College in al-Zaqaziq University. The seminar, which involved answers from various scholars and teachers to questions posed by the students, dealt with the causes of various interpretations of the Koran throughout history. Several scholars stressed that each person has the right to think, argue, and ask questions and should not just accept what earlier scholars and interpreters of Islam said without thinking. Dr. Su'ad Salih, dean of Islamic and Arab Studies at the al-Mansurah Branch of al-Azhar University, then explains the Koran's rules on women's dresses. In reply to a question by one of the students about the causes of the phenomenon of terrorism and whether the Islamic groups are involved, Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Salih, dean of the Religion and Propagation College in al-Zaqaziq University, says: "There are several expressions that we have become used to hearing from the Western media, such as fundamentalist and Muslim terrorism. These are used by the Western media, which is financed by the Jews to make people frightened of Islam. This media does not differentiate between an observant Muslim and what it calls terrorists and extremists." He quotes Prophet Muhammad as urging his followers not to exaggerate or go to extremes in their religion. Giving the historic reasons for this phenomenon, he says: "The first reason is that religious teaching is neutralized and completely separate from civic teaching, which has no interest in teaching religion except on the margin and the marks given for this subject are not added to the total marks. The second reason is that there is a group of people who have taken it on themselves to attack religion and to call for moral decadence. Extremism in decadence leads to extremism in religion. Hence the state must tackle these two causes to eliminate the phenomenon of terrorism." The seminar then discusses the plight of Muslims in Bosnia and elsewhere and concludes that the Muslims themselves are to be blamed for this because they are divided and attack each other. Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im al-'Arabi, teacher of literature and criticism at the Arab Language College, says on this issue that: "The Islamic world must use economic boycott and political pressure in support of its causes. We have to preach and contribute our money to support our brothers dispersed in the world." On pages 8 and 9, the paper carries questions from several readers asking for a religious ruling on various issues. Included in them is a question from Wajih al-Jamal from al-Qalyubiyah asking about the meaning of terrorism and Islam's concept of it. Shaykh Mahmud 'Abd-al-Wahhab Fayid replies that Islam calls for moderation in all matters in our life, citing several Koranic verses. He adds that Islam rejects terrorism, whether from the rulers or the ruled, because terrorism means the use of violence and frightening people. A 350-word column written by Majdi Salim on page 10 criticizes the Egyptian media's way of confronting the western immoral and debased programs that are transmitted through satellite. He says this media tries to outdo the Western one by transmitting still more decadent programs and liberalism that defies laws and controls. He argues that the only way to combat this cultural invasion is to strengthen religious beliefs at school, home, work, and through the media. On the same page the paper carries a 700-word report on a seminar on "intellectual extremism" held at Cairo University. The report begins by citing Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi's explanation of the origin of the word extremism. He adds that Islam calls on its followers to be moderate in all their affairs and daily life. Muslim thinker Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd lashes out at those "who do not differentiate between piety and extremism and swear that there are no moderates. I tell them that the Egyptian people are moderate, perform the prayers, and fast during the month [of Ramadan]." He then adds that the crises facing us are the result of the custom among Egyptians, Arabs, and Muslims to regard "reading as an absolute evil to the extent that Arab and Muslim thinking was afflicted by a great imbalance in logical education and this is manifested by the absence of the literature of dialogue." After stressing the universality of Islam, he says that: "Islam's priorities today are to guide its people toward it and to strengthen it and not to call on people to follow it. The evil afflicting the Islamic groups from east to west is that they are preoccupied with Islam at the expense of Muslims and they believe that their mission is to train jurisprudents only." Dr. Mufid Shihab, Cairo University President, differentiates between extremism, violence, and terrorism and explains each one. He says extremism is deviation that has not reached the extent of harming others, while violence means the use of force or the threat to use it against others, which is a violation of the law, while terrorism means the use of violence and force, contrary to the law, not with the aim of harming a certain person but to cause general destruction and ruin. He adds that: "?he terrorist is a criminal and has to be dealt with according to the law." He th?n conjectures that dialogue and not violence or punishment is the only way to deal with an extremist who does not harm others. He says that "extremism is a first step that might turn into terrorism. We must stop it before it turns into terrorism. Therefore, the treatment differs from case to case. There can be no dialogue with the terrorist or criminal but there has to be a dialogue with the extremists in an attempt to explain the truth." Dr. 'Ali-al-Din Hilal, teacher at the College of Economics and Political Science, Cairo University, then argues that extremism exists in the mind and behavior and that there is extremism not only among Islamic groups but also among some Christian and Jewish groups and among various ethnic groups in other parts of the world. 'AQIDATI carries on page 16 an 800-word report on a question and answer session held by a "religious convoy" with the students of Alexandria and al-Mansurah Universities. The questions deal with the contradicting fatwas, population control, drug addiction, and other issues. Following a teacher's reply to a question on drug addiction, Dr. Muhammad Hasan al-Hafnawi, teacher at al-Azhar's School of Medicine, answers a question by Suhayr Muhammad al-Bardisi on the reasons for the spread of terrorism in this way that harms Islam. He says that: "Ignorance is the main reason. The extremist has filled his brain with wrong information and followed it and thus has turned into an extremist. He would not have become so had he understood his religion well. The first step to reform him is science, then conviction, and then guidance of the right will. True religious knowledge is the safety valve against deviation. All the forces must rally for this decisive confrontation. Who will defend Egypt if its sons lose faith in it?" The Awqaf minister then answers a question on why the state has canceled some religious television programs. He explains that each program has its own temporary objective and is meant to tackle a specific point. Management then replaces it with new programs that raise new issues for debate. On page 20, the paper carries a 900-word report on an interview with Moroccan Muslim thinker Muhammad al-Wazzani in which he discusses the plight of Bosnia's Muslims, the situation in Somalia, and the spread of Islam in Africa. He also asserts that the "terrorist actions" in Algeria and Egypt "have nothing to do with Islam and are alien to our Muslim societies."
