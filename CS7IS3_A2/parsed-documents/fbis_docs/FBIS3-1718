Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of XINHUA news agency Hong Kong branch, accused the British side of playing mathematics games, saying Hong Kong residents should establish a monitoring group to supervise the construction of the new airport. Zhu said, "We have reiterated that the airport should be constructed in accordance with the memorandum of mutual understanding. But the fourth proposal put forward by the British side still poses a big problem: who should be responsible for the more than 20 billion H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars (2.564 billion U.S. dollars) debt." He accused the Hong Kong Government of intending to shift the debt burden to the Special Administrative Region Government of Hong Kong by changing the provisional airport authority into the so-called airport corporation. On the composition of the monitoring organization, he said this needs further consultation as it is the Hong Kong residents who pay for the construction of the airport.
