The blood donation problem has become more distressing because of the simple fact of the danger of the spread of AIDS, as well as the increase of accidents resulting from the increase in the number of vehicles in our country. We interviewed Agim Kociraj, director of the Blood Transfusion Service, about this problem. Unattributed reporter: Mr. Agim, how is such a situation created? Kociraj: As the public is aware, three cases of HIV positive AIDS infection have been identified in Albania. The very important role of the Blood Transfusion Service in the spread of this infection is also known. At this very important moment, we have managed to exert 100 percent control over the amount of blood collected from the blood donation system with regard to the presence of this very dangerous infection. However, the fact that all of the blood is 100 percent controlled does not mean that the danger is completely eliminated. Everyone knows that the methodology used cannot identify the presence of the infection in its first phases. It is known that this infection can be reduced at minimum, but cannot be eliminated. In order to reduce to a minimum the possibility of the infection spreading through the blood, it is necessary to include in the blood donation system blood donors from groups that less endangered than the majority of the population insofar as carrying this infection. The fact that in Albania the system operates with 100 percent paid donors does not help much in this direction. This for the very obvious fact that a small group of paid blood donors are always one of the most endangered groups insofar as being an AIDS virus carrier. What is envisioned, and what is being done in this direction? Viewing the problem with much seriousness, the Health Ministry, in cooperation with the Blood Transfusion Service, has passed a new regulation that anticipates collecting blood from less endangered groups, first from the relatives and friends of patients who need blood in our hospitals. This has considerable importance because family members and relatives are of the less endangered groups insofar as carrying the AIDS virus. For this reason, we think we should cooperate with the relatives, family members, visitors, and friends of the sick who need blood, so that they prove their bond with the patients, considering that these patients not only need blood but need the best ensured blood. This is the short-term program. The long-term program contains a very broad propagandistic campaign for the creation of a completely new tradition that has not heretofore existed in Albania -- the establishment of voluntary, unpaid blood donation. This program includes governmental and non-governmental institutions such as the Albanian Red Cross and the Health Education Directorate. Enormous assistance by the mass media is absolutely necessary in this direction. For this reason, I take advantage of the opportunity to first thank Albanian Television, which is showing interest in the introduction of this program.
