The residents of villages along the road joining the guerrillas' Pailin headquarters to Cambodia's second city of Battambang, fled along with retreating government soldiers as Khmer Rouge rebels advanced. The rebels backed-up by three tanks, overran a strategic government military base at Treng, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Battambang early Thursday, a humanitarian relief official said. It was the first time since 1989 that civilians in the area have been displaced on such a large scale by fighting, the official said. A government official said government troops destroyed a Khmer Rouge tank, before retreating 10 kilometers (six miles) to Sdao. Khmer Rouge radio, however, said Friday that the guerrillas had seized a government tank. The government troops then regrouped and counter-attacked, forcing the guerrillas back out of Treng late Thursday, the official said, adding: "But the situation is still quite serious there." A Police officer told AFP by phone from Battambang that the government troops were back in Treng, but were facing hit and run attacks from the Khmer Rouge. A curfew from 8 PM to 5 AM has been imposed in Battambang city for fear of guerrilla sabotage, the officer said. Treng was the government forces' frontline position before they launched their offensive on Pailin, advancing some 40 kilometers (25 miles) and capturing the Khmer Rouge's resource-rich "capital" on March 19. Government commanders vowed to hold Pailin "forever" but lost the town to a guerrilla counter-attack on April 19. Explaining the battlefield set-backs, one government officer said the rank and file troops were demoralised and disillusioned with corrupt leaders and felt they had little incentive to risk their lives. The soldiers said they were promised a share of the spoils from capturing the gem and timber rich Pailin region which bankrolled the guerrilla organisation, he said. In the end, however, most foot soldiers got nothing, with some even complaining that they did not receive their meagre salaries, while certain superiors laid claim to all valuables, he said. Further north in Banteay Meanchey Province, the government troops were holding their ground near the normally bustling border town of Poipet, a government official said. Heavy fighting has taken place around Poipet over the past three days as Khmer Rouge guerrillas tried to capture the town, which lies on the Thai-Cambodian border. "But we still hold Poipet. We are still there," the government official said. Khmer Rouge radio said six government soldiers were killed and 10 wounded, when guerrillas attacked and seized a former royalist stronghold at Rumchang and three nearby villages, in the Ampil district of Banteay Meanchey Province Thursday. The Khmer Rouge's clandestine radio added that the guerrillas had destroyed two munitions depots. An official from the Ministry of Defence, however, admitted the guerrillas had attacked Rumchang and the nearby villages, but dismissed their claim to have captured it. "The Khmer Rouge have already withdrawn," he said adding: "They still use the same hit and run tactics, so we did not lose Rumchang.
