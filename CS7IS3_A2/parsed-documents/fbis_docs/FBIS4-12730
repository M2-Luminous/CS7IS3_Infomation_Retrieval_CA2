Although State Prosecutor Moshe Lador had asked for prison sentences to be commuted to community service, Na'or imposed prison terms of eight months each on IDB Bankholding chairman Refa'el Recanati and Mordekhay Einhorn, former chief operations officer of Bank Le'umi. Eliyahu Kohen, then Discount's deputy chairman, received a six-month prison sentence. Only Giyora Gazit, former managing director of Bank Hapo'alim, received a three-month prison sentence commuted to community service. Aharon Me'ir, former managing director of Bank Mizrahi, and Udi Recanati, who headed Bank Discount's stock market operations at the time, were not given prison sentences. Na'or imposed fines of NIS [new Israeli shekels] 600,000 each on Refa'el Recanati, Einhorn and Me'ir. Gazit and Kohen each received a NIS 500,000 fine, while Udi Recanati was fined NIS 400,000. Hayim Buksbaum, the former head of Le'umi financial division and Dan Bavli, who audited Le'umi's books were each fined NIS 109,000. Mizrahi's accountant, Dov Nave, was fined NIS 90,000. Banks Hapo'alim, Le'umi, Discount, Mizrahi and IDB Bankholding were each fined NIS 1 million. Bank Discount has already set aside the NIS 1m. to pay the fine, according to last year's balance sheet. Na'or noted in her 26-page decision that despite all of the mitigating circumstances that might have justified lighter sentences, the scope of the fraud and the economic damage it brought upon the banks, their shareholders and the state is so large that even after 10 years it is impossible to let the affair go by.
