Speaking to the Hannover NEUE PRESSE (Friday [11 March] edition), Kinkel referred however to the dispute over international deployments by the Bundeswehr. This is an absolutely central issue, over which Germany risks being damaged by the SPD's blockade. The SPD must "force itself to make a turnaround" on this, Kinkel demanded. Even a clarification by the Federal Constitutional Court does not "release the SPD from its share of the responsibility to find the necessary political solution on the necessary amendment to the Basic Law on Bundeswehr deployment." The Federal Republic has every reason to strengthen the United Nations in terms of organization, personnel, and finance, Kinkel said. Germany has no cause to "humble itself." It must represent its interests, but it also has to realize that these interests are linked to those of other states. "We adhere to our culture of restraint," the minister added.
