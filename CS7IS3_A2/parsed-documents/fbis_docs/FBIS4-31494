Having "cleansed itself" from the Cernak wing, the "nationals" agreed that only a Slovak national could join the party, the independent daily SME writes. It writes that the rejection of a joint slate with Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) at the SNS congress on Saturday [4 June] has created conditions for the SNS to assume after the autumn early elections a position usual for radical parties in stabilized democratic countries. The only unpredictable step was the abolition of the post of honorary chairman which affected the advocates of the rejected HZDS coalition, Jozef Prokes and Marian Andel. Though speculations about the SNS's split did not materialize at the congress, one surprise should be expected before the elections: the participation of "some (former) leading representatives" of the SNS on the HZDS slate, the paper says. The pro-Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) daily SLOVENSKY DENNIK writes that the SNS will turn into a discussion club at the best, comparable with the Christian Social Union or Matica Slovenska (cultural and educational organization). The paper points out that it should not be forgotten that Meciar had sent a clear message to the SNS, though only three days before the congress -- he offered the SNS pre- and post-election cooperation. "The nationals have turned down the HZDS" and thus "voluntarily stepped on the road to power from which there is no divergence.... The road-roller from Zlata Idka (Meciar) is already rolling along it and he, as it is well known, uses no by-passes, not to say traffic direction indicators," the paper concludes.
