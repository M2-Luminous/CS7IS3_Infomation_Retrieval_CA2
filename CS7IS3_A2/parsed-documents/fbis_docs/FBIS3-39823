Mr. Mandela also said he was convinced there would be free and fair political campaigning throughout South Africa. He was speaking in Amsterdam at the conclusion of his visit to the Netherlands. [Begin recording] [correspondent Cliff Saunders] This Mr. Mandela and Mr. Carl Niehaus emphasized -- that every effort would be made to ensure that democratic, free, and fair elections were indeed held in South Africa. Disruption and intimidation would not be tolerated. [Niehaus] Every citizen of this country must have the freedom to participate in these elections, and we will convey that message very loud and clear through our negotiations with all the different parties. [Saunders] Asked about the competence of the peacekeeping force, Mr. Mandela expressed full confidence in the abilities of General Ramushwana to handle the problems presented by different ethnic groups coming together. [Mandela] The problems -- the teething problems -- that have manifested themselves -- I think he has handled them with great confidence. [Saunders] Mr. Mandela said he intended visiting Israel once a settlement had been achieved there, and he referred to the meeting he had with Mr. Yasir 'Arafat in the Netherlands yesterday. [Mandela] We have similar standpoints and similar aims. Both of us are freedom fighters. Both of us believe in the peaceful resolution of mutual problems, and I came here also to inform him of what efforts we are doing in our country and the progress that has been made. [end recording]
