FR940802-0-00022 FR940802-0-00008 As stated in the RFG final rule, EPA continues to believe that ethanol will not be excluded from the oxygenate market under the RFG program. Rather, EPA believes that many refiners will find it economically attractive to blend ethanol in RFG. As a result, EPA believes a market for ethanol will continue following implementation of the RFG program. The RFG program represents a major new market for oxygenates such as ethanol. Nevertheless, EPA has received comments stating that without promulgation of today's rulemaking or other similar measures, creation of additional ethanol and renewable oxygenate blending capacity beyond that currently underway is in doubt. EPA recognizes that concerns over the marketability of ethanol in RFG have created substantial uncertainty for ethanol producers and investors. EPA believes that today's action will reduce that uncertainty and make the RFG program consistent with long-running Congressional and Administration policies to promote renewable fuels. This program represents an attempt to harmonize the goals of greater reliance on renewable fuels and air quality improvements through the use of RFG. Specifically, the renewable oxygenate requirement will ensure that RFG regulations do not inappropriately limit the growth of the renewable oxygenate industry. It will ensure that several oxygenates will be used in the RFG program and provide the renewable oxygenates a minimum market. It should be noted that the program encourages the use of all renewable oxygenates, not any one renewable oxygenate (as discussed more fully in section III). By providing market certainty the program will encourage expanded private investment in new, more efficient and environmentally beneficial renewable fuel production technologies. Such potential renewable oxygenates include ethanol from cellulosic plant material and waste cellulose and MTBE derived from methanol which was produced from municipal solid waste, landfill gas, or sewage sludge. The program establishes a minimum 30% market share for renewable oxygenates. This level represents a market share for renewables that EPA believes would likely have been achieved through open competition with nonrenewable oxygenates in the absence of VOC emission restrictions, based on experience under the oxygenated fuels program. At this market share an estimated 1.7 volume percent (on an ethanol equivalent basis) of reformulated gasoline will be derived from renewable resources. EPA is promulgating the renewable oxygenate program because of the important benefits of the program. First, EPA believes the program will help conserve fossil energy resources and minimize any detrimental effects the reformulated gasoline program may have on energy consumption. Second, EPA believes that the program has the potential to provide global warming benefits by providing stimulus to the market to develop new, more efficient production processes for renewable oxygenates and their feedstocks. In addition, EPA believes that the program as structured maintains the environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program as promulgated on December 15, 1993, and has the potential to increase these benefits through the incentives it provides for increased ETBE use during the summer months. The reformulated gasoline program promulgated in December of 1993 is projected to cause an increase in fossil energy consumption, as discussed in more detail in sections III.H and VI of this notice. Today's action is intended to mitigate to some extent the increase in fossil fuel consumption that otherwise would result from implementation of the RFG program. Today's action also provides the certainty needed to encourage private investment in more advanced and energy-efficient production facilities and more diverse feedstock utilization. This will not only increase the fossil energy benefits of this program, but also provide the opportunity for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Today's action will also create incentives to utilize ETBE during the summer months. Its use, relative to MTBE or ethanol, has the potential to achieve slightly greater VOC emission reductions beyond those required by the final rule for RFG. Ethanol-containing gasoline, when mixed with other gasoline, causes the mixture to produce greater VOC emissions than the original fuels would produce. This can occur even in a vehicle fuel tank. This effect is called commingling and is discussed in sections III.C and VI of this notice and in the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the reformulated gasoline final rule. The effect of such commingling on VOC emissions is not controlled directly by the RFG program. As a result, to the extent that ETBE use displaces ethanol use during the summer months, additional VOC emission benefits are possible. In addition, ETBE possesses front-end distillation characteristics relative to both ethanol and MTBE which are also not controlled in the reformulated gasoline final rule, and which may provide further (though not quantifiable with any certainty at the present time) VOC emission benefits during the summer should its use increase as a result of the incentives created by today's program. Finally, EPA believes that this program is designed in a way which provides maximum compliance flexibility for refiners and minimizes their burden. The program is an annual program with provisions for a refiner to average over the course of the year or trade credits with other refiners anywhere in the country. EPA believes that by designing the program in such a way, the objectives can be met at a minimum cost. These provisions are especially important during the initial startup of the program. While the renewable oxygenate program takes effect for refiners beginning December 1, 1994, individual refiners do not need to blend any renewable oxygenate into their gasoline until later in the year or at all if they so desire. They will just have to demonstrate that they met the requirements over the course of the entire year through either the blending of greater than 15% renewable oxygenates in the latter part of the year, or the purchase of credits from other refiners. As a result, the averaging and trading provisions effectively provide refiners with additional time to meet the initial requirements of the program.
