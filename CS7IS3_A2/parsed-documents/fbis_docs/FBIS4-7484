According to the schedule, the Russian minister's appearance in Bucharest was to take place a week after the parliamentary elections in Russia, the moment when the "Zhirinovskiy reality and diversion" were consecrated. Ilie Ilascu's sentence was causing maximum tension in Bucharest. Under those circumstances, the Russian Embassy's reaction, coupled with the two unambiguous factors of political reality, was causing a just perceptible fear. General Pavel Grachev's visit and the signing of the accord already ran the risk of being interpreted as a gesture of succumbing to pressure. Two or three weeks later, with the impending visit of the U.S. President to Europe (Partnership for Peace, Moscow, and so forth), these fears were similarly intense, but had changed in content. The question asked was: Why is Grachev not coming, do the Russians not want to discuss things with us? Both the attention paid to the planned event and the radical change in the form of concern reflected a simple truth: Russia is the great power next to us that cannot be ignored or provoked. After 14 military cooperation accords concluded in the wake of 1989 between the Romanian Ministry of National Defense and the defense ministries in Western or neighboring countries, the 15th accord with Russia, which will be signed at the beginning of next week, has been interpreted in numerous ways. In fact, these documents resemble one another. As for differences, they lie in the form of military cooperation. Concluding the accord with Germany, the Romanian side was interested, for instance, in sending its officers for training by its partner. Ukraine (the last country with which such an accord was signed) is interested in having its naval officers trained in Romania. As for cooperation with Russia, we cannot ignore the fact that a major part of the Romanian Army's equipment, especially aviation, is of (ex)-Soviet origin. The political will and the substance of the security policy, which have brought about the conclusion of a number of such accords, are, however, alike. The strategy is to try to repeat Titulescu's [inter-war Romanian foreign minister] strategy immediately after World War I when he initiated a basic bilateral accord with the Soviet Union. The fate of a small country affected by the turbulent currents in the Balkans did not permit at that time, as indeed now, a strategy different from that of moving closer and strengthening, in every way, relations with the West, while maintaining amicable relations with Moscow. For the time being, however, the balance between the two great requirements is being achieved in a dynamic way by constantly adjusting to changes in the domestic and foreign political arena. The mechanism is moving, advancing along a road that, unfortunately, does not resemble a fast train track, but rather our homeland's roads. Guidance requires ability and it also requires the fulfillment of all the European commitments assumed so far, be they in the area of arms reduction or within the Partnership for Peace. To deny one component would be dangerous because it could compromise the entire thing.
