What does this mean--steps toward one another, a feeling out of the ground for negotiations? [Latifi] The official authorities of Tajikistan have yet to declare their readiness for negotiations. Officials are meeting one on one, but without authority, as private individuals. A group of high-ranking officials came here recently in the hope of winning the return of the refugees. This was the second such attempt, both ended in failure. Given the approach employed by the emissaries of Dushanbe officialdom, this is not surprising. For example, K. Kaimdodov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council, granted an interview to INTERFAX, in which (oh, simple soul!) he complained: Field work will soon be starting in the countryside, there is a shortage of manpower, and the refugees must for this reason return. [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What is the opposition's attitude toward the prospect of negotiations? [Latifi] We have always advocated negotiations. And the first step toward them, in our view, should be a meeting and agreements with the leadership of Russia, we recognize Russia's place in "big" geopolitics in the region also. We understand that it is very difficult to solve any questions within the former USSR, whatever it is now called, without Russia. But we see no mediating activity on the part of Russia as yet, unfortunately. Two institutions have been created in Russia for a resolution of the Tajik problem. The first is the interdepartmental commission chaired by A. Adamishin, deputy minister of foreign affairs. It has been in existence for quite some time, but has not met since last November. The second is the Tajik settlement mission, which was established in November by an edict of B. Yeltsin and is headed by Ambassador-at-Large A. Oblov. I have met with him three times and fully share his view of the need for a general--regional, political, interethnic--settlement in Tajikistan. We agreed for the time being not to notify the press of the contacts. But the agreement has to be broken. The Foreign Ministry is patently dragging out a settlement. We, on the other hand, believe that the process should be accelerated. [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What is forcing you to hurry? [Latifi] With the arrival of spring the development of events could assume a catastrophic nature. The passes and roads will be opened, and everything will be on the move. Colonel General B. Pyankov, commander of the collective peacekeeping force, who expressed serious concern at the state of affairs in Tajikistan, was in Moscow recently. When even the military believes that without negotiations with the opposition a catastrophe is inevitable, this speaks volumes. We need to listen to the sober voice of the army. If an escalation of the conflict begins, the war could, according to the forecasts of independent experts, carry over to Uzbekistan in connection with the fact that mass privatization has now begun there and tension has increased. All of Central Asia could flare up, and moreover, a Central Asian arc of war could interface with the Caucasus war. There would then be a great conflagration, about which we warned in our last statement. This is why the opposition is in a hurry to begin negotiations, to come to an agreement with Russia primarily. A statement addressed to President B. Yeltsin, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin, and the Federal Assembly has been published. We appeal to the Russian public also. It should be recognized that there will be no reforms in Russia and Russia itself even could explode unless the arc of fire in the south is put out in time. [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What, in your view, are the reasons for the procrastination over negotiations? [Latifi] They could be various: a desire to profit from the arms trade, for example, and also the voluntary or involuntary playing into the hands of the Tashkent regime. The latter is all but openly helping General Dostum in Afghanistan, an Uzbek by nationality. His deputy, General Aizi, declared plainly in an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA that his supporters were seeking to oust President Rabbani inasmuch as he is a Tajik. Just about half the population of Afghanistan is composed of Tajiks. The calculation, evidently, is that, after they have been suppressed in Afghanistan, Tajikistan could be pulled to pieces also and that it would disappear as an independent state. [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] So the first step toward a settlement should be, from your viewpoint, an official meeting of representatives of the opposition and Ambassador A. Oblov to discuss the conditions of the achievement of peace in Tajikistan. And how do you see the further development of events? [Latifi] The opposition devised its plan of action on 7 December of last year at the meeting in Tehran. It is set forth in the special document "Proposals for a Peaceful Settlement of the Military-Political Conflict in the Republic of Tajikistan," which was transmitted to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Office of the President. Via N. Nazarbayev and S. Niyazov the contents of the document were conveyed to the heads of state of the CIS. It was also sent to Butrus-Ghali and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Responding to our proposals, Ambassador Ramiro Paris-Ballon, the new representative of the UN secretary general, flew to Moscow. He is now actively trying to get the Tajiks to the negotiating table and has even traveled to Dushanbe and Gordnyy Badakhshan for this. We met twice: before and after the trip. It was proposed that the agenda of the negotiations consist of three questions: a political settlement of the situation in Tajikistan (which would include the creation of a State Council or Council of National Accord and also a provisional government made up of competent and neutral persons, an end to all the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the political confrontation and the civil war, and the release of all persons in detention in this connection); the disarmament and breakup of the so-called local self-defense force, armed detachments of the opposition, and special battalions of the MVD, National Security Committee, and Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan--formations in which the regime has as of late been registering on a general basis combatants from particular areas of the country (Kulyab, for example), providing them with a "legal roof." It is essential also to confiscate from the population weapons that are being held illegally; refugees, who should be returned to their permanent places of residence--with a guarantee of safety and social protection, return of seized assets, and so forth. We consider these three questions inseparable from one another. Paris-Ballon agreed with the need for their inclusion on the agenda. He has now gone to New York and reported on the results of his talks to the UN leadership and several days ago he met in Tehran with leaders of the Islamic resistance of Tajikistan. He is to determine the budget of the mission and specify the location of future negotiations. [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] You yourself speak about the possibility of an exacerbation of the situation by spring. It is obvious, therefore, that a settlement will require the presence of some peacekeeping contingents.... [Latifi] Even the Russian military openly acknowledges as a commonly known fact that the regime in Dushanbe is holding on exclusively thanks to the presence of the Russian Army. Were it to leave, the authorities would not last a day even: They would be swept away. These politicians, who came to Dushanbe with the support of Russian tanks, have in a year conclusively wrecked the economy, having brought the people to the brink of starvation. But we know that we cannot manage either today or tomorrow or the day after without Russia, and for this reason the problem of the presence of Russian military forces in Tajikistan has to be resolved. They could constitute the nucleus of a peacekeeping force, but, as A. Kozyrev and British Foreign Secretary D. Hurd say in a joint statement, Russia should for this obtain a UN mandate for peacekeeping activity. UN standards would specify precisely what the "blue helmets" are entitled to do and what they are not. The arms also would be under supervision, international observers would inspect them. Otherwise--there are troops in the region, they will be the peacekeepers. Today they will support one party to the conflict, tomorrow, another. We insist that the Tajik negotiations be conducted under the aegis of the United Nations. They need a serious guarantor, and their results need international recognition. Only then will the parties feel a sense of responsibility.
