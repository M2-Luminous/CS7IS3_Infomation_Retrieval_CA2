Technical details are as follows: 1. Silicon Microwave Devices Breakthroughs in 1993 were realized in development of broadband high-power devices such as the WD942 silicon broadband microwave pulsed power transistor, which in the 0.96-1.215-GHz range has a pulsed output power of 100 W and a pulse width of 10 �s, and the WD95I device, which in the 2.25-2.55-GHz range has a pulsed output power of 50 W and pulse width of 65 �s. 2. Optoelectronic Devices Advances have been made in research on high-power quantum-well laser diodes especially applicable to domestic all-solid-state lasers. Last year, the institute developed AlGaAs and InGaAs quantum-well laser diodes for solid-state laser pump sources--an achievement closely tracking the world state-of-the-art. 3. Micropackaging, Microassemblies/Micromodules In development of micropackaged devices, microassemblies and micromodules, the institute has made advances meeting early-9Os international standards. The HE48I-487 miniature VCO IC meets late-80s international standards. 4. Process Technologies In 1993 the institute undertook 10 military-product early-phase research projects, among which outstanding achievements were development of an all-planar process for fabricating the model E/D 2000-gate GaAs gate-array device and development of performance evaluation theory and methods for hardening and ruggedizing devices.
