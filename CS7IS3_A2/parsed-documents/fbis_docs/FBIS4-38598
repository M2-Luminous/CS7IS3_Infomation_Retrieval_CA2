UN experts are to be broadly involved in scrutinizing Ukraine's technical aid requirements under the thus drafted strategies, as well as in assessment of further cooperation prospects. A number of technical aid projects are reported to have been drafted by UN, which might be reduced to basically two types, to wit, immediate capital investment and technical cooperation designed to improve and upgrade Ukrainian experts' professional skills. The UN-sponsored "Systemic Reforms" project envisages aiding Ukraine in development of a national strategic-scope reform program based on comprehensive studies of Ukraine's domestic prices and markets. The "Human Resource Development" program focuses on Ukraine's human resource evaluation and social welfare to protect the society's underprivileged strata. It also covers health care, education, R&D support, copyright and intellectual property rights' protection in Ukraine. The "Environment, power industry and resource management" program encompasses the following areas: - nuclear safety policies; - the Chernobyl NPP's shut-down; - routine nuclear safety; - radiation monitoring and protection; - Chernobyl victims' rehabilitation; - Ukraine's power industry and fuel extraction. The latter area involves more specialized subprojects including "Development of national power industry strategies", "Systemic approaches to environmental effect appraisal", "Power industry management", "Application of power-saving technologies", "Conversion of power industry to coal- and gas-fired plants". The program's environmental section involves comprehensive ecological studies of the Dnieper River's basin and the Sea of Azov. The "sector reforms" project provides for aiding Ukraine in its infrastructure's modernization, industries' reorientation toward market demands. According to Inna Grigoyeva, Ukraine's chief expert with the National Center for International Technical Aid Application, the amount of UN financing has not been defined yet. The Agency for International Cooperation and Investments, which was instituted in September 1993, is in charge of coordinating the West's technical aid to Ukraine.
