The results for the other classes can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the representative class. The representative class for mobile home furnaces is gas fired mobile home furnaces, which is the most prevalent class of mobile home furnaces. For this representative class, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by the use of improved fan motor efficiency, level 2 adds a burner box damper, level 3 adds an improved heat exchanger, level 4 substitutes fan-assisted combustion and electronic ignition for the burner box damper and improved heat exchanger, level 5 assumes condensing of the flue gases and level 6 adds continuous furnace modulation. Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for oil-fired mobile home furnaces and are found tabulated in Section 1.5 of the Technical Support Document. 2. Payback Period Table 4&hyph;8 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative class of the product. For this representative class, standard levels 1 and 2 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year. Payback for all classes of mobile home furnaces may be found in Tables 4.3 and 4.4 of the Technical Support Document.
