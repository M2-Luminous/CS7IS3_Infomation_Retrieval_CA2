Many of the male detainees were taken away for refusing to join the vastly outnumbered force defending Bihac against a battle-hardened corps of the Bosnian army advancing from the south of the pocket toward Velika Kladusa, its main town, relatives and members of international relief organizations say. No firm figure on the number of detainees is available, although a variety of independent sources put it at between 400 and 700. The speaker of Bihac's self-proclaimed parliament, Bozidar Sicel, admitted that 150 people have been arrested. He dismissed them as "spies or agents spreading disinformation" in the intra-Moslem conflict and said searches of their homes had turned up weapons and explosives. The arrests began on June 10, the day the Bosnian army launched an offensive against Bihac, in the northwest corner of the republic, relief officials say. The detainees are being held at a poultry farm converted into a detention camp near the border with Croatia. A member of the International Committee of the Red Cross gained access to the camp over the weekend after a week of pressuring authorities for access. "They are men who refused to serve in the military, and political dissidents, but what is worse, their relatives have also been arrested, including women, adolescents and elderly people," a relief official speaking on condition of anonymity said. [passage omitted] Here in Velika Kladusa, small groups of women gather each day outside the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees or the Red Cross to ask the organizations to intervene on behalf of their missing loved ones. "They took away several dozen, in two cars and a truck," the wife of one detainee said on condition she not be named. "My husband didn't want to fight against fellow Moslems, and everybody knew it. They took away 15 of our neighbors, including a 70-year-old." Another woman said she challenged the officials who came and took away her husband, an engineer, last Monday [13 June]. "I asked them for an official document. They showed me one that said they had the right to search homes. Then they took away my husband." She added: "One of his friends agreed to go to the warfront. They let him go, and the next day he was on a bus for the front line. As for me, they said they would arrest me if I went back" to the UN refugee agency. Rumors are circulating around town that the prisoners are being mistreated and deprived of food. Relatives also say some are being forced to dig trenches on the front lines. Over the weekend a group of civilians digging with shovels and picks were seen on the front line near the hamlet of Hasici, with soldiers watching over them. But there was no way to confirm they were prisoners.
