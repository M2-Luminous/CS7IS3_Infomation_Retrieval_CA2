Speaking at a lecture meeting in his home base of Tochigi Prefecture, Watanabe said the coalition government must not carry through Ozawa's alleged plan to "railroad" the package of four political and electoral reform bills through the Diet. Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) is a core party in the seven-party coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Ozawa is widely regarded as a chief strategist for the coalition which swept Hosokawa to power last August. "It is a dictatorial plan advanced by Shinseito to try to railroad the bills through the Diet on the strength of a majority vote," Watanabe said. Watanabe is the leader of one of four major factions within the Liberal Democratic Party which fell to the opposition last year after 38 years of rule.
