However, even if they were just, they need to be more flexible, at least enough to acknowledge the basic humanitarian needs. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said this at a news conference today with a group of international journalists who have been in Budva, Montenegro, for three days. They go to Serbia on 23 May. Djukanovic said that the negative consequences of the sanctions on the Montenegrin economy have caused more than $5 billion in damage, with the greatest repercussions on the humanitarian situation because Montenegro is supporting about 50,000 refugees, 20 percent of whom are Muslim. He said Montenegro has been coping with a serious humanitarian crisis for months. UN bodies have not yet aproved a single request for the import of certain goods which would ease humanitarian and other problems. The Montenegrin prime minister was frequently asked about the effects of the sanctions and how long Montenegro will be able to endure them. Djukanovic said that the international blockade has been a complete fiasco, but if someone is interested in testing our ability to suffer, the nation is resilient and can endure the imposed hardships. Illustrating the deadly effects of the sanctions, the Montenegrin prime minister said the government had already sold several vessels from the republic's relatively opulent fleet. However, a number of vessels are in danger because they are trapped in foreign ports, and the costs of their anchorage are growing alarmingly day by day. [passage omitted] Djukanovic was also asked repeatedly about Montenegro's position in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Djukanovic said that most citizens of Montenegro would be in favor of a joint state with Serbia; others are iin favor of that, but only with absolute equality between the federal members. Montenegro will not back up on that position by a millimeter, the prime minister said. He added that there are secessionist and unitaristic political forces in both Montenegro and Serbia. In this context he mentioned certain political trends from within the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts and certain political views voiced at the recent congress of Serbian intellectuals. However, he stressed that official policy does not support those views, either in Serbia or in Montenegro. Any denial of Montenegro as a separate entity and the denial of its equality has a very destructive and destabilizing effect on the FRY, Djukanovic warned, and said that the overall constitutional commitments do not threaten Montenegro's position in any way.
