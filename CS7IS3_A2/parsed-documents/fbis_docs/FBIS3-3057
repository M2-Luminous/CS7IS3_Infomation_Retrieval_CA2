Su, vice-president of China's top party school, said governments of all countries exercise macroeconomic controls in varying degrees and with varying intensity for different fields, and so should the Chinese Government. After commenting that the Chinese Government's macro-control measures of last year have been successful, Su briefly analysed problems that prompted the government to act. in their drive for economic growth, he said, localities spent huge sums of loans that came in the form of inter-bank lending. As a result, capital construction went out of control. Spending on real estate development, stock speculation and unrestrained investment in "development zones" gobbled huge sums of money, most from banks. As a result, the government had to pay farmers "IOU" slips instead of cash for their produce, and a shortage of funds hobbled the construction of many key state projects. In the second half of last year, the central government began putting banking activities to order. "But a lot of loans could not be retrieved since the money had been turned into reinforced concrete in real estate," he said. Banks, ordered to get back their loans, cut back operating funds of enterprises, which then appealed legitimately for a loosening of credit. To avoid a major setback in economic growth, the central bank had to grant loans selectively for specific enterprises and relax control on credit. Still, he said, banks retrieved tens of billions of yuan and ensured funding for more than 90 percent of key construction projects. It also used the money to pay farmers. "But the rectifying measures are not a fundamental cure for the root problem," he said, referring to excessive fixed assets investment. In his view, the fundamental cure is to establish a system of comprehensive macro-economic controls that rely mainly on economic levers to be supplemented with some administrative means. "In exercising macro-controls, financial, taxation, pricing and banking departments should have coordination among themselves," he said. The economics professor expressed concern over the government's budget deficit of 130 billion yuan for 1994. "However," he said, "the real danger is for fixed assets investment to go out of control."
