The fact of the matter is that it is Israel that decides and dictates agreements between the two parties. If the Palestinian negotiator ever defies what is being dictated on him, the matter is referred to Yasir 'Arafat, Yitzhaq Rabin, or Shim'on Peres. 'Arafat will then announce his approval of the arrangements Israel wants. Thus, political and media observers began to see, day in and day out, further concessions made by the PLO delegation. They have now reached the conclusion that Israel has taken everything. But, despite this, Israel is exercising further extortion just for the sake of it. Israel stuck to its position over passages; settlements and the lands around them; main roads; control over the land, sea, and air border points; the right to enter the self-rule area to arrest wanted Palestinians; and all the other conditions of colonialism, hegemony, and tutelage. So what remains to be negotiated in Taba? This is the question being asked by political observers and world journalists. It is also the question which the Palestinian Arab masses are asking.
