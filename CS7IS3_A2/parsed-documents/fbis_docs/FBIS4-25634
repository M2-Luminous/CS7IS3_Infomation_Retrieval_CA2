These fears stem from indications that China will introduce a Foreign Ministry-run government agency which will supply all local staff to foreign diplomatic missions in Hong Kong, a practice which now operates in China. Some consulates have already been examining ways to tighten up security, including the access of local staff to sensitive information. Concerns were heightened following comments earlier this month by Zhang Junsheng, a deputy director of the local branch of China's official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. Mr Zhang told German journalist Peter Seidlitz that China would establish a foreign affairs office in Hong Kong which would be in charge of all major affairs. "All issues of foreign affairs in Hong Kong will be unified and dealt with under the management of the central government in Beijing," he was reported as saying. He did not spell out the issue of local staff recruitment. The local branch of XINHUA refused to comment when THE HONGKONG STANDARD asked about central recruitment being extended to Hong Kong. If it happens, Hong Kong-based consulates would no longer be able to recruit their own staff but would have to apply to the Chinese office to fill their staff needs. Some countries are expected to voice their disapproval if China decides to extend the practice here. Hong Kong staff working at various diplomatic missions are also worried about their future after 1997. Some have already voiced their concerns to their employers. Some fear for their jobs while others believe they may be forced to provide information. The central recruitment system, followed by most communist countries, allows the host nation to infiltrate "suspect" diplomatic missions and plant bugs, spies and informers inside foreign consulates and diplomatic households. Diplomats who have served in the former Soviet Union and communist capitals in eastern Europe told THE HONGKONG STANDARD they had to be alert because they did not know whether local staff were genuine employees or intelligence personnel working as clerks, interpreters, drivers, and even cleaners. "It was always a strained relationship for one didn't know who one could trust," a diplomat, who had served in the former Soviet bloc, said. Several diplomats said that if Beijing introduced the central recruitment system here, the same strained relationship that prevailed in China would come to Hong Kong too. "This would be a very unfavourable development. We would have to keep local staff at arms' length as happened in other communist capitals," a senior Western diplomat said. Other diplomats said it was unlikely China would create an unnecessary problem by extending the practice to Hong Kong. But diplomats who were concerned about central recruitment argued that after 1997 some of the diplomatic missions would assume greater importance. "Naturally Beijing would like to know what we are up to, particularly since Hong Kong has a democracy movement which is seen as subversive. These are matters we would have to report on and Beijing would like to know what we have to report back home." The British-Hong Kong governments prefer not to raise the issue in the hope that Beijing will not give it any thought.
