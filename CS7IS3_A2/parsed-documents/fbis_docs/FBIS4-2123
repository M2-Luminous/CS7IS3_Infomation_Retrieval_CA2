"We have never heard something like China sending a high-level delegation to North Korea to attend President Kim's birthday celebrations," said a foreign ministry spokesman contacted by telephone. He was denying a report by South Korea's YONHAP news agency which said that members of the delegation would have talks with Kim about the nuclear standoff following Pyongyang's refusal to allow full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of its nuclear sites. On Monday North Korea officially rejected an appeal by the United Nations Security Council to open its sites to IAEA inspectors. China is the North's closest ally and so far has refused to put any pressure on Pyongyang over the nuclear affair or to support moves to impose international sanctions.
