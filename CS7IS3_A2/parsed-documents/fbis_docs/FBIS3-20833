In addition to a number of telephone lines in some areas of Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srem that had been linked to the telephone exchanges of Novi Sad, Sombor, and Sid in Serbia's Vojvodina province, in the next 20 days the most remote villages of the Vukovar municipalities will be linked to the automatic system, and in the next two to three months telephone exchanges of villages in the Dalj, Tenja, and Mirkovci municipalities will be plugged into the Vukovar main telephone exchange, POLITIKA states. The paper cites Spasoje Popovic, director of the Post, Telephone, and Telegraph [PTT] Public Enterprise for Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srem, as stating that the PTT will recognize all the rights of previous subscribers in the territory of the former Croatia, under the condition that they prove that they owned the telephone before the war. Popovic notes that, during negotiations to establish telephone links between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and the Republic of Croatia, the Croatian representatives had demanded that the territory of the republic of Serbian Krajina be included in the Croatian telecommunications system, with the prewar area code of 056, which would have meant that the RSK was an integral part of the Republic of Croatia. This was not accepted, Popovic says, adding that the telephone connections of the RSK will remain in the FRY telecommunications system. Thus, the RSK and the FRY, as a single system, will establish their telephone links with Croatia via Croatia's country code number 99385, the POLITIKA article concludes.
