This is because of the insult against Islam included in the report. In a statement issued yesterday by the Foreign Ministry in this connection, it strongly condemned the insult addressed by the rapporteur against the Islamic religion and its beliefs. The Foreign Ministry demanded the ommission of the paragraphs from the report touching on this matter. The statement pointed out that Biru's report is part of a bigger plot targeting the Islamic religion and its beliefs.
