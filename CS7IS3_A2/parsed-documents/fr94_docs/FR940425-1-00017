The Commission has received requests to extend the comment period and believes that an extension of time is appropriate in light of the wide range of complex issues presented by the reproposed Large Trader Reporting System. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Stop 6&hyph;9, Washington, DC 20549.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33608, the Commission reproposed for comment Rule 13h&hyph;1, which combined with reproposed Form 13H would establish the Large Trader Reporting System. As a result of the wide range of complex issues presented in the release, participants have requested an extension of the comment period. The Commission believes that an extension of time is appropriate and would afford commentators the opportunity to prepare more insightful comments. Therefore, the Commission is extending the comment period for Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33608 from April 18, 1994 to June 3, 1994. By the Commission. Dated: April 19, 1994. Margaret H.
