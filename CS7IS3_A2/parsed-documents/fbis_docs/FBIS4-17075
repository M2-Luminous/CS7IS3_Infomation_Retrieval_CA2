He added that Tatarstan needed to win over the right to independently set export and import duties taking into account its own strategic interests and the right to set export quotas for oil for no less than five years. At present, the quotas are set for one year only. Otherwise, the Tatar government will be unable to guarantee foreign investors return on their capital. Besides its external problems, Tatarstan needs to solve internal ones such as the introduction of private ownership of land in accordance with the Constitution, heal the credit and financial systems, create market institutions -- private enterprises, leasing agencies, insurance companies, banks -- capable of maintaining direct contacts with foreign partners. Muratov said the present state of Tatarstan's economy was critical and needed immediate drastic reforms.
