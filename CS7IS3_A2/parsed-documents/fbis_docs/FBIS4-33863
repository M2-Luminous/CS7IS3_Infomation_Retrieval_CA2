According to reports from this Middle East nation, the Iranians will not vote for Parra because he allegedly is close to the Saudi (Ahmad Laki Jammani), who is an adviser in his Economic Investigation Center. The Iranian source added that this country will present its own candidate, Kazem Pur Ardebili, at the next OPEC elections. The communique issued by the national government regretted speculations about the former energy and mines minister and added that Alirio Parra has the support of 11 of the 12 OPEC member countries.
