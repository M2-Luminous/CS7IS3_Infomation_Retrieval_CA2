The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper features the complete text of both decisions by the lower house. In an article headlined "Algebra of the Compromise", the same newspaper prints statistical data on how factions of the lower house voted on these documents. The ROSSIYSKIE VESTI newspaper prints an opinion by presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov, saying that "the decision on the political amnesty is immoral". The same newspaper also carries an opinion by Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's national security assistant, who claims that "the Duma (eds: lower house) exceeded its powers". Editor-in-chief of the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper Vitaliy Tretyakov, commenting on the Duma's amnesty decision, holds a diametrically opposite position. He notes that "no juridical chicanery can put into doubt the Duma's important political and psychological victory. "If the Duma, in compliance with the constitution, has the right to amnesty both the convicted and those under investigation, and if it has done so, those who come under the amnesty should be released. If this does not happen, then the rights of the Duma and the rights of citizens are infringed upon." Commenting on the president's speech at the Russian parliament on Thursday, the PRAVDA newspaper stresses that the president's state of the nation address "is interesting due to the fact that Boris Yeltsin spoke not the customary language of the Russia's choice movement but the language of those who consistently opposed the destructive policy imposed by radical democrats". ROSSIYSKIE VESTI carries a series of comments on the president's state of the nation speech under the general headline "Parliament Should Shake the Extended Hand". Most comments note that "the presidential message is of general character". However, they point at the same time to the fact that "most deputies regard the key points in the presidential message as a result of adjustments in line with political realities which changed after the December 12 elections". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA calls its readers' attention to the aggravation of relations between Ukraine and the Crimean Republic, a constituent part of Ukraine, as well as to possible confrontation inside the Crimean leadership in connection with Kiev's demand to streamline The Crimean constitution in compliance with the Ukrainian basic law. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper carries an essay about Yuliy Khariton, chief designer of the first Soviet atomic bomb, who will turn 90 on February 27. Under the title "Stalin's Death", the TRUD newspaper features with some abridgments the first part from a hitherto unpublished chapter of a book by former Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy Nikolay Kuznetsov who personally knew Stalin for many years. The chapter describes some almost unknown particulars from the last days of Stalin's life and other events of that time. In the section "Essay of Russian Geopolitics", SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA completes the publication of an analytical article by Russian Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, the first part of which was printed in the previous issue.
