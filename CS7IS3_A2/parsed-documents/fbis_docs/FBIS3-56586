There is no need to withdraw from those regions which for centuries have been in the Russian sphere of interest, and there is no need to be afraid of these words. A security vacuum will start to form if Russia's troops are withdrawn from here. Rather than fleeing, supplementary forces are being brought in, which are always threatening, in some cases hostile to Russia. In my opinion, this announcement in fact indicates a serious change in Russia's position. Moreover, I cannot but associate this position with the recent meeting of U.S. and Russian leaders. Latvia must, therefore, absolutely reinforce its position, and in my view security policy has become a state priority [words indistinct]. [end recording]
