We talked to local columnist Jorge Paniagua Herrera on the phone, and he told us that the main square was empty and everything seemed to have returned to normal in San Cristobal. However, it is being suspected that EZLN members might be preparing to attack other municipalities. Last night, there were rumors that they might attack the city of Palenque at midnight. We have not received any reports on this yet, and everything seems to be calm. Here in Tuxtla Gutierrez, we are seeing some Air Force planes flying over, and some ambulances as well. There have been rumors that seven people have been killed, but we have not received any official reports. What is true is that EZLN members murdered the commander of the Ocosingo Judicial Police yesterday. Another three people were stripped and tied up. In Ocosingo municipality, which is the largest in Chiapas and is close to the Lacandon jungle, the peasants -- including some Guatemalans -- are still occupying the installations of the state government's radio station. This radio station has a strong signal in the jungle area, and the peasants are using it to broadcast their ideas. It was reported in Ocosingo that the peasants have withdrawn from the square but still remain at some radio station. Eyewitnesses mentioned that the runway was set on fire to prevent airplanes from landing. Early this morning some shops in San Cristobal were robbed. The situation in the municipal county seats of Margaritas and Trinitarias remains unchanged: EZLN members are still in the area. We talked to some people in the cities of San Cristobal and Ocosingo, where we have only been able to get through by telephone because the roads were blocked until the early hours of the morning. People are very afraid, and they are desperately asking for the government's intervention. According to an official communique, the government is trying to prevent a bloodshed in those municipalities. Do you have any doubts, questions? [Alejo] Is there any information on the identity of the EZLN leaders? [Camacho] We have not been able to identify any of the faces that were shown on television. However, it is obvious that the group includes Guatemalans. Precisely yesterday, we were able to watch some recordings from Ocosingo, where they were talking on the radio, and it is obvious that the leaders are not peasants, but rather well-educated people. Their speeches are too well-written. Many people believe there are Guatemalans among the leaders because of the accent among other things. Some of them have tried to cover their faces with stockings to remain anonymous. The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas also has been accused of being involved in these incidents, but so far there is no evidence of this. What is true and evident is that there are Guatemalans involved. It is evident because of the accent; we are very familiar with the accents, and we know how the Indians speak. People I have talked to in Ocosingo have said that there are people with features different from ours. [Alejo] Maricarmen, it has also been said that most members of the armed group are Indians and peasants? [Camacho] There are peasants from Chiapas, but not Indians, because EZLN members do not speak any dialects. EZLN members include mestizos rather than Indians. There are even youths between the ages of 13 and 18 who are armed, as well as women. Some of the women have been identified as being from the Lacandon area, but they are not necessarily Indians.
