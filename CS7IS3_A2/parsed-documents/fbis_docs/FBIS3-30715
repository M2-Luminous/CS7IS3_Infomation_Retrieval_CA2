With many clips of Dogan's statements, Mr. Kenan proved his claim that the DPS works against the interests of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria. His strongest argument was that the current DPS charter differs significantly from the documents presented to the Turkish and world public when the movement registered. Adem Kenan visited National Assembly Chairman Necmettin Cindoruk for 18 days, and, he says, succeeded in convincing him not only of Dogan's double game, but also of the fact that the DPS serves only the interests of the former "revivers," and their present day servants -- Dogan's circle. In an open letter, attached to excerpts of his book "Last Strike," and personal talks with leaders of parliamentarian and extraparliamentarian parties, Kenan revealed the grave socioeconomic situation of the Turks in Bulgaria and the continuing ethnocultural obliteration. In statements carried by ORTA DOU, noted politicians supported the mission of Mr. Kenan and his party in saving the Turkish ethnic minority in Bulgaria. Mr. Kenan expressed his regret that he could not meet Tansu Ciller, however, he was assured that, by 15 May, he will receive an official invitation from the Turkish prime minister. Mr. Kenan reached an agreement with major business clubs on the allocation of 50 stipends for Bulgarian students interested in studying at Turkish higher education establishments. The sole condition is that they should not be children of participants in the revival process. He added that 55 of the 75 students sent to Turkey by Dogan are children of such parents. The DPS does not have two charters and Mr. Kenan is manipulating the mass media, Mrs. Sherife Mustafa told STANDART NEWS. According to her, the movement's charter was amended and supplemented at the last national conference. The charter merely specifies the functions of the separate structures and their leaders.
