Galenko, A.K. Akiyev, V.Ye. Tarasova, Scientific Research Antiplague Institute of the Caucasus and Trans-Caucasus, Stavropol] [Abstract] The scientific and practical importance of data on the interaction of plague microbes with antibiotics obtained in experiments with strains isolated from natural disease outbreaks prompted an investigation of 50 foreign strains from the persons infected with plague. The strains for this purpose were received from the Plague Scientific Research and Information Center in Stavropol in cooperation with the World Health Organization. All strains are isolated from the patients whose disease is clinically manifested in the cutaneous bubonic and septicemic forms. In addition, five plague microbe strains isolated from an outbreak in Central Caucasus as well as control strains recommended by WHO--Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli 25922, and Staphylococcus aureus 25923--were included in the experiment. In examining the U.S. strains, streptomycin, gentamycin, ristomycin, kanamycin, doxycyclin, and polymyxin C were used. The resistance of African strains to a broad range of antibiotics, including streptomycin, erythromycin, monomycin, and lincomycin was also examined. The outcome of the experiment was assessed after 48 h of incubation at a 28ï¿½C temperature. The sensitivity of U.S. and African strains of plague microbe to the above antibiotics is summarized; the standard strain sensitivity was consistent with WHO guidelines. The experiment makes it possible to assert that the plague microbe strains isolated from patients treated with large doses of antibiotics (usually streptomycin) display no appreciably noticeable tendency toward developing resistance to them. It is noted that in addition to streptomycin, gentamycin, doxycyclin, kanamycin, and tetracycline warrant further investigation. Tables 1; references 7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.
