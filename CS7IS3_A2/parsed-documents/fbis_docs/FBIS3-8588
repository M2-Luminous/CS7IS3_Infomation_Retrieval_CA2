The SDL fears that if Meciar's government is dismissed, some parties will lose interest in the elections, he added. "If people underestimate the need for new elections, they do not understand the depth of political crisis in Slovakia," Weiss said. The position of the SDL is influenced by the fact that some unnamed politicians are ignoring the need for elections for which the SDL has been calling for a year, he said.
