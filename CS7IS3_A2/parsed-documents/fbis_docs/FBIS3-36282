First of all, about a legally binding document on compensation to Ukraine for nuclear weapons. As for strategic nuclear weapons, such a document was signed with Russia and it is legally binding. It was signed by the Russian and Ukrainian premiers, [Viktor] Chernomyrdin and the then Ukrainian prime minister Leonid Kuchma. As for compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, by all means there will be this compensation. As early as this month experts will begin to work on determining the value of these weapons. They are experts from Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. Thus, on the main issue on the agenda here, that is, on compensation for nuclear weapons to Ukraine, one part of it was legally settled and the other will be settled after the evaluation of these nuclear weapons. This, I tell you, is what it is in reality. There is an absolutely specific accord on the part of Ukraine: Should one of the sides fail to fulfill its obligations, Ukraine for its part will stop actions. Next, there is no agreement -- and I do not know where what was said here comes from -- on the destruction of missiles, including SS-24's. There is no such a thing, I emphasize this. What it is about is lowering the combat status of missiles, not destroying SS-24's. This is quite another matter. It is about lowering their combat status. As for withdrawing them, we will determine what warheads will be withdrawn and not the destruction of missiles, as was said here. Not a single document mentions this. Why distort facts? This is a question of principle. I emphasize -- please do not interrupt me -- it is specifically about lowering their combat status and withdrawing 200 warheads within 10 months, without specifying what warheads and from what missiles. Next, I have nowhere and never said that I will withdraw nuclear warheads independently from the Supreme Council decision. I address this reply to Mr. Hudyma. The talk was about the following: When the nuclear warhead becomes physically obsolete and when Ukraine faces danger, then irrespective of the decision, whether taken by the president or the Supreme Council -- and the defense minister was saying about this, by the way, people will not say this is not true -- then the nuclear warheads will have to be withdrawn. Because there will be a dilemma: Either danger or nuclear warheads. I have said this and I am saying this to you. As for everything else, the president's actions will be adequate to the Supreme Council decision. Another question arises. I want to tell you about this sincerely. If we withdraw the warheads according to an agreement, this is an appropriate legal document and a process of compensation. If we withdraw in the face of danger, then the question will be put in a different manner by those who accept the warheads. It is not by chance that I read the message from the chief designer, or, a group of chief designers. This is a question of principle and one must take it into account. I can fully support those deputies who are saying that not everything has been done neatly over this time, both on the part of the president and on the part of the government, that we have made many mistakes and that it is really true that we have been put in complicated economic, political, and international situations and that these situations require appropriate actions. And if someone has other possibilities for such actions, then let him offer them. I have been acting in line with the decisions of the Supreme Council and I was striving to achieve the fulfillment of those decisions. One more thing: Not a single country can ever claim that all agreements should be concluded with it in advance, before it determines its final status. We have to determine our status. If we are a nonnuclear state, then we have to exercise this status consistently. And after that the agreements are concluded -- both the defense minister and Vasyl Vasyloyvych Durdynets [deputy chairman of the Supreme Council] have partly enumerated those agreements which are envisioned for signing: On the value of compensation, on silos, on withdrawal, on schedules -- everything will be done without fail. Not a single move can be made without such agreements because it would be dangerous to make such moves and nobody would do this. I understand that today it is difficult to make decisions, there are political problems, there is pressure applied on Ukraine. They are right who say that Russia should abandon its claims to Ukraine. But these claims were made by that Supreme Soviet which no longer exists. There is another Supreme Soviet. Now that country must determine itself and I support those who raise this question, but you must understand that there are relevant procedures and a relevant order. I cannot force the Duma or the Federal Assembly of Russia to cancel these reservations, as far as the former Supreme Soviet is concerned. Russia itself will determine whether or not these are legal. And, in the long run, this is the legal and constitutional right of the Duma and the Federal Assembly. We can only propose that such steps should be taken. We are facing economic problems which must be solved. And if we stop or block, as People's Deputy Haysynskyy said, this process in the presence of all those economic difficulties and absence of possibilities to act, both in relation to power engineering, nuclear power stations, and fuel elements, then we will have to face the dilemma: Either one or the other. I would like to assure you, esteemed people's deputies, that Ukraine will be compensated for both tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. I would like to tell you that today, at lunchtime, I received a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton, in which he gave his consent to double economic aid to Ukraine -- specific figures, serious figures are mentioned, to provide assistance in eliminating nuclear weapons and to provide aid to those officers who need social protection, including housing. As a matter of fact, I was acting in a situation which took shape, I was acting so as not to do harm to Ukraine, so as to preserve the state. Maybe, someone else can do it better. Now it is up to the Supreme Council. I would only like to say that we must take steps consistently. And this consistency was initiated by the Supreme Council and I believe that this Supreme Council must also say its final word, to finish what it once began. Thank you for your attention.
