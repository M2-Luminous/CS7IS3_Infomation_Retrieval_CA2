FR941128-2-00087 FR941128-2-00046 Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted subject to final approval an agreement containing a proposed Consent Order from American Home Products Corporation (``AHP'') which requires AHP to divest its tetanus and diphtheria vaccines business to a Commission-approved purchaser. Further, AHP would be required to license American Cyanamid Company's (``Cyanamid'') rotavirus vaccine research and to aggregate royalty payment information relating to sales of particular cytokines used for white blood cell and platelet restoration once FDA approval is obtained for these products. The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed Order. Pursuant to an August 17, 1994, Agreement and Plan of Merger, AHP will acquire all of Cyanamid's voting stock. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the following five markets in the United States: (1) Combined tetanus and diphtheria vaccines approved for use for adults and children at least seven years old, known as ``adult Td''; (2) Combined diphtheria and tetanus vaccines for children between the ages of two months and seven years old, known as ``pediatric DT''; (3) Uncombined tetanus vaccines, known as ``tetanus toxoid''; (4) Rotavirus vaccine research and development; and (5) Cytokine research, development, and production. The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation in each of these markets. In the area of tetanus and diphtheria vaccines, AHP would be required to divest, within four months, its tetanus and diphtheria vaccines business to a Commission approved purchaser. Because that purchaser will need to obtain FDA approval before it can begin selling tetanus and diphtheria vaccines, the proposed Consent Order also requires AHP to manufacture these vaccines for the approved purchaser for a period of five years or until the purchaser gains FDA approvals to manufacture its own tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. AHP will be required to sell tetanus and diphtheria vaccines to the purchaser at cost, with annual adjustments (exclusive of materials and labor) indexed to the Consumer Price Index. In addition, under the proposed Consent Order, AHP is required to provide technical assistance and advice to assist the purchaser in obtaining FDA approval to manufacture and sell tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. The proposed Order also provides for a trustee to assure that AHP appropriately divests its tetanus and diphtheria vaccines business. If AHP fails to divest its tetanus and diphtheria business within four months, or if the acquirer abandons its effort to obtain FDA approval to manufacture and sell tetanus and diphtheria vaccines, then the trustee may be directed to find another acquirer. The proposed Consent Order also requires AHP to license, within one year, on a nonexclusive basis, the Cyanamid rotavirus vaccine research assets to a Commission-approved licensee. If AHP fails to find an approved licensee within one year, then the Commission may appoint a trustee to license the Cyanamid rotavirus vaccine research assets on an exclusive basis to an approved licensee. AHP is also required under the proposed Order to provide technical advice, assistance and training to enable the licensee to continue the Cyanamid rotavirus research as an ongoing project. The proposed Consent Order prohibits AHP from receiving information relating to the market for cytokines for white blood cell and platelet restoration, unless the information is aggregated on a worldwide basis. This provision of the proposed Consent Order does not become operative until the FDA approves AHP's products in this area. The proposed Consent Order will also prohibit AHP, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring any interest in any entity engaged in the clinical development, or manufacture and sale of tetanus, diphtheria or rotavirus vaccines in the United States without prior approval from the Commission. The proposed Order will also require AHP to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every six (6) months thereafter until the Commission has approved a purchaser and licensee. One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, AHP will be required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires AHP to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of AHP resulting in the emergence of a successor. A sunset provision is also included which terminates the order after 20 years.
