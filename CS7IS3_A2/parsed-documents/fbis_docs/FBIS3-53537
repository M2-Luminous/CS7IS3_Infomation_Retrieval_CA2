He did this when he failed to wrench an approval from his partners in NATO on a proposal for concentrated air strikes on Bosnia that would end the continuous Serb attacks on Muslims. When we recall that the United States itself presented this proposal last August, we realize that the U.S. President's weakness, which was clearly manifested at the Brussels summit, is a result of a state of reluctance and confusion that prevails in the decisions and stands of the U.S. Administration. This U.S. Administration is wasting a great inheritance of military and political glory created by [former] President George Bush's administration when it stood against the Iraqi aggression on Kuwait with a sincere will, a brave stand, and a daring decision that put an end to treacherous belligerence and gave the United States the prestige and respect that qualifies it to lead the world after it became the last superpower on earth. It seemed clear that during the Brussels summit, the U.S. President was unable to take hold of the necessary reins to make a strategic decision that would reinforce the credibility of the "president of the world" as is being touted in political terminology!! It is no surprise that the U.S. President has become a target of derision for Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russian fascism, and disdain for Milosevic, the leader of the Serbs. The former proposed to extend a helping hand to the "weak" United States. The latter responded to the proposal to deal air strikes by intensifying the malicious fire on Sarajevo!? This American retreat, which is due to tactical calculations and favoring regional interests at the expense of the global responsibilities of the last superpower, is considered submission to tyrants and encouragement for aggression. This will create new facts in the international arena. These facts will contribute to rekindling the fire from beneath the ashes of the cold war! This disgraceful retreat from the decision to deter the aggressor, coupled with the unfair decision that equates the heavily armed Serb and the Muslim deprived of the right to own a means of self-defense, renders those who abstain from making a deterrent decision partners in an international conspiracy against Bosnia-Herzegovina and partakers in the aggression carried out by the criminals of the barbarian war launched by the Serbs in the name of old crusades and new fascism.
