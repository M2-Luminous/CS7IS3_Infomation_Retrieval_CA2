FR940812-0-00041 FR940812-0-00011 In addition, we revised §416.1403(a) to include in the list of administrative actions that are not initial determinations, transitions from section 1611 to 1619(a) eligibility or section 1619(a) to 1611 eligibility. If a recipient's section 1611 or 1619(a) benefits are adversely affected (i.e., reduced, suspended, or terminated) for a reason unrelated to his or her medical condition at the time of the shift, such planned action(s) will continue to be subject to advance notice of benefit reduction, suspension, or termination and be covered as initial determinations under §416.1402(b). If an individual's benefit amount increases, an initial determination is made under §416.1402(a). Determinations about an individual's disability are also initial determinations under §416.1402. Redesignated §416.1402(h) (former §416.1402(i)) provides that a determination about whether an individual is eligible for special SSI eligibility status under §416.265 is an initial determination. Section 416.265 describes the eligibility requirements for special SSI eligibility status under section 1619(b). Because we must make a threshold calculation and a finding that an individual needs Medicaid to continue working in order to determine eligibility under section 1619(b), we will continue to provide an initial determination. Movement from special SSI eligibility status under section 1619(b) back to regular SSI benefit status under section 1611 or special SSI cash benefit status under section 1619(a) is defined to be an initial determination under §416.1402(a). Public Comments The following is a summary of the substantive comments we received on the proposed rules and our response to them. Comment: The commenter was concerned about using gross earned income, rather than actual countable earnings, in transitions between benefit statuses as described in §§416.260, 416.261, and 416.262(b). The commenter was not so much concerned with using the gross earned income amount at the time of the transition between benefit statuses, but rather how that amount might be interpreted in other determinations in the SSI program. The commenter suggested adding a clarifying statement indicating that the gross income amount used in the transition process is not to be considered an SGA determination. Response: Although in the preamble to the proposed rules (58 FR 52458, 52459) we stated that we would not make actual SGA determinations on whether an individual is eligible for section 1619 status, we agree with the suggestion to add the clarifying statement to these final rules. We have added the statement to §416.260, which deals specifically with transitions between benefit statuses under sections 1611 and 1619. Regulatory Procedures Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review. All program changes reflected in these regulations related to Pub. L. 99&hyph;643 and Pub. L. 101&hyph;508 were implemented on their respective effective dates. As of December 1993, there were 20,028 section 1619(a) participants and 35,299 section 1619(b) participants. Paperwork Reduction Act These regulations contain information collection requirements in §416.268. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), we submitted a copy to OMB for its review and we received clearance to collect this information under OMB No. 0960&hyph;0267. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 3 minutes per response. This includes the time it will take to read the instructions, gather the necessary facts, and provide the information. Since we estimate that 25,000 SSI recipients will provide this information, the total annual burden is estimated to be 1,250 hours. Organizations or individuals desiring to submit comments on these information collection requirements should direct them to the Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21235, Attention: Reports Clearance Officer, 1&hyph;A&hyph;21 Operations Building, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Office Building, Room 3208, Washington, D.C. 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for HHS. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect only individuals and States. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.
