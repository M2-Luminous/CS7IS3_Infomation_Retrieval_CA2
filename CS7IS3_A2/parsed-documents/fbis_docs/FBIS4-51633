We will listen further to Prime Minister Yi's view on his appointment and the direction of the government's administration. [Begin recording] [Kim] How are you? [Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok] Hello. [Kim] First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your appointment. [Yi] Thank you very much. [Kim] You have been entrusted with a heavy duty of leading the third-term cabinet of the civilian-rule government. What is your impression of your appointment? [Yi] Since I have been entrusted with an important duty during a difficult period, I, who am lacking in every way, have a heavy heart. [Kim] One of the tasks which the civilian-rule government must continue to promote is reform. What do you think that the third- term cabinet must urgently do to continuously promote reform? [Yi] I will work to emphasize harmony by gathering all kinds of different and creative opinions into one unified opinion. We must achieve reform through harmony. [Kim] In the past you were the deputy prime minister in charge of South-North diplomacy and security-related issues and presided over coordination meetings for reunification and security-related policies. Now you have become the prime minister, are you thinking of continuing to be in charge of diplomacy and security-related issues? [Yi] I have experience in this field, but the coordination meetings for reunification and security-related policies are held centering on the deputy prime minister in charge of national unification. It has operated in such a way for about a month. I believe that it is ideal for the joint work in the process of establishing, coordinating, and promoting a policy. [Kim] You have been known to be a conservative figure. Some people even pointed out that you are not fit for carrying out reform. What is your opinion on this matter? [Yi] People who have a practical knowledge about the true nature of North Korea regard that North Korea can be our partner only when reunification is achieved together, and at the same time they say that we should find a way for reunification with the North by taking a prudent attitude and being cautious of the danger of North Korea's line toward the South. This kind of people are saying that I am a conservative. I think this matter is related to who has a more correct understanding of reality. I believe that I am very knowledgeable about North Korea because I have visited North Korea for talks, have thought about this matter over a long period of time, have had many experiences, and read many books on it. Therefore, I think I am a practical rationalist. [Kim] Thank you for the interview. [Yi] You are welcome. [end recording]
