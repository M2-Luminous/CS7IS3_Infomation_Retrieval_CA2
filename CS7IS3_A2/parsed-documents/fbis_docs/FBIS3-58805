Addressing the members of the American and Common Market Club (ACMC) in Brussels, European Commissioner Karel Van Miert affirmed that apart from enlargement, ensuring the follow-up of the Uruguay Round, and working in favor of the environment and social dimension will be the three main challenges facing the European Union in the near future. Moreover, he noted -- as U.S. President Bill Clinton recently remarked -- that these three objectives are now common to both Europe and the United States. The Belgian commissioner believes that the important thing now is to convert the touchdown scored in GATT: "For instance, the agreement does not guarantee any opening of the Japanese market," he pointed out, highlighting that some obstacles remain, which are not even of a regulatory or legislative nature, but are rather of a "private," "psychological," or some other nature. "The imbalance is flagrant and this is becoming less and less acceptable," remarked Van Miert. "The Americans have understood this clearly, and it is they who from time to time turn on the heat vis-a-vis the Japanese partner." On the other hand, the single market is far from being completed, added the former chairman of the SP [Flemish Socialist Party]. In the telecommunications sector: "A substantial amount of time was lost on the Americans and the Japanese." Even if there are only slight differences at the technological level, the sector is characterized by considerable tariff discrepancies, and both structural and organizational divergence. Too many member states are still wrapped up in their national monopolies, which constitutes a major "comparative disadvantage." By the same token, in the air transport sector -- where some are advocating a break -- there can be no going back, and Van Miert stressed that "headway must be made more rapidly," while at the same time asserting that "if the single market had been in existence 10 or 15 years ago, then it would have proven easier to emerge from the current crisis." Social Dumping The single market is also hampered by competitive devaluations and social dumping, to Van Miert's dismay: "If certain member states begin to manipulate monetary or social instruments, then we will find ourselves back in the situation of a soccer match where some players only use their feet, and others their hands, or head. That is the truth of the matter." With respect to the dossier on the steel sector, some episodes may only be described as "scandalous": "How can we negotiate," says Karel Van Miert rebelliously, "when each state has a right of veto, and certain parties occasionally deny the reality regarding the state subsidies which they are awarding?" Nonetheless, the words of the former Commission vice president (since the end of December, under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, there are now only two vice presidents in the Community executive: Manuel Marin and Henning Christophersen -- L' ECHO editor's note) try to be optimistic. Whereas the European Commission was in rather a bad way one year ago, Van Miert maintains things have improved since then, especially by virtue of the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, the adoption of a strategy for recovery, the conclusion of GATT, and also thanks to the efforts of the Belgian presidency. In any case, the European Commission has not been weakened by the exercise involving the white paper. He observed: "It has been proven that, when called upon to draw up certain texts or to negotiate, the Commission can always be relied upon. Do you think that the Germans would have accepted the British haggling over GATT? Sometimes it is enough for a country merely to table a particular document for it to be systematically rejected by the others. That is why people turned to Delors for the white paper." Furthermore, Mr. Delors will not hesitate to point this out if there are attempts to "drown the fish," i.e., if the document is not followed up. "The Commission must seize the opportunities that present themselves, without worrying about its popularity," concluded Van Miert. "Do you know that during the negotiation of the Eko Stahl dossier, the Germans from the eastern laender remarked to us that before they were bound to follow the instructions issued by Moscow, whereas now they are bound by those originating in Brussels. Criticism was already being leveled at the Commission at the time of General de Gaulle, and there are those who would have liked to see it disappear back then. Which is rubbish, because that would be tantamount to wiping out the entire Community...."
