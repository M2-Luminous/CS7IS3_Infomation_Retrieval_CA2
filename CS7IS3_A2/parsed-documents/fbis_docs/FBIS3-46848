And there is no guarantee that this will continue into the future. Meanwhile, looking to the mid to long term, employment stability which is based on Japanese-style employment practices must change as it now stands. The pressing employment issue is intertwined with complex elements involving short-, mid-, and long-term aspects. First, there is great fear that the prolonged slump will relegate into the ranks of the unemployed a great number of still employed but surplus workers through massive employment adjustments. Furthermore, the difference between foreign and domestic wages as viewed from a dollar base in concert with the sharply higher yen is growing ever larger. As a result, there is accelerated investment in overseas manufacturing, which has given rise to anxiety over the gap between production and employment. Finally, with the solid trend toward an aging population and work force, a long-term task is to reconsider Japanese-style employment practices and management system. The Current Situation of Employment Stability The current business recession, which started at the beginning of 1991 and then apparently having hit bottom at the beginning of 1993 but followed by the emergence of the high yen, again continues. With the possibility that the economic growth rate during fiscal 1993 will be still lower than the less than one percent growth rate of the preceding year, the lowest since the latter half of the seventies, the result is the fear that this will be the longest recession since the end of World War II. One major and unique characteristic of the current business recession is the stability of employment compared to the previous high yen slump. Despite an average 6.3 percent drop in manufacturing production during fiscal 1992, the number of regularly employed people compared to the preceding year remained stable and for the first half of 1993 dropped to a level just 0.7 percent below the preceding year and stayed there. This is the major difference compared to the previous high yen slump where the drop in production and employment stayed roughly in the same range. Against this background are the following two major factors. First is the steep adjustment in work hours which occurred this time as part of the process of reducing production activity. With the reduction in prescribed work hours and the spread of the five-day work week, there was a steep reduction of slightly more than 3 percent (during the high yen slump it was slightly less than 1 percent) in the total work hour base. The heightened demand for a subrogated work force in concert with this short-term development is a major factor in the avoidance of a steep decline in regular employment. The total committed work base, comprised of hours, was lower than for the previous high yen slump. Furthermore, the wage adjustment mechanism worked more effectively this time. During the previous high yen slump, the cost of real wages (deflation in wholesale prices) rose to a remarkably high level due to the high yen and the steep drop in the price of oil and despite a slump in production activity. This time, in contrast, the gentle rate of increase in the cost of real wages for 1992 was slightly more than 2 percent, given the fact that the drop in the price of manufactured goods was trifling. In this way, real wages and the adjustment in work hours were effectively accomplished. In terms of this recession, despite a steep drop in work productivity accompanying the drop in production activity, the rate of increase for companies in unit work cost (the cost of real wages divided by work productivity) remained at about the same level as for the previous peak. A "Myth" To Be Tested However, it is doubtful that employment stability will continue in the latter half of fiscal 1993 as it has up to now. First, there is little room for a further reduction in work hours, which have already reached a remarkably low level. Furthermore, we are in a situation where wholesale prices have dropped 3 percent over last year under the continued high yen, with little room remaining for adjustments in real wages if the solidification of nominal wages in the downward direction is any precedent. This is one basis for the "wage reduction argument" which would involve the lowering of the nominal wage base during the spring labor offensive. There is exceedingly little possibility that such a "wage reduction" will occur. Rather, should production activity be fully restored in fiscal 1993, the level of unit work cost will be higher still and will be a major factor in putting additional pressure on company earnings. Were we to mechanically calculate the amount of necessary reduction in employment because unit work costs for manufacturing at the beginning of fiscal 1993 remained at a par with the preceding year, we would get a 10-percent reduction (about 800,000 people) over the preceding year and from the viewpoint of manufacturing costs would become an appropriate standard in establishing surplus employment in companies. On the other hand, should most of this be absorbed by the market, the unemployment rate would be 3 percent. Furthermore, the pressure for adjustments in employment is particularly striking for the management ranks. As a result of reduced operations which were vigorously implemented during the first half of the eighties, the number of people employed professionally as managers dropped despite economic growth. However, since 1986 the tide turned once again to rapid additions in staff and, compared to the trend (based on the GNP price elasticity) for 1991, the base for all industries now shows a surplus of nearly 170,000 people. This is based on accelerating growth in the number of employees as a whole and a 20-percent increase during the past six years in the number of professional managers. What made this possible was excessive creation of subsidiaries by major companies caused by latent profits in real estate during the bubble economy. In this sense, to the degree that adjustments were not made during the previous high yen slump, the pressure for reducing the number of management positions has increased during this business recession. The guarantee of stable employment during business recessions has been accepted up to this point as a tacit contract arising from the Japanese-style employment system. There are those who question the responsibility of management vis-a-vis implementing of forced employment reductions by major companies. However, it is not that major Japanese companies have never adopted reductions in force in the past, rather they have delayed them as much as a year and a half when compared to U.S. firms. The conditions that made this possible were the work hours and the heightened adjustment force of real wages. Furthermore, during those periods the brevity of the business recession always pointed to a business recovery. With the latter half of fiscal 1993 indicating a strong possibility that these conditions will not be met at all, this may become the time when the myth that "big business equals stable employment" will be questioned. The High Yen and the Hollowing Out of Industry The continuing high yen, a major factor in the lengthening of the current recession, has rekindled the risk of a hollowed-out industry, which had been trumpeted during the previous high yen slump. The high yen, which has climbed to nearly 100 to the dollar, is only one-fourth what it was during the 1985-87 period in terms of rate of increase. A major factor for the serious acceptance of the current high yen has been the inability to shift smoothly from external to internal demand, eliminating other factors of the earlier high yen period such as: 1) correction of the overly cheap yen during first half of the eighties; 2) improvement in trade as a result of the steep drop in crude oil prices; and 3) financial deregulation and increased corporate earnings bolstered by skyrocketing asset values. That is to say, the current high yen, facing a time of corporate strength weakened by a steep business recession and the explosive drop in asset values, is having a greater impact than would appear on the surface. Furthermore, from the fact that the automobile and electronics industries, which were eagerly making direct overseas investments during the previous high yen time and simultaneously investing aggressively in plants and equipment domestically, the hollowed-out production argument results in needless fear. However, if we look back in terms of the current state of things, another factor was that the chief export industries, primarily automobiles and electronics, in simultaneously making broad domestic and direct overseas investments, created a surplus of plants and equipment, prolonging the inventory adjustment period. The response to the high yen by Japanese companies who have learned this lesson will be different this time. Furthermore, it is significant that many businesses already producing in earnest overseas have made few investments compared to the previous high yen period. In this alone there is the strong possibility that companies are responding with care to the differences between foreign and domestic production costs. In the future this will strengthen the trend for still higher production overseas as opposed to domestic production. However, on the other hand, judging by questionnaires of most companies, the view that 120 yen to the dollar is an appropriate exchange rate and that export industries will be dealt a major blow should the yen go any higher than this, raises many doubts. Although the five-year average exchange rate preceding the high yen from the beginning of this fiscal year was stable at about 134 yen to the dollar, the difference in the inflation rate between the United States and Japan during that time was on the average close to 3 percent in terms of wholesale prices and the real base in the yen versus the dollar means that for this period the yen was almost 15 percent cheaper. This is to say, in terms of the nominal base, the stability of the exchange rate for Japan, which has had a remarkably low inflation rate among advanced nations, means depreciation in terms of the real base. The high yen this time signifies this kind of adjustment in the direction of a cheaper yen. The high yen provides an opportunity to increase the pressure for restructuring domestic industry, which has been protected by the system, including agriculture, through the growing foreign and domestic price differential. Although productivity in some areas of manufacturing in Japan is extremely high, productivity for industry as a whole in 1991 compared to the United States and the chief countries of Europe was 20 percent lower (from a base of purchasing parity). Facilitating movement of workers from areas of low productivity to highly productive ones through deregulation is a fundamental strategy for linking increased demand for high yen profits and for avoiding a hollowing out of employment. Changing Japanese-Style Employment The fact that Japanese companies, which have been facing a business recession, did not immediately resort to layoffs as is done in the United States but instead sustained surplus employment by sacrificing corporate profits has been taken as a manifestation of their sense of social responsibility. Consequently, fear is widespread that, should the underlying relationship of trust between employer and employee collapse through a large-scale employment adjustment, in particular through the dismissal of midcareer and senior employees with many years of service, companies will lose the industriousness of the worker and over the long term the vitality of the Japanese economy will be weakened. However, Japanese-style employment, which is based on the seniority system and employment stability, must undergo wide ranging alteration, whether we like it or not, brought on by a major change in the external environment, the long-term aging of Japan's population. The percentage of aged will double in the next 30 years and, furthermore, the rate of increase in the supply of workers in the 1990's will be half that of the 1980's, which means that we will once again be facing reductions as we enter the 21st century. It is a very different situation where up to now Japan has been supported by a high-quality, abundant work force. The elements that will sustain the greatest impact from this are the seniority system and the wage scales that are based on age and reflect seniority. Wage scales that provide increases in the average wage based on current age have in general been accepted as subsistence supplement [seikatsu kyu] based on a worker's need to provide for increased educational fees for his children. However, perhaps these major Japanese companies been practicing something akin to the communist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need." Rather, a better explanation is that wages increase on the basis of age and years of continuous service rather than stemming from an economic theory that a portion of the profits from the investment in human capital which communicate discipline within the company are restored in the form of wages based on years of service in order to keep an employee with the company. In this case, a wage system based on years of service is a factor in that the average white collar worker can bear the burden of raising and educating his children, except that this is not the outcome. If the wage system is not paternalism by business but is the result of corporate policy toward the investment of human capital in a pyramidal age structure reflecting the population and Japan's high growth rate since World War II, the increasing average age of the work force and a lower average economic growth rate could weaken the corporate will toward investment in human capital and actually work toward lowering the slope of the wage profile. Furthermore, should the situation develop that stockholders, and chiefly institutional investors, more and more be unwilling to accept excess employment and the sacrificing of company profits during business recessions as has been the case up to now, companies all the more will move toward the curtailment of employees who are subject to entrenched personnel practices. Should this materialize, the incentive for an employee to remain with one company as has been the case to this point will diminish. Furthermore, the chronic need for labor and the inadequate labor force will work to heighten the trend toward increased unemployment along with increased employment opportunities at midcareer. This situation was already strikingly evident at some companies during the last stage of the Heisei recession. Should the behavior of employees become fluid and not fit into the framework of a specific company, employment practices more and more will have to change regarding this. Compensations for Employment Stability Up to this point the embracing of an surplus work force by Japanese companies during business recessions has been highly praised as a demonstration of their social responsibility. However, the Japanese worker is forced to make many sacrifices in return for employment stability. First is the chronically long work week. In an employment system which adds long overtime hours to the normal day, reducing work hours during business recessions can regulate the amount of work invested. Indeed, this is a system that exists in order to use precious human capital to the maximum. For U.S. and European companies that lack this kind of overtime buffer, a drop in production activity must immediately be tied to layoffs. Second are the frequent transfers and temporary assignments to affiliated companies. Japanese employees are obliged to do what the company orders in return for guaranteed employment. As a result, the reshuffling of office and production workers among business activities during recessions is everyday fare. In going beyond the basic need for this, many companies attempt this as a kind of "shock treatment" in order to generate a sense of crisis in the employee. However, the psychological suffering is incalculable for older workers who are dispatched to unfamiliar jobs. Third is the 30 percent of white-collar workers in their forties who make unaccompanied transfers caused by reshuffling stemming from transfers effected without regard to business conditions. To attribute this to the issue of a worker's family and his children's education is myopic. For example, even were this not the issue, moving a family from a town to which they are accustomed to unknown territory for the convenience of the company is totally unacceptable in European and U.S. societies. Finally, the fixed employment system of large companies is a major factor in the substantial differences in wages. This is to say, the fact that women who must work for the sake of their homes and their children are actually excluded from the seniority system is the reason why the average difference in wages between men and women is the largest in Japan among advanced nations. Furthermore, an aged-based system, which uniformly makes retirement compulsory despite differences in individual ability at a particular age, sanctions "age discrimination" which is prohibited by law in the United States. Moreover, whenever a male employee 40 or older tries to change jobs to seek new opportunities, he faces the disadvantage that the amount of retirement he will receive is severely reduced because he is interrupting his years of continuous service. This factor prevents the effective employment of precious human talent which could benefit another company. It is true that working conditions have improved drastically in the development of the postwar Japanese economy with the promotion of wage increases and shorter work weeks. However, companies dictate repeated shuffling of personnel, and older employees, who have skills useful only to a specific company, also face compulsory retirement and are forced to transfer to job sites with extremely poor working conditions. Moreover, it is also true that those in management are coerced into early retirement or are put on temporary retirement transfers to subsidiaries in advance of their formal retirement age. Improving Employment Policies There is a surplus work force, the time when employment stability was the greatest concern is gone, the inadequacy of the aging work force is becoming universal, and the negotiating strength of the worker is increasing. The coming issue, therefore, is not simply one of employment stability, but of having a choice in work content. Should that happen, it will often be more advantageous for a company to keep common specialized technologies on hand than to focus simply on management positions. For the worker there are more fundamental advantages with an inadequate work force than for the company. The prerequisite is to create a society in which one can choose one's retirement and have individual choice in work content. The chief aim of Japanese employment policy until now has been to reduce unemployment by underwriting entrenched employment practices. However, the entrenched employment practices are a major cause of the sharp differences in working conditions for senior workers above retirement age and married women, not to mention the cost of job shuffling, frequent transfers, and chronic overtime. The limitations in the supply of the work force will intensify as we enter the 21st century. Moreover, as the ratio of older workers and women grows, the social cost of entrenched employment practices will steadily increase. The current "lifetime employment system" is already changing and in the future adjustments to employment centering on management positions will steadily strengthen. Given this situation, support to entrenched corporate employment practices through subsidies as government policy may be unavoidable in the short term. However, policies will be needed for the long term which give mobility to workers broadening the range of choices he can make beyond of dependency on one particular company. To this end, it will be necessary to abolish the preferential tax system which does not allow an employee to defer pay into a retirement fund, and in its place establish a government policy such as for welfare payments that make it possible to move to an accounting system for company retirements that is not disadvantageous to transfers between companies. Furthermore, employment mobility will stimulate the need for a shift toward practical life experience over the university education which primarily fulfills the function of qualitative selection for entry into major companies. Furthermore, the possibility exists that the non-productive behavior of working any number of years in order to enter a famous university will be reduced should midcareer employment opportunities with major companies expand. Reform of the Japanese educational system will be indispensable for improving the labor market, which will be the way out.
