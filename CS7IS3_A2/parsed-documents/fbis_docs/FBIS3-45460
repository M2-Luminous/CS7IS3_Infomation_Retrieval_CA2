As a result, the reputation of the Conservative government is going downhill, and the position of Prime Minister John Major is becoming more precarious each day. At the beginning of this year, British society was shocked by a scandal where Environment Minister Tim Yeo had an illegitimate child. Because this minister had always been an advocate of John Major's new idea of "back to basics," the mass media raised the issue: If it attached great importance to "traditional values," the Conservative Party should not act against family and individual moral standards either. Facing a public outcry for Yeo's resignation, Prime Minister John Major claimed that "the illegitimate child" issue was a private matter for Yeo and that it was up to him to decide whether he should resign from office. John Major's remarks aroused greater resentment among the public. As a result, Yeo's constituency demanded that he resign immediately, while criticism from the media also intensified. The forced resignation of Tim Yeo was followed by another scandal. Secretary to the Cabinet Alan Duncan went so far as to buy a council house illegally for 50 percent less than the market price, thus earning a profit of nearly 200,000 pounds. Then, on 10 January, the Earl of Caithness, the minister of state for transport, announced his resignation. It was disclosed that the cause of his resignation was the suicide of his wife, who could not bear the minister's extra-marital affairs. If we say that the disgraceful series above only impaired the reputation of individuals, then another scandal revealed by major British newspapers the other day could do great harm to the image of the Conservative Party as a whole. According to a 250-page report released by the relevant auditing department in London, Westminster City Council, which is claimed to be the "flagship" council of the Conservative Party in Greater London (and which includes major commercial and tourist areas in London proper), had misappropriated up to 21.25 million pounds of public funds to canvass for the Conservative Party. This incident immediately gave rise to a public uproar, and some people believe that "the Conservative Party is corrupt and that they have abandoned basic traditional values." In recent years, Britain has been plagued by a worsening economic recession and drastic increases in unemployment and crime rates, and complaints are heard everywhere. People from Britain's political and economic circles have always blamed the leaders of the Conservative Party for "their lack of creativity" as well as their inability to shoulder the heavy duty of leading Britain. Under such circumstances, in order to establish a new image for and restore the prestige of the Conservative Party, John Major raised the slogan of "back to basics" at the party's annual conference in October 1993. The essence of his slogan was to implement basic economic policies, including maintaining a low inflation rate, advocating free markets, and supporting the development of enterprises; attaching greater importance to basic social values, such as exercising self restraint, respecting the law, and showing concern for others; and to restoring the traditional values of "being honest and upright in one's way, and being particular about one's manners." For a time, the public cherished the hope that Major's slogan could inject a certain vigor into British society, which has been dejected and apathetic for many years. That is why public resentment is soaring after the moral scandals inside the government were exposed, and people have deemed the Major administration a "hypocritical" government. It is clear that the accusations made in political circles and the media have already gone beyond the moral standards of individuals and have touched upon the credibility and reputation of the leaders of the Conservative Party. The results of the latest opinion polls show clearly that the Conservative Party has fallen behind the Labor Party by 25 percentage points, with an approval rate of a mere 26 percent. People generally believe that the unceasing scandals in the Conservative Party have made the Major administration, which already suffers low prestige among the public, to further lose the trust of the British public. It is probable that the Major administration will choose to reshuffle the cabinet at an early date; otherwise, it will surely suffer losses in the local council elections and the European Parliament elections scheduled for this May and June. By then, the problems may be so serious that one or two resignations by ministers will be to no avail.
