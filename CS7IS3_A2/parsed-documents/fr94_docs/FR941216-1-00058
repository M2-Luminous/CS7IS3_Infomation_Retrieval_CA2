The synthetic debt instrument is the hypothetical debt instrument with the same cash flows as the combined cash flows of the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge. (c) Integrated transaction _(1) Integration by taxpayer. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a qualifying debt instrument and a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge are an integrated transaction if all of the following requirements are satisfied_ (i) The taxpayer satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph (f) of this section on or before the date the taxpayer enters into the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge. (ii) None of the parties to the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge are related within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1) (other than parties that have made a separate-entity election under §1.1221&hyph;2(d)). (iii) Both the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge are entered into by the same individual, partnership, trust, estate, or corporation (regardless of whether the corporation is a member of an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return). (iv) With respect to a foreign person engaged in a U.S. trade or business that issues or acquires a qualifying debt instrument or enters into a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge through the trade or business, all items of income and expense associated with the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge (other than interest expense that is subject to §1.882&hyph;5) would have been effectively connected with the U.S. trade or business throughout the term of the synthetic debt instrument had this section not applied. (v) The qualifying debt instrument, any other debt instrument that is part of the same issue as the qualifying debt instrument, or the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge cannot have been part of an integrated transaction entered into by the taxpayer that has been terminated under the legging out rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (vi) The §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge is entered into on or after the date the qualifying debt instrument is issued or acquired. (2) Integration by Commissioner. The Commissioner may treat a qualifying debt instrument and a financial instrument (whether entered into by the taxpayer or by a related party) as an integrated transaction if the combined cash flows on the qualifying debt instrument and financial instrument are substantially the same as the combined cash flows required for the financial instrument to be a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge. The circumstances under which the Commissioner may require integration include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) A taxpayer fails to identify a qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge under paragraph (f) of this section. (ii) A taxpayer issues or acquires a qualifying debt instrument and a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) enters into the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge. (iii) A taxpayer issues or acquires a qualifying debt instrument and enters into the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge with a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)). (iv) The taxpayer legs out of an integrated transaction and subsequently enters into a new §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge with respect to the same qualifying debt instrument or other debt instrument that is part of the same issue. (d) Special rules for legging into and legging out of an integrated transaction _(1) Legging into _(i) Definition. Legging into an integrated transaction under this section means that a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge is entered into after the date the qualifying debt instrument is issued by the taxpayer or acquired by the taxpayer, and the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied on the date the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge is entered into (the leg-in date). (ii) Treatment. If a taxpayer legs into an integrated transaction, the taxpayer treats the qualifying debt instrument under the applicable rules for accruing interest and OID up to the leg-in date, except that the day before the leg-in date is treated as the end of an accrual period. As of the leg-in date, the qualifying debt instrument is subject to the rules of paragraph (g) of this section. (iii) Anti-abuse rule. If a taxpayer legs into an integrated transaction with a principal purpose of deferring or accelerating income or deductions on the qualifying debt instrument, the Commissioner may_ (A) Treat the qualifying debt instrument as sold for its fair market value on the leg-in date; or (B) Refuse to allow the taxpayer to integrate the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge.
