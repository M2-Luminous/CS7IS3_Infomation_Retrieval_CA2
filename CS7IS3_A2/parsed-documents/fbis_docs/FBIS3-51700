The number of deputies was increased from 77 to 113, and the requirement of being affiliated to a political party was eliminated per the sudden decision by Congress, whose sessions had previously been suspended until 1 February by Fernando Rosero, acting president of the chamber. However, Samuel Belletini, the actual president of Congress, refused to accept the suspension, and he reconvened the session. Within a few minutes, the controversial package of reforms was approved amid loud protests by the opposition. The change in the composition of Congress, which could alter the traditional balance between the coastal and mountain regions, might entail changing the terms of the upcoming 1 May elections, which officially got under way on 1 January under the constitutional provisions that were in effect at that time. According to the official call for elections, 65 of the 77 deputies of the unicameral Congress must be elected. President Duran-Ballen must promulgate the reforms in order for them to go into effect, and this is practically assured in view of the support given to the package by the pro-government wing. Violations of procedure, including the approval of rules without the necessary votes, have been alleged by the opposition, which has announced its decision to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to annul the reforms. Meanwhile, the full scope of the reforms was not clarified in today's session of Congress. While some sectors assured that the reforms will not go into effect until 1996 and, in turn, the upcoming elections will not be affected, other blocs claimed that the changes will go into effect immediately. The same Congress must determine the effective date for the reforms to the Constitution that was approved in a 1978 referendum.
