How will they affect our province's development? [Feng] There are four kinds of problems facing water resources in our province. First is the relatively low volume of water resources. Second is the imbalance in the time and space distribution of these water resources. Third is serious pollution affecting water quality. Finally, is the low capacity available to exert control of water resources on a broader scale. For many years, the average annual precipitation has measured 531.4 mm, 18 percent lower than the national average, and placing Heilongjiang 25th among 30 provinces, cities and regions. The total volume of water resources in Heilongjiang is 77.2 billion cubic meters, which translates into 2,180 cubic meters per capita, 520 cub meters lower than the per capita amount nationally. The acreage share of water per mu is only one-third of that per mu nationwide. Rainfall and runoff during the year are concentrated in the months June through September, comprising 60 percent to 80 percent of the annual precipitation, which leads to easy flooding. Since rainfall during June is less than 10 percent of the annual total, a spring drought frequently occurs. Water distribution is concentrated mostly in hilly areas, which is 74.5 percent of the total precipitation. While only 25.5 percent of the water resources is located in the plains where 80 percent of the cultivated land in the province is found, one can see how the arrangement between water and land resources is extremely illogical. The quality of natural water in Heilongjiang is very good, except it is seriously polluted by humans. Rivers where the pollution is more serious include the Sunghuajiang, Mudanjiang, Tangwanghe, Musuhe, Ashihe, Anbanghe etc. It is now possible to regulate and control surface runoff in Heilongjiang at 7 billion cubic meters. In comparison with Jilin and Liaoning Provinces, this scale of control is far lower than theirs. Moreover, Heilongjiang's effort is a preliminary development phase, which depends chiefly on natural runoff. These problems seriously inhibit Heilongjiang's economy and the improvement in living conditions of its inhabitants. [Reporter] What measures and practices has Heilongjiang adopted to strengthen the management of these water resources? [Feng] Heilongjiang places great importance on management of the province's water resources. In 1988, after the "PRC Water Law" had been promulgated, Heilongjiang's People's Provincial Assembly passed "Implementation of the `PRC Water Law,'" and the provincial CPC committee and provincial government issued "Identification of Several Problems on Strengthening Water Conservation Construction Projects." Following this, the provincial government further established a means to implement this "identification." The appearance of a series of regulations and policy statements issued by the provincial CPC, the provincial assembly, and the provincial government on following the law regarding water control and flood prevention, comprehensive management of water resources, mobilizing all elements in society to participate in water conservation, to strengthen water conservation-based industries and turn around the passive economic development that had resulted from sluggish buildup of irrigation and water conservancy projects. To logically open up and effectively protect the water resources in Heilongjiang, we must start with basic tasks by initiating an overall survey and evaluation of the whole province's water resources. We must classify water resources by river basin and cities/towns; investigate and evaluate underground water resources for those towns suffering water shortages; and make a present status survey of water resources being tapped and used. Based on the needs of the "Water Law," Heilongjiang will organize water administrative teams overseeing water use compliance, and their authority will extend all the way down to the village level to locate and deal with cases flouting the water conservation law. Supported by the court in some localities, special water conservation courts may be set up. To strengthen the unified management of water resources, we must implement a plan for economic use of water. Within the province, the plan must cover tapping of water directly from rivers, lakes, and underground sources, implementing a permit system for water extraction where "water extraction permits" are issued by water administration agencies at various levels, and collecting a water resource fee. [Reporter] What engineering projects will the province consider in the next step? [Feng] For several years Heilongjiang has invested considerable sums to build several irrigation and water conservation projects. Among them are 69 large and small-size reservoirs controlling a total volume of 7 billion meters of water. Add to this the engineering project diverting water from the Nunjiang, and a series of water conservation items in the Sanjiang area--all of which are having an impact on development in Heilongjiang. However, these already-built projects cannot meet present needs. In accordance with the spirit of "Identifying Several Problems on Strengthening Water Conservation Construction Projects," issued by the provincial CPC and the provincial government, new construction and expansion, and safety maintenance will involve 14 large and mid-size reservoirs, which will increase the capacity to control surface water to more than 10 billion cubic meters. The importance of the Nierji, Qinglongshan, and other reservoirs in the planning stage right now is to increase the capacity to control the water volume in some of the important rivers in the province to meet the needs of agricultural production along both river shorelines, and thereby stimulate economic development in these areas.
