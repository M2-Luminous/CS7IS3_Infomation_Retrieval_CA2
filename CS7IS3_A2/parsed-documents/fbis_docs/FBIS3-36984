He said in a press release on Sunday that General Suleymenov "was and remains a member of Chechnya's legally elected parliament, as well as defence minister in the Government of People's Confidence of the Chechen Republic". "His illegal arrest by supporters of the Chechen ruling regime may exhaust the patience of our government and force it to take adequate measures" if Suleymenov is not set free in the near future, Mamodayev warned. He did not elaborate on "adequate measures" and did not specify the date from which his ultimatum was to come into force. But he stressed that "the Government of People's Confidence has everything it needs for taking such measures". General Suleymenov headed armed opposition in Chechnya after Dudayev disbanded the Chechen Parliament last spring and declared open war on political opposition. The general formed an opposition army of several hundreds of fighters. In early February, he conducted military exercises of his army and demanded President Dudayev's resignation. On February 9, Suleymenov and his bodyguards were arrested by Chechen Security Department officers. So far, he has not been officially charged with any crime.
