FR941125-1-00019 FR941125-1-00007 (5) Conformity of federal actions with the SIP. Section 176(c) of the Act requires the States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIPs. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by the States be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required USEPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final USEPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed the States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557, April 16, 1992). The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993, (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993, (58 FR 63214). These conformity regulations require the States to adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIPs for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of Illinois is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, the State of Illinois is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(V) and, thus, do not affect approval of the redesignation request. It should be noted, however, that regardless of the attainment status of Jersey County, Illinois is obligated under the transportation conformity rule and under the general conformity rule to submit the conformity SIP revisions, including revisions covering Jersey County by the deadlines discussed here. Therefore, the attainment status of Jersey County should not be an issue in this case. It is further noted that the Illinois redesignation request for Jersey County indicates that the State of Illinois will submit a SIP revision to meet USEPA's conformity requirements after Illinois has had sufficient time to review and act on USEPA's final conformity regulations. C. Improvement of Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Emission Reductions The IEPA notes, on the basis of relative emissions and on the basis of the meteorology leading to high ozone concentrations in Jersey County, that the high ozone concentrations observed in Jersey County in 1988 were due to ozone precursor emissions in the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area. For example, the IEPA notes that the 1990 summertime VOC emissions in Jersey County were only 20 tons per day while the VOC emissions in the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area were 922 tons per day. Given the proximity of the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area, the dominance of ozone precursor emissions from that area compared to those from Jersey County, and the meteorology of peak ozone days in Jersey County (winds are predominately from the southeast through southwest on these days placing Jersey County immediately downwind of the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis area), one can see that the ozone precursor emissions in the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis area are the likely source of the high ozone concentrations in Jersey County. Between 1987 and 1990, the following VO emission control measures were implemented in the Metro-East St. Louis area: (1) reduction in fuel volatility (Reid Vapor Pressure [RVP]) from 11.2 pounds per square inch (psi) to 9.0 psi; (2) continued implementation of the Federal Motor Vehicle Emission Control Program (FMVCP); (3) basic vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M); and (4) RACT. In Jersey County, the following VOC emission control measures were implemented between 1987 and 1990: (1) reduction in fuel RVP from 11.2 psi to 9.5 psi; (2) continued implementation of the FMVCP; and (3) RACT on major sources. These emission control programs produced real and permanent decreases in VOC emissions and are responsible for the attainment of the ozone NAAQS in Jersey County. The largest emission reductions have occurred for mobile sources and gasoline related evaporative emissions, which are a significant portion of the total VOC emissions for the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis and Jersey County areas. Mobile source emissions decreased approximately 25 percent between 1987 and 1990, and gasoline evaporative emissions decreased approximately 10 percent in the same time period. D. Maintenance Plan The following summarizes Illinois' maintenance plan for Jersey County: (1) Emission certification and tracking. The IEPA will continue to inventory ozone precursor emissions in Jersey County and will make periodic updates in the emissions inventory consistent with the requirements of the Act. The IEPA will track Jersey County emissions to ensure that significant increases in emissions are identified and evaluated for possible air quality impacts. If significant negative air impacts are indicated, appropriate regulatory action will be initiated.
