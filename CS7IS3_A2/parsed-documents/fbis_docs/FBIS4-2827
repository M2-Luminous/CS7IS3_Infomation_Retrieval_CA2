According to the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, the heavy bomb caused serious material losses and high casualties and, as a result, many horrified residents fled to mountains around the town. But the agency did not give the exact number of casualties. Two U.S. bombers destroyed two Serb military ambulances and killed two medical workers Monday afternoon when bombing the Serb positions two kilometers away from downtown Gorazde. It was reported that both NATO and the Pentagon are dissatisfied with the two air raids against the Serb positions. In the first air strike Sunday, two U.S. F-16 planes could not find the targets in time as they lost contact with the land control system. They hastened to drop bombs when fuel was running out before they could return to their base. In Monday's operation, the bad weather over Gorazde and the complex terrain might be reasons for the accident. Inspecting Serb positions around Gorazde, Bosnian Serb leader Rodovan Karadzic said that the United Nations, when authorizing NATO to launch air strikes against Serb positions, has committed a gross mistake that could lead to "disastrous consequences." He also accused Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia who called in the NATO warplanes to bomb Serb positions, of siding with one warring party, referring to the Muslims. Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb Army who was accompanying Karadzic during the inspection, said he and Karadzic had ordered Serb soldiers to shoot down any NATO warplanes that will stage air raids against Serb positions again.
