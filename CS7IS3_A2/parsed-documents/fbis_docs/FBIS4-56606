Menem noted: "One could either follow the European or the Brazilian models," adding: "One must not forget that the United States is not acting in the world alone, it is part of an interdependent world." He noted that Washington is engaged in "the NAFTA process, which seeks to promote free trade, while we are within Mercosur [Common Market of the South]." He said there are many options available as far as approving this law is concerned. Menem said: "We are committed to lobbying for the proposal, but we are not going to force lawmakers." In remarks during the program "Controversy at the Bar," Menem joked with the actors and told producer Gerardo Sofovich that if he expected the president to defend him against the "aggressions" of his colleagues, he will have to pay him his "fees as an attorney." Menem also described as "simple rumors" reports of federal government intervention in the Buenos Aires City Council and in the Tucuman Province Legislature. He also denied charges that he only grants interviews to "journalists who are my friends."
