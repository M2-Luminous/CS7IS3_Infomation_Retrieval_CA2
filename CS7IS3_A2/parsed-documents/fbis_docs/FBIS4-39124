He said "the non-competitive production of Ukrainian enterprises has so far found a market only in the eastern republics of the former USSR." However, he said "Ukrainian industry is in dire need of western technology, something which Russia is unable to give us." Kuchma was convinced that Ukraine needed a strong centrist party for the Ukrainian president to lean on. "One possible basis" was his own Interregional Reform Alliance, he said. Kuchma believes that only well-versed economists could put Ukraine's economic mess right. "I see no one to fit the bill among potential future prime ministers," he said. Regarding the situation in Crimea, Kuchma pointed out that separatist moods on the peninsula could have been warned earlier, without creating a precedent for their encouragement. He said that the regions must be given broad economic stability rather than political independence. "The Black Sea Fleet is a constant source of tension in Crimea," Kuchma commented. "The fleet must be leased in its entirety to Russia and the proceeds used to buy Russian oil and gas...Ukraine does not need such a huge or, for that matter, decrepit fleet," the presidential candidate said.
