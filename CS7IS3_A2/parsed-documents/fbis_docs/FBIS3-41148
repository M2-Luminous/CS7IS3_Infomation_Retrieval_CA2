According to the source, authorities constantly receive reports of fishermen and residents on drug shipments that are brought ashore. The source added that this kind of activity has also been reported in several provinces, such as Chiriqui, Colon, and Veraguas. He said that in the Atlantic sector, boats are using the island of Escudo de Veraguas for illegal activities due to the lack of surveillance. The source stated that the SAN is constantly conducting operations in the most vulnerable points for this kind of activity, but the lack of aircraft and resources prevents them from maintaining constant surveillance. However, the source said he did not know whether the town of Viento Frio in Colon Province is being used for the trafficking of drugs. He indicated that so far SAN authorities on the Atlantic coast do not have reports on the use of this location as a point for transshipping narcotics. Recently, residents of this town reported the presence of boats that drop drug packages, which are later picked up by persons who sell narcotics. During 1993, the authorities conducted several counternarcotics operations in the Provinces of Chiriqui and Bocas del Toro, which led to the arrest of several people allegedly involved in drug contraband.
