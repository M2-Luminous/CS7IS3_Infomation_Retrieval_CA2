According to reports coming from Tijuana where the murder took place last Wednesday, this man is Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas who was allegedly hired by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) as a member of the candidate's security corps. Colosio was murdered last Wednesday at the end of an election rally held in Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood in northern Tijuana, on the border. The video, filmed by an amateur and disseminated today by Televisa, first shows Sanchez Venegas getting close to the candidate and later opening the way for Aburto Martinez. In the video, one can see how the assassin raises his arm and puts the Taurus .38 caliber just a few centimeters from Colosio's right temple, as well as the blast at the moment of the shooting. This is the first direct image of the homicide, which even registers the exact hour of the shooting, 1912 Mexico City time (0112 GMT). Quoting sources close to the investigation, the daily EXCELSIOR said, however, that Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas denied any link to the attack and pointed out that the fact he was there next to Aburto Martinez is a mere "coincidence." Two other persons arrested on the day of the murder as witnesses, Vicente Mayoral and Jose Antonio Sanchez Ortega, were released 24 hours after the murder. The Attorney General's Office [PGR] denied reports to the effect that Sanchez Ortega tested "positive" in the so-called "paraffin test," conducted immediately after the murder to determine if he had fired any weapon. The police also arrested several relatives and people close to the confessed killer, including his mother, Maria Luisa Martinez, and his sisters Elizabeth and Karina, ages 17 and 9, the press said today, adding that their whereabouts are unknown. According to the PGR, there was only one man, Aburto Martinez, and only one weapon, the Taurus .38 caliber gun, involved in the attack, but political circles and the local media do not rule out a plot. Investigations are now under Special Prosecutor Miguel Montes, whose appointment has been challenged by the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), who believe that Montes' pro-government affiliation does not guarantee the impartiality necessary for arriving at the truth.
