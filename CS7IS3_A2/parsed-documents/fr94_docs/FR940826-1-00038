FR940826-1-00038 FR940826-1-00008 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Care Financing Administration 42 CFR Parts 412, 413, and 414 [BPD&hyph;763&hyph;P] RIN 0938&hyph;AG20 Medicare Program; End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Payment Exception Requests and Organ Procurement Costs AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: These proposed regulations specify the criteria HCFA would use to determine if a facility furnishing dialysis services to patients with end stage renal disease qualifies for a higher payment under an exception to the prospectively determined payment rate. These regulations are intended to inform providers of the procedures HCFA uses to evaluate payment exception requests. They implement existing authority in section 1881 (b)(2) and (b)(7) of the Social Security Act (the Act). These regulations would also revise the way we compute acquisition costs for hearts and livers that are transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries.
