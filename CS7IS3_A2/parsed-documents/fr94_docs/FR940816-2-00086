FR940816-2-00086 FR940816-2-00066 [Docket No. AB&hyph;3 (Sub-No. 118X)] Missouri Pacific Railroad Company_Discontinuance of Trackage Rights Exemption_Perry County, IL Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP), has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuances of Trackage Rights to discontinue its trackage rights over approximately 7.2 miles of rail line owned by Illinois Central Railroad Company (IC) 1 between milepost G&hyph;59.20 (Valuation Station 3132+45) in Pinckneyville, and milepost G&hyph;66.43 (Valuation Station 280+79) in Pyatts, both in Perry County, IL. 2 1 The trackage rights were granted in an agreement between IC and MP dated May 7, 1929. 2 Under 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The applicant, in its verified notice, indicated a proposed consummation date of September 14, 1994. Because the verified notice was not filed until July 27, 1994, consummation should not have been proposed to take place prior to September 15, 1994. Applicant's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after September 15, 1994. MP indicates that operations by other carriers will continue on a portion of the line. IC intends to abandon a portion of the line by notice of exemption filed July 26, 1994, in Docket No. AB&hyph;43 (Sub-No. 164X). MP has certified with respect to the trackage rights involved here that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 3 3 No environmental or historical documentation is required here under 49 CFR 1105.6(b)(3). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the discontinuance shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on September 15, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay must be filed by August 29, 1994. Petitions to reopen must be filed by September 6, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 4 4 Because this is a discontinuance proceeding only and other carriers will continue to provide service over a portion of the line, the routine provisions for trail use/rail banking or public use conditions provided for in abandonment proceedings are not appropriate here. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Joseph D. Anthofer, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, NE 68179. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Decided: August 9, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20057 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
