FR940610-1-00092 FR940610-1-00008 The fat and saturated fat reductions discussed in the impact analysis above relate only to the lunch meal. The proposed regulation will also reduce fat and saturated fat in school breakfasts, from 28 to 25 percent of total calories from fat, and from 11 to 10 percent of total calories from saturated fat. This will increase the overall reduction in average fat and saturated fat for the student population, but to a lesser extent than NSLP due to the smaller reductions and because fewer students participate in the School Breakfast Program. The food labeling regulations are not expected to reduce U.S. fat and saturated fat levels by the full amount needed to achieve the Dietary Guidelines. This indicates that there will be room for the fat and saturated fat reductions which would result from the proposed rule to generate health improvement. d. Effects on Participation It is anticipated that the rule will have minimal effect on NSLP participation because implementation of the rule is not expected to increase meal prices or decrease meal acceptability. On a typical day, 25 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program. About 14 million of these meals are served to children receiving free or reduced price lunches. USDA has analyzed both the impact of meeting the dietary guidelines on meal price and meal acceptability and the implications for program participation. Lunch price is an important factor in determining the level of participation among these students, with students participating at higher rates in schools with lower prices. Research indicates that price increases can cause substantial decreases in student participation. A key factor in maintaining participation among paid students while implementing the dietary guidelines is minimizing the meal cost. Food cost analysis demonstrated that nutritional targets can be reached within current food cost constraints. Minimizing cost impacts removes upward pressure on student fees which would result in decreased student participation. USDA's efforts to test the effect of reducing fat and sodium and increasing the nutritional quality of meals has shown that improvements can be made without affecting participation. Although the SNDA study found that schools that served meals with a low proportion of calories from fat (less than 32 percent) had lower than average program participation, this information needs to be viewed in the larger context of efforts specifically designed to examine improvements in school meals. The Department sponsored demonstration projects in five school food authorities from school year 1989&hyph;90 to 1991&hyph;92 to evaluate the extent to which menus planned to meet the NSLP meal pattern could be modified to better reflect the dietary guidelines. 16 Through the Menu Modification Demonstration Project, USDA examined the process involved in modifying school meals, including the impact on program participation. The demonstration found that fat could be decreased significantly without decreasing program participation. The percentage decrease in grams of fat ranged from 12 to 31 percent in the four sites. In all schools, average daily participation remained stable or increased slightly. In addition, the improvements were made with relatively minor changes in the types of foods offered. Although the districts were not able to make comparable improvements in the percentage of calories from fat, because overall calories decreased, the results demonstrate that fat can be cut without losing participation. California is operating a State-wide demonstration of nutrient standard menu planning. The State reported that the nutrient-based system they implemented did not result in any decreases in gross meal participation between 1990 and 1992. SNDA did find lower student participation in very low-fat schools, however, the study also indicated that it is possible to reduce the average fat content of lunches offered to well below the national average of 38 percent of food energy without adversely affecting participation in the NSLP. Participation rates were similar in schools whose lunches provide a moderate percentage of food energy from fat (32 percent to 35 percent) and in those whose meals provide a high or very high percentage of food energy from fat. It is important to note that the SNDA finding of low participation among low-fat schools is not based on experience with schools altering the nutrient content of food but rather on a point-in-time cross-sectional observation of schools with low-fat meals. The study did not collect information on how the schools implemented low-fat meals and what consequences these would have had on participation.
