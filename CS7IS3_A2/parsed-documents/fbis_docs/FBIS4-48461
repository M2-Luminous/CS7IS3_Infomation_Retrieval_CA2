Putting aside Mr. Theodore Sindikubwabo's pleasure over the extermination of Tutsis in Kibuye and Cyangugu, government forces recently threatened that they would massacre those refugees in the Hotel Des Milles Collines, as well as several orphans which were taken hostage by government soldiers and Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militias]. The Interahamwe militiamen and government troops are ready to massacre all these people if the Rwandan Patriotic Front continues its military advance.
