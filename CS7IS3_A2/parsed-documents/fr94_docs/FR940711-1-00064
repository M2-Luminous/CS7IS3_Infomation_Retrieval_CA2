SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The temporary regulations (TD 8553) published in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register contain amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1), the Regulations on Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax at the Source (26 CFR part 31), and the Excise Tax Procedural Regulations (26 CFR part 40). These amendments relate to the deposits of taxes by electronic funds transfer. The final regulations that will result from the regulations proposed in this notice would be based on the text of the temporary regulations and would provide rules for the gradual phase-in of the requirement for taxpayers to deposit certain taxes by electronic funds transfer. The text of those temporary regulations also serves as the text of these proposed regulations. The preamble to the temporary regulations explains these proposed regulations. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these rules and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a copy of this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are timely submitted to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for October 3, 1994, beginning at 10:00 a.m. at the IRS Auditorium. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments by September 12, 1994, and submit an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic by September 12, 1994.
