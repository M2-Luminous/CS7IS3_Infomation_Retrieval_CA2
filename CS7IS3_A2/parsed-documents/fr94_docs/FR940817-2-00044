FR940817-2-00044 FR940817-2-00032 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;354&hyph;000] National Fuel Gas Supply Corp; Petition To Waive Tariff Provision August 11, 1994. Take notice that on August 5, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) filed a Petition for Waiver of a provision of Rate Schedule FT. National requests a waiver of Section 3.2 of National's FT Rate Schedule to the extent necessary to permit National to accept a letter of credit or alternative financial assurances acceptable to National from Iroquois Energy Management, Inc. and Medina Power Company (the Shippers) in an amount in excess of the cost of performing the service requested by the Shippers for a three-month period. National states that the limited financial assurances permitted by Section 3.2 would not secure National's capital cost for facilities required to serve the Shippers, and that the Shippers fully support the instant petition. The facilities required are those proposed by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, as operator of the Niagara Spur Loop Line, in Docket No. CP94&hyph;587&hyph;000. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 382.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
