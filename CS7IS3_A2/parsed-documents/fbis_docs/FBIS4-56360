The combined expectations placed upon this type of production, which assimilates the experience of the Anapistas [members of ANAP: National Association of Small Farmers] imply the risk of added frustrations (as in the recent case of the food program) if the people are not fully aware that it will take time--and not just days or even months--before a serious dent is made in the frugality of our meals because of the UBPC's. One cannot lose sight of the fact that our cooperative workers have inherited an agricultural picture with marked shortages of fuel, fertilizer, herbicide, tools, and shoes, a costly economic program involving machinery, pumping, and irrigation systems (in addition to dams, minidams, and canals), combined with an inefficient system of collection worsened by a lack of containers and a partially inoperative transport pool. The UBPC members as a whole can decide whether or not to acquire this equipment that places such a burden on their economy (which is what is happening in some places, where they have rejected the FREGAT irrigation machinery, for example, and some of the tractors, harvesters, and cane combines). Replacing these resources implies efficiency, but also a return to manual labor, just as we have had to go back to oxen. This means that our aspirations for a high-yield agriculture will have to be postponed for who knows how long. It may be worthwhile to note that more than a few experts maintain that this should never have been the model chosen for Cuba, any more than the gigantic scale of certain factories and enterprises. Forced as we are to deal with the situation at hand for the time being, what strikes us are the events connected with the establishment and first steps of the UBPC's, which promise to provide us with a better supply of products from the land and within a reasonable period of time. Obviously, what is happening in the fields is closely connected with our very survival. This experience of cooperativizing the work, means, and production, based on national ownership of the land and macroresources (highways and dams), with the state as the sole buyer, does entail unknown factors of interest to everyone, particularly specialists in agricultural transformations. In other words, it is not only the politicians, economists, government officials, and farmers themselves who are impressed with the need to continually evaluate the progress of the process. Veteran academicians are also sharpening their arsenal of scientific tools in order not to lose ground or their footing. Such is the case of the Rural Studies Team of the Department of Sociology of the University of La Habana, headed by Dr. Niurka Perez Rojas and made up of Dr. Cary Torres Diaz and Miriam Garcia Aguilar. Supported by a group of students, the three women have been examining the startup of the UBPC's in our country and conducted field studies in the municipalities of Santo Domingo in Villa Clara and Guines in La Habana. In addition to a solid volume of first-hand information, the researchers have evaluated the motivations and individual features of the labor force making up the UBPC's. For Professor Perez Rojas, "state-owned agriculture had demonstrated inefficiency in terms of stimulating farm workers, but also with respect to yield and the organization of work. Previous studies done by our team had already demonstrated that the farm worker's household had a lower level of monetary income than did cooperative members and individual farmers." "The UBPC members are starting from a very difficult situation of a state-owned economy that is generally unprofitable," Niurka emphasized. "It is an economy in deep crisis. This explains why its essential motivation and prime priority is to obtain food for the family via accelerated development of crops in areas of local consumption and livestock modules." "The second expectation identified by our research is the possibility of obtaining more monetary income. Although this was not articulated, we realized during our interviews that the workers also hope to obtain surpluses in time. Being able to participate in management and major decisions ranging from the election of boards of directors to anything having to do with autonomy is the third motivating factor. "Respecting and promoting that autonomy seems to me to be extremely important. I was quite concerned when I heard a leader in Granma Province tell the members of one UBPC that what was important was production rather than earnings. He was saying so because that particular UBPC wanted to cut its staff and operate with fewer workers than the state enterprise. In my opinion, the bottom line of any cooperative is the distribution of profits. Without it, there can be no profitability or efficiency. I think it is indispensable to respect the fact that it is in fact stipulated that they have the power to decide." Another aspiration expressed by UBPC members is the possibility of building homes. The researchers believe that this motivation ranked fourth because it reveals the understanding of the current shortage of resources. Man and His Work For those seeking conceptual explanations of the phenomena of reality, the behavior of work forces within the UBPC has singular features. "The first distinctive trait of the permanent UBPC work force is its duality," says Professor Cary Torres. She explains: "As long as they use the land and are the owners of the means and results of production, they are in fact owners, which gives them the right to participate in earnings and decisionmaking. However, they are at the same time an effective labor force. They are the workers and leaders within the productive process. This duality makes them different from salaried workers, both in terms of their relationship to the means of production as well as their social production." Another important element in the researchers' analysis has to do with the distinction between "the permanent work force and the hired work force, resulting from their different positions with respect to the means of production. This lends an element of subordination to the hired work force compared with the permanent work force, Torres Vila said, because the former do not have the advantage of participating in decisionmaking or local consumption, housing possibilities when scheduled and built, or other benefits. The analysis begun by the Rural Study Team of the School of Philosophy and History will also ponder the labor-related reaction of cooperative workers (the name given to UBPC members). "It is a known fact that when they were state agricultural workers," the professors say, "they did not work a full eight hours. There was absenteeism and productivity was very low. Placed in different conditions providing them with a real feeling of belonging, material incentives, and participation in decisionmaking, the same individuals have begun to react. We have observed that the same workers who performed for three or four hours are now doing so for eight or more. We also see encouraging signs of improved productivity. If this trend continues, the hired labor force and particularly the number of mobilized [sic] workers will be minimal." Many Watching Us Like everything else happening to us now, at a time when so many people around the globe want to see us succeed and others are predicting the end of our dreams, the implementation of this type of agricultural organization is viewed with interest by scholars in other parts of the world. The research being done by the Rural Study Team, which has just celebrated its tenth anniversary and which was the most outstanding collective from the School of Philosophy and History both last year and in 1992, is part of an international project on Agrarian Transformations in Socialist Countries sponsored by the MacCarthur [sic] Foundation in the United States. The academicians heading up the study in Cuba are American economist Carmen Diana Deere, professor at the University of Massachusetts, and Cubans Niurka Perez Rojas and Ernel Gonzalez, who heads the University of La Habana's Department of Sociology. In an article to be published in the coming issue of the British Cambridge University's JOURNAL OF PEASANTS STUDIES, the three scholars maintain, among other things, that: "Given the conditions of the special period, when nearly all types of food and other consumer goods are once again rationed, other incentives are needed in addition to linking pay to productivity in order to achieve a greater work effort and stabilize the size of the farm work force. With the considerable cut in the quantity and frequency with which many food products--including eggs, barnyard poultry, milk, and cooking oil are distributed--the sale of food to workers and the quality and diversity of the meals served in farm cafeterias have turned into incentives as important as wages paid in money. "While it is still too soon to evaluate this dramatic reorganization of the Cuban state-owned farm sector," say the authors of the research report soon to appear in the British periodical, "it became clear in the interviews conducted that it has generated considerable optimism among workers as well as administrators, particularly in terms of the recovery of sugar cane production. UBPC members report that they certainly feel like `owners' and are working longer days with greater intensity. They are taking better care, not only of the land, but also of their machinery and implements." Beyond Desires It is certainly premature to make any further evaluations of the UBPC's and their future. In addition to positive desires, it is praiseworthy that the CPA's [Agricultural-Livestock Cooperatives] should transfer their experience and that the ANAP should help prevent the exodus of the UBPC skilled work force, as they are now doing. It is also to be hoped that the UBPC's that grow a variety of crops will beware of the evils of disproportion that afflicted state agriculture: far too much cabbage and too few beans, large quantities of turnips and eggplant and too little rice. Political factors having to do with prices and plans that take the people rather than figures into consideration must also play a role. Now that the people have scanned the horizon of the most noteworthy positive and negative factors, hope prevails. And time must be allowed to do its work.
