But as a large party, no one can prevent us from analyzing the present situation and preparing for the future. If the prime minister's position nevertheless becomes vacant, we will put forward our own candidate in consultation with our partners in the opposition," Albert M'Peti, the PDSC [Democratic and Social Christian Party] representative in Belgium, said in an interview with DE STANDAARD. For some time, things have not been going well between the two main partners in the Zairian opposition, the UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] of Prime Minister Tshisekedi and Joseph Ileo's PDSC. In the local press and at meetings of party activists, the Christian Democrats are being blamed for dropping Tshisekedi and even looking to lead the government themselves. They would prefer to put forward their deputy chairman Gustave Malumba Mbangula. The UDPS leader made it clear again yesterday that he is not planning to step down. He called the politicians who claim the prime ministership "an insult to the intelligence of the Zairian people" and emphasized expressly that "the prime minister's position is not empty." "We also think that," M'Peti replied. "We continue to support Tshisekedi. But should things have another outcome, then we will put forward our own candidate, fully in accordance with the wishes and decisions of the CNS [Sovereign National Conference] and the HCR/PT [High Council of the Republic/Transitional Parliament]. This stipulates that the prime minister of the new transitional government must come from the opposition and that he will be free to form his own government. In important portfolios like home and foreign affairs, defense and energy, each opposition minister will be given a deputy minister from presidential circles and vice versa. This week a full meeting of the HCR/PT is to assess the results of various committees. As soon as the new transitional constitution is approved, the high meeting must appoint a new prime minister. The government program remains that which was drawn up by the CNS in the past. It first provides for a referendum on the new constitution and free parliamentary and presidential elections within 15 months.
