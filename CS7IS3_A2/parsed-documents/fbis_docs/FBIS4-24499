FBIS4-24499 "drchi104_v_94012" FBIS-CHI-94-104 Daily Report 27 May 1994 TAIWAN U.S. Administration Considers Taiwan Policy U.S. Administration Considers Taiwan Policy OW2705140694 Taipei CNA in English 1329 GMT 27 May 94 OW2705140694 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Han Nai-kuo] [Text] Washington, May 26 (CNA) -- The Clinton administration will proceed with its review of US policy toward Taiwan in the next few weeks, White House Security Adviser Anthony Lake said Thursday [26 May] afternoon. In response to questions at a press briefing, Lake denied that the Clinton administration has put its Taiwan policy review on hold in the past several months because of the issue of most-favored-nation trade status for Mainland China. "I would prefer to say that it has been proceeding apace, rather than was on hold," he said. Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said a high-level meeting on the issue would be held soon. Asked whether the administration will consider increasing contact with Taiwan and Tibet as a tool to push for human-rights progress in the mainland, Lord noted that the United States already maintains a strong unofficial relationship with Taiwan, and has done so through several administrations. "If anything, we believe it has become stronger in this administration. We will pursue that," he said. Lord said the one-China policy of the United States is very successful because it permits the United States to improve its relationship with Beijing and at the same time allows it to maintain a strong friendship with Taiwan and strengthen Taiwan's de facto security. "So, we will not play games or alter our one-China policy. We will continue to strengthen our unofficial ties with Taiwan. It's worked for many administrations. It's going to work under this administration," he said. He added that the Clinton administration also will continue contacts with the Dalai Lama. He said the administration is disappointed that Beijing has not yet agreed to enter into a dialogue with the Dalai Lama after the Tibetan spiritual leader stated openly that he was willing to hold talks without including the issue of Tibetan independence on the agenda. Lake said the Clinton administration is "very disturbed" by many of Beijing's actions in Tibet with regard to Tibetan culture, and that the issue will remain on the US agenda with the mainland.
