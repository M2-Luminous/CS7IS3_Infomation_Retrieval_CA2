JUVENTUD REBELDE expressed its views on the subject when commenting on the 3 March disclosure of a secret official U.S. report recognizing the nonexistence of solid cases of human rights violations in Cuba. The document, signed by Joseph Sullivan, chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, was prominently published by JUVENTUD REBELDE under the title, Top Secret (Muy Secreto). [title given in English followed by editorial note in Spanish]. The U.S. report, the weekly publication notes, "is irrefutable evidence not only of the lies and hoaxes invented and promoted against the Cuban revolution, but also -- even though it comes form our enemies -- of the absolute probity that has always characterized us." Although we did everything possible to work with human rights groups to obtain more solid cases, most of the interviews did not produce any conclusive cases, the official U.S. document states. For the past 35 years Cuba has reiterated that there have been no cases of murder, torture, or missing persons in our country, and no one can deny that, JUVENTUD REBELDE contends. It also protests the fact that based on fabrications of this nature and statements by small groups that have made a business out of the alleged defense of human rights in Cuba, the United States is trying to condemn Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission for violating those rights. How do the governments that support Washington's position at the United Nations feel now that U.S. officials themselves have admitted in secret reports the falsity of their arguments, the Cuban weekly asks. JUVENTUD REBELDE also stresses the fact that the document also recognizes the fraudulent nature of many actions carried out by groups that claim to defend human rights here, whose leaders "make money at the expense of a program for refugees that has no justification." During the past few months, there have been frequent reports of fraudulent requests from activists and paid testimonies by human rights leaders, the U.S. document admitted in reference to the procedures followed to request asylum in the United States.
