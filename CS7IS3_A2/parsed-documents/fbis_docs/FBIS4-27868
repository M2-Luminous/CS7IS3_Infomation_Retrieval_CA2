The Democratic Party, however, held an emergency meeting of its policy-making supreme council Saturday morning and adopted a resolution urging the government to work for peaceful resolution of the nuclear row through dialogue. "Whatever happens on the peninsula, (we) have to prevent another war (in Korea)," the DP said in the resolution, asking the government to seek an independent method of settling the dispute through active contacts with North Korea. Earlier, First State Minister for Political Affairs So Chung-won called DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek and stressed the need to form a united political front as the nuclear deadlock has reached a critical juncture. Since there would be many stages of economic sanctions against North Korea and Seoul does not yet know Washington's exact plans, confusion might arise if there is a split in the nation's stance on the issue, So said. So promised Yi that the government will brief the opposition party on the North Korean problem when President Kim and Seoul's ambassador in charge of nuclear affairs, Kim Sang-hun, return home. So assured Yi that the government will try to reflect the opposition party's position when it works out concrete measures on North Korea. The DP resolution also called on the United States and the United Nations to refrain from any provocative action and to help resolve the row through dialogue. In addition, the Democratic Party asked North Korea to stop refueling at the 5-megawatt reactor immediately, and to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct special inspections of two unreported nuclear facilities. The opposition party also demanded that Pyongyang guarantee the transparency of its nuclear program and scrap its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.
