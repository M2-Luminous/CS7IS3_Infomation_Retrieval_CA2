A report by the SUDAN NEWS AGENCY from Nairobi said the Sudanese Embassy there issued a statement in which it held the rebel movement was responsible for the failure of the talks that were concluded in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, yesterday, and in which a government delegation, led by Dr. Ibrahim Abu Awf, minister of state at the ministry of social planning, and the special envoy of the UN secretary general for humanitarian affairs in Khartoum took part. The statement pointed out that the relief talks failed because of the insistence of the rebel movement -- Garang's group -- on not opening the (Nadus)-Kapoeta-Torit road which feeds Kapoeta and Torit areas via the border area of (Nadus) from the Kenyan Lokichoggio where there are operation lifeline relief depots. The statement added that the Government of Sudan agreed to open a road from Uganda to feed all the west Equatoria area. It agreed to open a road from border (Nadus) area to feed areas of rebels also up to (Shabdum) and Jabal (Boma).
