FBIS4-53877 "dreas100_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 Thailand Official Says Japan Committed to Rice Imports Official Says Japan Committed to Rice Imports BK2405102394 Bangkok Voice of Free Asia in Thai 1030 GMT 23 May 94 BK2405102394 Bangkok Voice of Free Asia Thai BFN [Text] There was a report in the Japanese press that Japan imported a total of 50,000 tons of rice from Australia in 1993 and is expected to import more than 200,000 tons in 1994. This prompted speculation that Japan might review its rice importing policy and probably would import only the short and medium grains from the United States and Australia under the new regulations of GATT. It is also anticipated that Japan will reduce imports of long-grain rice from Thailand in keeping with the GATT regulations. Concerning the said report, the Thai commercial counsellor in Tokyo checked with Japanese rice traders and trading associations. From their explanations, it was learned that the report was unfounded. Japanese officials explained that the Japanese Government had completed negotiations for rice purchases in April and is committed to importing 760,000 tons of rice from Thailand. They confirmed that there would be no change in this policy. Japanese officials explained that, under the new GATT regulation, which will take effect in 1995, fixing minimum access at 4 to 8 percent of local rice concumption, there was a fear that the volume of rice imports would be smaller than at present. Anyway, there has been no announcement about the reduction of the amount of imports from any particular country. Currently, Thai rice exported to Japan is used as food, for production of sweets, and in food processing factories. It is even believed that there would be a greater demand for Thai rice in Japan because Thai rice is cheaper than rice imported from other countries.
