[Ben-Eli'ezer] It was a very grave incident. I sharply denounce the attack. It came not only at the wrong time, but it could lead to the situation getting out of control unless the following conditions are observed: All the security forces, especially the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], must show maximum determination and control on the ground. There is no room for mercy to anybody. In this situation, there are two possibilities: Either we immediately clamp down on everybody or there is havoc. At the same time, the IDF, the security forces, and the political echelon, must and can bring about steps to calm down tempers. I reiterate my long-term conclusion that when extremists on both sides -- and this time religious extremists -- live together, such a situation is inevitable. [Engel] This incident is not linked to the IDF's action in the field. We understood from Qiryat Arba' local council head Beni Qatzover that the assailant was mentally unstable, at least lately, yet he had weapons and plenty of ammunition which he could use whenever he felt like it. How can the security forces or the political establishment cope with such a situation? [Ben-Eli'ezer] I heard Qatzover saying that the man was mentally unstable. It is a shame that we found out about that after he murdered others and committed suicide. I think that political and municipal officials have to cooperate with the authorities, despite all the difficulties involved, to prevent crazies from carrying weapons. There are extremists in the territories belonging to very extreme movements who are no less dangerous than that crazy man. [Engel] How will this grave incident influence the negotiations with the Palestinians? [Ben-Eli'ezer] It will definitely not contribute to the talks. [Engel] Was Israel in touch with the Palestinians this morning? [Ben-Eli'ezer] I have not had any contacts. It is possible that others have. I think contacts are vital and coordination between the two leaderships is critical. I would welcome such moves. We must remember that we are in the midst of the Ramadan fast, which will bring the entire Islamic world up in arms. How can we go and tell them that a crazy man was responsible? We must not ease up our control on the territories and our efforts to return calm through talks and actions. [Engel] We understand that the prime minister plans to convene the Inner Cabinet. [Ben-Eli'ezer] I think that is the right thing to do. [Engel] Can you tell us what you think it will decide? [Ben-Eli'ezer] No, I cannot. I am no prophet. I can only say one thing: We do not have any interest in bringing about an escalation of the situation. Our only interest is to restore calm. We are not going to war against either side. In my view, it is a grave escalation of the situation because if whoever did it is crazy. It is something you have no control over unless as I said, people cooperate. I believe that any decision made will be aimed at controlling the situation and restoring calm.
