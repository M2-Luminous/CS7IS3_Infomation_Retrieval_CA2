The letter, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, said: "In the name of freedom of democracy I writing to you to ask about the fate of the Libyan citizen Mansur al-Kikhya, my husband and the father of my children and a respectable man who was abducted from Egyptian territory. I understand from your recent speech that you are seeking to find him because he is a human rights case." She went on: "Three months have elapsed and we do not know who committed this ugly crime. Maybe cowardly elements did, and I am certain that your hands will reach them and that you will punish these cowardly people." She also pointed out that Libya "does not wish to lose a free and noble man who believes in nothing except right, peace, and dialogue..., and I am certain that you will find him and return him free to his children and home.... You will find him anywhere, inside or outside Libya...it does not matter...what matters is for him to come back to his children, who have not stopped crying." [passage omitted]
