The delegation will apparently include Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko; Vadim Gustov, chairman of the Federation Council's committee for CIS affairs; Yevgeniy Pavlov, his deputy; and Viktor Stepanov, Federation Council member and chairman of the Karelian Supreme Soviet. Vadim Gustov recalled that the meeting of CIS parliamentary heads at St. Petersburg on 8-9 February will focus on the election of an Interparliamentary Assembly chairman "to replace the departed Ruslan Khasbulatov." According to Gustov, reports that Vladimir Shumeyko has recently offered the post of "CIS speaker" to the "fired" Stanislav Shushkevich "do not square with reality, because this post can only be held by an acting head of parliament." He said that "talk about Shushkevich took place before all the recent events." The chairman of the Federation Council's committee for CIS affairs listed legislative enactments that would be worked out under "Russia's sponsorship." Some of them are based on the CIS "Treaty on Collective Security" (many provisions of which Stanislav Shushkevich opposed as speaker of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet); they include enactments on the procedure for imposing martial law on CIS territory, "On Mobilization," "On the Procedure for the Development, Production, Testing, and Delivery of Armaments and Military Hardware," and so forth. The IPA plenary session scheduled for the beginning of March will set up a number of commissions which, the CIS committee chairman assured, "Russia will join, bringing all its ideas along, because in the light of its experience it has always been and will be the main source and drafter of legislation within the CIS."
