I believe this is a necessary side effect. Yet, this does not mean we ought to let it be so, nor lie to ourselves and see the world through rose colored glasses when the street reality is not so. The truth is that the possession of dollars in the midst of a widespread shortage crisis, such as the current one, opens the door to consumption options, that until now have been rare for the common citizen. And on occasion, this blinds the senses to the point that people put aside important values in order to attain hard currency. It is a reality, at least that is my opinion. I based this on, among other things, the noticeable increase in prostitution and the transfer of qualified labor force to sectors where attaining hard currency is easier. It does not matter if it means going from being a professional to being a gardener or a chauffeur. Some of these people have told me that the bottom line is that right now a college degree does not get them what four or five dollars -- attained in a job with a much lower level of qualification -- do. In diverse ways, this phenomenon continues to spread and corrupt. We must not forget, even for a moment, that there are people who assume certain attitudes forced by the need to, for example, buy a bar of soap or some milk to solve domestic needs. That the person who regularly sells export rum, such as the one that shocked me at the entrance of a shopping store, dressed in the latest fashion, is not the same as the housewife who, nearby, was selling a bottle of a lower quality liquor in order to buy -- she told me -- some cooking oil. Although their motives are different, both converge on efforts to attain hard currency which as the people say: Opens the door and eases today's difficult conditions. I believe that this is a necessary side effect. Yet, I believe it is important that this phenomenon be seen in social terms and we should work as fast as possible to find alternatives more closely attuned to our goals to allow people to make a living according to their efforts and contributions, and not on the basis of other harmful criteria. I believe we are going through a difficult and risky period. Undoubtedly, overcoming today's slump will leave negative scars on many people as a result, precisely, of the unavoidable steps we have had to take. Among these, the dollarization is one of the most worrisome. Once this bitter economic gulp is over, we will have to charge against the harmful habits and attitudes which this hour is spreading and which has resulted in certain people rendering ludicrous worship to fetishes and mechanisms incompatible with our overall goals.
