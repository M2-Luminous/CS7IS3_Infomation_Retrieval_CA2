FBIS3-47030 "dreas006__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-006-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Mondale Reportedly Influenced Economic Report OW1001012394 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1001012394 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale made an unusual request to Isamu Miyazaki, president of the Daiwa General Research Institute, who was in charge of compiling a report while serving as acting chairman of the Economic Reform Research Council (a private advisory body for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa) when the council drafted the report in December last year that the report specifically indicate Japan's plans to cut its trade surplus with the United States and Japan's efforts to expand domestic demand. This was disclosed on 8 January. A member of the report draft committee said: "Bureaucrats and the United States were a major `barrier' to us when we compiled the report." He is implicitly admitting that the request from the U.S. ambassador was a "pressure" and it affected the report's contents. The council, which was created by Prime Minister Hosokawa with the mandate to study ways to reform Japan's economic structure, submitted the report to the prime minister on 16 December. It is still unclear when Ambassador Mondale and Mr. Miyazaki met. According to an official familiar with the council, however, the U.S. Embassy asked for a "meeting between Ambassador Mondale and Mr. Miyazaki to discuss the report" when the council was about to compile it. According to the same official, they met at the president's office in the Daiwa General Research Institute located in Koto Ward, Tokyo. During the meeting, the U.S. ambassador is said to have asked Mr. Miyazaki to incorporate in the report numerical targets for cutting Japan's trade surplus with the United States. As for the numerical targets, many council members from industries argued strongly that "the report should incorporate numerical targets for Japan in order to avoid pressure from European nations and the United States to further appreciate the yen. The council, however, decided not to incorporate the numerical targets in the report in the face of a fierce backlash from the Finance Ministry that spoke out against setting any macroeconomics targets." Nonetheless, the report calls for "Japan's aggressive efforts to cut its current account surplus fully and significantly in the midterm" and for an increase in the basic plan for public investment under which a total of 430 trillion yen will be invested by the year 2000. As a result, the council compiled the report taking into account the U.S. ambassador's request. Mr. Mondale succeeded Mr. Armacost as U.S. ambassador to Tokyo in September last year and he is former vice president and a big cheese in the United States. During the Japan-U.S. summit talks held in New York in late September last year, President Clinton told Prime Minister Hosokawa, "Ambassador Mondale is my partner who converses by telephone with me most frequently." The U.S. ambassador is believed to have made the request after conferring with the President.
