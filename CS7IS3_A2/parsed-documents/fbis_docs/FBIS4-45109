There are many reasons for this. The biggest reason is that cotton crops during the last two years were badly damaged by special kinds of pests. Since the whole textile industry depends on good and plentiful harvests, the textile industry and other related industries are facing a crisis now. In addition to cotton, the wheat production this year was not as good as expected. Therefore, wheat had to be imported from the United States. The continuous drought during the last three years has effected agricultural production as well as electricity generation because of shortage of water. Our agricultural and industrial production is also reduced because of load shedding. Thus, Pakistan's economic graph is not more than 3.5 percent. V.A. Jaffery, prime minister's economic expert, claims that our GDP is about 4 percent. Anyhow, keeping away from these figures for a while, we have to admit that all in all our economy is not satisfactory and production in two main departments--agriculture and industry--is declining gradually. Thus, Pakistan's budget is being prepared keeping this information in mind. This budget is being prepared accepting all the conditions laid down by the IMF. As I wrote in my column recently, this budget will let the genie of inflation out of the bottle and will drown every thing with it. The present government accepted the IMF conditions and first decided to levy the general sales tax (also known as weight and value aided tax). The general sales tax will be levied on every thing manufactured in this country. When manufactured goods are taxed, the investors will pass this burden to the consumers. This way the common people who are already screaming under the weight of high prices will also have to bear the burden of general sales tax. It is said that the government is planning to increase all government salaries by 35 percent. The government will have to bear an additional 12 billion rupees expense this way. How will the government meet his additional expense? I think it important to mention here that when a general sales tax was introduced in Europe, consumers had strongly demonstrated against it. The government had to use force to control that. Such demonstrations are expected to take place in Pakistan also. However, we have to see how our government controls these demonstrations. The bosses of the IMF want to push Pakistan and other third world countries into the trap of unreasonable taxes so that these countries are unable to make economic progress because of social upheavals. This is a major joke against Pakistan and other third world countries. The IMF is demanding reduction of duty on imports to help the developed nations benefit and keep their factories running. At the same time, it is getting taxes imposed on the people to block all ways for them to live proudly. In the context of Pakistan's economic development, it is important to mention that the leaders here have no sympathy for the poor. Although these leaders come to power by crying about the problems faced by the poor people, once they gain power they do not even listen to the complaints of these poor people. Also, the landlords and investors control power in Pakistan. This groups believes that it should rule by keeping people hungry and naked. Thus, they do not let the government take any step that might benefit the poor. Instead, the poor are told to be prepared to face tougher times. It is surprising that only the poor are expected to face unfortunate and unfavorable conditions. Some of them do not even get a shroud when they die. It would not be out of place or unnecessary to mention the Soviet Union in the context of the present economic situation. Its merciless bureaucracy and unscientific economic policies played an important role in the fall of the Soviet Union. The people were silent against the flawed policies and the propaganda. No major movement was launched against the government there. The result of the "silence" of the people was the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The economic problems that the people are facing there is known only to them. A similar economic and political situation exists in Pakistan. We are obeying "orders" from such economic agencies that are not ours and are forcing us to take steps in the name of a market economy that we might lose everything. Why do we want to make progress with aid? Cannot these landlords reduce their luxuries and improve the economy of our country? We have India's example also. It owes more money than us, but still refused to accept the IMF and World Bank conditions. India's Finance Minister Manmohan Singh gave such a reply to these organizations that they were silenced. The problem in Pakistan is that the people in power lack feelings for their country. The middle class is not involved in our politics. This results in almost no national unity. Meanwhile the bureaucracy and the government are making decisions and sending the message to the people to be prepared for the coming hard times. The former government had started tax on agricultural products to include as many people as people in the tax base. However, the state governments have not taken any step in this area. One World Bank representative told me that the state governments have no plans to levy agricultural tax. The question arises: How will the government create additional resources? Perhaps, the government itself does not have the answer to this question. Those economic experts who are working for a specific lobby here do not have any answer to it, either!
