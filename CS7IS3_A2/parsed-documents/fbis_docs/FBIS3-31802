Karoly Levai reports. [Levai] It is not true that the stance of the Hungarian Government has become more radical regarding the issue of the Hungarian minorities beyond the border, Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said. He added that they had always laid equal emphasis on the establishment of good neighborly relations and the assertion of rights of the Hungarian minorities living in the neighboring countries. Neither of these two issues should be given preference, said the foreign minister. According to him, there are not any problems in those countries where the Hungarian minority is not significant or where minority rights are granted. It is true, however, that there are countries where the situation of the Hungarian minority is changing unfavorably. Thus, for example, our reservations concerning Slovakia's admission to the Council of Europe unfortunately seem to be vindicated, the foreign minister said, adding that the situation of the Hungarian minority there depended on the Slovak domestic policy. Geza Jeszenszky, however, did not wish to express his opinion on it. He said: the ideal solution would be if minority rights were regulated legally in every country, just like us. Until then, the handling of these issues in a way which satisfies both sides, should be helped by the establishment of mixed committees.
