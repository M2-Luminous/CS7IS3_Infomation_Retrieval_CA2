Only sporadic fire exchanges took place. Saturday night Azeri population centers in Terter, Geranboi and Agdam Regions in the north of Karabakh came under fire from the direction of Armenian positions. According to the source, in the south-western areas of Azerbaijan Armenian units are engaged in burning houses and other building, and in destroying material and cultural values. As Azerbaijan's President, Geydar Aliyev, told a delegation from Russia's State Duma, evidently the Armenian side is bent on destroying all material values in the localities it seized, realizing that soon it will have to leave the invaded areas.
