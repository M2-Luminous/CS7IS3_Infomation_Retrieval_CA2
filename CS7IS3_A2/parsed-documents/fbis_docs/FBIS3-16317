Mr. Krzhanitskiy, Ukraine's ambassador to Russia, will represent Ukraine, which is participating in the conference as an observer. As Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported, our state is not taking part in creating, and will not join the system of collective security. Ukraine's position is caused by its legislation: It does not join military and political unions, blocs, or groupings. It was stressed during the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' briefing that the creation of a system of security parallel to NATO is dangerous and inexpedient. Ukraine is in favor of global collective security on the territory of Europe.
