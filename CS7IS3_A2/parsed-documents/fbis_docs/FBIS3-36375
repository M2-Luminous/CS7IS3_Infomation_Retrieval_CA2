Stolypin is responsible for an idea which reflects the essence of the problem of Russia's foreign policy today surprisingly accurately: "If the state has healthy and strong roots, then believe me, the words of the Russian Government will sound completely different to Europe and the whole world." Our diplomacy needs a strong home front now as never before. A major step has been taken toward this -- the adoption of the Constitution. The election of the parliament may also create preconditions for strengthening Russian statehood, and consequently for putting foreign policy opportunities and the work of the past two years into practice, and for completing the arsenal of the Russian state's diplomacy. Continuation of Partnership or "Imperial" Impasse? The main result of the implementation of the president's foreign policy is the fact that at a turning point in its history, in the face of the collapse of the communist system and the disintegration of the USSR, Russia has not found itself in the position of a social outcast on the international arena, as was the case in 1917. The fact that we managed to avoid the worst -- a repetition of the Yugoslav tragedy on the territory of a nuclear superpower -- happened because we did not take the "imperial" path, we did not start trying to restore a union state by force or redraw the borders. We also rejected appeals of the opposite sort -- to distance ourselves from the problems of the former Union altogether and withdraw into isolation. A difficult path, but ultimately the only sensible one, was chosen -- to consistently develop the post-Soviet area by developing the CIS. Today, despite all the difficulties of the formation of the Commonwealth, it is proving possible to move gradually toward closer cooperation in politics and resolve old and new problems in a civilized way within its framework. Are there ways of more effectively protecting our interests in nearby foreign parts? In any case, our diplomacy is constantly seeking them out. But only within the framework of a principled choice in favor of advancing national interests via partnership rather than confrontation, and via direct observance of international law. To betray this choice for the sake of attempts to realize the myth of "reviving the empire" by force, not to mention delirious ideas about a "dash toward the warm seas," would mean once again setting yourself in confrontation with the whole world, and returning to the "besieged fortress" policy. This would mean transforming foreign policy from an important source of help in implementing reforms into a superfluous load aggravating the country's already serious internal problems, and indeed capable of sinking the country altogether. Clearly, such adventurism would immediately and acutely complicate the situation of Russians in the former Union republics, and a new wave of refugees would inundate Russia. Maybe that is what supporters of the "imperial" policy need in order to obtain a pretext for "restoring order" in Russia itself? Meanwhile, the interests of our compatriots in the former republics can only be ensured if internationally recognized standards in the sphere of human rights and the rights of ethnic minorities are observed throughout the area of the former USSR. With this aim in mind we have already concluded dozens of bilateral and multilateral agreements with our CIS partners. It was on our initiative that the Declaration on International Commitments in the Sphere of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms was adopted in the CIS, and the Commission for Human Rights set up. We take a tough line on any violations of the lawful interests of our fellow countrymen, and we invite international organizations and partners in other foreign countries to participate in the work of defending them. However, it must be admitted that at the political level our understanding of the acuteness of the problems of the Russian-speaking population is being transformed too slowly and with too much difficulty into the creation of effective mechanisms for solving them. Which direction we will move in -- toward fascism or, conversely, toward stability and democracy in our society -- will depend largely on how responsible and farsighted our parliamentarians are with regard to the problem of the Russian-speaking population. We have to start with ourselves. And obviously not with irresponsible statements insulting the honor of entire nations and provoking discrimination against the Russian-speaking minority, but with setting an example of a consistent battle against chauvinism and ethnic hatred. For example, the Federal Assembly could express itself in one form or another in support of the Declaration on Aggressive Nationalism, Racism, Chauvinism, Xenophobia, and Anti-Semitism, adopted on Russia's initiative by the foreign ministers of CSCE member states in December of last year. This would be a good signal both internally and externally. For the first time in Russia's history it has neither immediate nor even potential military adversaries. This creates the preconditions for a significant reduction in the burden of defense expenditure, which is particularly important at the initial, most complex phase of economic reforms. However, threats of a new type have appeared which demand the strengthening of democratic statehood, the creation of economic, effective, and mobile armed forces. I refer to local conflicts, particularly in the CIS, the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and international terrorism. We are already resolving many tasks concerning the prevention and settlement of armed conflicts near our borders with the help of the United Nations and the CSCE. We are seeking the expansion of aid to the Russian peacekeeping effort on the part of the world community on the basis of the reality of Russia's special interests and responsibility. Neither we nor our partners in the CIS can accept the "residual principle" which the United Nations still espouses in allocating the organization's resources for peacekeeping aims in the Commonwealth. But these efforts of ours can be effective only if they given society's firm support. Extremist appeals to either abandon everything and pull out of the conflict zones in the CIS, or else "establish order" by force do damage to both Russia's actual peacekeeping mission and also to the world community's perception of our aims in the nearby foreign countries. Russia is reaching the level of mature partnership with the leading democratic states of the world. This is directly enshrined in very important documents concluded with the FRG, France, Britain, the United States, Sweden, Denmark, and a number of other states. Thanks to partnership relations with the West, we have entered key world economic organizations. Although the rate of cooperation falls short of what we would desire, we have nevertheless recently received soft loans to the tune of $2.5 billion from the IMF alone, and preferential credits to the tune of $0.6 billion from the World Bank. It is time to proceed further without artificial delays. Russian foreign policy has saved the country from falling into the abyss of international financial bankruptcy, on the brink of which the former Soviet Union stood. We have received a 10-year deferment from the Paris Club on payments due for 1992-1993 on the former USSR's foreign debt totaling $15 billion. The London Club has granted us a five-year deferment on the sum of $3 billion. It is specifically the new nature of relations with the West that permits us to defend Russia's lawful interests in the sphere of security, the economy, trade, and so on, increasingly actively. Amid political tension, this would be even more difficult. We are striving for Russia's political interests to be taken into account as well. A typical example is the recent adoption by NATO countries of the "Partnership for Peace" concept instead of the immediate extension of NATO membership to the borders of the CIS. Cooperation between Russia and the United States helped to achieve the trilateral agreement on the full elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The mechanism of new ties with the West is still far from being perfect. So far no "consultation reflex" has yet been developed, which would ensure timely consideration of mutual interests in an uninterrupted fashion. In a number of situations -- Tajikistan, Georgia, and Yugoslavia -- we have had to exert a lot of effort to ensure Russia's position and the understanding and assistance of the United Nations and the CSCE. We are proposing to the "Big Seven" and other leading powers that a strategy of mature partnership of a long-term nature be coordinated. It is equally ridiculous to set the rapprochement with the West against the development of Russia's relations with Eastern states, and with the development of its relations with CIS countries. On the contrary, a serious positive potential in mutual relations with the great Asian powers -- China, India, and Japan -- is being created. Diplomacy has "discovered" new partners for Russian business, including in the sphere of military-technical cooperation -- South Korea, ASEAN, and the states of the Persian Gulf. Obviously Russia's attractiveness both for the West and for the East depends in many respects on the stability and predictability of our internal situation. No one will invest in a country where there is great uncertainty. The sooner we adopt laws which meet the needs of the market economy, the faster will be the rate and volume of the trade and economic cooperation with foreign countries that is so vital to us today. Diplomacy Needs Support From the Legislators In foreign policy matters, the stance that the Federal Assembly occupies will to a great extent determine the face that Russia shows to the world -- the face of the unpredictable "sick man" of Europe and Asia, or that of a great Eurasian power and a responsible and reliable partner. The Foreign Ministry sees the Federal Assembly as a state institution capable of ensuring, within the limits of its competence, a reliable legal base for our foreign policy, and assisting the government in implementing laws affecting Russia's interests and in complying with international treaties. We are also hoping for constructive dialogue on the best paths our activities should take. The Supreme Soviet also had the chance to become a serious state institution, but, unfortunately, it was not taken up. The Foreign Ministry unfailingly strove for cooperation. During the initial phase of the Supreme Soviet's work, this was to some paid off. However, as its confrontation with the executive grew, the discussion of foreign policy questions increasingly turned into a settling of ideological scores. Unfortunately, even today, side by side with the pseudopatriotic extremism, it not been possible to eliminate the lingering bombast, personal arrogance, and unprincipled compromises which are being passed off as centrism. Both as a State Duma deputy and as a minister I will not make concessions to those who want to push Russian diplomacy onto the track of imperial "anti-Western" or aggressively nationalist policy which would inevitably lead the country to a catastrophe. At the same time, I am prepared to cooperate with any critics or political trends in the interests of patriotic, open, and professional foreign policy. What could constitute a responsible foreign policy agenda for the new parliament? First of all, the ratification of around 60 treaties that the Supreme Soviet did not examine. These include major ones such as the START II Treaty, and agreements on legal aid and military and economic cooperation with CIS countries. Second, the adoption of laws providing for the efficient work of Russia's foreign policy mechanism. This means a law on the Russian Federation's international treaties, a law on the diplomatic service, and the Consular Regulations. We are also counting on constructive consultations during the preparation of the president's decisions on appointing Russian ambassadors and representatives at international organizations (in accordance with Article 83 of the Russian Federation Constitution). Third, the adoption of laws providing backup for Russia's foreign economic ties, such as a law on the continental shelf and the economic zone, and a law on the export of weapons and military hardware. Fourth, the elaboration of new laws or the amendment of existing ones in the humanitarian sphere. The section on dual citizenship in the Law on Citizenship must be brought into line with the new Constitution. The creation of a statewide program of support for the Russian-speaking population in CIS countries is particularly urgent. Our compatriots' rights will only be reliably ensured when their economic future is guaranteed and the conditions for maintaining their native language and culture are created. The scale of this problem means that the efforts of the Foreign Ministry or the immigration service alone are insufficient. A special department is needed which would shoulder the entire set of questions concerning the protection of the rights and interests of our compatriots in nearby and more distant foreign countries. Fifth, the creation of legislation ensuring Russia's participation in peacekeeping activity, including at UN, CSCE, and CIS level. It is time to define the legal basis for the presence of Russia's troops abroad, on a treaty basis, of course, and in line with the principle of [military] bases. Sixth, the parliament could, in accordance with the Constitution, support the desire of the Russian regions to make use of the advantages of cooperation with other states. Institutions for regional cooperation in the Black Sea, Baltic, and Barents-Euro-Arctic regions have been created with Russia's active participation. It is high time for there to be analogous structures in the Far East for ties with the PRC and Japan. At the same time, legal frameworks for regional foreign activity are needed, as well as a clear-cut division of prerogatives and functions with federal organs in the interests of the state's unity. After all, the more powerful Russia is as an international partner, the more profitable it will be for its regions to conduct business abroad too. Seventh, parliamentary ties. Regular day-to-day, rather than ostentatious, work with the parliamentarians, particularly with our neighbors, can supplement the foreign policy work of the president and the government, first and foremost in protecting the rights of millions of our compatriots in former Soviet republics. The status of foreigners in Russia should also be brought into line with international standards, by adopting a relevant law for this purpose. Today we are investing the prestige of the president's foreign policy in the present and future of Russia as a great power. The entire gamut of the new opportunities for cooperation which have been accumulated at political level must be placed at the service of resolving our internal problems, primarily economic ones. This is a statewide task. National interests, rather than narrow party interests, should serve as the guideline here. In resolving this task, parliamentarians will have a reliable ally in diplomacy.
