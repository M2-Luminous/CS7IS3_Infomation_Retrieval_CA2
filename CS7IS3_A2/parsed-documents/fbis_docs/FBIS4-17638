The hearings were initiated by the International Committees of the Russian parliament's two chambers. According to the deputy foreign minister, Aleksandr Panov, Russian-Chinese relations are a priority area of the Russian foreign policy. The diplomat also noted in his speech that the Russian Foreign Ministry conducts a course for strengthening bilateral ties with China and sees its main task "in bringing Russian-Chinese relations to a level of constructive partnership". Panov noted that this line pursued by the Russian Foreign Office finds support from the Chinese side. The deputy minister dwelt at length on problems in Russian- Chinese relations. He stressed that the situation in connection with the massive immigration of Chinese into Russia needs close attention. It is aggravated by the fact that there is no law on the status of foreign citizens in Russia for the time being. In this connection the sides concluded an agreement which drastically cut the number of people having the right to a visa-free entry to Russia. Apart from this, Panov continued, the problem of the border between the two countries remains acute. The diplomat underlined that the problem was "the main irritant in our relations until recently". However, a joint Russian-Chinese demarcation commission is now actively working. It successfully resolves questions on ownership of disputed islands on border rivers. The diplomat also said that talks are in progress on cutting the strength of Russian and Chinese troops in border areas. In the opinion of the deputy minister, it is necessary to develop infrastructure of the Russian-Chinese border in future, which will help promote trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. Panov added that the turnover of border trade between Russia and China totalled 2.5 billion U.S. dollars last year. He expressed opinion that it would be very profitable for Russia to lend a helping hand in modernisation of Chinese industrial enterprises built with Soviet assistance in the 1950s.
