[Yevtukhov] The overall picture in our country is as follows. Last year we observed a precipitous growth of entrepreneurial structures; it amounted to a factor of 2.6 as compared with the preceding year. This includes the following growth factors: in industry--2.3, construction--1.9, trade, public dining and food services, as well as wholesale and middleman-type operations, or--to put in more succinctly--in the trade group--4.9, and in the finance-credit and insurance sphere--4.6. As a rule, these are medium- and small-sized enterprises; despite such a precipitous growth, the number of employees in them increased by a factor of only 1.4. This year there has been a decline in the growth rate of small enterprises. There are several reasons for this. One of them is the fact that many private entrepreneurs overestimated their own powers and possibilities. At first everything proceeded quite easily: They registered their own businesses, obtained licenses, current enterprise accounts, seals or stamps, and other requisites--all without any red tape. But then, in the words of the old proverb: "It was smooth going on paper, but they forgot about the ravines." Because, of course, even the most capable and bold-spirited businessmen bear upon themselves the brand of that leveling-mandatory distribution system which all of us have been striving--with very great difficulty--to break away from. I do not mean to say that such "owls" are talentless people. On the contrary, among our businessmen there are many, many imaginative and clever persons who can "spot" their Western partners a hundred points. And it's a well-known fact that when one of our fellow-countrymen was in the United States, he noticed a price differential of only half a cent per gallon on gasoline between two neighboring states; and he was able to make some good money by using this knowledge. His American colleagues could only spread their hands wide in amazement; here was a profit which had slipped right through their fingers. Most of our home-grown entrepreneurs, however, are taking just their first steps in business. They are still basically used to a kind of tutelage or guardianship: Give them this and provide for that. And take, for example, the psychological pressure from the people around them--people who have created an aura of criminality around the entrepreneurs. It must be admitted that one does occasionally encounter money-grubbing self-seekers and tricksters among them, but--taken en masse--they are persons with initiative, persons who every day take the risk of losing everything which they have earned so far. However, I have digressed from the main point. On the whole, the situation is really not too gloomy. During the present year [1993] production at the state-owned enterprises declined, whereas in the nonstate sector of the economy it has doubled. Labor productivity is growing at small enterprises, marking time at collective enterprises, and sharply declining at state-owned enterprises. In my opinion, these indicators speak for themselves: We must open up a wide expanse for private initiative. [Khalin] Do you mean, Vasylyy Ivanovych, that the decisive word lies with privatization, and that it needs to be given a helpful push, as is now being done in Russia? [Yevtukhov] Privatization is not a panacea for all our ills, but rather only one of the means for enhancing the efficiency of our fixed capital. Yes, the Ukrainian government is in favor of privatization, but not for one and all--not in any blanket sense. Take, light industry, for example; It gives a quick payback to the service sphere, and this proceeds less painfully. But in heavy industry--for example, in the metallurgical and chemical industries--we must approach this matter more carefully: Here we should begin with the subdivisions and individual units. One would not privatize a blast-furnace shop, but you could do so in the case of a transportation shop connected to it. The same thing pertains to management structures. Take the West, for example. There the steel-foundry branch is a state-run sector, whereas management is private. What I mean to say is the following: In each case it is necessary to seek out the optimum forms of combining interests. On the one hand, to develop private entrepreneurship, while--on the other hand, to demonopolize production, to make it competitive, flexible, and easily manageable. In short, I am for a selective, smooth, gradual process. To my opponents, who zealously insist on "speeding things up," on transferring Western models to our soil, I cite the following argument: If Western models were mechanically transposed to our realities, things would turn out as they did in the case of Disneyland in France. Remember how many delighted exclamations there were: The American "Land of Dreams" right near Paris! But what happened? It was almost an embarrassingly awkward situation. The public did not exactly flock to Disneyland in droves. For the skeptical, rationally minded Frenchman a "dream"--as the saying goes--is something fit for lightbulb; he has another way of life, another set of values. This example, of course, is somewhat abstract or even farfetched. I simply want to point out that privatization will work better if it conforms to our customs, habits, and--in the final analysis--to our predilections. [Khalin] How is this to be achieved in practice? What is being done by the Ukrainian government in order to develop entrepreneurship? [Yevtukhov] A long-term State Program has been approved for supporting entrepreneurship. It provides financial, legal, informational, and educational-methodological assistance primarily to those who are capable of breathing life into the priority spheres of economic activity: processing and storing agricultural products, construction and the construction industry, as well as innovations. This work is being coordinated by the Ukrainian State Committee for Assisting Small Enterprises and Entrepreneurship (Goskompredprnimatelstvo). Within this committee a National Fund for Supporting Entrepreneurship and Developing Competition has been created. It is being financed both from the budget as well as by funds from the entrepreneurs themselves. We are paying a great deal of attention to forming a normative base, along with a financial and tax policy for the nonstate sector of our economy. Draft laws on small business, licensing, commercial secrets, and a number of other matters have been submitted to the parliament for examination and consideration. The goal of this program is to give a new impulse to unleashing business initiative so that it may become a noteworthy force in the economy. As of today, 50,000 small enterprises, 10,500 cooperatives, and 15,000 private farms are producing 10-12 percent of our national product. By the year 1995 the number of entrepreneurial structures will reach 300,000, that is to say, it will more than triple. There will also be a corresponding increase in their proportionate share of the national product. [Khalin] Would you kindly tell us, Vasylyy Ivanovych, how economic ties with Russia are being built up on the level of small enterprises, and what kind of a line is being maintained here by the Ukrainian government. [Yevtukhov] We are in favor of openness and mutually profitable cooperation. It is not important where capital is invested just so long as it operates in the interests of the entrepreneur and the state. The main thing is not to interfere in how people handle money and business. By increasing his own income and wealth, a businessman also enriches his own country, provided that he pays the correct amount of taxes. Therefore, we are in favor of minimal regulations with regard to economic ties: Let the entrepreneur himself seek out profitable direct ties. Naturally, no barbed wire along our border with Russia is needed just so long as the existing customs agreements are lived up to. They allow us to fix and calculate goods turnover, tax revenues, distribute and pay back credits, and so forth. By my education and previous work experience I am a technical person. Therefore, I know the following: When a complex electronic system gets out of order (and this may be extended by analogy to the former Soviet Union), its adjustment and fine-tuning proceed unit by unit. This is also the case with regard to the bilateral ties between Ukraine and Russia. We must meet each other halfway, including in the development of entrepreneurship, set up and fine-tune mutually advantageous "units" of ties, strengthen them, and the main thing--let me repeat--is not to interfere in the unleashing of business people themselves, not to surround them with a petty kind of tutelage. A narrow-minded business attitude is not tantamount to an efficient, businesslike approach. [Khalin] One last question, Vasylyy Ivanovych. The Ukrainian press, as well as numerous forums of business circles, have been sharply critical of the government for the disintegration of the economy, the unbridled inflation, and so on. Do you have a specific program for getting us out of this crisis? [Yevtukhov] Yes, I do. And as to the criticism, can you name me even one state in the world where there are no dissatisfied people? We place great hopes on the coming year. We will have elections to the parliament, and--to my way of thinking--in our contacts with the legislative branch we will give a new impulse to the reforms and start to enter into a market economy at a more rapid pace.
