At a 50-minute joint press conference held today with Yeltsin in the press center of Russian Foreign Ministry, Clinton said the the U.S. was ready to "work on some joint projects" with Russia. One thing discussed in this Moscow summit was another aid package totalling 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to Russia and other former Soviet-bloc republics, Clinton said, adding that 70 percent of the finacial support earlier promised in the Vancouver aid package is ready for delivery. He said he was especially happy about President Yeltsin's unyielding stance to press on reforms in Russia, adding he and Yeltsin had discussed a number of ways for the U.S. and the world community to promote Russia's reforms. When asked if he will drop his "shock therapy" policy, Yeltsin gave an immediate "no," adding "the reform will continue to be implemented in a resolute way." Clinton said Washington was ready to help Moscow to lessen social hardships that appeared in the "shock therapy" reform process. This year, the U.S. Government will approve funds to shore up small private-run businesses in Russia and will accelerate the founding of a new fund for Russia's large-scale enterprises. The U.S. commerce secretary will visit Moscow with a group of top executives from major U.S. companies on a trade mission to Russia next March, he said. Clinton said he convinced Yeltsin of the "Partnership for Peace" idea in their last three rounds of talks. Looking back on his past legs of European tour, Clinton said he hope his trip could help the construction of a new European security framework on the basis of free economy, common allegiance to democracy and mutual respect for territorial integrity. Clinton said he was envisaging an highly integrated Europe, both politically, economically and from the point of security. Clinton said he will again meet with Yeltsin during the G-7 summit in Naples, Italy, next July and Yeltsin will visit Washington this fall.
