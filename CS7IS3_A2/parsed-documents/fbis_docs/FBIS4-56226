FBIS4-56226 "drlat084_f_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 El Salvador Coffee Growers Urge Army To Rid Santa Ana of Gangs Coffee Growers Urge Army To Rid Santa Ana of Gangs PA3004002094 San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 22 Apr 94 pp 2, 37 PA3004002094 San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY Spanish BFN [Text] Santa Ana coffee growers and professionals are urging the Armed Forces to conduct an operation against gangs of kidnappers and thieves that operate in that region, some of which include mercenaries. Families of the victims and farmers, who have paid large sums of money for their release, continue to receive threats and letters in which they are warned "their days are numbered." Some of those who were threatened showed EL DIARIO DE HOY a letter signed by a certain "Commander Oscar," the self-styled leader of the "New People's National Liberation Army." In the letter "Commander Oscar" announces that starting next Monday a new war will be waged against the coffee growers and landowners, who will also have to pay a war tax of 2,000 colones per month. Likewise, the criminals say they have a list of 400 persons who will be kidnapped and warn people to be prepared. The same sources report that gangs of former rebels who use military weapons -- such as M-16 and AK-47 rifles, as well as other weapons that were in vogue during the war -- operate in the region. Because of this they doubt the police can do much to stop them for two reasons: First, because the PNC [National Civilian Police] does not have adequate equipment, and second, because a large part of the police is made up of former FMLN members. They claim the gangs operate from the base of Santa Ana volcano and that some are led by foreign mercenaries, because black men and men with European traits have been spotted. A column of men was seen near Lake Coatepeque a few days ago. Former captives of these gangs say these men use olive-green camouflage uniforms and tennis shoes. Also, they communicate by radio with other gangs that operate in Cerro de Guazapa (San Salvador), Los Naranjos (Sonsonate-Santa Ana), and San Miguel volcano. They also claim the gangs have their own camps at the entrance of Santa Ana volcano, in El Milagro ranch, and in other places that are already known to the authorities. One of those threatened sent the note from the presumed "Commander Oscar" to Defense Minister General Humberto Corado. He says he received a reply that the "peace accords" have limited the role of the Armed Forces. As to the Army's patrolling of the roads, the coffee growers say these steps are not sufficient because the soldiers will not enter the coffee plantations as they have been prohibited from doing so. Among those kidnapped are Ricardo Planas, whose family paid 500,000 colones as ransom,; Mauricio Lopez Parker, 25,000; Carmen Martinez, 30,000; Guillermo Martinez H., 30,000; Lola Giammattei, 150,000; Ernesto Escobar Pacas, 125,000 colones, among others. "Santa Ana is an inferno, because gangs of thieves and kidnappers operate with complete impunity," they said in an alarmed manner. A few days ago some distinguished ladies were leaving the Santa Lucia Church, following a mass for Dona Alicia Valiente de Hernandez, mother of Dr. Rene Hernandez Valiente, and all were robbed of their belongings. Because of this, they are asking President Alfredo Cristiani to authorize the Army to conduct an operation to rid the zone of criminals because many of the farms have been abandoned by their owners and overseers. When General Corado was asked about this, he said the institution is ready to obey any order issued by the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, that is, by President Cristiani.
