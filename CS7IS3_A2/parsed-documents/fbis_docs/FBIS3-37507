U.S. President Bill Clinton is angry, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is indignant, and NATO is poised to put warplanes into the air. The real culprit has not been found but it is planned to punish the Serbs just as a warning, as it were. You can understand the world public, and Bill Clinton, and Butrus-Ghali. The death of completely innocent people is, of course, an outrage and demands retribution, but only against those who are guilty of this crime against humanity. But we Russians cannot understand why the world public was not indignant at the tragedy in Russia 3-4 October 1993 when, according to the official figures, 145 people died and hundreds were injured during the firing on the House of the Soviets (the "White House"). The people responsible for this action, which was just as inhuman and criminal as the one in Sarajevo, have not been brought to justice even though the whole world knows who they are. Furthermore, they have received not only Russia's highest awards but also the applause of statesmen who imagine themselves the guardians of democracy. One cannot help but notice the more than strange metamorphosis of the United Nations. Instead of performing a peacemaking, unifying function, it is being transformed right before our eyes into some kind of world policeman ready to punish and actually punishing not so much those who commit acts against peace and humanitarian principles but primarily those who have displeased the forces lobbying at UN headquarters. As evidence let us recall the bombing of Libya and the residential center of Baghdad and the military actions against opposition forces in Somalia undertaken under the international organization's flag by U.S. Army subunits. Decisions to carry out these and similar unlawful actions are most often made administratively without discussion by or the sanction of the Security Council. That is what the United Nations has done this time too. There is another strange element in UN activity which can hardly be left without assessment. It is the fact that countries or, to be more accurate, the political forces which dominate them and which for the sake of their own ambitions are prepared to shed the blood of other peoples and even their own fellow countrymen and are actually doing so are going unpunished. Israel systematically bombs South Lebanon -- and the United Nations does not even wag a threatening finger. Neither the world public nor the United Nations was disturbed when Turkey, a member of the United Nations and NATO, wiped the Kurdish town of Lice from the face of the earth in the space of a few hours on 22 October 1993. It is quite well known how much mental energy, how many diplomatic efforts, and how much money the United Nations expended to enable the Jews scattered throughout the world at last to acquire their own statehood. But the United Nations is totally incapable of forcing Israel to respect the Palestinians' right to their own state. Nor is this organization particularly concerned about the fate of the Kurdish people, numbering almost 40 million -- the world's first farmers -- whose culture goes back many thousands of years. The Kurds' land is divided among Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The Kurds' desire to reunite and form their own state according to the law and the provisions of the UN Charter is viewed as a manifestation of terrorism and separatism and is being suppressed most harshly with the tacit connivance of the United Nations. The impression is being created that the United Nations is moving away from its initially proclaimed principles of being an impartial world arbiter toward being the instrument of the policy of a group of countries headed by the United States. Whereas in the past the ambitious tendencies of that group and the United States were countered by the USSR and the socialist countries, now that counterbalance has been removed and scope for unlimited domination of the world has opened up before those who were used to such sway until 1945. The colonial system collapsed after the victory over fascism but it seems that neocolonialism is being reborn on a new basis under the blue flag of the United Nations and with the assistance of its army of "blue helmets."
