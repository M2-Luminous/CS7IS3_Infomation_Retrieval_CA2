Initially, the authorities approved the march from Trocadero Square (known as the Square of Human Rights) to the Romanian Embassy, a distance of about one and one-half kilometers. However, at 1700, law enforcement officers -- at least seven trucks full of policemen -- surrounded the square and halted the march on the embassy. Nevertheless, several hundred Romanians remained in Trocadero Square, holding banners demanding President Iliescu's resignation and comparing him to Ceausescu. The organizations in France wanted to organize a rally on Friday evening in front of the Romanian Embassy in Paris, where a reception was scheduled "in honor of President Iliescu's presence" in France. This rally was banned.
