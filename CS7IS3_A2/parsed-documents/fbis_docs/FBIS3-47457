In response, the Defense Agency [DA] is now examining the possibility of ending the Midterm Defense Buildup Plan (1991 to 1995) in 1994. No decision, however, has been made about how to proceed with the review in the future because a coordination of views has yet to be carried out between the DA and the prime minister on the review, and DA is at a loss over how to deal with the review. Prime Minister Hosokawa intends to inaugurate his private advisory body this spring with the mandate to study a new defense guideline to replace the current guideline and to come up with conclusions on the new defense guideline. The DA will start working on the new guideline after this summer in line with the conclusion. Because the current Midterm Defense Buildup Plan is designed to formulate the guideline, "The DA considers it natural to launch a new midterm defense buildup plan in 1995 after ending the current Midterm Defense Buildup Plan in 1994" to reflect the new guideline in the 1995 budget (says a DA source). It will be hard for the DA to get the cabinet to decide on the new guideline and the new midterm defense buildup plan during 1994 because of procedural difficulties and a heavy workload. As a last resort, the idea is surfacing that the new midterm defense buildup plan should be launched in 1996 as scheduled. Nonetheless, the prime minister has yet to give the DA clear-cut instructions, including on the way to handle the new midterm defense buildup plan, and this appears to be heightening the irritation in the DA. DA Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama told a news conference on 10 January that "(the prime minister's remarks) are his personal opinion, and his remarks cannot be considered to be his instructions."
