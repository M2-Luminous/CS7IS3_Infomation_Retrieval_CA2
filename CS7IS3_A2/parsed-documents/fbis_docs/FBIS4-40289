Regarding the Results of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council Session in Istanbul"] [Text] The session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] which was held last week in Istanbul has demonstrated both the definite desire of the NATO states and a number of East European countries, primarily Russia, to find spheres of cooperation in the new situation following the Cold War, and also the difficulties of implementing them. The present session is called upon to determine its attitude toward the Russian Federation within the NATO system, NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Ballanzino stated at its opening. This question, he said, is the most important one on the agenda of this exceptionally important forum. Russia is the only superpower in Europe and it will continue to maintain this position in the future. We attach great significance to cooperation with Russia. For his part, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev indicated certain features in Russia's understanding of the position and dynamics of the development of military-political structures in Europe. The creation of a new architecture of security in Europe cannot take place without Russia's participation, and still less, be aimed against it, the French LE FIGARO writes. The NATO countries, according to the newspaper, have determined a strategy for their actions which would meet two objectives: First of all, the establishment with Moscow of a "broad, individual, and far-reaching partnership program" based on "dialogue about common objectives in those spheres in which Russia is making a specific and important contribution." The second task, the newspaper believes, is "not to give in to pressure from the Russians," who take a dim view of "NATO's right to adopt its own decisions." Moscow will not be given the right of veto. According to the Russians' ideas, Radio Liberty said in a broadcast, NATO should be subsumed into a new collective security system under the aegis of the CSCE. This would automatically place Russia on the same level as other participants in this organization, notably the United States. Having theoretically decided for itself the question of the need to strengthen cooperation with NATO, and in particular through the "Partnership for Peace" program, Russia, which still possesses the acknowledged status of a nuclear superpower, is demonstrating its desire to play a fitting role in partnership relations with the North Atlantic alliance. Time will tell to what extent the NATO leaders will take this into account in their strategy.
