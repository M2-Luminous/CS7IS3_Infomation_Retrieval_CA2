Another thing, at a time when Yeltsin himself was in opposition, he had meetings with top officials from other countries and received them here. There were no problems then. What offended Boris Nikolayevich this time? Why did he not receive Nixon? [Kozyrev] I think the explanation here is very simple. I, for example, heard that Nixon was in Moscow when he had already arrived in Moscow. That is, the problem here lies in the organization [of the visit] and Nixon should ask people in his apparatus and, perhaps, complain to those people who invited him to Moscow -- I don't know who it was, who was dealing with his visit here -- as to why his program had been so ill thought-out. There is a certain protocol. Protocol means certain respect toward a state in question. The president was absolutely right when he did not receive Nixon, because at the basis of his program was disrespect toward Russian statehood, toward the Russian state. You know, his wanting to meet Rutskoy is roughly equivalent to someone arriving at a respectable gathering and -- forgive me for the analogy, but this matter needs to be presented quite graphically -- wanting to use the toilet. One option is to say excuse me, I will go out for a minute to make a telephone call to my close friend. Everyone will understand this and there will be no problem. Another option is to open wide the doors, to begin with this and join the guests coming out of the toilet. It is likely the guests will be offended. This is the whole problem. I think the problem does not lie in the fact that he has met the opposition representatives or people who are more like criminals rather than the opposition in this particular context. The whole problem is that he did it wrong as regards priorities, politeness, and good manners. I do not think this is his personal problem, of course. He himself, perhaps, is not even able to deal with such details. This is the problem of those, I stress this once more, who had organized his visit and, above all, his own apparatus. [Svanidze] That is, this is the problem of his apparatus, his team, and those who invited him here, isn't it? [Kozyrev] Absolutely correct. [Svanidze] As far as I know, he was invited here by no one else but Mr. Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security Council. [Kozyrev] You seem to know more than I do. [Svanindze] Andrey Vladimirovich, Boris Nikolayevich's reaction -- can it be regarded as demonstration of toughness toward the United States? [Kozyrev] No, this has nothing to do with the United States. I would like to tell you yet again that this problem was purely ethical, it was the problem of the program and the team. [Svanidze] One gets the impression, many experts and political analysts, both Russian and non-Russian wrote this, that relations between the two powers have become colder now than what they were until very recently. [Kozyrev] I am to meet Warren Christopher in Vladivostok in the very near future, and we will discuss with the secretary of state what form of partnership we should have. We should agree on this so that it does not cause annoyance and so that it does not come as a surprise, for example, when Russia comes out with its own initiative. We, on our part, feel offended sometimes -- why do they come out with their initiative when we were supposed to agree on it between ourselves first. So this should be clarified and the mechanism of interaction should be finalized. I would not dramatize it but I would not underestimate it either. If, on the other side there is simply a desire to undermine political partnership, and these are not simply problems of growing up, so to speak, problems of mutual adjustment, but if there is a political desire to give up partnership, this would be a different matter. But one should be convinced of this first. [Svanidze] What is this new, tougher, more authoritative Russian policy linked to? Can it be explained by foreign policy or internal policy? [Kozyrev] I would say neither the one nor the other. It is simply appearing in a perhaps more mature form in line with the restoration of the Russian state. But again, you know, we hear this cheap criticism that consists of saying that foreign policy is encountering certain difficulties. But here it is forgotten that ours is a new state. We only adopted a Constitution in December. Before that we were living under the Soviet Constitution. You wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry reading such a mess. So at last, then, we got a new Constitution in December. Our Russian statehood did, of course, take on a new quality -- an authoritative quality, if you like. We are now setting ourselves the full-scale task of strengthening the Russian state -- a democratic state, and foreign policy accordingly. Naturally, as the Russian state becomes more powerful -- and when we get on top of the economic reforms, we will have a powerful economy, whereas now our economy is weakened -- this will become apparent in foreign policy. Not because we want this or because we are under pressure from the opposition and so on and so forth -- nothing of the sort. The opposition only gets in the way of all of this. The opposition -- I mean the extreme opposition, so to speak -- is getting in the way of setting up a powerful statehood and consequently it weakens foreign policy. You know, we are being constantly reminded of Zhirinovskiy. We are told: You are talking tough because you are being pressurized by Zhirinovskiy. Nothing of the sort. If we had not been accused of acting to Zhirinovskiy's orders or being under pressure from Zhirinovskiy, we would have talked even tougher. [Svanidze] Do you think of yourself as a party politician? Do you think of yourself now as a member of Russia's Choice? [Kozyrev] Well, let's not... [Svanidze] Let's not what? [Kozyrev] Let's not be specific about that. I was of course a member of the Russia's Choice electoral bloc, if you will. I have not rejected Russia's Choice, its common aims and so on. But Russia's Choice is not yet a party, and a complicated process to create a party as opposed to an electoral bloc is under way, along with a difficult process of, let us say, self-determination and crystallization of political currents, and so I would not now say that I belong to any specific party.
