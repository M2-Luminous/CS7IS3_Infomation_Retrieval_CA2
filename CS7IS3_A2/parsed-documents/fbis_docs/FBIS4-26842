Full text of the speech follows: Distinguished guests, foreign envoys, ladies and gentlemen: Four decades ago the Chinese Government, along with the Indian and Burmese Governments, issued joint statements, deciding to make mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence the basic principles for guiding mutual relations, thereby proclaiming the creation of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. It is of great significance today that we hold the meeting to commemorate this major historical event, to evaluate the role played by the five principles of peaceful coexistence in the past and in the present, and to look into the future development of the world. The five principles of peaceful coexistence were a product created by the demand of the times. Following the end of World War II, newly independent and liberated nations anxiously wanted to establish a new type of international relations based on an equal footing, and they yearned for a peaceful international environment for developing their national economies. Meanwhile, a few countries in the world adopted an attitude of rejecting and opposing these newly independent national states, and even implemented a policy of aggression and war against them. These norms for international relations, which were aimed at consolidating national independence, safeguarding national sovereignty, and seeking justice and equality, reflected the common aspirations of the large number of independent national states at that time. It is precisely because of this that the five principles of peaceful coexistence received broad endorsement from the international community. The 10 principles adopted by the Bandung Conference in 1955 specifically epitomized the spirit of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. The "Declaration Concerning the Establishment by Countries of the Principles for International Law Characterized by Friendly Relations and Cooperation in Accordance with the UN Charter," adopted by the 25th UN General Assembly in 1970, and the "Declaration Concerning the Establishment of a New International Economic Order," adopted by the Sixth Special UN General Assembly in 1974, both affirmed the five principles of peaceful coexistence, which have also been cited by many international organizations and in the documents of international conferences. In fact, the five principles of peaceful coexistence have become an important component of the norms for international relations. Over the past four decades, the five principles of peaceful coexistence have withstood the tests of a changeable international situation, demonstrated a powerful vitality, and played a tremendous role in promoting world peace and international friendship and cooperation. History has born witness that the five principles of peaceful coexistence are universally applicable norms for international relations. If countries with different ideologies, social systems, and economic development levels can observe the five principles of peaceful coexistence, it is entirely possible for them to establish relations of mutual trust and friendly cooperation; if the five principles of peaceful coexistence are violated, confrontation and armed conflicts may take place even between countries with identical ideologies and social systems. Therefore, it is an irrefutable truth that the five principles of peaceful coexistence are the cornerstone for establishing and developing relations between countries. As one of the initiating countries of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, China has always adhered to and practised those principles. Guided by the five principles of peaceful coexistence, China has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries; engaged in economic, trading, scientific, technological, cultural exchanges and cooperation with more than 200 countries and regions; established good-neighborly and friendly relations with all neighboring countries; and settled border issues left by history with a great majority of neighboring countries. In international affairs, China abides by the five principles of peaceful coexistence, stands for fairness, does not seek selfish gain, and makes proper contributions to the peaceful solution of international disputes, promoting international cooperation, and maintaining regional and world peace. China has contributed its share of efforts to help maintain the independence and sovereignty of Afghanistan and has also played a constructive role to bring about a political solution to the Cambodian issue. China has always supported the Korean people in a peaceful settlement of reunification problem through dialogue. China always stands for a fair and rational solution to the Middle East issue, restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and calls on the Arab and Jewish people to live in harmony. During the Gulf crisis, China supported the restoration of Kuwait's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Since the outbreak of the conflict in Bosnia Herzegovina, China has repeatedly called on the parties concerned to cease conflict and hostile actions and to seek a political solution to the conflict through peace talks. At the United Nations and other international organizations, and at a number of important international conferences, China has adhered to a just position and played a major role in bringing about the solution of major international issues. The world has undergone major changes over the past 40 years. The bipolar world structure has ceased to exist. The world is rapidly moving toward a multi-polar structure. International relations are now undergoing far-reaching changes. Seen from an overall perspective, the international situation is relaxing. Over the long term, the outbreak of a new world war may be avoided. However, the end of the Cold War does not mean that the world is in great peace. Ethnic contradictions have intensified in some countries and regions, resulting in frequent armed conflicts, in unending wars, in turning hundreds and thousands of people into refugees, and in a great loss of life and property. Some developing countries have sunk deeper into poverty. The North-South contradictions have become more acute. Hegemonism and power politics still thrive in the world. Cases of interference in other countries' internal affairs have been frequently reported. Peace and development that are much sought after by the people of the world are far from being realized. How, then, to build a new world with stability, security, and prosperity? For many years, the international community, including the United Nations and regional organizations, have indeed done a lot and achieved certain results in maintaining world peace and promoting common development. However, people have more and more come to realize that only by establishing a set of basic principles for international relations and for international political and economic life which everyone sticks to can we expect to generally and effectively guide and standardize the international community's activities. We believe that the five principles of peaceful coexistence embody the most fundamental rules for international relations. They are in line with the purpose and principles set down in the United Nations Charter. They reflect the essence of international relations. They can serve countries of different social systems, countries with different levels of economic development, and neighboring countries. Therefore, we stand for the establishment of a new order in international politics and economics based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and by adapting to the changing international situation. Mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs is the core of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and of the new international order. The world is diversified and colorful. Not only the social systems, values, and ideologies differ between countries, but also large differences exist between their historical traditions, religious beliefs, and cultural backgrounds. Only by recognizing these differences and showing respect to each other can we broaden the scope of cooperation, promote exchange, and get along amicably. It is necessary for all countries to learn from each other and to make use of each other's experience; however, this is possible only if it is based on each country's independence. Imposing one's values and social models on other countries inevitably encourages tension and confrontation between countries. Each country's affairs should be taken care of by its own people. The people of each country absolutely have the right to choose a social system and development path suitable for their national conditions, and other countries should not interfere in the country's affairs under any pretext in any way. We hold that all countries, big or small, poor or rich, strong or weak, are equal members of the international community, and, while seeking their own development, can make due contributions to world peace and development. Having some differences between countries is inevitable. China has always advocated promoting mutual understanding and reducing differences through conducting dialogue, and has opposed exerting pressure on other countries and interfering in other countries' internal affairs. On the human rights issue, all countries should conduct dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect to seek common ground while reserving differences, so as to make contributions to protecting human rights and to improving the world's human rights conditions. Imposing one kind of standard of human rights on others and interfering in other countries' internal affairs under certain pretexts and ignoring other countries' national conditions and law, as a matter of course, will be opposed by a large number of developing countries, including China. Mutual respect of each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, and peaceful coexistence among all countries -- these are the basis of the five principles and the new international order. It is unacceptable to use any pretext to infringe on other countries' sovereignty, to deprive them of their sovereignty, or to encroach on or devour other countries' territory, or to use force or to threaten to use force as a means to implement one's policy. We should not resort to using force to settle disputes between countries; achieving a fair and reasonable solution through peaceful talks is the only correct way. Here I like to point out in particular that Comrade Deng Xiaoping, by summing up domestic and international practice, has offered many penetrating expositions on the five principles of peaceful coexistence. He put forward the great idea of "one country, two systems" for solving the Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan issues. He said: "Our putting forward the 'one country, two systems' idea to solve China's reunification problem also is a kind of peaceful coexistence." He also pointed out: "On some international territorial disputes, we may set sovereignty aside for the time being and make joint efforts to develop the territory in question first." It is just under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's advocating "shelving disputes and making common efforts to develop" that China and concerned countries have actively sought ways to join efforts to develop regions under dispute, in order to preserve peace and stability in this region and to prevent tensions from emerging. Equality and mutual benefit are the embodiment of the five principles of peaceful coexistence in the handling of economic relations. In economics, all countries should benefit each other by learning from each other's strong points to offset their own weaknesses, helping supply each other's needs, and cooperating with one another on an equal footing. Protectionism of various forms and exchanges of unequal values are undesirable. The world economy is an inter-related and mutually-dependent whole. Various regions and countries promote and supplement each other in economics. At present, some developing countries are having economic difficulties of which many are caused by an irrational international economic order and by exchanges of unequal values. Developed countries have the responsibility to help developing nations shake off poverty. The worsening of the absolute poverty in some underdeveloped countries is an important cause for turmoils, civil wars, and even regional conflicts. This is a fact to which the international community should attach sufficient importance. South-North dialogue and cooperation should be promoted. Developed countries should open their markets to developing nations, provide development funds, transfer technologies, and increase aid to the latter, help the latter reduce its debt burden, and thus contribute to the latter's economic development and social stability and to narrowing the South-North gap. Their doing so will be conducive to their own economic development. Distinguished guests; China is going all-out with its modernization program. It needs a peaceful international environment and needs to develop friendly cooperation with other countries. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his report to the 14th CPC National Congress: China has consistently pursued an independent foreign policy of peace. The basic objectives of that policy are to safeguard our independence and sovereignty and to promote world peace and development. China will always stand firm as a strong defender of world peace. China will never seek hegemony and expansion; it is opposed to hegemonism, power politics, aggression and expansion in any form. Under the new international situation, we will abide by the five principles of peaceful coexistence and continue to actively develop our relations with other countries. China will always be a good neighbor to surrounding countries, as well as an equal, cooperative partner to other countries. To open up on every side and actively develop economic relations with other countries is an important component part of China's foreign policy. China will constantly expand and strengthen exchanges and cooperation with other countries in the economic, scientific, technological, and cultural fields in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit; and will actively assimilate the achievements of civilization of all mankind, including the advanced business operations and management expertise of developed western countries. Over the last 15 years, China has opened itself wider and wider to the outside world and has now created a pattern of being open on every side, with both coastal and interior regions open to the outside. The policy of opening up has promoted economic development and the improvement of the people's living standards, and won wholehearted support from people across the country. China's policy of opening up will not change, no matter how the international situation changes. Distinguished guests: The 50th anniversary of the United Nations will be ushered in next year, and mankind will enter the 21st century several years later. To sum up the historical experience of human society over the last half of the century and make the 21st century one of peace, stability, development and prosperity has more and more become a common aspiration of the peoples of all countries; and it is also a rigorous challenge of history to the governments and peoples of all countries. The Chinese Government and people will hold aloft the banner of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and join other countries in the world in working hard to build a new international political and economic order and create a glorious future of the mankind. Thank you!
