In a dispatch from Vienna, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN said Kim had formally handed a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement to top IAEA officials. Kim made it clear that Pyongyang will have no alternative but to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if the international community imposes economic sanctions, the newspaper said. Saying it was unusual for a North Korean ambassador to hold talks with top IAEA officials, MAINICHI said some observers view Pyongyang's move as an indication that it has begun efforts to avoid a breakdown in IAEA inspections. Meanwhile, Yun Ho-chin, councilor at the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, told MAINICHI Thursday that his country is in a special position where it is suspending its decision to withdraw from the NPT. Yun said, "from a legal point of view, North Korea has already left the treaty, but it is trying to resolve the nuclear dispute politically within the NPT framework. "That is why North Korea is allowing the IAEA to service surveillance cameras in order to help maintain the continuity of nuclear safeguards." With regard to the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, Yun claimed that North Korea's method of preserving the spent fuel rods has been proven in earlier experiments to allow for accurate checking later. "When the IAEA insists on its own way of checking, it is the same as trying to chase us out of the NPT," Yun said, hinting that North Korea would even leave the regime completely if it could not reach an inspection agreement with the IAEA.
