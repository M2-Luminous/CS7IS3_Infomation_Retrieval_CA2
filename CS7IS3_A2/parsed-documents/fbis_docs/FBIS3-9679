In a statement to Radio Novi Sad, he assessed that UN forces are attempting to calm the situation only in places where the Muslim forces are not having successes. "It is for precisely this reason that we have sent a protest to the United Nations, stressing in particular the examples of the battlefields near Maglaj, Bihac, and some others," Krajisnik added. He stressed that forecasts of a Muslim offensive have turned out to be true and he confirmed that Muslims are obtaining weapons from abroad.
