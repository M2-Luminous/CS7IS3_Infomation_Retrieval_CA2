FR940725-0-00066 FR940725-0-00008 b. If the final decision rendered in an impartial due process hearing sustains the evaluation of the Section 6 School Arrangement CSC, the parent has the right to an independent evaluation, but not at the expense of the Department of Defense or any DoD Component. 5. The parents of a preschool child or child with a disability shall be afforded an opportunity to inspect and review all relevant educational records concerning the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of such student, and the provision of a free appropriate public education to him or her. 6. Upon complaint presented in a written petition, the parent of a preschool child or child with a disability or the Section 6 School System shall have the opportunity for an impartial due process hearing provided by the Department of Defense as prescribed by appendix C of this part. 7. During the pendency of any impartial due process hearing or judicial proceeding on the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a preschool child or child with a disability receiving an education from a Section 6 School Arrangement or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such a student, unless the Section 6 School Arrangement and a parent of the student agree otherwise, the student shall remain in his or her present educational placement, subject to the disciplinary procedures prescribed in this part. 8. If a preschool child or child with a disability, without a current IEP, who is entitled to receive educational instruction from a Section 6 School Arrangement is applying for initial admission to a Section 6 School Arrangement, that student shall enter that Arrangement on the same basis as a student without a disability. 9. The parent of a preschool child or child with a disability or a Section 6 School Arrangement employee may file a written communication with the Section 6 School Arrangement Superintendent about possible general violations of this part or Pub. L. 101&hyph;476, as amended. Such communications will not be treated as complaints under appendix C of this part. G. Disciplinary Procedures 1. All regular disciplinary rules and procedures applicable to students receiving educational instruction in the Section 6 School Arrangements shall apply to preschool children and children with disabilities who violate school rules and regulations or disrupt regular classroom activities, subject to the provisions of this section. 2. The appropriate CSC shall determine whether the conduct of a preschool child or child with a disability is the result of that disability before the long-term suspension (10 consecutive or cumulative days during the school year) or the expulsion of that student. 3. If the CSC determines that the conduct of such a preschool child or child with a disability results in whole or part from his or her disability, that student may not be subject to any regular disciplinary rules and procedures; and a. The student's parent shall be notified in accordance with this part of the right to have an IEP meeting before any change in the student's special education placement. (A termination of the student's education for more than 10 days, either cumulative or consecutive, constitutes a change of placement.) b. The Section 6 School Arrangement CSC or another authorized school official shall ensure that an IEP meeting is held to determine the appropriate educational placement for the student in consideration of his or her conduct before the tenth cumulative day of the student's suspension or an expulsion. 4. A preschool child or child with a disability shall neither be suspended for more than 10 days nor expelled, and his or her educational placement shall not otherwise be changed for disciplinary reasons, unless in accordance with this section, except that: a. This section shall be applicable only to preschool children and children determined to have a disability under this part. b. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the emergency suspension of any preschool child or child with a disability who endangers or reasonable appears to endanger the health, welfare, or safety of himself or herself, or any other student, teacher, or school personnel, provided that: (1) The appropriate Section 6 School Arrangement CSC shall immediately meet to determine whether the preschool child's or child's conduct results from his or her disability and what change in special education placement is appropriate for that student. (2) The child's parent(s) shall be notified immediately of the student's suspension and of the time, purpose, and location of the CSC meeting and their right to attend the meeting. (3) A component is included in the IEP that addresses the behavioral needs of the student.
