Members of the Cambodia People's Party (CPP), also known as the Phnom Penh party, part of the country's three-party coalition government, are planning to table a motion backing the action when parliament reconvenes in the next two weeks, the official said. The parliamentarians need the support of their coalition partners in the royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], to get the two-thirds majority necessary to carry the motion in the 120 strong national assembly, the government official said. It is not known how many MPs support the move. Co-Premier Hun Sen -- a CPP leader -- who was due to visit Bangkok to discuss "border problems" following allegations that the Khmer Rouge had attacked government forces from positions in Thai territory, decided to postpone the visit until after parliament had voted on the motion, the official said. The move to outlaw the guerrillas comes after the Khmer Rouge refused co-Prime Ministers Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's offer of a ceasefire for the April 13-15 Khmer New Year celebrations. Hun Sen has said the ceasefire offer was a sign of the government's willingness to negotiate with the rebels. But the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge, which has shown no sign of compromise, appears to have exhausted the patience of both the government and King Sihanouk. The guerrillas recent kidnapping of an Australian and two Britons further exacerbated matters, the official said. Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng told AFP that the king advocated the move by the national assembly "to isolate the Khmer Rouge as rebels." "We have kept the door open but the Khmer Rouge never joined the reconciliation process," Sar Kheng said, adding: "Now we should not talk anymore about keeping the door open." Government officials said King Sihanouk was "disappointed" that the Khmer Rouge did not follow through with his recent peace proposal for the rebels. Under the plan, certain "acceptable" members of the radical faction would be given senior cabinet posts in exchange for the Khmer Rouge ceasing all guerrilla activity, opening up their zones and merging their fighters with the national armed forces. In a recent interview with the Phnom Penh Post, the king described the government's offensive against Pailin and its March 19 seizure of the Khmer Rouge's stronghold, as "legitimate, unavoidable and most laudable." The Khmer Rouge office and residence facing closure under the MP's motion was set up here following the 1991 signing of Cambodia's UN-brokered peace plan, which lead to elections last May. The Khmer Rouge, however, boycotted the polls, which saw the former resistance allies in the FUNCINPEC party, and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, form a coalition government with the radical faction's arch foe, the Phnom Penh party. Despite continuing a guerrilla campaign in the countryside against the new government, the Khmer Rouge were allowed to maintain representatives in the capital. This anomalous situation stemmed from King Norodom Sihanouk's hopes for a national reconciliation plan which would include the Khmer Rouge, and from the government's subsequent policy of "keeping the door open" for the guerrillas. Prior to postponing his trip to Bangkok, Hun Sen said this was one of the major issues on the agenda for his talks with the Thais. "Some Thai officials said the Khmer Rouge are not yet illegal because they have representatives in Phnom Penh," he said. "I want to say officially that no other people or party except the Royal Government is legitimate, and that the Khmer Rouge office in Phnom Penh is the internal policy of the Khmer Nation," Hun Sen said.
