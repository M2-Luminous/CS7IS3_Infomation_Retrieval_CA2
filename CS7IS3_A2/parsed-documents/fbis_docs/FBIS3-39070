Last Saturday [5 February], right in the middle of the market in Sarajevo, a shell left 68 dead and 200 wounded. It took this carnage, the nausea and disgust of public opinion, for the determination of the West to take hold. At the initiative of France and encouraged by the United States, NATO gave the Serbs an ultimatum to lift the blockade on Sarajevo. Mr. Defense Minister [Francois Leotard], good evening. We will be taking stock of the situation shortly with General Cot, who will be with us, and this is very exceptional, in a two way link-up from Zagreb, and with Isabelle Baillancourt, our special representative in Sarajevo. But we immediately have a question that is in everyone's mind. Have we started a process which carries with it the risk of extending the war in Europe? [Leotard] It is because of the very existence of this risk that we have been there, since the beginning, since 1991. We are there because Europe, and the French first of all, realized that, starting from that region, there could be a chain of events -- which history has already shown us, for that matter -- a chain of events dangerous for all of Europe. It is for that reason. So we have had the risk of expanding [of the war] up to now, and we are still facing it. In other words, we are intervening because there is that hypothesis of the war spreading to the north and to the south -- toward Krajina in the north, we will come to this in a while -- and toward the south, the Muslim areas in the south. It is because of these risks that we are there. [Sinclair] But is the process started by NATO -- we are going to come back to this at great length because the program is dealing exclusively with this subject -- is the process started by NATO this week, is there a risk that we are taking on? [sentence as heard] [Leotard] It is important to know that, in this part of the world, there are no policies that do not involve risk. So we have to look at this situation very seriously, first of all, and with courage and lucidity. Seriously, because people have been killed. I remind you that 200,000 people have died throughout the territory of the former Yugoslavia, there are 4 million refugees, tens of thousands of people who have been displaced, who are living in enclaves today. With courage, because I think we have to assess and accept a certain number of risks, which come from our firm attitude. And then, of course, with lucidity -- aware that the situation is extraordinarily complex and that it involves methods on our part, and on the part of all Europeans for that matter. [Sinclair] So before further discussion of the matter, Francois Leotard, the pictures. Let us immediately look again at the film of the week. [passage omitted] Francois Leotard, we will look at things in order, and first of all, of course, the ultimatum. Why did it not seem possible yesterday, or even seemed irresponsible, as Bernard-Henri Levy, the Abbe Pierre, and Bernard Kouchner were told, why has it suddenly become possible this week? [Leotard] I think there are several things to be said in response to your question. First, France itself, especially since April: We have kept asking for a certain number of international measures. We are not alone in this matter. We belong to coalitions: Europe, NATO, and of course the United Nations. So we have asked for intervention several times within these organizations. [passage omitted] The second reason is that bit by bit attacks on the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] have increased. So we were were getting bogged down. The reason for our presence was to give humanitarian aid, and that aid was itself being hindered. The third reason is that there was a disagreement, it is true and I must say it here, about the very idea of what was meant by air strikes. We have heard a lot of unclear or vague things -- this is normal in discussion. We have always asked for air support -- that is to say, an air presence -- to enable aid tasks to be carried out. Others have said we have to go further, we have to strike systematically, and sometimes in depth, sometimes even in Serbia itself, against those fighting us. But that is not our mandate. We have not declared war on one of the three factions. But we are going to declare war [as heard]. So you have to realize that what was difficult yesterday because we, France, were not understood, is better accepted today, because the French position, in particular at the last NATO meeting, was accepted by the Americans, and understood by our allies. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] Will you designate the aggressor today? [Leotard] It is more complicated than it was yesterday. Of course, it is the Serbs besieging the town in Sarajevo, for example. We have to say things clearly. Elsewhere, as you will see, it is Muslim Bosnians surrounding Croat zones, so it has become more complex. [Sinclair] But you are not equating them? Because the expression the belligerents has always been... [Leotard, interrupting] No, I am not equating them. What happened in the beginning was the desire of Greater Serbia, of the Serbian leaders, to spread their influence, to gain territory by violence. That is what we should never have accepted. Never have accepted. We must tell those people who keep saying that we must withdraw, I mean to say, sometimes for a minimum, minor, modest effort, at any rate at the start, one can prevent a larger catastrophe. And this is absolutely the thesis we are trying to develop. Let's try to stop the war now, because tomorrow we won't be able to stop it any more. [Sinclair] Saying to oneself at the same time, let's stop it now but, perhaps, we could have stopped it earlier. [Leotard] Perhaps we could have stopped it earlier. [passage omitted] We must stick to the same course, because we are involved in a trial of strength, with people who today respect only threats. So we must carry these threats through. [passage omitted] This is just to show that the existing forces, including French planes, are constantly taking photographs which we need and targets have already been established. Everyone must know we have all this and we will use it. [Sinclair] So when we talk about bombing artillery pieces, it is really these artillery pieces here that we see [points to map] and which are approximately how many, 250 or 300? [Leotard] Now, between 250 and 300, if you add pieces that are really heavy artillery mortars of 120 mm or mortars of 80 mm, which are very hard to detect because they are small weapons. And it was probably a 120 mortar, you remember, which caused the drama, the tragedy, of the market of Markale. [Sinclair] General Cot, you are in Zagreb, live from Zagreb with us. Thank you very much for being with us. We can see you and we can hear you. On the ground, the Serbs have timidly started to hand pieces of artillery over to the UNPROFOR. For you, is that encouraging or, on the contrary, do you think that this is not enough? Two days ago, 13 pieces of artillery were reportedly handed over. Today, for instance, nothing has come as yet. Are you rather optimistic or pessimistic? [Cot] If you allow me, before I go into figures concerning guns, I would like to tell you what I think about what the minister has just said. I think that the tragedy of 5 February was a genuine trauma on the ground, as I could see for myself the following day, and throughout the world. Two initiatives have emerged. The first, about which you talked at length, if I understood well, is that of NATO. The other is what is happening on the ground, and as early as the following day, through the negotiations we conducted immediately: we managed to obtain a cease-fire, as you know, before NATO's decision, and that cease-fire is being heeded. We also managed to have observers sent there and to start gathering pieces of artillery. I think, I sincerely hope, that these two initiatives will be complementary, and I do hope that the 120 mm shell on the market place could be the beginning of a process leading to the opposite of 1914 Sarajevo, if you like. An example closer to us could be that of Ouvea [site of clashes between police and freedom fighters in New Caledonia in 1988]. As you rightly put it, it seems to me that when too much becomes too much, on the ground, one must understand that it is necessary to break out of this absurd situation. I believe that NATO's initiative, which I support, of course, and the one we took on the ground, that is continuing to negotiate in a determined fashion, are complementary. [Sinclair] Negotiations on the ground are continuing. General Soubirou, a French general and Michael Rose's deputy, was in Pale today to negotiate with the Serbs. So what has come out of the negotiations today? Can you tell us? Are we in a process where we are moving towards the handover of Serb artillery to your forces, the UNPROFOR forces, or is there a feeling that things are getting very bogged down? [Cot] Yes, I think we have not started off so badly, since, as I told you, the cease-fire has been respected for three days. But it is true that the items that we have collected so far are only a minute fraction of the total that the Serbs have, since we have today 20 antiaircraft guns from the Serb side, and 10 items from the Bosnian side. But I think we will continue, and we must certainly keep up pressure, and even step it up. That is why I went to see General Mladic, who is the commander of the Serbs, in the mountains of northwest Bosnia yesterday, and got him to agree to come to Sarajevo next Tuesday, 15 February, to the airport, and I am going to ask General Delic, his counterpart with the Bosnians, to come too, because I think that the level of negotiations, headed at the moment by General Soubirou, is too low, and I am glad to have got these two chiefs to meet. I will be there too, with General Rose, and we really intend to keep up strong pressure. [Sinclair] General, people remember your anger when you said: We are ready for military intervention, and are sorry that we don't have the means to respond when the UN forces are attacked, and even spoke about your soldiers being humiliated. Does the situation seem clearer to you today? Do you feel that everyone fits their role better? [Cot] Yes, I also said other things, but that is mainly what has been remembered. Let me tell you that this morning I received the decision by the Secretary General, Mr. Butrus-Ghali, to delegate to Mr Akashi on the ground the right to take the decision on possible use of air support throughout the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so I must be satisfied with what I have done and I think... [Sinclair, interrupting] Would that be done, General... [Cot] ...this is more in keeping with the needs of the force that has got itself into a more and more difficult situation, as Mr. Leotard was saying. [Sinclair] Would that be done at your request? That's to say, would it be at the request of UNPROFOR that it would be submitted to Mr. Akashi and then he would authorize the strike? How would it happen exactly? [Cot] That is indeed just what would happen. I would ask for the use of aircraft, whether throughout Bosnia, as I have just said, or for the case of Sarajevo today, and I would submit this request to Mr. Akashi, who, taking into account those factors that come under his competence, would make the decision himself, which would make it possible to save a great deal of time. That's to say, we could reduce it from about three hours -- that's the timescale we have found through our exercises up to now -- to about half of that, or even less. So it is a very important decision. [Sinclair] A question to Francois Leotard, and also to you, General Cot: What will happen if the withdrawal is incomplete, that is if we see that each day, a small contingent -- if there are any at all -- is handed over to UNPROFOR, and if, at the end of the day, when the ultimatum expires, we have 80 or 120 pieces of artillery out of the 250. What will we do? What will we not do? [Leotard] It is necessary for all, including the Serbs, to know that we are extremely determined and that we intend to succeed in this operation. If the conditions set by the decision of Brussels are not met, the term used in the resolution is: The batteries will be exposed to attack. It will be up to us to decide when and how the attacks, the strikes take place. [Sinclair] That is to say, possibly, an extension of the ultimatum? [Leotard] No, on the contrary. NATO's decision points out very clearly -- and it is exceptional for this type of decision -- that the deadline would not be extended. Consequently, on the evening of the 20th, everybody should know what can be expected. It will be up to [pauses] ...of course, we are not [pauses] ...having said that, what General Cot says is true: We are not just outside, we are also inside the site, the theater, as we say. There will be close cooperation with the forces on the ground, General Rose, General Soubirou, General Cot, of course, who will direct things, and this cooperation will enable us to see how ground troops move toward the batteries, the orders they receive, the reactions of those who may not want to obey them, and then the decisions to be taken. But nobody should question our determination. It should be obvious for those who are listening to us. [Sinclair] General, something that people are a bit worried about here is that Serbian weapons are being deposited in the barracks at Lukavica, in other words in a zone under Serbian control. There have already been precedents when Serbs have taken over weapons very close to them, left for them. Shouldn't these locations be under the control of the NATO forces, and in any case out of reach of the Serb forces? [Cot] Yes, but all things are possible. Even if they are all withdrawn from beyond the radius of 20 km, you could say that they could be brought back later. I think this is a first step. And I must say that what has been decided does not deal only with a withdrawal beyond a radius of 20 km, but also regrouping within the radius of 20 km, as long as the regrouping is under UN control. So I think these are reasonable guarantees. [Sinclair] Today the Serbs, in particular General Milovanovic, who is the chief of staff of the Serb forces in Bosnia, are asking you to monitor the Muslim infantry in Sarajevo. Might you consider this? Was this in the agreement? That's to say, they are asking for another, extra guarantee? [Cot] This is something different. First of all the pieces of heavy artillery surrounding Sarajevo have to be regrouped or pulled back, as we have just said. That is our first aim. Of course there is no question of the Muslim forces taking advantage of this to occupy the territory that will thus have been liberated. That is where the interplay of forces on the ground is extremely complex. It is like a game of spillikins in a war situation. That's to say, you have to pick up one by one the instruments of death around Sarajevo and, at the same time, ensure the physical presence of soldiers on the ground, reassure the population -- which General Rose did yesterday, going out onto the streets, and which we, our soldiers, do every day, and at the same time see that those inside the siege don't benefit from it, because that would again be seen as a factor of violence or aggression -- that they don't benefit from the situation in order to regain ground which will have to be regarded from a diplomatic or political point of view. What is important in what we were just saying is that there is no military solution, properly speaking. I hope we will speak about the peace plan, political and diplomatic solutions, but everyone is well aware that we are in a situation where there are no military solutions, properly speaking. [Sinclair] A last question, perhaps, general: It has been said very often that air strikes are not of much use if there are not enough men on the ground to occupy the positions formerly held by the Serb forces, as we were saying. Has anything changed in this line of thinking, or was it wrong, or are you saying today: We do indeed need more men, and you are asking for more men? [Cot] I think the scenario you have just described, namely that we make air strikes and we have to reoccupy the ground, has been too strongly influenced by the Gulf war, where by and large that was the scenario. But here, indeed we don't have the means to reconquer in the military sense what has been got rid of on the Serb side. I don't think that's the aim, actually. We don't have the means to do it and, as Mr. Leotard said, we are not in a war situation. We are there to take over control of these weapons. I am sure that the pressure is strong enough for this to be done, but I don't think we can talk about military operations, about reconquering ground that has in a way been cleared by air strikes. This is a line of thinking that does not accord with the nature of the force, nor with its mandate as Mr. Leotard said just now, at the beginning of the program. [Sinclair] Francois Leotard, I would like to ask you the same question, because it often was an argument used by politicians, including the present government, who said: We, France, have done our best, but there are not enough of us on the ground because other countries have not followed us sufficiently. [Leotard] Yes, of course. I would like to comment on what General Cot has just said. He is totally right. We are in a situation which is the exact reverse of the Gulf war. May I remind you that during the Gulf war we wore khaki, if I may put it this way, not white and blue. We had a front, a genuine front. There was an opponent, a named opponent, and so on. Here, we are not in a war situation. We have not declared war on anyone. We are painted in blue, i.e. we are men of peace, and, in fact, the situation of Sarajevo is reproduced elsewhere, with other elements, with different ethnic and religious elements. I believe that it is necessary to be aware of this. To the precise question you are asking, namely, will more men be necessary to control the 20 km zone, unfortunately, the answer is yes. I say unfortunately, because we have made a significant effort and we do not intend to step up that effort as long as others don't. Of course, military officers themselves say some 1,500 men should be added to bring the situation more under control. Again, we must bear in mind that we are not in a situation of military conflict, which makes things very complex indeed. [Sinclair] A last question, General Cot, and I will let you go. Do you think that the Serbs' capacity for retaliation has been overestimated, or is it significant, even after air strikes, and are you worried for civilians and your soldiers? [Cot] We have not over [pauses] ...we know the capacity of the Serbs. The Serbs have inherited the material of the Yugoslav People's Army, as you know. I don't know how we could estimate today what would be left of the guns after air strikes, this would take us too far into the debate, but I think that the Serbs have the means to retaliate, indeed, not only around Sarajevo, but throughout Bosnia, especially against humanitarian workers, which is another matter. There is no doubt that there is a contradiction there which will have to be assumed, between the mandate in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is essentially, if not totally, a humanitarian one, and the new attitude which we will take on. It is a genuine problem. [Leotard] We must understand, Anne Sinclair, if you allow me, that on the very day these air strikes begin -- if they ever begin -- the airport will be closed. At the moment, 80 percent of the food reaching Sarajevo comes from the airport. We would be in a totally different situation, and a very difficult one to manage. At the moment, there are some 3,000 men there, including more than 2,000 French soldiers. It would be a complex situation. [Sinclair] General, thanks a lot for being with us live from Zagreb. I let you go back to your men, your battalions, your mission which will become very complicated over the next few weeks. Thanks a million for being there, and good luck. [Cot] Thank you, Madame. [Sinclair] Before talking about the Bosnian problem as a whole, I would like to play for you a recording of Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the country, of this country that has suffered too much, as was said yesterday at the opening of the Lillehammer Olympic Games. He does not speak often; he has not spoken since the ultimatum. He agreed to do so for the "Sept sur Sept" team out there, and he did it in French: [Begin Izetbegovic recording; Izetbegovic speaks in halting French, reading from a script] Dear French friends. The France that fought in the resistance has just shown Sarajevo the path of honor and courage. I thank the French authorities and the French people for this. Alas! It has taken tens of thousands of deaths for the European conscience to wake up. I hope that this is not just a burst of indignation, and that from now on Europe will defend in full one of the peoples which make it up, and the values which lie at its roots. But if an ultimatum has been issued to the Serbs to withdraw their guns, you must know that the siege of Sarajevo has not been lifted. Five metres, 500 metres from here is Mount Trebevic. For two years sharpshooters have been killing children, women, pedestrians, a whole innocent people, every day. Will the Serbs be allowed, in exchange for the withdrawal of their guns, to continue to surround 300,000 men and women? A first step has been taken, but it does not give us back our freedom. More steps need to be taken, in Sarajevo and elsewhere, to enable us to live again at last. Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, Maglaj, Tesanj, Mostar and the other towns have been besieged and starved for months; Tuzla is being shelled. Is Sarajevo going to be saved, and not those towns? If Europe, and the international community, really make the aggressor retreat from around Sarajevo, will they stop there? Will they consider that they have done enough for Bosnia-Herzegovina? We in Bosnia-Herzegovina are resisting a new fascism. This curse is not threatening my country alone. Tomorrow it can invade Europe and the former USSR. Will the Serbs obtain by negotiation what they were unable to grab by war? The end of Bosnia, recognition of their conquests, and absolution for their crimes? French friends, I ask you to continue your support for the freedom of Sarajevo and of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole. Thank you. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Leotard] I mean to say that the other Europeans, the international community should pull their weight as much as France. We now have nearly 9,000 French soldiers throughout the theater, if I can say that, on the Adriatic, on the Danube, in Zagreb, in Sarajevo. We are the country that has contributed most. [Sinclair] Nine thousand out of... [Leotard] Out of nearly 30,000 now. There are 30 nations there. So, we are the country that has pulled its weight most. The others must pull their weight too. We have asked for this, from the United States, of course, but also and above all, from the Europeans. It's up to the Europeans to understand that it is partly their future which is at stake on this territory. [passage omitted] [Leotard] And then, Tuzla, where we are trying and we are hoping to open the airport, which would allow humanitarian aid to reach the north of Bosnia. And there, also, the Serbs are opposing this for the time being. I personally hope that we can also have the air protection force used around Tuzla, so that we can reopen the airport of Tuzla and get humanitarian aid into that part of Bosnia. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] Could we make the following concession to the Bosnians: grant them, in a revised peace plan [pauses] ...this is what the Americans advocate, that is, the revision of the peace plan in favor of the Bosnians, and to give them access to the sea, access to the Sava. [Leotard] Now, I think it's a demand that is not without legitimacy. It's just that the European Union has now drawn up a plan to which the three parties involved have more or less agreed. We have to work on this now and try to perfect it and to improve it. That is what the Americans are asking us to do to ensure that it is not an unfair solution. All injustice in that part of the world, in that part of the European continent, will lead to further violence... [Sinclair, interrupting] You mean too unfair. [Leotard] Too unfair. And so, this is a demand which needs to be studied but which is, you see, very difficult. Croatia has already said it will never accept the division of its Dalmatian territory, its Dalmatian coast. So this is very difficult. And in the north, of course, the Serbs also are opposed to their corridor there, which is about 8 km wide, being cut as well. [Sinclair] Here we must remember that the peace plan envisages the division into three republics -- Serb, Croat and... [Leotard, interrupting] And Bosnian Muslim. [Sinclair] Bosnian Muslim -- of all of Bosnia. [Leotard] We must remember that there are enclaves, you see. Those three enclaves which are in the east of Bosnia, which are Muslim and are within Bosnia. [Sinclair] In a confederation of whatever size. [Leotard] Of course, you have to see the initial peace plan as a starting point. That's to say, the basic idea is respect of the international frontiers of Bosnia, which have been recognized by the international community, and the coexistence of its peoples within this territory. This is really something that we can hope for, and for which we have to put on pressure. Because you can't imagine states that are enemies taking this shape. It is inconceivable. You would have dozens of corridors and we Europeans know what that means from the last war. So these people absolutely have to get on together to cooperate in the shape of a confederation, so that they can exchange goods, exchange populations, so that there should not be dozens of ghettos, making as many seats of violence, of Gaza Strips, as has sometimes been said, from where terrorist actions, or acts of despair might originate. So it is a very difficult task for diplomats, and I think public opinion should encourage this, and that of course this peace treaty should not be based on an injustice. [Sinclair] What is special about this war in former Yugoslavia is that it is not just a civil war, with all its horrors -- and the siege of Sarajevo, this terrible civil war -- but it is also the first time for 50 years that we have seen an attempt at ethnic cleansing, in other words towns and villages completely either massacred, or looted and raped, or where in any case the inhabitants have been deported to other areas so as to make homogenous areas. This is what has been done by the Serbs, mainly. [Leotard] This is what it is essential to reject. [passage omitted] The truth is that we have a lot of educational work to do. Do you have French people, Italians, Spaniards ready to die in large numbers, in a war, so that the previous situation can be restored? That is the difficulty. We must not hide it. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] Let's broaden the problem a bit to all of East Europe. We have seen the sinister Zhirinovskiy today ready to send battalions of volunteers to fight in Serbia. Zhirinovskiy makes a lot of noise, but is not in power, but won't the nationalists he is whipping up force Boris Yeltsin to take this overexcited nationalism in Russia into account? [Leotard] This is one of the aspects of this crisis, that they are Slavs, and of course the Serbs are Slav and Orthodox, and there is a sort of human and intellectual fraternity with the Russians, and President Yeltsin has to deal with an opposition, as you said, in the opposition -- that is to say Zhirinovskiy, who is very nationalistic, chauvinistic, xenophobic and fascist -- you can't call it anything else, because unfortunately that is the best definition of what he stands for. So we must both help Yeltsin to resist this nationalist opposition, not allow an anti-Russian, or anti-Slav, attitude to take hold, which would be quite out of place, certainly for France, and at the same time we have to make sure that this poison, this plague, that Europe saw 50 years ago, does not spread, as is unfortunately the case in Belgrade now. How else can we describe the people currently in Belgrade? And some of their associates in Bosnia. So the democracies have to be on guard to ensure that the values in their inheritance -- respect for human rights, elections, the right to come and go, the dignity of the human person -- should all be defended here. If it is not defended here, how can it be defended elsewhere? [Sinclair] So if it is defended here, won't this create a European precedent? What will we do the day that this or that minority in Russia or elsewhere in East Europe is either oppressed or oppressor? [Leotard] Mr. Balladur, the French prime minister, has put forward an initiative, which I think quite exemplary, as to what the French position, and, I was going to say, French intelligence, could be in that part of Europe. It is called a stability plan, a stability pact, which is to examine the problem of frontiers and the problem of minorities before crises arise, as a preventative measure. [passage omitted] I think we are faced with a resurgence of nationalism and ethnic or, unfortunately, religious demands, which are fatal for Europe. We fought this for decades, and they are coming back, and you will see that the borders here are the former borders that are very, very old. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] Mr. Leotard, there are exactly 10 days left, or a bit more, since it is next Sunday at midnight that the cease-fire [as heard] will expire. Do you hope things will move, that the Serbs will hand their heavy artillery over to UNPROFOR? Are you hoping for a positive outcome? [Leotard] I am hoping with all my heart that things happen in the way we intend. [passage omitted] I just want to say that there are people around today who are warmongers, who say: The only thing to do is to make war. But that isn't true. There are people on the other hand who say: We mustn't look, it's too awful, it isn't our business. That isn't true either. In fact we are faced with a reality that is going to affect us, which can affect us, and France's honor lies in being there with her soldiers. [passage omitted]
