ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim final rule implements recent amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) by amending the regulations implementing the MMPA to authorize, pursuant to a General Authorization for Scientific Research, the harassment of marine mammals in the wild for purposes of bona fide scientific research, that does not have the potential to injure marine mammals (Level B harassment). DATES: The interim rule is effective on October 3, 1994. Comments must be postmarked or received by November 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments or requests for the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared for this action should be sent to Chief, Permits Division, F/PR1, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226. Comments regarding the burden-hour estimate or any other aspect of the collection-of-information requirement contained in this rule should be sent to Ann D. Terbush at the above address and to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Attention: NOAA Desk Officer, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ann D. Terbush, (301) 713&hyph;2289. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: General Background and Statutory Information Marine Mammal Protection Act The MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq. ) places a moratorium on the taking and importing of marine mammals by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction with limited exceptions. One exception is for the taking or importing of marine mammals for purposes of scientific research. The MMPA Amendments of 1994 (1994 Amendments), enacted on April 30, 1994 (P.L. 103&hyph;238), among other things, require that, within 120 days of enactment, NMFS issue a General Authorization for Scientific Research and implementing regulations allowing takings of marine mammals in the wild for purposes of bona fide scientific research by no more than Level B harassment (pursuit, torment, or annoyance of marine mammals that does not have the potential to injure marine mammals). The 120-day deadline requires that this General Authorization be issued by interim final rule without prior notice and opportunity for prior public comment. Comments on the General Authorization and implementing regulations are invited and will be considered in issuing a final rule. Level B harassment is defined as any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering but does not have the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild. Level A harassment is defined as any act which has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild. In general, except for small take authorizations for harassment under section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, a permit is required to take by Level A harassment. And, a permit is also required to hunt, capture, or kill marine mammals for the purposes of scientific research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock, or to take by Level B harassment for photography for educational or commercial purposes. Fur Seal Act In proposed revised permit regulations published on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53320), NMFS proposed consolidating three sets of permit regulations that have been implemented under the MMPA, the Fur Seal Act of 1966 (FSA) (16 U.S.C. 1151 et seq .), and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .). This interim final rule revises the permit sections of the implementing regulations of the FSA (50 CFR part 215) to reference MMPA permit regulations (50 CFR part 216, subpart D) as the applicable regulations for the taking of North Pacific fur seals for scientific research or exhibition purposes. The FSA permit regulations are also revised to allow the taking of North Pacific fur seals involving only Level B harassment for the purpose of scientific research under this interim final rule. (Note: North Pacific fur seals (Pribilof Island population) have been designated as depleted under the MMPA.) Collection of Certain Marine Mammal Parts In enacting the 1994 Amendments it was the apparent intent of Congress to allow under a General Authorization the conduct of scientific research activities involving certain low-impact types of taking of marine mammals in the wild, with the goal of making a permit unnecessary for scientific research involving types of taking that do not have the potential to injure marine mammals or marine mammal stocks. NMFS believes that such types of low-impact taking include the collection of tissues, fluids, or other marine mammal parts sloughed, excreted, or otherwise discharged naturally by marine mammals in the wild, where such collection may not necessarily involve the harassment of living marine mammals in the wild. Accordingly, NMFS is amending §216.26 of the implementing regulations (50 CFR part 216) to allow for purposes of bona fide scientific research, without issuance of a permit, the collection of any tissues, fluids or other marine mammal parts naturally sloughed, excreted or otherwise discharged by a living marine mammal in the wild. Section 216.26 is also amended to: (1) Ensure that requirements for the registration, identification, transfer, or other possession of such marine mammal parts are consistent with those already established for parts salvaged from beached or stranded marine mammals (§216.22(c)); (2) require that, in registering such marine mammal parts, the person collecting the part must also state the scientific research purpose for which the part was collected; and (3) prohibit the sale or trade of any such marine mammal part for commercial purposes.
