The Ifo Institute cites in particular Zhirinovskiy's success at the parliamentary elections in December 1993 and his goal to replace Boris Yeltsin as Russian president in 1996. The Russian reform and stabilization program adopted in the autumn of 1993 also contains problematic taxation plans. In view of the massive tax evasion in Russia, it would be desirable to go back to administratively simpler taxes which are difficult to evade, the Ifo Institute writes. The institute also proposes property taxation. The Russian budget deficit for 1993 will probably be 1.5 to 2 trillion rubles higher than planned. At the end of 1993 the government also approved a cash injection of 550 billion rubles for the arms industry and took emergency measures to alleviate the energy crisis in the CIS caused by the cold winter.
