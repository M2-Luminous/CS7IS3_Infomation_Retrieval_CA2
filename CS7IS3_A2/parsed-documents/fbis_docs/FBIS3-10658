This will be the first of two satellites that will be part of the second generation of Embratel's communications satellites. Brasilsat-B1, which arrived in Sao Jose dos Campos on 28 February, will be subject to final integration tests at INPE's Integration and Testing Laboratory (LIT) until the end of April. After being tested, the satellite will be transported to the Arianespace's Kourou launch in French Guyana, from where it will be transported into space by an Ariane rocket. The tests at INPE, supervised by experts from INPE and Hughes Aircraft Co. -- a Los Angeles enterprise that built the satellite, will verify all the Brasilsat-B1 systems. Second Generation The Brasilsat-B1 and B2 are the same type and look like the first-generation satellites--Brasilsat-A1 and A2, but are more advanced technologically and have better performance. The signals the new satellites send to earth are much more powerful. The service life of the two satellites that will be replaced, Brasilsat-A1 and A2, estimated at eight to 10 years, is almost up. According to Embratel, their replacement will not affect the users, not even those who have parabolic antennas, who will continue to receive their television programs normally. The new satellites have an approximately 12-year service life, which means that Brazil's communications are guaranteed until the year 2006.
