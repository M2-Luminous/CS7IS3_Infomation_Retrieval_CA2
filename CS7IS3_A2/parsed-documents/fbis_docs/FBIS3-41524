The towns of Wuppertal, Remscheid and Solingen have joined forces in a unique association to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 25 to 30 percent by the year 2005. They intend to develop a CO2 reduction plan jointly at regional level. The project will be financed largely by the Construction and Housing Ministry of the land of North Rhine-Westphalia. The most important sources have been known to science for a long time: industry, traffic and households. CO2 is also released when electricity is generated from fossil fuels such as coal and oil. So energy consumption must be reduced and made much more efficient. Improved thermal insulation of buildings is one way of saving energy. Today's modern household appliances use a lot less power than at the start of the 1970's. Moreover, using local public transport instead of the car also helps to cut CO2 emissions. The three towns' activities will in the future be coordinated in a regional office. Initiative, a willingness to talk, and motivation are now required to bring about a consensus of those involved in authorities, associations and firms. The project will show its first results by 1995. Then it will also be clear where the universe of actions, set by the European Union, Federal Government, and laender, must be changed to achieve the great objective of CO2 reduction. Wuppertal chief executive Joachim Cornelius says: ``The very fact that this forward-looking project is being tackled in the three large towns makes me optimistic and can only be of advantage.'' Many citizens are already wanting to take part.
