Camilion noted that it must still be determined whether the new system "can be implemented overnight, or whether it requires a process of adjustment." Camilion agreed with Lieutenant General Martin Balza, Army chief of staff, that "no deadline" has been established for carrying out the presidential order. Justicialist Party and Radical Civic Union Party legislators this afternoon supported the president's decision to eliminate compulsory military service, and stressed that this measure "has been requested extensively by the whole of Argentine society." A little over two months ago, the public became engaged in heavy discussions over whether or not it was appropriate to maintain the system of compulsory military service, after the killing of conscript Omar Carrasco at a garrison in the town of Zapala, Neuquen Province. Congress became a sounding board for this controversial issue, as a military service bill that has already been approved by the Chamber of Deputies is currently being reviewed by the Senate Defense Committee. The defense minister made it clear that the decision was made by the executive branch, "but Congress will have the last word in determining a way to replace compulsory military service with a professional system." Concerning the deadlines considered by the government for implementing the measure, the minister pointed out that "there are no deadlines," but estimated that "a few weeks will be required." The defense minister indicated that the project "was discussed by the cabinet today, and the president believed it was wise and advisable to announce it publicly." Concerning the budget issue, Camilion said: "In principle it is being reviewed, to see if the idea is viable." He added: "The figures must still be adjusted." The minister also explained that "no deadlines have been estimated" for the elimination of compulsory military service, because it is very important to determine first "whether it can be implemented overnight or whether it requires an adjustment process."
