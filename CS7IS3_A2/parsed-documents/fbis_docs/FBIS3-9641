I did that out of the sense of duty I feel for our readers. I had to see, with my own eyes, without intermediaries, what is happening with Ion Iliescu. Has he changed at all since his meeting two years ago, preceding the electoral campaign, with journalists of various Bucharest publications, a meeting I also had the honor of attending? After the conclusion of the recent three-hour meeting, after having listened to Iliescu -- who kept talking throughout the meeting, from its very beginning to the end, interrupting, with or without a reason, his partners -- my conclusion is absolutely clear: The president has undergone a radical change. Two years ago, he still had certain doubts. Whether to run for president or not. Whether to turn right or left. Whether what he was doing was right or wrong. Now, however, he has no doubts. Now, he is firmly convinced that whatever he does is right. He is firmly convinced that truth is on his side. He is convinced he is right with respect to the domestic and international orientations of the country, the political spectrum available at home, and, what is even more, regarding the way in which dailies should be run. The journalists, we poor devils, are coming from the trenches of life. We know everyday reality, we have contact with it directly, brutally, and not by way of briefings elaborated by counselors. We know, in detail, all the dramatic aspects of the current hard life in Romania. We know that everything is stagnant. We know that there is an extremely grave economic and political blockage. We know that prices are increasing continually. We know all this from the hundreds of letters and phonecalls addressed to us by our readers, as well as from assessing our own situation: The circulation of our dailies is dropping owing to the drastic reduction of the people's purchasing power within the great economic difficulties we are facing. After I had read the invitation sent to me by Spokesman Traian Chebeleu, in which it was announced that the president wishes to discuss the social, political, and economic problems of the country with the directors and chief editors of the major dailies, I thought that perhaps Ion Iliescu wishes to learn, in a direct way, from the representatives of public opinion, about what is actually going on in this country. This proved to be a vain illusion. It was merely an illusion of mine stemming from my conviction that not only in the case of democracies, but also in dictatorships, the heads of state feel the need to be well informed about the large- or small-scale changes taking place in reality. If for no any other reason, then just because the careers of all heads of states who have neglected this have ended tragically. In this sense, Nicolae Ceausescu is a very good example. However, Ion Iliescu did not want to learn anything from us. First, because he did not summon us to Cotroceni for us to tell him what we think he should do, but rather for him to tell us what he thinks we should do. From this point of view, all the time, I had the impression that I was not attending a meeting with President Ion Iliescu, but rather with the propaganda secretary Ion Iliescu. That is, what we were attending was actually not a dialogue, but rather a meeting (I must admit, with mineral water and Coca-Cola being served, and every now and then we were also allowed to utter a few words) in which we were given precious recommendations. On how to be more profound. On how we could become more polite to the presidential institution. On how we should cease to resort to querelle in the press. (This French word, meaning "quarrel," seems to be Ion Iliescu's latest linguistic acquisition). Second, the president did not wish to learn anything from us about what is happening in the country, because he is firmly convinced that he knows everything that is happening currently. That the decline in production has been stopped. That we managed to survive without foreign financing. That the Vacaroiu government is the best conceivable one in the whole wide world. How about the rest? The rest is nothing but malevolent things claimed by his adversaries. By the opposition. By the press. Recently, I discussed the situation in the country with many politicians. Not solely those of the opposition, but also with those belonging to the rulers. Throughout those talks, I have never experienced a denser opaqueness with respect to the signals coming from the outside than the one displayed by the president during our Monday meeting. All our attempts trying to tell him that the people are leading a rough life, that prices are extremely high, that the phenomenon of corruption is expanding, and that the state institutions are anything but open, were received by him with a sullen distress akin to animosity. I am quite certain that, while listening to our warnings, Ion Iliescu was trying to figure out to which occult, destabilizing force the speaker belonged to. Thus, after two years, I now found a person who has definitively locked himself up in the tower of his own truths. A man living among statistical figures and abstract truths, a man who is unreachable even by the slightest breeze from the outside. A man to be pitied, in a way.
