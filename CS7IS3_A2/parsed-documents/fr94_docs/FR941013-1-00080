FR941013-1-00080 FR941013-1-00010 V. Selection of Basis for Proposed Rule A. Selection of Regulatory Alternative for Existing Sources To select one of the five regulatory alternatives to serve as the basis for the proposed standards for existing sources, the EPA evaluated the organic HAP emission reductions, control costs, economic impacts, and other environmental and energy impacts associated with implementing the air emission controls under each regulatory alternative. Based on this evaluation, the EPA selected Regulatory Alternative 3 as the basis for the standards proposed for existing sources. Regulatory Alternative 1, the MACT floor, is estimated to reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately 24,000 Mg/yr. Regulatory Alternative 2 is estimated to reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately 29,000 Mg/yr. Substantially higher organic HAP emission reductions beyond those estimated for Regulatory Alternatives 1 and 2 are estimated to be achieved by either Regulatory Alternative 3, 4, or 5. All three of these regulatory alternatives are estimated to achieve similar levels of organic HAP emission reduction from the regulatory baseline. Nationwide organic HAP emission reductions are estimated to be 43,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 3, 43,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 4, and 44,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 5. The highest level of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction would be achieved by selecting either Regulatory Alternative 3, 4, or 5 as the basis for the standards for existing sources. The estimated control cost estimates for Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 are higher than the estimated costs for Regulatory Alternative 3. Because Regulatory Alternative 3 would provide essentially the same level of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction for a lower cost, Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 were eliminated from further consideration as the basis for the proposed standards. The EPA may set standards that are more stringent than the MACT floor if such standards are achievable considering the cost, environmental, and other impacts listed in CAA section 112(d)(2). Based on the information available to the EPA at this time, the only difference in these cost, environmental, and other impacts that the EPA can distinguish between Regulatory Alternatives 1, 2, and 3 is related to the estimated nationwide costs of controls required by each of these regulatory alternatives. The total nationwide annual cost estimated to implement controls under either Regulatory Alternative 1 or 2 is approximately the same ($4.7 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 1 versus $5.2 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 2). The total nationwide annual cost estimated to implement controls under Regulatory Alternative 3 is significantly higher ($24.5 million per year). However, given the additional 19,000 Mg/yr of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction that is estimated to be achieved over Regulatory Alternative 1 and the additional 14,000 Mg/yr of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction that is estimated to be achieved over Regulatory Alternative 2, the EPA concluded that the additional cost of implementing controls under Regulatory Alternative 3 is reasonable and justifiable. Thus, the EPA selected Regulatory Alternative 3 as the basis for the proposed standards for existing sources. B. Selection of Regulatory Alternative for New Sources No regulatory alternatives beyond the MACT floor were identified for new sources. Thus, the MACT floor for new sources is the basis for the control requirements proposed for new sources. C. Selection of Format for Proposed Rule Section 112 of the CAA requires that emission standards for control of HAP be established unless it is the Administrator's judgement that emission standards cannot be established or enforced for a particular type of source. Formats for emission standards include percent reduction, concentration limits, or a mass emission limit. Section 112(h)(2) identifies two conditions under which it is not feasible to establish an emission standard: (1) If the pollutants cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to emit or capture the pollutant; or (2) if the application of measurement technology to a particular class of sources is not practicable because of technology and economic limitations. In these cases, the EPA may instead establish design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards, or a combination thereof.
