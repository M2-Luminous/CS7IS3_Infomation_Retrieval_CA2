DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek, commenting on foreign media reports that North Korean President Kim Il-song has suggested Aug. 15 as a possible date for the historic talks, said, "the earlier the South- North Korean summit came, the better it would be. "Even if it's just for demonstrating national independence, the summit should be held prior to the third-round talks between Pyongyang and Washington." The party's spokesman, Rep. Pak Chi-won, said in a statement: "We believe it was natural for the summit leaders of the two sides to meet prior to the third-round talks to resolve the nuclear issue from the perspective of national independence, so that we see President Kim (Il-song)'s idea, revealed in an indirect way, of holding it on Aug. 15 as inappropriate." Noting that his party is aware of North Korea's political schedule to hold a "pan-national rally" on Aug. 15, Pak said, "it is our position that the inter-Korean summit should not be abused politically under any circumstances."
