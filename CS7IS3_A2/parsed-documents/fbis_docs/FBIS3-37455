During today's meeting with foreign journalists, Einseln said that the proposal for such a meeting had originated from the Russian side. He noted that Estonia should strive for cooperation with all neighboring countries, including Russia. The major general, however, did not wish to elaborate on cooperation with its' eastern neighbor. Speaking about Russia's military doctrine, Einseln emphasized that it looks quite acceptable on paper but one must look at how it is implemented. So far Russian statements have, in Einseln's opinion, sounded quite threatening. At the same time the army commander opined that a major part of Russia's aggressive statements are meant for domestic consumption or serve as blackmail. Einseln hopes that common sense will finally win in Russia too. According to Einseln, he is on good terms with the Russian servicemen deployed in Estonia. Einseln explains the halt in the troop withdrawal with bad weather. Would you be keen to go anywhere in such weather? asked Einseln of journalists. Einseln supported the Latvian decision to agree to the Russian demands on Skrunda radar station. He is also in favor of reducing the number of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast and the coordination of international aid provided to the Baltic Armed Forces. The (?forces) commander thinks that NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which Estonia joined on 3 February, is a step in the right direction, and at the right time. This has been reported by the Baltic News Service.
