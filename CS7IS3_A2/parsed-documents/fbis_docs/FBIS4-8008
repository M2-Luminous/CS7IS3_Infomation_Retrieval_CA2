The same source says that a strong attack by the Muslim army was repelled last night in the area of Krizevci, in the immediate vicinity of Gorazde. [passage omitted] Over the last 24 hours the frequency of NATO flights at very low altitude over the area of Gorazde, Cajnice, and Foca, where the fighting has been under way for 11 days, has increased, the statement says. Reinforcements in groups of 30 or 40 soldiers, specially trained in sabotage and terrorist activities, are being sent to the Muslim army in Gorazde from central Bosnia, Serb military sources say. The fate of some 700 Serbs trapped in Gorazde is increasingly uncertain, in the light of the fact that they are being used by the Muslims as a shield for Muslim soldiers who are being forcibly sent to the front line, the statement says.
