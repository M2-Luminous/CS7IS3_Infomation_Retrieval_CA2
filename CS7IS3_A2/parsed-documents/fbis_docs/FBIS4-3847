Dacre Holloway, UN Protection Force spokesman, was quoted as saying that scores of artillery and tank rounds were fired during "a heavy Bosnian Serb Army attack" hours before the deadline of 0001 GMT on Sunday [24 April] set by NATO. He said the heavy artillery attack on the town began at 11:00 A.M. Local time, with impacts all over the city, some very close to U.N. military observer headquarters, and the town hospital was also hit again. According to reports reaching here, Holloway said the Serb Forces were attacking from north of the Drina River which runs through the Muslim town. He also acknowledged that there had been some Muslim firing but said the "indiscriminate" Serb response was out of proportion. NATO ministers meeting Friday in Brussels ordered Bosnian Serb Forces to stop attacking the town immediately or face NATO air strikes. The Serbs, who have been attacking Gorazde since March 29, were warned to withdraw all forces three kilometer from the center of the city by the Sunday deadline, and 20 kilometer from the town by Wednesday. According to U.N. sources, about 700 people have been killed and more than 1,900 injured during the Serb offensive.
