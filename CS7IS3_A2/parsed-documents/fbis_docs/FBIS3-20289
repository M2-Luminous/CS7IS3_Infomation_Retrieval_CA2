In an interview with THE TIMES in west Belfast, the Sinn Fein president said Sinn Fein could not wait indefinitely for the Government to meet its demands. But he described December's Anglo-Irish declaration as a significant development which he hoped to incorporate into a wider peace process. Mr Adams, who was interviewed at Sinn Fein's office on the Falls Road in west Belfast, called on the Government to clarify the document in the way that it has for other parties. But he warned: "At some point of course we may exhaust that possibility and we may have to conclude reluctantly that because of Mr Major's leadership difficulties that he won't be able to engage with us. Then I think we will perhaps have to try to find other ways of moving forward." This would mean turning back to the agreement Mr Adams reached last year with John Hume, the leader of the SDLP. "We cannot allow the peace process to founder," Mr Adams said. "The lesson is that this peace process arose from the Irish initiatives. One would move back to that." Mr Adams, who was wearing the kind of smart suit which helped him to woo the American media during his trip to New York last month, said that he was perplexed by the Government's attitude to the peace process during the past few months. He said: "They seem to have stopped petrified in mid-leap. We are keen to explore whether the Downing Street declaration is a tremendous leap or whether it is a barricade the British Government has erected almost as a counter-offensive to the pressure coming from Ireland." Since John Major and Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, issued the Downing Street declaration last December, Mr Adams and other leading Republicans have been careful neither to accept nor reject the document. Mr Adams said yesterday that while Sinn Fein was encouraged by the peace process it was unhappy with the Unionist veto in the declaration and its assertion that Irish self-determination should be exercised separately on both sides of the border. "It is perfectly reasonable to say that we want London and Dublin to come to an agreement which involves all of us, and then as part of that to seek Unionist consent. But I think what is turning that on its head is to say that we cannot move unless we have Unionist consent." That would be akin, he said, to President de Klerk of South Africa refusing to agree to reforms without the consent of the far right. "Why should John Major stall on the basis of right-wing reaction in Ireland?" Mr Adams said. Unionists should be persuaded that their future lay in a united Ireland. "Why doesn't he try to move these people forward. I actually have confidence in the Unionists that in the new scenario they will be pragmatic and that they will seek to work out the best arrangement for themselves." Mr Adams said that Britain had no right to interfere in Irish self-determination, and Sinn Fein would continue to boycott any border polls to decide the future of Northern Ireland. But he added: "It's remarkable that the British Government has taken all these hundreds of years to admit that the people of Ireland are a nation."
