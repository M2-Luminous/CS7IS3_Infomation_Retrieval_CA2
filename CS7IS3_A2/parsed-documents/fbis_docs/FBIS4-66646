In Cologne, AL-HAWADITH interviewed him about developments in the Iranian situation, following the events of Zahedan, the attempted assassination of President Rafsanjani, and about his position as a religious personage from Qom. He answered the questions, and expects difficult times for Iran, because of an unprecedented economic crisis that is hitting the poor classes and causing them to take to the streets. The interview with Ayatollah Rouhani continued in Bonn, which is the last stop on his tour. He did not want to go into questions of religious authority, perhaps because one of his two brothers, Mohammad Rouhani, is a religious scholar in Qom, who has his adherents and students. Through the tape of the interview, which runs more than two hours, a true picture emerges of the many Iranian difficulties. [Murtada] What precisely happened in the city of Zahedan? Why the eruption? Is there any connection between this security convulsion and the assassination attempt against President Rafsanjani? Is overburdened Iran on the eve of a counterrevolution? [Rouhani] What occurred in Zahedan was a settling of scores between Sunnis and Shiites. The spark came at a border post with Pakistan, when a Revolution Guard member killed a Sunni clergyman on grounds that he had committed the crime of murder and fled to Rawalpindi. He was allowed no defense and the matter was dubious. The city's Sunnis became agitated; their movement was led by the son of the slain clergyman, Abdollah Shahinjashr. The regular forces intervened and supported the Shiites, who live in nearby Zabol. Matters developed and took on sectarian dimensions, since the Shiites of Zabol opposed the Sunnis of Zahedan. Revolution Guard units were immediately dispatched to restore order in Zahedan and put down the uprising. Many of their personnel were killed. Undoubtedly, the inhabitants were in a state of rebellion against the regime, which relies on weapons to impose its control. In the midst of this hubbub, President Rafsanjani was shot at. The attempt was one of a series and was not the first. The shooter was an officer of the Revolution Guard. He was not alone. About 50 suspects have been arrested on suspicion in that operation. Behind the events at home, Rafsanjani--at Friday prayers in Tehran University--said that the Americans and Israelis wanted to kill him. Security forces were deployed on a vast scale in many cities. Minister of Intelligence and Security, 'Ali Fallahian, personally took charge of the investigations into the assassination attempt against Rafsanjani. Besides Zahedan, there are at least three cities with a majority of Sunnis, whose inhabitants hate the regime. The most important of these cities, in addition to Zahedan, are the capital of the southern Baluchestan region, Hashtbar on the Caspian Sea, and Gonbd-e Kavus, near the border with Turkmenistan. Security forces, Basij (volunteers from among the oppressed), and Revolution Guard elements were deployed to suppress what appeared to be a Sunni intifadah against the Tehran regime. [Murtada] Are the Sunnis in Iran capable of convulsing the regime, which is controlled by Shiites? [Rouhani] Government estimates put the number of Iranian Sunnis at 7 million, i.e., 12 percent of the total population of 59 million. Sunnis live in the Baluchestan area, where they are the majority; the plains of Gorgan, on the border with Turkmenistan; and some areas of Gilan on the Caspian Sea, neighboring Azarbaijan. Iranian Kurds are Sunni, as are the Arabs in the oil-rich Khozestan region. The state's strategy is to prevent the rise of any Sunni to high office in the administration or governmental pyramid, as well as the Armed Forces, Revolution Guard, and state organizations. Sunni areas are generally poor. Their educational and social levels have been low since the Shah's time and have continued that way since Khomeyni. There are feelings of rebellion against the regime and its organizations, especially in light of attempts to force Sunnis to embrace Shiism and the Twelver School. The Iranian Constitution, whose drafting was supervised by Khomeyni himself, envisions no role for minorities in Iran. It asserts that Iran is a Shiite state, of the Ja'afari school. In 1979, a clause in this Constitution protecting the rights and private affairs of minorities was rejected. It was declared that Islam is the religion of the generality of the nation. It is no coincidence that we see widespread Sunni solidarity with Zahedan. [Murtada] However, Arab and foreign observers think that the degeneration of the Iranian situation in general, and the Zahedan uprising in particular, can be attributed to difficult living conditions and the collapse of the Iranian rial exchange rate vis-a-vis the dollar. [Rouhani] Living conditions are extremely difficult. They are the fuse for the explosions and acts of unrest in many cities. The middle classes are ground down by high prices. When President Rafsanjani tried to abolish the government subsidy on certain commodities, in accordance with the instructions from the International Bank, Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i was opposed. All of this coincides with a population explosion, inflation, and foreign debts, which have reached $30 billion. The amount spent on armament is unknown, but it is in the neighborhood of 4 billion [dollars] annually. All of these reasons result in semi-daily disturbances, which the regime controls by arms. However, it is unable to deal with the underlying causes. [Murtada] Has the crisis over Marja'iat [Supreme Source of Emulation] in Iran ended? Can the supreme leader, Khamene'i, become the Supreme Marja'? [Rouhani] In previous sermons, Ali Khamene'i has stated he is a moqalled [emulator] himself, not a Marja'. The rank of a Marja' requires at least 30 years of practice in teaching and writing books before one becomes the Supreme Marja'. From this perspective, it is impossible for Khamene'i to become the Marja', especially since he does not fulfill these conditions. [Murtada] Is Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah in Beirut, who is knowledgeable and spiritually influential, entitled to become the Marja'? Would it be incumbent upon him, therefore, to leave the southern suburb, in order to settle in Qom? [Rouhani] Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah studied under the Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Rouhani, who is my brother. He is considered a supreme Marja' now. He now lives in the holy city of Qom, which was his birthplace. Fadlallah is not entitled to be a supreme Marja', so long as his teacher is alive, and he is the Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Rouhani. [Murtada] What developments do you expect on the domestic political scene following the Zahedan incidents? [Rouhani] Generally, the situation is unstable; disturbances occur each day. Groups rise up against the regime. Killings happen, and citizens are detained. From this perspective, Iran is atop a volcano. I see a civil war coming in two or three years. This is what the West doesn't understand. The socioeconomic situation is difficult. Unemployment is a time bomb, because it affects more than half the labor force. The government cannot do anything with regard to the situation. In the Shah's days, Iran's oil profits were about $50 billion each year. The Shah ruled Iran for 37 years and came to power 12 years before Mosadeq, i.e., 1320H in the Iranian solar calendar (1941). Mosadeq fell in 1333H (1953). The Shah continued in power for 25 years after Mosadeq. During his reign, oil profits were in the range of $50 billion per year. Iran's population was around 35 million. Today, oil profits are $12 billion a year, while the population is around $60 million. In addition to this large gap, wealth, capitalists, and experts have fled abroad. Major factories are either destroyed, or their owners have taken their funds to the West. The country went through eight years of war. I should mention that Rafsanjani revealed dreadful numbers after the war. He said that 25,000 cities, towns, and hamlets were destroyed with, at least, one-half million persons killed. Now, their families are a burden on the state. This government does not inspire confidence. It vacillates before problems that remain unsolved. I am a proponent of the dollar model. In the Shah's time, for example, I did not praise it. Everyone knows that I opposed it. The dollar was equal to six tomans while, today, it is the equivalent of 150 tomans. This is a large disparity in the rate of exchange, and means the state's economic structure is in ruins. In these circumstances, no one trusts the regime that has gotten us into indebtedness to the choking point, with all the debt services and commitments. [Murtada] But, President Rafsanjani has showered promises to reform the situation on more than one occasion. [Rouhani] In my view, even if Rafsanjani wanted to do anything, he could not because, first, he doesn't know the mechanisms of the economy, nor does anyone in the government at this difficult and complex stage. Naturally, he can call for assistance from men of expertise and competence in the economic and political arena, but he does not trust them. In general, the regime does not trust Iranians abroad. Usually, they are specialists. Today we have about 100,000 specialists abroad. There are around 3 million exiles. Unfortunately, these capable people are absent from Iran, living in Europe or the United States. They don't trust the regime enough to return. Those who dared to return were unable to do anything. So they packed their bags and left the country again. They did not feel secure or safe. The regime did not inspire them with confidence. Moreover, the suspicion was mutual, and the upshot was Iran lost its capabilities. [Murtada] These days, many are talking about the second five-year plan to boost the country's economy. [Rouhani] Iranian five-year plans are pretty on paper; implementation is another story. The government has been incapable of applying what it plans for the last 15 years. The next month is worse than the last month. The past is prettier than the present. Today, we cannot say that Iran's situation in various fields and areas is better then yesterday. The entire regime is in a critical predicament, and its important men and prominent figures know that better than anyone else. [Murtada] In that case, how do you explain the arms expenditure. Is it unreal in any way? Why guns before bread and at its expense, as it appears from your reading of the situation? [Rouhani] The Shah's regime did not respect the citizens' freedom and gave not a fig for them. It feared foreigners, and the present regime is maintaining this shahinshah principle. It attaches no importance either to human rights, or to the United Nations, the so-called international community. The arms expenditures benefit a million armed men who protect the regime. The regular army numbers one-half million; the Pasdaran about 300,000; and the rest, i.e., 200,000, are police, security personnel, and secret police. This million forms the regime's power, and its financial weight pours into their palms. The regime's goal is to satisfy these elements and comply with their needs. There is a wall between the people and the regime. By chance, I asked one of my relatives who lives in Qom to bring me some Iranian bread, which we call "Sangak." It is good bread. I tell you that I cannot eat just one bite of it. It is black and flavorful. No one knows what it is made of. This bitter bread is eaten by 40 million Iranians. They eat it with cheese and milk. This is the life of Iranians today. The people are in mourning today, wandering aimlessly in misery. They are suffering from difficulties that appear impossible to solve. [Murtada] Do the president and the leader, that is Rafsanjani and Khamene'i, form one team, or does each one play his political game within the power structure? Are differences a natural occurrence, or are conflicts concealed? [Rouhani] Contrary to what some say regarding disputes and differences between the two men, although their points of view are different, I believe that they coalesce and are in accord. I have learned that in a recent leadership meeting in Tehran, Khamene'i called for alliance with Iraq, because it opposes the Americans and the West in general. In contrast, Rafsanjani called for openness to the West. However, the different viewpoint does not mean that the two men are quarreling. Each one has his opinion but, in the end, there will be complete and total agreement between them. Disagreement might lie in distribution of roles. Rafsanjani always concentrates in his speeches on the importance of relations with the West in order to safeguard the regime, while Khamene'i sees the opposite. He looks for reasons for the regime to stay in alliance with the weak, with states outside the West's influence. However, the two do agree on the principle of division of power. One is president of the republic; the other is leader of the revolution. The regime is based on the principle of division. [Murtada] Where do "conciliation" efforts between Washington and Tehran stand? Why hasn't normalization occurred, despite Rafsanjani's desire for normal relations? Why hasn't the West supported his efforts, so long as he is a counter-revolutionary Trotsky? Is it true that Washington considers him a part of the regime that it cannot trust in whole or part? [Rouhani] The readings and analyses vary in this regard. I am sure that the Americans do not trust the Iranian regime, nor its leading figures. Therefore, they ignore it, although they have not granted it a respite. It seems to me from meetings with Western officials that they are in no hurry to have normal relations with the Iranian regime. They will impose their conditions. The matter is no longer as it was in the past, during the time of the Soviet Union and the dual polarization. They are letting the Iranian regime chase after their heels and not the reverse. Khamene'i's anti-American slogans are mere words for internal consumption. In any event, the record is worn out. No one listens anymore, even those who once believed in its content. [Murtada] Is there any close relationship between you and the spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council, Hasan Rouhani? [Rouhani] There is no close relationship. Hasan Rouhani is from Semnan; I am from Qom. His father is a religious scholar, and he is also a religious scholar. His surname is "Alemi." He is the official spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council, which has 12 members, including Khamene'i, Rafsanjani, the Ministers of Interior and Security, and Ahmad Khomeyni. It is the highest political-military power in Iran and makes the major decisions on all levels. [Murtada] How could the situation develop in Iran in the near future, in light of the Zahedan challenges? [Rouhani] The situation might go from bad to worse. The regime is off balance and unstable. [Murtada] What is the alternative to the regime? The domestic opposition? The Abol-Hasan Bani Sadr wing in the regime? [Rouhani] The alternative might be a moderate Islamic regime, not the Islam that the present regime espouses. I mean a regime that respects principles of Islamic justice and freedom. One cannot offer hypotheses in this regard. The alternative is a regime composed of a supreme council, whose strength is 400 or 500 persons. This council elects a nucleus of 10 to 12 persons to rule the country. Free elections should then follow. Everything depends on the people's free choice and consciousness. They want tangible results. I am one who calls for free elections. This means finally turning the page of the Valay-e Faqih [Supreme Jurisprudent]. As a jurist, I believe that Vali-ye Faqih is not a religious principle, because it is a man's power over people. For example, how can a religious scholar who knows nothing about arms, military strategies, and the tactics of complex modern warfare, presume to build an army and determine its type of weaponry, in addition to its training? The same question also pertains to the economic structure. It is very complex and delicate. The cultural structure is no less complex for its part. Are financial issues simple? I believe that Velayat-e faqih died with Khomeyni and his legacy has been replaced by Vali-ye Amr [Guardian of the Muslim Cause], i.e., the ruler or sultan. Khamene'i, now, is Vali-ye Amr. As for the beiat [pledge of allegiance], that is claimed by Rafsanjani, the elected president. I think that all of this nomenclature touches the people's religious sensibilities and strives for religious legitimacy. The words and titles are pretty, but what is important is managing the country and the results achieved. [Murtada] Why dissolve the regular army? Why have attempts been unsuccessful to merge it with the Revolution Guard forces? [Rouhani] In a state like Iran, where all are subjects of Vali-ye Faqih and vali-ye Amr, there is no place for a regular army. These things must be done away with, before starting to rebuild regular military structures, seeking help from experts and technicians. The religious scholars should be excluded from this; they might be proficient in religious jurisprudence, but they don't know the requirements for a modern military structure. This separation is a must. [Murtada] Who is the Shiites' supreme Marja' today, after the death of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Golpaygani? [Rouhani] Grand Ayatollah Mohammad 'Ali Araki. He is over 100 years old. I know him personally, very well. I attended a study group with him, conducted by Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Khansari in Qom. Araki is a pious man, but he is reaching the end of his life, so that he no longer knows what is happening in Iran. One of my friends called on him last year to talk with him and get his views. My friend was astonished when Araki asked him about Imam Khomeyni's health. He believed that Araki didn't know that Khomeyni had been dead for five years. He apologized for the question. He said: "I didn't know that. May Khomeyni live with God in His Paradise." He was chosen the Shiites' supreme Marja' precisely because he doesn't know what's going on in the country, because there is the concern to maintain the regime, no matter the cost. Araki supports the Vali-ye Faqih, while others may reject it. Now, every grand ayatollah is in Qom. There is no longer one in holy Najaf. It is impossible for Khamene'i to become the supreme Marja', because this selection depends on the people and their faith. According to the Constitution, Khamene'i is the effective head of state. He has the final word in all political matters. Rafsanjani, in fact, is head of the Cabinet, with the title of president of the republic. Today, he is less influential than he used to be. Once he was a trusted advisor, close to Khomeyni. I think that this is the basic reason for the West's indifference vis-a-vis Rafsanjani, and his attempts at a policy of openness toward it. He is being held back by radicals. [Murtada] Why are Iranian-Gulf relations fluctuating warily, despite serious Gulf initiatives, based on a desire for good neighborliness. Then, the occupation of Abu Musa Island occurred to reveal an overt expansionism? [Rouhani] I think the Gulf states do not trust the Iranian regime. A climate of confidence is basic in good-neighbor relations. When I refer to the government in Iran it occurs to me, in the first place, that firm relations ought to be established with Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states. I can well understand Gulf wariness vis-a-vis the Tehran regime and its flip-flops. Abu Musa compounded this situation and, unfortunately, caused alienation. Words alone will not eliminate the suspicion and distrust. [Murtada] One last question. The Islamic Revolution came to power in 1979 and raised the slogan of just rule. Fifteen years later, we see that the abyss has deepened between the rich and the poor. That is what overthrew the Shah's regime. Does this gap, now, represent a main danger point against the ruling regime? Will history repeat itself, with another mark in Iran? [Rouhani] Rafsanjani himself admitted that the gap is growing between the haves and the have-nots, between the wealthy and the poor, which was the crux of the demonstrations against the Shah. Now, class tensions are rising on the eve of the 16th year of the Iranian Revolution. I think that this gap is a major danger point for the regime which, as I expect, will be subjected to major tremors even before the end of President Rafsanjani's second term in three years. The president is a candidate to be eliminated, since he is not affiliated with a well-known religious family, as is the case with the leader, Ali Khamene'i, who is the son of Ayatollah Javad Khamene'i and the nephew of Shaykh Mohammad Khiabani, leader of the Tabriz revolt during the Constitutional Revolution in Iran. Rafsanjani is from a small village called Bahreman in southern Iran. It is part of the city of Rafsanjan, in the Kerman Province. During the Shah's regime, he fled to Iraq and, then, to Syria and Lebanon, where he received assistance from Imam Musa al-Sadr. His wish was to transform the revolution into a state, but he immediately clashed with positions of power. As a result, he has backed off his project in favor of maintaining his seat in power. He is now completely in a semi-defensive condition. He has lost his gamble on economic reform. I am sure that his goal has been limited to continuing in power until the end of his term. He is no longer likely to introduce reforms into this situation, whose difficulties have apparently gone out of control, especially in light of the collapse of oil prices, the population numbers, the paucity of production, and the decline in the currency exchange rate. I see no light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, bitter bread or "sangak" has become the first concern that keeps various classes of society sleepless, and makes them take to the streets.
