The Seoul government had asked Beijing to use its influence in the matter, the source said, but North Korea's response was not known. Chinese Ambassador to Seoul Zhang Tingyan notified South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong that Beijing has asked Pyongyang not to replace the fuel rods at its 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon without IAEA supervision, the source said. North Korea has defied IAEA demands to be present during the refueling and to take samples of the spent rods, which could help the agency trace Pyongyang's nuclear activities since 1987 when the reactor is believed to have started operating. The agency has threatened to report North Korea to the UN Security Council unless these demands are met. Pyongyang offered May 6 to let the IAEA be present when the fuel rods are changed but would not allow the collection of any samples that might reveal past operations. Vice Foreign Minister Hong asked the Chinese ambassador to use his influence with North Korea about a week ago, the source said.
