The May 24 high-level meeting in Washington is intended to discuss the bilateral cooperation in the environment and other global areas, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, told a press conference. Both parties are uncertain whether or not they will touch on sectoral trade issues in the meeting, over which the framework talks became stalled, Kumano said. The framework talks have been deadlocked since the February meeting of then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The talks broke down when Tokyo rejected U.S. demands for Japan to introduce numerical targets in three priority fields of government procurement, insurance, and autos and auto parts, to measure American manufacturers' access to these markets. Global topics to be taken up at the coming Washington meeting for bilateral cooperation are also covered under the framework talks launched in July 1993.
