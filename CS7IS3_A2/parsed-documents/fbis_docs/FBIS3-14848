Speaking at a meeting with Russian and foreign journalists in Moscow on Monday, Kozyrev said that the Foreign Ministry is dealing with the Middle East "as much as with Bosnia. We maintain direct contacts with the PLO, Yasir 'Arafat and Israel." He said the Russian side plans to take constructive steps in the near future. Particularly, a special envoy of the Russian president, Igor Ivanov, will fly to the Middle East "within several hours," he added. As for "today's incident with the planes in Bosnia," "we have no information about their identification so far. All three warring factions have planes of which type. They were shot down in the area where fighting is going on between Croats and Moslems. But in any event this falls within the recently adopted U.N. Security Council resolutions which ensure the 'no-fly' zone ban, for which Russia had also called for," the Russian foreign minister said. Moscow is against using aviation. There is a proposal to ban the use of aviation in all was zones, Kozyrev stressed. He said Russia was one of the initiators of the resolution on 'no-fly' zones. "In this case we are for the resolution to be observed in the strictest possible way and any side which embarks on the path of their violation should be ready to face the severest consequences," he said. He emphasised that the recent events in Bosnia show that the way to peace in the region is not in escalation of violence and the use of aviation, but in political settlement. Kozyrev called for a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to discuss the "entire spectrum of problems." he said The idea has been discussed by telephone several times and now the sides are trying the set a convenient date. Touching upon the spy scandal in the United States, Kozyrev said that from the very beginning of the "spy history" the policy of President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian Government and the Foreign Ministry was aimed at avoiding the "politicisation or ideologisation" of the problem. The Russian side believes it "lies within the competence of the security services" of the two countries. "As far as I know, the services maintain regular contacts and are able to settle the issue on their own," Kozyrev said. "Unfortunately, the United States has expelled (Aleksandr) Lysenko who was an official representative of (Russian) intelligence bodies in Washington in accordance with an agreement between the governments of the two countries. Today the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was informed that the Russian side wants his American counterpart to leave the country," the Minister said. The Russian side did not want this. "We had to resort to this 'reciprocity,'" he added. He stressed that both countries should do away with this practice "the sooner, the better." Kozyrev believes the incident will not affect U.S.-Russian relations.
