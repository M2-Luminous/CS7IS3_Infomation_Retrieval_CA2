The document must now be countersigned by the respective chiefs of state and government in July. Tonight, the foreign ministers signed a document establishing the framework of the ACS, which will be an organization of consultation, joint efforts, and cooperation aimed at promoting expanded economic trade and investment projects. Among the countries joining the ACS are members of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. The presidents meeting that will ratify the ACS shaping document will be held 24 July in a yet-to-be-determined country, Foreign Ministry sources told AFP. In addition to promoting economic integration, the ACS proposes active and coordinated participation in multilateral forums, environmental protection, and conservation of regional natural resources, particularly in the Caribbean Sea. The ACS will have full members and observers, and its permanent organizations will include a Council of Ministers and a Secretariat. The Secretariat will be headed by a secretary general, who will be elected by the Council of Ministers every four years. Also, the Council of Ministers will establish a special fund designed to support technical cooperation and research programs. The document signed by the foreign ministers says: "None of the positions outlined in the current agreement should be interpreted as conflicting with the rights and obligations of the parties in regard to other agreements." The document adds that these positions will not affect "other existing mechanisms of cooperation, joint effort, and consultation."
