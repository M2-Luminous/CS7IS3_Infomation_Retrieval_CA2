In the statement, Pyongyang proposed to the United States that they hold talks in the near future to discuss signing a peace treaty for establishing a peace-guaranteeing system that will substitute the present Armistice Agreement between the two countries. Regarding this, station commentator (Srikov) writes: The Korean Armistice Agreement signed some 40 years ago is still valid. On 8 July 1953, the agreement was signed on the Korean peninsula. The war seemed to have ended, but it still continues today. The most bloody war ghost [kajang yuhyolchogin chonjaeng yuryong] ever since the days of World War II is wandering there. The DPRK Foreign Ministry's statement noted that the current situation of the Korean peninsula and the entire world requires the replacement of the present Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty between Pyongyang and Washington. We cannot help but agree to this. An armistice is different from durable peace. The present situation, which poses a danger of war in Korea, cannot be regarded as a normal situation. A military conflict [kunsajok punjaeng] can take place at any point, and it would not be limited to the Korean peninsula as it was not some 50 years ago. Therefore, we can totally welcome the DPRK proposal for replacing the armistice in Korea with real peace. However, there are many obstacles to overcome in the course toward peace. The commentator continues: The United States said that it reacted negatively to this proposal because the so-called nuclear plan of the DPRK was not clear. (Williams), a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State, said that the Washington-Pyongyang talks can be resumed only when it becomes possible for the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection team to conduct a close inspection of all nuclear facilities in the DPRK. Pyongyang is also insisting on holding direct talks with Washington, excluding the ROK. Of course, the need to replace the armistice with real peace in Korea has been (?discussed) since long ago because the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty would resolve a big issue in the world.
