While in Washington, Nazarbayev met leaders of some major international financial organisations. On Tuesday he received World Bank President Lewis Preston at Blair-House, the official residence of heads of state and government visiting Washington. Later in the day he met managing director of the International Monetary Fund Michel Camdessus. Nazarbayev also had talks with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown and First Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Roger Oltman. "Good relations are shaping up between the international financial organisations and Kazakhstan," Nazarbayev told ITAR-TASS. Thanks to the influence of the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury, representatives of Western donor-countries have decided to grant Kazakhstan financial aid amounting to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, thrice the expected sum. During the meeting with the U.S. secretary of commerce, the sides discussed the possibility of setting up a joint commercial-economic commission, which could be headed from the American side by the U.S. secretary of commerce, and from the Kazakh side -- by the minister for foreign economic relations. The talks with first deputy secretary of the treasury focused on the problem of expanding American aid to Kazakhstan. President Clinton announced on Monday that the United States would allocate to Kazakhstan 311 million U.S. dollars as compared to 91 million dollars last year. "I believe our relations will develop normally," Nazarbayev stressed. The Kazakh leader received later in the day James Baker, former U.S. secretary of state, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, prominent American political scientist and former presidential adviser on national security. Then Nazarbayev met representatives of U.S. science and the arts in one of the Washington hotels. He told them about the results of his talks and the agreements reached with the American administration. He also replied to questions, particularly on the situation in the region where Kazakhstan is located, on his country's relations with Russia, and on cooperation in space research. The Kazakh president called at the embassy of his country in the United States.
