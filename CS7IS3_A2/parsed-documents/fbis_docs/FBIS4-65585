Ataman told his weekly press conference that during his contacts in Moscow last week, Ambassador Bilgin Unan conveyed Turkey's views on the oil pipeline, which has been shut since the Gulf war. During his contacts, Unan told Russian officials that Turkey awaited Russia's understanding and support, in relation to measures foreseen to `save the pipeline', Ataman said. Russian officials said that they shared Turkey's concerns and were supporting Turkey in this matter. Turkey wants to drain the oil remaining in the pipeline since the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait and to repair the pipeline which is presently rotting away.
