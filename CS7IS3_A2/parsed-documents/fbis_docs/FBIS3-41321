Several foreigners have been arrested transporting drugs within Cuban territorial waters attempting to smuggle drugs into U.S. territory, which were later incinerated under official supervision. An example of the efficiency of the National Revolutionary Police in its fight against drugs is the case of a man in Havana City who was arrested for growing marijuana in his backyard. According to Detective Pablo Ibarra Martinez, Alejandro Valdes Friel from Cerro Municipality was arrested for growing 62 marijuana plants in his backyard and for the possession of 10 packages of the drug in his home. After being arrested, Valdes confessed that he had the plants for his own consumption. Investigators determined that he had been carrying out this activity for several years and had been previously arrested for the same crime. The suspect is currently in jail charged with the possession of toxic drugs. This crime can carry a sentence of from three to eight years in prison.
