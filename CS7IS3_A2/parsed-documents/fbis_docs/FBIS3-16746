Reliable sources told BASAPRESS that 160 million rubles were embezzled from the credits granted by the "Gagauzcombanc" to the economic entities and was later illegally invested in transactions. The budget of Gagauz Republic for 1994 was a problem of major dispute, because the localities densely inhabited by Gagauzians do not want to take part in its formation. The Gagauz government decided that the economic entities in this region should make allocations to the budget "within the necessary limits." Local observers say that the Republic became almost insolvent; it does not have budget sources.
