FR940527-1-00004 FR940527-1-00002 Discussion On August 13, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 93&hyph;16&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;8659 (58 FR 44441, August 23, 1993), to require initial and repetitive inspections of the propeller control unit (PCU) servo ballscrew internal spline (BIS) teeth for wear, and replacement, if necessary, of PCU servo BIS assemblies. That action was prompted by a report of an incident where the crew experienced difficulties in feathering and controlling the propeller blade angle. Investigation of the PCU servo BIS assembly revealed excessively worn spline teeth. That condition, if not corrected, could result in inability to control the propeller blade angle due to tooth wear in the PCU servo BIS assembly. Since the issuance of that AD, Hamilton Standard has developed a damper to be installed between the end of the ballscrew and the shoulder of the quill shaft. The damper preloads the quill against the retaining ring and eliminates axial motion between the quill and the ballscrew. This reduces vibration, enhances ballscrew lubrication, and results in an extension of the useful life of the BIS assembly. In addition, the manufacturer has issued revisions to the alert service bulletins (ASB) referenced in the current AD. The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of the following Hamilton Standard ASB's, all dated April 7, 1994: No. 14SF&hyph;61&hyph;A59, Revision 4; No. 14RF&hyph;9&hyph;61&hyph;A53, Revision 5; No. 14RF&hyph;19&hyph;61&hyph;A25, Revision 4; No. 14RF&hyph;21&hyph;61&hyph;A38, Revision 4; No. 247F&hyph;61&hyph;A3, Revision 3; and No. 6/5500/F&hyph;61&hyph;A11, Revision 4. These revisions enable affected propellers with a ballscrew quill damper installed in accordance with the following Hamilton Standard SB's to extend the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours time in service (TIS) since last inspection: No. 14SF&hyph;61&hyph;67, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994; No. 14RF&hyph;9&hyph;61&hyph;61, dated December 9, 1993; No. 14RF&hyph;19&hyph;61&hyph;29, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994; No. 14RF&hyph;21&hyph;61&hyph;48, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994; No. 247F&hyph;61&hyph;6, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994; and No. 6/5500/F&hyph;61&hyph;19, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;16&hyph;02 to increase the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours TIS since last inspection for propellers that have a ballscrew quill damper installed. There are approximately 2,506 propellers of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1150 propellers installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1.5 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, and on the average utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year equating to 4 inspections, the total cost impact of the proposed AD per inspection on U.S. operators is estimated to be $379,500. However, based on an average utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year, the proposed AD would eliminate 2.7 inspections per year per propeller, resulting in an approximate yearly cost savings to U.S. operators of $256,163. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended]
