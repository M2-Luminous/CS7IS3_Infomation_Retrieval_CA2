Stercken, who arrived in Ankara yesterday, met with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. In a statement he issued prior to the meeting, Stercken said that he himself does not believe in these claims and added that those who previously went to the southeast to carry out observations were biased. Stercken further added that those who maintained that German arms were being used against the population in southeast Anatolia were prejudiced and not interested in seeing Turkey live in peace. Cetin, in turn, said that Turkey and Germany have deep-rooted and multidimensional relations and added that the two countries should not be affected by the undesirable situations that may arise from time to time. Pointing out that Turkey is determined to resolve terrorism within the framework of democracy, human rights, and a state of law, Cetin said that terrorism is a significant threat to democracy.
