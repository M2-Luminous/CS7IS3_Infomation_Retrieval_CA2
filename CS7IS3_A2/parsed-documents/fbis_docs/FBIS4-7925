At a press conference after the government session, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the government had rejected a constitutional bill submitted by the Czech-Moravian Centrist Party (CMSS) "for being an attempt to split the Czech Republic into two parts," a Czech and a Moravian-Silesian part. The capital, Prague, would constitute its own division. "The government already rejected this idea in its statement of principles last October," Klaus said, adding that the bill conflicted with the government's already prepared bill. The second bill, a law on the budget and economic management of higher local administrative units, represented an "isolated, unsystematic approach in which the law on the economic management of these units would be passed before the units and their competence were defined," Klaus said.
