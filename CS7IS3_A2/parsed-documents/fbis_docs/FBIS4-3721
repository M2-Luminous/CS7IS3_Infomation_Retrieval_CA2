The Professional Committee of Nuclear Power Equipment, under the Shanghai Institute of Atomic Science and Technology, has recruited 265 individuals and 29 groups as members. The group members are large and medium-sized enterprises that make equipment for nuclear power stations, including the Shanghai Boiler Factory, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and the Shanghai No 1 Machine Tool Works. "The Professional Committee is expected to reinforce local academic research on civil nuclear energy and to supply local manufacturers with more advanced technology," said Wang Zurong, the committee's director. Wang is also managing director of the Shanghai Nuclear Power Office. Local manufacturers have seen the domestic market blossom as provinces like Liaoning, Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Guangdong are planning to build nuclear power stations. The committee's members are divided into seven smaller groups according to profession to facilitate their work, according to sources from the committee. "One of the most important groups in the committee is the QA (quality assurance) group. To all nuclear power station equipment suppliers, nuclear safety is the first consideration," Qian Huimin, secretary general of the committee, said in an interview. The city has invested nearly 200 million yuan ($23 million) in buildings for equipment suppliers and has loaned the local industry more than 13 million yuan ($1.5 million) for scientific and technological research. Another 200 million yuan will be used to technically renovate some 20 suppliers in the next two years, according to the Shanghai Nuclear Power Office. Shanghai plans to continue supplying equipment for the second phase of the Qinshan Project in Zhejiang and has contracted with Pakistan to build parts for a 300-megawatt nuclear power station.
