FR941020-0-00036 FR941020-0-00010 32 CFR Part 706 Certifications and Exemptions Under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972; Amendment AGENCY: Department of the Navy, DOD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined that USS HERON (MHC 52) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval minehunter coastal craft. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Commander K. P. McMahon, JAGC, U.S. Navy, Admiralty Counsel, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Navy Department, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400, Telephone number: (703) 325&hyph;9744. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 706. This amendment provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy, has certified that USS HERON (MHC 52) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS, Rule 27(f), pertaining to the display of all-round lights by a vessel engaged in mineclearance operations, and Annex I, paragraph 9(b), prescribing that all-round lights be located as not to be obscured by masts, topmasts or structures within angular sectors of more than six (6) degrees, without interfering with its special functions as a naval minehunter coastal craft. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the aforementioned lights are in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based on technical findings that the number and placement of lights on USS HERON (MHC 52) in a manner differently from that prescribed herein will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.
