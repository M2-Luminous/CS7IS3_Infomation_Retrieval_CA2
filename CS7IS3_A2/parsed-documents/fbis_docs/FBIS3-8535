After fierce artillery attacks, the chetniks have been attempting infantry breakthroughs in the Bandera-[word indistinct] region. The Doboj defenders are successfully resisting these attacks, which are still going on." Hajrudin Fermic reports from the Maglaj front that "after last night's massacre in the old part of Maglaj, when five civilians were killed and 13 injured, the chetniks are today trying to repeat this by suddenly shelling the town and by sniper fire (?in the north). Tanks, Bofors guns, and mortars have been used to attack at various intervals from the western and southern side. We have learned in the emergency ward that one person was wounded by a sniper today. The chetniks are also continuing their rapid concentration of manpower and deployment of armored vehicles and artillery." However, he adds, "the fighters of the 201th Brigade and their affiliated units stand ready to resist the offensive." Muhamed Mujic reports from Bihac that "the fierce Serbo-chetnik offensive continues today in the free part of the Bihac area. In addition to the defense lines of the 5th Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council, the regions of Bihac and Cazin have been targeted by all kinds of artillery and tanks. The most destructive grenades have today been falling on Bihac, especially on its industrial zone and suburbs. The chetniks showed their insolence and truly desperate motives with a frontal tank assault on the base of the French battalion in the center of Bihac last night. At 2140 [2040 GMT], tanks from the notorious aggressor's stronghold in Grabez suddenly opened fire on the French Battalion's base, which is clearly marked and has been there for over a year. Several shells hit the building in which the French soldiers are accommodated and one grenade landed in [word indistinct] where the vehicles are parked. One truck was completely destroyed in the powerful explosion while several vehicles have been damaged. Luckily, according to unofficial reports, none of the French soldiers was injured." Mujic adds here that "many people in Bihac wonder why NATO aircraft were not called in to help."
