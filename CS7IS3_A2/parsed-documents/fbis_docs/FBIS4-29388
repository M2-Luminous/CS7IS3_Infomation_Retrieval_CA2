FBIS4-29388 "dreas117__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-017-A Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Government Reportedly Preparing for Sanctions Government Reportedly Preparing for Sanctions OW1706140094 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1706140094 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Concerning the U.S.-proposed draft sanctions resolution of the UN Security Council [UNSC] to deal with the DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, a government official said: "Japan will be able to participate in the first phase of sanctions without amending current laws." He thus indicated the government is preparing for sanctions against North Korea. However, if the UNSC fails to adopt the resolution and if Japan, the United States, and South Korea should carry out sanctions independently, Japan will be placed in a difficult position over the issue of halting remittances to the DPRK, a measure included in the second phase of sanctions. Commenting on the U.S.-proposed resolution, a Foreign Ministry official said on 16 June: "If the situation remains as it is, less rigid (sanctions measures) will be adopted. Severer measures are unlikely. Also, the United States will not call for independent sanctions." He also indicated that unless Pyongyang orders International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to leave the country, or it begins procedures for its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), sanctions will be moderate. Even if the U.S.-proposed resolution is adopted, actual sanctions would be carried out after a one-month grace period. The sanctions would include a ban on arms export, and halting UN economic and development assistance. Concerning a ban on all air traffic except passenger flights, a Foreign Ministry source said: "Chartered flights might be affected by the ban. As for passenger flights, North Korea has not allowed them to fly into the country since May last year. Only cargo planes carrying matsutake mushrooms are allowed to stop by." The second phase would include a freeze on sending remittances to North Korea. To implement this measure, it is necessary for Japan to revise the Foreign Exchange Law. Article 16 of the law stipulates that Japan can suspend remittances "if it is necessary to faithfully fulfill the treaties and international agreements Japan concluded." But the Finance Ministry asserts that an agreement among only Japan, the United States, and the ROK does not provide sufficient reason for freezing remittances. It notes the need to have a UN resolution, saying: "If it is impossible to revise the law, the alternative to implement the freeze would be to have a UN resolution." The Foreign Exchange Law sets the limit of the amount of yen to be carried by a traveler to North Korea at 5 million yen. The Foreign Ministry has said it is possible to drastically lower this limit, and to halt remittances to the DPRK through Japanese financial institutions with the issuance of a ministry notice. But without a UN resolution, people going to North Korea via third countries, which do not participate in sanctions, could thwart the special measure. Without a UN resolution, sanctions would be less effective. This is the reason why Japan is reluctant to stop remittances.
