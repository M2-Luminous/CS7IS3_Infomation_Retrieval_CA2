FR940920-2-00054 FR940920-2-00027 II. Covered Facilities and Nature of Discharges A. Types of Discharges Authorized The proposed general permit will authorize the following discharges from exploratory offshore oil and gas operations: Drilling mud and drilling cuttings; deck drainage; sanitary wastes; domestic wastes; desalination unit wastes; blowout preventer fluid; boiler blowdown; fire control system test water; non-contact cooling water; uncontaminated ballast water; uncontaminated bilge water; excess cement slurry; mud, cuttings, and cement at the seafloor; and test fluids. Drilling muds and cuttings are the major pollutant sources discharged from exploratory operations. Further description of discharges are given in Part V below. When issued, the proposed general permit will establish effluent limitations, standards, prohibitions, and other conditions on the authorized discharges from the facilities covered. B. Types of Facilities Covered The general permit proposed today authorizes the discharge of specific operational wastewaters from offshore exploratory oil and gas operations located in federal and state waters. In order to be authorized to discharge under this permit, the operator of such exploratory operations must be registered with EPA as the NPDES permittee. Development and production operations are not covered by this general permit. Exploratory operations are defined as those operations involving the drilling of wells to determine the nature of potential hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration facilities covered by this general permit are included in the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category (40 CFR part 435, subpart A). Under the proposed permit, the number of wells from which discharges may occur is limited to a maximum of five at a single site. C. Areas Covered The area of coverage under previous general permits for offshore oil and gas activities in Alaska was linked directly to federal or state lease sales. For a variety of reasons, EPA is now planning to tie the area of coverage to MMS planning basins and all contiguous state waters. This method of defining the area of coverage will ensure that all areas likely to be leased during the term of this general permit will be covered. While the planning basins are generally larger than the specific sale areas offered for lease by MMS, discharges under this permit would occur in only those areas successfully leased. EPA believes that this is a more practicable way of addressing the area of coverage. Hence, areas covered by the proposed Arctic NPDES general permit include the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea planning basins as defined by MMS (U.S. Department of the Interior, 1992), and state waters contiguous to the landward boundary of the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea planning basins. The general permit does not authorize discharges into any wetlands adjacent to the territorial waters of Alaska or from facilities in the Onshore or Coastal Subcategories as defined in 40 CFR Part 435. III. Statutory Basis for Permit Conditions Sections 301(b), 304, 306, 307, 308, 401, 402, 403, and 501 of the Clean Water Act (The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987), 33 U.S.C. 1311, 1314 (b), (c), and (e), 1316, 1317, 1318 and 1361; 86 Stat. 816, Public Law 92&hyph;500; 91 Stat. 1567, Public Law 95&hyph;217; 101 Stat. 7, Public Law 100&hyph;4 (``the Act'' or ``CWA''), and the U.S. Coast Guard regulations (33 CFR Part 151), provide the basis for the permit conditions contained in the permit. The general requirements of these Sections fall into three categories, which are described below. A discussion of the basis for specific permit conditions follows in Section V of this fact sheet. A. Technology-Based Effluent Limitations 1. BPT Effluent Limitations The Act requires particular classes of industrial dischargers to meet effluent limitations established by EPA. EPA promulgated effluent limitations guidelines requiring Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available (BPT) for the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category (40 CFR part 435, subpart A) on April 13, 1979 (44 FR 22069). BPT effluent limitations guidelines require ``no discharge of free oil'' for discharges of deck drainage, drilling muds, drill cuttings, and well treatment fluids. This limitation requires that a discharge shall not cause a film or sheen upon or discoloration on the surface of the water or adjoining shorelines, or cause a sludge or emulsion to be deposited beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shorelines [40 CFR 435.11(d)]. The BPT guidelines for sanitary waste require that the concentration of chlorine be maintained as close to 1 milligrams/liter as possible in discharges from facilities housing ten or more persons. For facilities continuously staffed by nine or fewer persons or only intermittently staffed by any number of persons, the BPT guideline for sanitary waste require no discharge of floating solids. A ``no floating solids'' guideline also applies to domestic waste.
