FR940830-2-00141 FR940830-2-00057 Exhibit J Debit Card Directory; Chapter 2 POS Networks When banks began hooking up their automated teller machines to regional electronic-banking networks back in the 1970s, the eventual use of debit cards to buy things in stores was always uppermost in the minds of bank and network managers alike. That next step began in the early '80s. One of the first networks to introduce point-of-sale debit was Iowa's Shazam. In 1985, California's major banks created Interlink, skipping the ATM stage altogether and going straight to POS. Now at least 25 networks offer POS, and the brand identity, single card bases, and machine-sharing these regional systems bring to the product are helping fuel its remarkable growth. This is producing some notable success stories among the networks. The New Jersey-based NYCE network, whose POS program barely existed two years ago, is installing thousands of terminals a month in supermarkets and other retail locations. Result: a nearly 600% increase in monthly transactions in one year. These 25 networks offering POS, along with Maestro, MasterCard's national POS brand, are ranked here by transaction volume for June 1993, with details on each system's transactions, terminals, switch fees, cards, and merchant concentration. Interlink, with its massive programs with such merchants as Lucky and Arco, ranks number one, dwarfing second-ranked Explore, another California network. NYCE's big growth was enough to boost the network into the number 10 spot. Look for network mergers to thin these ranks, leading to perhaps 10 or so super-regional systems by the end of the decade. Fewer brands covering more cards, terminals, and territory should mean accelerated growth for POS. [Page irreproducible.
