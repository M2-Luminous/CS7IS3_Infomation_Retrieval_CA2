He stressed this odious crime will not go unpunished. 'Abbas Zaki told AL-DUSTUR this massacre is within the framework of the Israeli scheme to use terror operations similar to those committed in Dayr Yasin to empty Hebron of its inhabitants. He added: Not content with its crime in Hebron, the enemy tried to commit another massacre during prayer in a mosque in Sa'ir at noon yesterday. 'Abbas Zaki said: From this premise, we insist on removing these settlers and setting a timetable for dismantling the settlements. He said: The slogan should be the West Bank and Gaza first and not Gaza-Jericho first, and international legitimacy resolutions should be implemented. [passage omitted]
