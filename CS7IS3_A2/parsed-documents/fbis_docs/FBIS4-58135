We appreciate the efforts that you have put since you became a secretary of state in bringing about solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. You spent some days now in Cairo with President Mubarak, Chairman 'Arafat, our Foreign Minister Peres, and helped to bring about the beginning of the end of the negotiations about Gaza-Jericho First. I know that a date was set for the signing of the agreement, but there are still some issues to be negotiated, formulated, and be put in the draft -- not the draft, in the context of the agreement on which we will sign. I know that now you will go to other Arab countries, especially to Syria, in an effort to revive the peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. Israel is interested in achieving peace treaties with the three neighboring Arab countries, beyond the peace with Egypt. And we appreciate your efforts in bringing the Syrian and the Israeli positions closer, and I wish you all the success on your road to Damascus. [passage omitted] [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent in English regarding reports on a deal to offer Syria control over Golan Druze villages] [Rabin, in English] I do not believe that it will be advisable to me, before the secretary will go to Damascus, to discuss any details of what we brought before the secretary as our basic approach for the peace with Syria. [passage omitted] [Qol Yisra'el political correspondent Shlomo Raz] I understand that the meeting with Secretary Christopher focused on the Syrian issue. Were the Americans given any additional information that will facilitate expediting the negotiations with Syria? Has Israel presented more detailed plans or the scope of the withdrawal it is willing to carry out on the Golan Heights? [Rabin] Today, our main goal is to complete the work in Cairo in order to attain an agreed formulation of the Gaza-Jericho First accord. Such an agreement has not yet been fully drafted. Several problems which require examination and agreement still exist. The delegation headed by the deputy chief of staff will leave for Cairo on the morning of 1 May in the hope of wrapping everything up by the evening of 2 May. Several issues were left for a meeting I will hold with 'Arafat on 3 May. Those issues must be concluded in order to attain a complete and total agreement. A date was set, but there still are issues that need to be completed, agreed upon, and added to the formulation of the agreement. In fact, today we dealt with issues that concern the negotiations with the other Arab partners -- that is, the three neighboring Arab countries. Naturally, we dealt primarily with Syria. We also heard the secretary's briefing on the outcome of his meeting with King Husayn in London in the context of the resumption of the negotiations with Jordan. We presented the secretary with our stands in principle regarding our willingness and conditions for the attainment of peace with Syria. Do not expect me to give details, but the main principles of our stands are known, and I will not repeat them on this occasion. I believe that, in the absence of direct contacts, negotiations should be held through the secretary of state. He will relay our stands, and I will not do this through the media. [passage omitted] [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent] [Rabin] I presented a comprehensive concept which contains the nature of peace, the principle of withdrawal with which you are familiar from my previous declarations, the stages, reference to the implementation of each step, as well as several demands from the United States. I will provide no further details. [passage omitted]
