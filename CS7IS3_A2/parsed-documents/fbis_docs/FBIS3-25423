Verwoerd, the South African president who hardened apartheid in the 1960s, you are, at the age of 65, a leading figure of the Afrikaner resistance, after having been grand master of the secret society Afrikaner Broederbond for a long time. What do you think of the order to boycott the elections issued by your organization, the AVF [Afrikaner People's Front]? [Boschoff] I do not think participation in the elections is the main priority. What is important is to arrive at the establishment of an Afrikaner nation in the existing constitutional framework. [Sprang] You are one of those who are demanding the creation of an Afrikaner state. Why? [Boschoff] Because of the right of peoples to determine their own fate. We are a minority in this country. What chance do we have as European Whites to live in a state governed by Blacks? [Sprang] You think that Blacks and Whites cannot live together? [Boschoff] It is not a question of the color of the skin, but of culture. We do not speak the same language, we do not have the same way of living. I do not think that Africans can live like Whites. To live peacefully in this region, the Afrikaners must have an independent state which they govern, just like Botswana, where the Tswanas live; Lesotho, where the Suthus live; and Swaziland, where the Swazis live. You fought the Germans to remain Belgians or French. [Sprang] But there is nowhere in South Africa where the Afrikaners are in a majority.... [Boschoff] In the region around Orania where we have established the foundations of an Afrikaner community, in the Northern Cape, the density is two inhabitants per square kilometer. Moreover, historically, this region did not belong to anybody. [Sprang] But there are many coloreds there and, moreover, they speak Afrikaans, your language. [Boschoff] Yes, but they are increasingly inhabiting urban areas. It is perfectly possible to find a compromise with them to divide up areas. The important thing for an Afrikaner, for a Boer, is land. Next comes religion. We are strong Calvinists. [Sprang] However, the government and the ANC [African National Congress] do not seem prepared to divide up South Africa into ethnic territories, which was the basis of apartheid.... [Boschoff] It is not for Mr. Mandela to decide our future. It is impossible to deny the demands of a whole people. But these leaders must realize that the Afrikaners will never allow their nation to be led by Communists. [Sprang] What if the answer tomorrow is no. You are boycotting the elections, but what then? [Boschoff] We will take up arms. We have the power to paralyze this country.
