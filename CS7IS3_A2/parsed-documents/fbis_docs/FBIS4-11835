We also call for a comprehensive disarmament and a ban on nuclear, biological, and chemical tests so that humanity may stay free of any threat to its security and well-being, he added. Lt. Gen. Halabi noted that Egypt took it upon itself to promote peace in the Arab region after it had chosen a clear path. He noted that all parties must have equal faith in the need to achieve a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in our region to achieve a bright future and security for the region's peoples. He hoped that today's talks will lead to fruitful results as far as joint action is concerned to preserve security and stability in the region as well as in Europe. He added: Egypt's participation in the European security conference in Rome a few months ago was an indication of the role we could play in this regard. The talks dealt with all aspects of military cooperation between Egypt and German and ways of developing them.
