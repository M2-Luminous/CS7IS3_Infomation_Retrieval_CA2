The MoU was initialled here on Friday by Mr N.N. Vohra, the Union Home Secretary, on behalf of India and by Mr Wynn Lwin, the Ambassador of Myanmar. The signing ceremony took place in the presence of the Union Minister of State for Home, Mr P.M. Sayeed, and the Deputy Foreign Minister of Myanmar, Mr Nyunt Swe, who is currently visiting India as the head of a seven-member delegation of his country. The Foreign Secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, and India's Ambassador to Myanmar, Mr G. Parthasarthy, were also present at the signing ceremony. The two governments have agreed to take all necessary measures to prevent inadvertent violations of each other's territory by their security forces. They would also monitor and curb effectively all illegal and negative activities such as trans-border movement of insurgents, narco-traffickers and others involved in nafarious activities. Meetings between civilian border authorities would be held at the sectoral level on a quarterly basis, and at the national level on an annual basis. The government considers the MoU a positive step and intends to follow up on it quickly and effectively through certain well-considered initiatives. The MoU is motivated by the shared desire of the two governments to maintain good neighbourly relations and to set up an effective consultation mechanism for maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border. India shares a long boundary with Myanmar extending 1,643 km from Arunachal Pradesh to Mizoram. The terrain along the border belt is densely forested and consists of steep and high mountain ranges. The border is almost open and porous with numerous jungle routes, a fact that helps smugglers, drug-traffickers, insurgents and other trans-border criminals to pursue their illegal activities across the border. A border trade agreement was also concluded between the two countries on Friday. It was signed by Mr. Tejendra Khanna, the Commerce Secretary, on behalf of the Government of India and Mr U Nyunt Swe, on behalf of the Government of Myanmar, in the presence of the Minister of State for Commerce, Mr Kamaluddin Ahmed. Mr G. Parthasarathy and Dr J.K. Bagchi, the Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Commerce, were also present at the signing ceremony, besides the eight-member delegation from Myanmar. The agreement will be valid for two years and will come into force from a date to be mutually agreed upon by the two sides. It provides for border trade to be conducted initially through the Customs posts across Moreh in Manipur and Champai in Mizoram corresponding to Tamu and Hri on the Myanmar side. Trade under the agreement may be in freely convertible currencies or in currencies mutually agreed upon by the two countries, including counter-trade arrangements. Although in practice some form of border trade had been in operation, there had so far been no provision for formalised trade across the border with Myanmar. The agreement, which has been signed following approval given by the Cabinet in the recent past to the Commerce Ministry's proposal to formalise and facilitate border trade, will help in furthering the economic content in the relations between the two countries. It would also help in developing the infrastructure in the border States and increasing economic opportunities for people living there. The agreement will have to be followed by infrastructural arrangements required for the purpose, including the setting up of customary check-posts, banking facilities, etc.
