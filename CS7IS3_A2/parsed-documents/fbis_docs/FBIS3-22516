However, based on data from the National Survey of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors Related to Sexually Transmitted Diseases - HIV/AIDS Infection, there could be over 121,000 HIV carriers in Colombia. This investigation, the most extensive now available, was ordered by the Deputy Directorate of Health Services of the ISS [expansion not given] from Profamilia, and was based on interviews with 18,000 people. According to the report, "20.3 percent of the tests of men and 1.3 percent of the tests of women were positive. This means that, of the total population, 118,093 men and 3,538 women could be HIV-positive or what amounts to the same thing, 35 of each 10,000 inhabitants might be infected with the HIV virus. Minister of Health Juan Luis Londono de la Cuesta said this was a very high figure. According to the ministry's projections, there might be 50,000 HIV carriers in Colombia. As in other parts of the world, the official figures in Colombia are not very realistic, because of the enormous underreporting of AIDS. Although the figure is disturbing in itself, what is even worse is the Colombian population's profound ignorance about this disease. All the work done since June 1983, when the first case of AIDS in Colombia was found in Cartagena, has apparently not accomplished very much. According to this survey, 89 percent of the people interviewed said they knew what AIDS is, but when questioned in greater depth, it became apparent that the Colombian people know very little. For example, 54.5 percent did not have the slightest idea that AIDS was a fatal disease, and barely half knew that it is transmitted sexually. Only 2.7 percent knew that it can be transmitted through blood, and 1.8 percent that it can be transmitted perinatally (from the mother to the fetus). A significant percentage, 16 percent of the population, continues to believe that it afflicts homosexuals, prostitutes, bisexuals, and drug addicts; 5 percent said that it is a plague or a disease like cancer; 1.3 percent believe it is a new disease imported into Colombia; and 1 percent think it is caused by immorality. While 73 percent know there is still no cure for AIDS, 9.5 percent think there is a cure, and 18 percent do not know. Once again it was clear that in the area of sex education the youngest people and those with the highest educational levels are the best informed. I Am Immortal, I Am Not At Risk According to this investigation, 72 percent of the Colombian people do not think they are at risk for AIDS; 21 percent think they are at risk, and 7 percent do not know. Of people who have been sexually active, 23 percent of the men and 25 percent of the women think they have a high risk of contracting AIDS. Among persons who believe they are at risk, 4.6 percent of the men think it is because their partner was unfaithful; 3.6 percent because of their sexual practices; 7 percent because they have had casual sex with anybody; 1.4 percent because they needed a blood transfusion or blood products; and a small part because they have shared syringes, are at risk because of their job, or because they are in contact with items belonging to persons who are infected. Among the 20 percent of the women, 12 percent think they may be at risk because their partner was unfaithful; 0.4 percent because of their sexual practices; 0.4 percent because they have had casual sexual relations with anybody; and the rest because of blood transfusions, sharing syringes, because of their job, or from contact with items belonging to infected persons. "In urban areas there is believed to be a greater AIDS risk than in rural areas. In Antioquia and central Colombia, people think they have a higher risk, while in the east they believe they have a reduced risk," stated the investigation report. The people who believe they cannot be infected attribute this to being monogamous (42 percent); not having sexual relations (14 percent); and not engaging in high-risk practices (10 percent). "People who are not now in a stable relationship, young people who have not completed primary or secondary school, people in Antioquia, the central region, the Valle, Tolima, Huila, and Santander regions say they have engaged in high-risk behaviors." Fidelity, the Best Method Over half the population (53 percent) thinks that AIDS can be avoided by fidelity to a single partner, always using a condom (34 percent); not having casual relations (26 percent); not sharing syringes (13 percent), and requiring blood tests (11 percent). For 5 percent of the population, the best AIDS-prevention method is use of a method that never fails, abstinence. A little over half the women believe fidelity is the best way to prevent disease; 28 percent believe in using a condom; and 24 percent in not having casual sexual relations. Surprisingly, 17 percent think AIDS can be prevented by avoiding contact with infected persons. People under 45, those now in a stable relationship, and people with a higher level of education know the importance of fidelity, while younger people and those who are single or separated are aware of the need to use a condom. On the contrary, older and less well-educated people are the most fearful about contact with persons infected with the AIDS virus.

While 95.6 percent of the Colombian people know about condoms, only 5 percent of the population uses condoms. This contrasts with 34 percent of the people who mention using condoms as a method of preventing AIDS; it seems that when having sexual relations, they prefer a natural approach. One reason for this last-minute change may be that 35 percent of sexual relations take place under the influence of alcohol. It is surprising that the 84 percent of the women whose partners have used a condom at some time have used it as a contraceptive rather than as protection from disease. One factor that will be used in AIDS and STD prevention campaigns is that 92 percent of the adults in Colombia have had sexual relations (97 percent of the men and 88 percent of the women). The strange thing is that 91 percent of single men and 51 percent of single women have had sexual relations. Of people who have had casual sexual relations, 41 percent of the men and 49 percent of the women did not obtain information about their partner's sexual history.
