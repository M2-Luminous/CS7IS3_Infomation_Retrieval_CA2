The paper, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says in an analysis today that no matter how cunning those parties are, nobody will be convinced that Lebanon's problem is Iraq. Iraq, the paper maintains, has not been sharing the occupation of Lebanon with Israel for approximately 20 years. Nor has it been imposing on Lebanon its presidents, prime ministers, and Arab and foreign policies. Besides, the history of the Iraqi Army is not spoiled with the crimes of the invasion of Lebanon, nor has this army turned the Lebanese territory into a hotbed of terrorism, kidnappings, and extortion. Referring to the level and quality of Iraq's relations with Lebanon, the paper says that Iraq's extremely clean official and popular relations with Lebanon are known. They have always been based on respect for Lebanon's unity, sovereignty, and independent options. They have never advocated any tendencies that would harm the unity of the Lebanese people and territory. This is well known by all Lebanese.
