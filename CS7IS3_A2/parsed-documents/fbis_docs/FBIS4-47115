From the roundtable discussion held at the Union of Writers of Russia on the topic of "Current and Future Position of Russia in the Context of the Current and Future World Situation"] [Text] And nevertheless, this global society about which Aleksandr Zinovyev speaks, I believe, has not yet come to Russia. When it does come is a matter of time, that is clear. Russia is still a continent, still a civilization, such a country which, evidently, does not immediately lend itself to the onset of a global society. For some time to come, it will remain with its own psychology and with its own character. You say, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, that you are an observer, and we are participants, eyewitnesses. I will allow myself to disagree with the fact that you are an observer, if only because of the position which you take, even because of that pain with which you speak about what is going on in Russia. After all, your role here was a very important one. Important in that which happened with Russia, as well as in that which is now happening with Russia. In one of the interviews, I believe with a Polish journal given about a year ago, Vladimir Maksimov said goodby to Russia. This was painful to hear, because you have a better view of the state of affairs. You know the West better. You, knowing Russia, look at it as if through sober eyes, from the side. Sometimes it seems that we here cannot help but get accustomed to what is happening. We get bogged down in that situation in which it exists, and this hinders us from speaking and thinking in a rational manner. The situation really does press upon us, and to climb out from under it is very difficult. You, it would seem, have the opportunity to think independently. Yet I do not want to agree with you. Yes, the situation is desperate and difficult. But having the heart of a person living in Russia and being a Russian, I do not want to agree. Specifically because people are listening to our words. They want to know what we think. They are listening also to your word, and in this sense you are not supporting us. Perhaps it makes sense even to be cunning. Yes, to be cunning is the last thing we should do. Yet, almost contrary to our own opinion, we want to keep up hope in the people who are staying in Russia and fighting for it. Russia was quite recently a peasant country, by 80-90 percent. And the fact that it was a peasant country, that it had its own ideology, the peasant ideology, could not disappear right away. And it has not disappeared, but has become hidden under some other ideology. But it still lives inside the people. And perhaps, therein lies the hope... Today Russia, it seems to me, listens more not even to the patriotic press, but to common sense, which must ultimately prevail. Russia understands it better. Especially after the October events, when it is no longer necessary to convince anyone, when the instrument which was used to makes fools of us has fully exposed itself, fully shown itself. When one speaks with people somewhere in the remote areas, one sees that the people have gone on the defensive. They are digging in so as to survive for the time being. To survive, to withstand this terrible situation, and then to rise up with their attitude, in order to raise up their country. And it is this sense of self-preservation, it seems to me, that is being manifested in the fact that our man does not see himself outside of statehood. No matter how he might want to survive independently, nevertheless survival takes place within a certain group. These groups are expanding. They are becoming bigger and bigger. Our man is sufficiently literate to understand that if Russia perishes, he too will perish... Recent years were very important. They were frightening, but also important, because they were very educational. Our economic managers, directors of enterprises and kolkhozes [collective farms] and sovkhozes [soviet farms] have been through great universities--political, economic, and simply those of life. They now think quite differently. This was several years ago when we were still confused. Today this confusion has passed. Especially, I repeat, since October. Today the economic managers know what to do. And they are ready. And the people are also psychologically ready for what they will have to overcome. Then you say that everything is different now--civilization is different, obviously, the West is different. And this West will no longer tolerate Russia. The West "does not need the truth about Russia," as Ilyin said. It needs a falsehood about Russia which is convenient for it. But the very fact that the West is speaking out against Russia with such persistence, is trying to destroy it to the end, speaks of the fact that Russia nevertheless exists, in spite of the physical force and the economic force. It understands the power which it can be. It is the power about which Dostoyevskiy spoke in his "Notes From the Underground." This is not even power. It is something else, some twist, some "aberration", when a man, in spite of everything, does not agree with that which is beneficial for him, which is important for him, and acts in an unbeneficial way, in such a way as no one has ever acted. And this, perhaps, is specifically what will happen in Russia. Yes, we are being tempted by benefits. We are being tempted by Western life, and specifically because they are tempting us, the Russian man will act just the opposite. After all, just look, advertising is not very effective. Somewhere in Moscow, in the big cities, people take the bait. But in Russia, in its depths, that which is imposed evokes hatred and rejection. In a Siberian village they will not accept a product simply because it is being imposed upon them. In just this same way, those rules which are being imposed upon Russia cannot be accepted because they are being too strongly imposed. A Russian person always has a cautious and suspicious attitude toward something that is being imposed upon him. He has always been independent, and the "slave position" of our man is overly exaggerated. "Slavery under communism" was also overexaggerated. The Russian man has a mind of his own. He really was suppressed and confused, but now he is coming to his senses. And how he will show himself in another year or two, we still do not know. Yes, the time is coming when people are starting to not believe in anything. But when we turn our face in that direction (not to the West, but to the East), our attitude changes. During the time of discord, I believe, there were no theoretical conferences about patriotism, about statehood. People simply gathered in Nizhniy Novgorod, in Yaroslavl, and in other cities, and began giving money, began bringing themselves, their friends and their families to the ranks of the people's volunteer corps. And ultimately they sacrificed everything. I do not believe that all is lost. I do not believe it because I live among these Russian people. If we do not retain hope, then what is there to live for?
