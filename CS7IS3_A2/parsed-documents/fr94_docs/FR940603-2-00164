FR940603-2-00164 FR940603-2-00092 Priority 1 is an ADA informational materials dissemination project for architects and design professionals at the local, State, and regional levels that shall include the following major components: _Identify and compile specific materials that have been or are being developed by the Department of Justice, its grant recipients, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research's grant recipients, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board and other Federal agencies as appropriate that the applicant intends to publicize to the targeted populations; _Identify professional and trade organizations that serve architects and design professionals that have regional, state and local affiliations through which information and materials could be disseminated; _Identify professional and trade journals and other publications through which the availability of materials can be publicized at the local, State, and regional levels; _Establish size of target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of the project's activities; _Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including professionals serving racial and ethnic minority communities; _Develop a plan to effectively publicize and disseminate the availability of material available from Federal agencies and their grantees, utilizing, to the extent possible, existing dissemination mechanisms for architects and design professionals including professional and trade journals, regional and national conferences, etc. Such a plan should ensure that the dissemination of materials will continue after the grant period has ended; _Develop, reproduce and disseminate marketing materials such as pamphlets, flyers, articles, ad slicks or other products necessary to inform architects and design professionals of the availability of ADA materials; _Create articles on the requirements of the ADA for publication in media appropriate to target audience; _Coordinate with the Department to ensure that future new or updated materials will continue to be disseminated to professionals at the local level following the conclusion of the grant period; _Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate to what degree the project succeeded in meeting its stated objectives and reaching the targeted audience. Priority 2: Dissemination of ADA informational materials to building contractors, construction tradespeople, building inspectors and plan reviewers at the local, State, and regional levels . Building contractors, construction tradespeople, building inspectors and plan reviewers play an essential role in ensuring that new construction, additions, and alterations are accessible. Many smaller projects, particularly alterations, are accomplished by contractors and tradespeople without the use of architects or other design professionals. Business owners, State and local governments, service agencies and other ADA covered entities rely on the knowledge and expertise of builders to meet a myriad of needs, one of which is compliance with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design; and contractors and tradespeople rely on building inspectors and plan reviewers for advice and assistance in understanding and applying these rules. With access to educational materials and services, building contractors and skilled construction tradespeople at the local level can help business owners comply with the ADA and reduce claims of discrimination by people with disabilities based on inaccessible facilities or elements. Since the enactment of the ADA, a wealth of educational material on complying with the accessible design requirements has been developed by Federal agencies for use by entities and individuals with responsibilities and rights under the ADA and professionals who may provide services that will assist these groups in understanding and complying with the requirements of the Act. Examples of such information include the Department of Justice's ADA Standards for Accessible Design, and title II and III Technical Assistance Manuals; the Access Board's ADA Accessibility Guidelines Checklist and various Technical Assistance Bulletins (addressing accessibility topics such as detectable warnings, visual alarms, TTYs, slip-resistant surfaces and using ADAAG). Other materials have been produced through federally funded grant programs and examples include DOJ funded projects such as the American Hotel and Motel Association's Accommodating All Guests compliance manual, the Food Marketing Institute's ADA Starter Kit for Supermarkets and the ADA Compliance Manual for Supermarkets, and the National Restaurant Association's ADA: Answers for Foodservice Operators compliance manual and A Warm Welcome videotape on compliance for the food service industry. Examples of grants funded through the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) include numerous ADA Design Tech Sheets (illustrated technical materials addressing such topics as signage, areas of rescue assistance, accessible route, ATMs, curb ramps, ground and floor surfaces, etc.), and the Title II Action Guide for State and Local Governments.
