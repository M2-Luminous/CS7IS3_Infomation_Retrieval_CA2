FR940916-2-00102 FR940916-2-00082 If any participant of DTC becomes insolvent or DTC ceases to act on its behalf, DTC's existing RTS procedures will unwind all of the participant's Repo positions to eliminate any DTC obligations to automatically allocate future distributions created by past RTS transactions with the terminated participant (without affecting the courterparties' legal obligations of right with respect to the terminated participant). Before permitting a participant to voluntarily retire, DTC will verify that the retiring participant has closed out all its entitlements and obligations for future distributions created by past Repo instructions. The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, specifically with section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder because it facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by giving users of DTC's RTS the same degree of control over income on securities that they have outside DTC and by improving RTS users' access to information about their RTS obligations and entitlements. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition DTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. (C) Shelf-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others DTC developed the specific payment date RTS inhibition in response to participants' requests to add this flexibility to existing RTS. Under the existing RTS, returns of principal on securities that return principal in periodic payments until maturity, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), are paid to the repo sellers with the exception of the final payment at maturity. The final payment at maturity and redemption proceeds on other types of securities are paid to the repo buyers regardless of RTS status. In addition, a repo buyer may direct that all future distributions on a security be paid to it rather than the seller, consistent with the Master Repurchase Agreement of the Public Securities Association. However, participants perceived a need for specific single payment date RTS inhibition in cases such as when a CMO periodic payment before the final payment includes a principal component large enough to significantly affect the value of the collateral securing the repo. This can happen because of the volume of mortgage prepayments. For example, on a multi-tranche CMO a particular tranche might not be receiving any principal payments (with those payments allocated to earlier tranches), but then due to prepayments paying down the earlier tranches that tranche might suddenly receive a sizeable prepayment of principal. One participant reported incidents where the prepayment amounted to 50% or more of the value of the tranches. DTC's review of its records spotted numerous prepayments exceeding 10% of tranche value with some as high as 85%. Although the tranche remains outstanding, its value as repo collateral is dramatically decreased, and the repo buyer is exposed to significant credit risk until the mark-to-the-market payment is received. While a repo buyer faced with risk because of a large intermediate principal paydown could eliminate the risk by instructing DTC to redirect all future distributions on the CUSIP to the repo buyer instead of the repo seller, 5 such action would deprive both the repo buyer and the repo seller of the advantages of RTS for future distributions on the CUSIP. Participants thus requested a more restricted method of inhibiting an RTS payout. The proposed rule change was developed after a number of conference with participants. DTC received a written comment from the Dividend Division of the Securities Industry Association supporting the proposed amendment to Repo tracking. 6 5 For a detailed description of redirecting future distributions, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32395 (June 1, 1993), 58 FR 32162 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;92&hyph;18] (order approving rule changes relating to DTC's enhancement of its Repo Tracking System). 6 Letter from Stephen Hopkins, President, Dividend Division of Securities Industry Association, to Donald Donahue, Operator and Reorganization Officer, DTC (January 17, 1994). The software to support individual repo position memo accounts for each participant-counterparty combination was developed for stock loan income tracking, a proposed rule change that was filed separately. 7 Once the programming was done, it was cost-effective to import it into RTS to improve participants's access to RTS information. 7 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34218 (June 15, 1994), [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;07] (notice of filing of a proposed rule change relating to the establishment of the stock loan income-tracking system). III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4(e)(4) thereunder because it effects a change in an existing service of DTC that does not adversely affect the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of DTC or for which DTC is responsible and does not significantly affect the respective rights or obligations of DTC or its participants. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.
