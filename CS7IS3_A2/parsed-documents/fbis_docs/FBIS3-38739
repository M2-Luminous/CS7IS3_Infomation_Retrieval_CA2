The research, based on the new Euro-boundaries drawn up for the June elections, suggests that, on the latest polls published last week, Labour could take 57 seats, the Lib Dems three and the SNP [Scottish Nationalist Party]. The result would be a humiliation for the Conservative group in the European Parliament, reducing Tory representation to its smallest since Euro-elections began. One of the many casualties would be their leader, Sir Christopher Prout. The Lib Dems temper their analysis with a warning about the direction of the Green vote, which in 1989 reached nearly 15 percent but has subsequently collapsed. The Lib Dem survey suggests that Labour modesty about its prospects, after its successes in 1989, is misplaced. The Tories did badly in 1989, running a negative campaign, losing 13 seats and ending up with only 32 to Labour's 45. Overall, Labour polled 40.1 percent to the Tories 34.7 percent, with the Lib Dems on 6.1 percent. The Greens took 14.9 percent of the vote. This year, with the number of seats increased by six, the constituency boundaries have been redrawn throughout England and Wales, making straight comparisons with 1989 virtually impossible. Number crunchers at the Lib Dem headquarters argue that the best way of predicting the outcome this time round is through assessing the parties' respective shares of the general election vote in each of the redrawn Euro constituencies. The figures suggest that on the basis of the 1992 general election, the Tories would have won 51 Euro-seats in which Labour came second, and a further 15 in which the Lib Dems came second. Labour would have won 25 seats in England and Wales in addition to seven in Scotland. The tables show that 12 Euro-seats which would notionally have been held by the Tories on this basis are vulnerable to a swing of less than 5 percent from Tories to Labour, a further nine could go on a 10 percent swing and a further four if the swing matches the latest MORI poll finding of a 12 percent swing to Labour since 1992. The Lib Dems are clearly concentrating their efforts in the South-west and, on the basis of the 1992 elections, could take Somerset and North Devon on a 23 percent swing and Cornwall and West Plymouth on a 3.3 percent swing. Devon and East Plymouth falls to an 8.4 percent swing, Wight and Hampshire South to a 9.5 percent swing. Michael White adds. Conservative Euro-sceptics last night moved to hoist John Major by his antifederalist rhetoric when they urged the Prime Minister to go into the European elections with a cast-iron guarantee never to return to the Exchange Rate Mechanism or to enter a single European currency. Under the banner of restoring "national self-government" they urge the abolition of "European Citizenship," a smaller Brussels commission -- with no powers to initiate legislation -- and "depoliticisation" of the Luxembourg Court. Such talk will infuriate Britain's European partners. Reminding Mr Major that he wrote as recently as last September in the Economist that economic and monetary union now had "all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency," five young MPs in the Thatcherite No Turning Back group, led by lain Duncan Smith (Chingford) urge Mr Major to "set out an economic agenda that will be workable" instead.
