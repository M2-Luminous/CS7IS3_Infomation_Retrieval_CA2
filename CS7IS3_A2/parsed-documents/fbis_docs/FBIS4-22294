Karimov, by UzA [Uzbek Agency] correspondent A. Niyaziy: "The Generation's Health Is the Country's Wealth: Interview With Shavkat Karimov, Health Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan"] [Text] [Niyaziy] Shavkat Ibragimovich, it is completely obvious that an economic reform cannot have an effect on all spheres of social life. What effect on the nation's health is exerted by the economic reform being carried out in Uzbekistan --the changeover to a different system? [Karimov] Actually, during the period of the changeover to market relations it is impossible to take a superficial attitude toward the questions of the social protection of the workers. In essence, any reform is carried out for the good of the nation. For three years the economic reform has been carried out in the country. At the same time, as compared with other states in the Community, a lot has been done in our republic to improve the social protection of the population. Naturally, the question arises: how was it possible to achieve this in the complicated conditions of the changeover to market relations, when the economy frequently comes up against unforeseen difficulties? But the fact of the matter here is that, unlike many countries in the CIS, the social protection of the population in Uzbekistan has been elevated to the rank of state policy. It is precisely the need to carry out a strong social policy that stipulates one of the five basic principles of creating a new society in our country. That is why, for the last three years, that the health indicators in our republic have been rather good. Whereas the average life expectancy in 1991 in our republic was 69.3 years, in Russia it dropped from 69.6 to 66. Child mortality for each thousand newborn infants in Uzbekistan dropped from 37.3 in 1992 to 31.6 in 1993, and the death rate in childbirth dropped from 79 to 41.6. [Niyaziy] What do you think is the basic factor for the improvement in these indicators? [Karimov] This is achieved basically thanks to the concern that is shown and to the implementation of our President's edicts in this area and the "Soglom Avlod Uchun" state program. The goal of this program is clear-cut: in order for the future generation to grow up healthy, the children must be born healthy. And that will be possible when the mothers are healthy. This is the indisputable truth that constitutes the basic essence of the program. We carried out a preventive study of 5.1 million women. On the basis of the survey results they were grouped into three different groups. The first group includes healthy women who are capable of giving birth to healthy children -- as many as they want. The second consists of women who have been subjected to some kind of ailment. They must, first of all, restore their own health, and only then will they be able to give birth to a child under a physician's constant observation. But for the women in the third group it is recommended that they not give birth to children, inasmuch as they are suffering from serious, chronic ailments, and for them giving birth to a child would result in weakened descendants and would represent a danger for the mother's own health. Public health workers have been engaging very actively in improving the health of the women included in the second and third groups. As is attested to by science, the most favorable period for women to give birth is the age between 20 and 35 years. At that time, as a rule, healthy, capable, beautiful children are born. In addition, for the best possible development of the child, it is important for him to be nourished by his mother's milk. It is not accidental that 1993 was declared the "Year of Mother's Milk." In nature there is no product that is capable of replacing mother's milk. That is the medical side of the question, but there is also a moral side: as he takes in his mother's milk, he also absorbs love and all the higher feelings. That kind of child acquires an immunity to diseases and has a loving attitude toward his parents and to everyone else. It is for good reason that people say, "If a person's mind has not been nurtured on mother's milk, you cannot grow him on cow's milk." Therefore among our nation it used to be customary to breastfeed boys until the age of 30 months and girls until the age of 24 months. That idea has also been reflected in the "For a Healthy Population" program. In order to bring up a healthy generation it is necessary to have a healthy way of life. Therefore Uzbekistan is the only country in the world in which the "Soglom Avlod Uchun" Order has been established, and an international fund has created with the same name. As you might recall, our President's first edicts were aimed at protecting and strengthening the health of mother and child. Concern for the fate of future generations has been firmly stated in legislation and has been embodied in the free distribution of food products for pregnant women in low-income families. Our President has also promulgated an Edict dealing with the providing of medicines to pregnant women on a preferential basis. Unfortunately, in certain places these measures are not being carried out properly. I would like to emphasize that the state strives, to the best of its abilities, to support and strengthen every family. So if certain families, having forgotten their duty to the state, do not care about whether they are giving birth to a healthy child, are they raising that child correctly for society? Will today's infants be able in the future to become the best kind of citizens, and to multiply their Homeland's wealth? [Niyaziy] How do you evaluate the demographic situation in Uzbekistan? [Karimov] The population increase in the republic is stable. Every year something of the order of 700,000 children are born in our republic. The natural mortality rate constitutes 150,000 persons. Consequently, every year the population increases by an average of 500,000 persons. That is, the republic is growing younger from year to year. Currently 48 percent of the population is made up of young men and women below the age of 18 years. The future of our state will be determined specifically by these young people. At the same time, according to data that is available to us, in 1993 the level of the natural mortality in Russia increased from 12 to 15 percent. Consequently, the population decreased by approximately 800,000 persons. And, as the specialists attest, if extraordinary measures are not taken, this process can become worse and can lead a great power to serious consequences. In Uzbekistan the approach to this problem is completely defined. As I mentioned, before introducing market relations in our republic, the state policy on the social protection of the population was defined. Life confirms the correctness of the path that was chosen by Uzbekistan and reinforces one's faith that our republic will become a great state.
