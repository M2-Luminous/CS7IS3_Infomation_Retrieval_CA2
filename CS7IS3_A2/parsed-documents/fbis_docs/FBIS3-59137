On a tour of the Gioia del Colle Air Base in the southern Puglia region, where the Tornado Air Defense Variants will be based, Fabri said the decision to lease the warplanes from Britain was "the most logical and economical, the most correct and advantageous" move to round out Italy's air defense system. With reference to the Eurofighter 2000, to be built by a European consortium, Fabri stated, "we absolutely have not renounced" participation in this program. Air Force Chief of Staff General Adelchi Pillinini, who accompanied the defense chief here, along with the commanding officer of the Third Air Region, General Vincenzo Manca, discussed the "compatibility" between the Air Force modernization program and keeping F104 ASA interceptors in service. "I have no doubt about the possibility of using" the F104s now flying out of the Gioia del Colle Base "for another 15 years," said the general and affirmed that these warplanes still have 260,000 flying hours of life left in them. "Around 2010 we can replace them with the Eurofighter," he added. Pillinini reported that also under study are the G222 transport planes, still considered fully efficient by the Air Force, and the Hercules C130s, scheduled for overhauls after 20 years in service in line with a European modernization program. The defense minister said the reason for the tour here was to "check out the conditions of efficiency of this air base with the view to training for the use of the new interceptors," the Tornado ADVs. Now sharing the Gioia del Colle base are the F104s of the 12th squadron and the 156th squadron of Tornado fighter-bombers.
