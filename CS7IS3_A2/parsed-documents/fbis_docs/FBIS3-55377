This is taking place in conditions when the world community, including Russia, proposed real possibilities for the bloodless solution of disputed problems by peaceful means, the spokesman told a briefing in Moscow January 6. Karasin said that over the past two weeks the Azeri armed forces were fighting to liberate some of the republic's regions earlier captured by units of the Karabakh Armenians. There are widespread hostilities around Nagorno-Karabakh with heavy casualties. The spokesman drew the attention of journalists to the two sides' mutual accusations of responsibility for the resumption of fighting, shelling and new offensives. This is not infrequently close to manipulating the public opinion and non-critically reproduced by the media causing misinformation, said the diplomat. He believes the propagandist war only aggravates the profound mutual mistrust between the conflicting sides. The spokesman has voiced regret that Baku rejected the proposals of its Russian mediator put forward on December 16 and 20 on a temporary cease-fire which would create more favorable conditions for signing an agreements on ending hostilities.
