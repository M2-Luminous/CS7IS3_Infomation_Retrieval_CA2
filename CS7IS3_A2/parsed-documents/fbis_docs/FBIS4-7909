This crisis results in pushing for extremist and populist trends, Weiss added. "If a political party loses a program, it usually compensates it by turning to myths. One of them could be Slav solidarity and cooperation of Slav countries," Weiss said. Chairman of the ethnic Hungarian Christian Democrats Bela Bugar pointed to the apparent shift in the SNS strategy. The party's last electoral manifesto was unique [in] calling for the destruction of a common state of two Slav nations; now it is calling for the unification of the Slavs, Bugar argued. Slovak Radio broadcast a statement by SNS chairman Jan Slota today. Molnar travelled to Moscow as an observer and was not assigned to present a message, Slota said. Slota considers negative statements by leaders of other parties inadequate and stupid. At the congress Molnar said "five sentences" on the need of Slav solidarity, concluding that no Slavs would exist without Great Russia. Slota said he fully identified himself with this view. The SNS "has nothing in common" with the alleged invitation to Zhirinovskiy to Slovakia for April 16-19, Slota stated, adding that "if we are really such a democratic country as we are calling ourselves... I see no reason for wondering about Zhirinovskiy's visit".
