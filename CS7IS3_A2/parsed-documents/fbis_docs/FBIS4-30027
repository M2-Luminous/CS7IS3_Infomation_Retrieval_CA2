He answered many questions from our correspondents: [Correspondent] Dear Deputy Prime Minister, how do U.S. businessmen view the opportunities for doing business and investing in Vietnam? [Tran Duc Luong] The U.S. business circle has admitted that Vietnam, with a population of more than 72 million, is a large market. The country also has a favorable position as a country in a fast developing economic region. During previous years, the U.S. business community took the lead in demanding that the U.S. Government normalize relations with Vietnam. At present, U.S. companies are continuing to request the government to normalize relations with Vietnam as soon as possible and to grant it the most favored nation status so that they can have favorable conditions for doing business in Vietnam. [Correspondent] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, could you elaborate on the areas of great potential in cooperation between the U.S. and Vietnam? [Tran Duc Luong] The U.S. companies are paying keen interest in all projects to which Vietnam wants to attract foreign investment, especially projects related to oil and gas, telecommunications, and electronic and computer items. While U.S. industrial companies are paying keen interest in the Vietnamese market, various prestigious financial and banking agencies in the U.S. say they will send representatives to Vietnam soon. The eight Vietnamese businessmen who accompanied me had separate meetings with their U.S. counterparts and have reached initial agreement on some areas, including plans to export a large amount of rice to the U.S., the exploitation of oil and gas in Vietnam, and the opening of direct flights between the two countries. [Correspondent] Is the U.S. business sector raising any obstacles at all regarding doing business and investing in Vietnam? [Tran Duc Luong] In our meeting with U.S. businessmen, we presented both sides of our situation. We not only told them about the potential and prospects in the Vietnamese markets, but also frankly briefed them on the difficulties and restrictions in doing business in our country. For example, our infrastructure is poor, our legal system is not yet perfect, and our economic cadres and state management mechanism are not effective because we have not yet firmly grasped the functions and activities of the market economy. U.S. businessmen who have visited Vietnam understand the difficulties currently faced by our country. They said that these are immediate difficulties that Vietnam can overcome and then step by step improve and perfect the business and investment situation in the country. [Correspondent] What is your appraisal of the potential of Vietnam-U.S. relations? [Tran Duc Luong] In the past, the U.S. Government drew a road map for the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations and the U.S. Government has affirmed that it will continue with this road map. During our meetings with authorized U.S. officials, we asked whether the U.S. has a new road map or timetable for the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations, to which they answered that the two countries are advancing on the road to normal relations and toward the direction of building a good relationship and mutual understanding. I think that, strategically, both countries have realized that it is essential to establish normal relations so as to advance toward building a sincere friendship and cooperation in a constructive spirit. This is the unswerving and principled stand of both sides. In addition, both sides will hold more meetings in the near future to resolve various outstanding problems. [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister.
