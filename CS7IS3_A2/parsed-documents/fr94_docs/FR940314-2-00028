EFFECTIVE DATE: March 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen Grebasch or Erik Warga, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;3773 or (202) 482&hyph;0922, respectively. Initiation of Investigations: The Petitions On February 14, 1994, we received petitions filed in proper form by the Connecticut Steel Corp., Georgetown Steel Corp., Keystone Steel & Wire Co., North Star Steel Texas, Inc., Co-Raritan River Steel Co., and Northwestern Steel & Wire Co. (petitioners). At the request of the Department of Commerce (the Department), petitioners filed a supplement to the petitions to correct methodological errors and support the data presented. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioners allege that imports of steel wire rod (SWR) from Belgium and Germany are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Petitioners have stated that they have standing to file the petitions because they are interested parties, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petitions are filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to these investigations. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, these petitions, it should file a written notification with the Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential antidumping duty order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of the publication of this notice. The procedures and requirements are contained in 19 CFR 353.14. Scope of Investigations The products covered by these investigations are hot-rolled carbon steel and alloy steel wire rod, in coils, of approximately round cross section, between 0.20 and 0.75 inches in solid cross-sectional diameter. The following products are excluded from the scope of this investigation: •Steel wire rod 5.5 mm or less in diameter, with tensile strength greater than or equal to 1040 MPa, and the following chemical content, by weight: carbon greater than or equal to 0.79%, aluminum less than or equal to 0.005%, phosphorous plus sulfur less than or equal to 0.040%, and nitrogen less than or equal to 0.006%; •Free-machining steel containing, by weight, 0.03% or more of lead, 0.05% or more of bismuth, 0.08% or more of sulfur, more than 0.4% of phosphorus, more than 0.05% of selenium, and/or more than 0.01% of tellurium; •Stainless steel rods, tool steel rods, ball bearing steel rods, and deformed concrete reinforcing bars; and •Wire rod 7.9 to 18 mm in diameter, containing 0.48 to 0.73% carbon by weight, and having partial decarburization and seams no more than 0.075 mm in depth. The products under investigation are currently classifiable under subheadings 7213.31.3000, 7213.31.6000, 7213.39.0030, 7213.39.0090, 7213.41.3000, 7213.41.6000, 7213.49.0030, 7213.49.0090, 7213.50.0020, 7213.50.0040, 7213.50.0080, 7227.20.0000, and 7227.90.6050 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. United States Price and Foreign Market Value Belgium Petitioners based United States Price (USP) on competitive pricing information obtained through their own business activity and supported with affidavits. This information included delivered prices of SWR to unrelated U.S. customers. Petitioners calculated USP by subtracting movement charges (including U.S. customs duties), and adjusting for Belgian taxes. FMV was based on home market price quotes for identical merchandise, exclusive of value-added tax (VAT). Petitioners calculated FMV by subtracting movement charges, and converted the prices to U.S. dollars using contemporaneous exchange rates found in the U.S. Customs Bulletin. Petitioners made a circumstance of sale adjustment for differences in credit expenses. Petitioners also calculated the amount of VAT in accordance with the Department's methodology as discussed in Stainless Steel Wire Rod from France (58 FR 68865, December 29, 1993) (Final Determination) and added the resulting amount to both USP and FMV. Germany Petitioners based USP on competitive pricing information obtained through their own business activity and supported with affidavits. This information included delivered prices of SWR to unrelated U.S. customers. Petitioners calculated USP by subtracting movement charges (including U.S. customs duties), and adjusting for German taxes. FMV was based on home market price quotes for identical merchandise or, if non-identical, merchandise which would presumably have a lower cost of production (COP) than the U.S. merchandise, exclusive of value-added tax (VAT). Petitioners calculated FMV by subtracting movement charges, and converted the prices to U.S. dollars using contemporaneous exchange rates found in the U.S. Customs Bulletin. Petitioners made a circumstance of sale adjustment for differences in credit expenses. Petitioners also calculated the amount of VAT in accordance with the Department's methodology as discussed in Stainless Steel Wire Rod from France (58 FR 68865, December 29, 1993)(Final Determination) and added the resulting amount to both USP and FMV.
