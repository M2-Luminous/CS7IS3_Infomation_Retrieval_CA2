The committee put forward seven suggestions in light of the recent report on planning work by Minister of the State Planning Commission Mr Chen Jinghua. One of the main suggestions dealt with attempts to control the size of credit and the supply of money. Mr Liu said that China had increased its credit at a high speed in the past two years and had increased the issuing of money into circulation. If the government did not make up its mind to reduce the supply of money, a number of serious problems would be created unfavourable to stable economic development. The committee suggested that the banks should greatly improve their fund management and speed up capital flow, strictly restricting and striving to reduce the size of credit. It also suggested greatly strengthening macro-control, restricting investment in fixed assets and overgrowth in demand of consumer goods, developing the rural economy in an overall way, particularly in the production of grain, cotton, vegetable oils, meat, sugar and vegetables, strictly controlling prices for everyday needs, services and agricultural production means and cracking down firmly on criminal acts and misdemeanours involving speculation and the raising of prices. With regard to boosting economic results, Mr Liu said that China's economic results on the whole remained low with 30 percent of state-owned enterprises running at a loss. Social capital circulated slowly and the debt problem among enterprises was becoming increasingly serious. China, therefore, had to deepen reform and boost economic results while enterprises with serious losses must be declared bankrupt.
