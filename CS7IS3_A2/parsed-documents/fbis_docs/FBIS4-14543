Serious Battles in Latvian Parliament Over Ratification of Agreement on Russian Troop Withdrawal"] [Text] As you know, the Russian and Latvian state delegations initialed an agreement 15 March regarding the Russian troop withdrawal from this Baltic Republic before 31 August 1994. However, it will be extremely difficult to ratify this agreement in the Latvian parliament. Two of the Saeima's eight factions -- the Movement for National Independence and the "Fatherland and Freedom" Association, holding 21 out of 100 seats -- are taking a hard-line stance. Deputies from the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction are taking the most hard-line stance. They are proposing to poll citizens 29 May -- the day of the local self-government elections -- and find out their view of the demand that the Russian radar at Skrunde should cease to operate at the same time as the troop withdrawal (and not remain in the Republic for another four years' work followed by the 18 months allocated for it to be dismantled, as envisaged by the agreement initialed by the Russian and Latvian delegations). At first glance, there are more people in the Latvian parliament who are in favor of a civilized Russian troop withdrawal from the Republic, but the methods they are using in an endeavor to win public support evoke at the least perplexity. Thus, according to RIA, Ludis Pavilonis, deputy head of the Latvian Government office supervising the Russian Army withdrawal, speaking on national television, said that the pace of the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia has been appreciably stepped up of late. The RIA report also claimed, citing the Northwestern Group of Forces [NWGF] Press Center, that, owing to the success of the interstate talks and mindful of Latvian leaders' wishes, the command of the NWGF has allegedly found it possible to hand over to the Latvians by 1 April 1994 the military airfields at Tukums, Daugavpils, and Jekabpils, along with the Riga and Daugavpils aviation-engineering schools' stock. Actually, neither of these reports is accurate. I was told by Colonel Golin, head of the NWGF Press Center, that there is no question of the pace of the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia being speeded up, nor has the press center made any statements regarding actions of goodwill on the part of the NWGF command in connection with 1 April, if only because all these installations...have already been handed to the Latvians either prior to 1 March or during the first few days of March.... At the same time, the Latvian Government backed the package of agreements with Russia. As its 29 March statement indicates, the cabinet of ministers sees the speediest signing of the documents and their ratification by the Saeima as the "only real guarantee of the Russian troops being withdrawn from Latvian territory by 31 August this year."
