The faction believes that Andrejevs cannot occupy the ministerial post after having confessed to ties with the notorious Soviet security police, KGB. Kirsteins also approached the issue from the ethical viewpoint saying that Andrejevs cheated the parliament since deputy candidates vowed non-collaboration with foreign security structures before the 5th Saeima [parliament] elections. The Homeland and Freedom faction will give a vote of no confidence to Andrejevs because he formally violated the election law, its head Maris Grinblats said. Grinblats, however, praised Andrejevs for his confession and said that Andrejevs may be telling the truth when he claims his KGB ties were limited. The Equality of Rights faction will also vote to express no confidence to Andrejevs because his infringement of the election law could become a precedent for further irregularities, said faction Deputy Chairwoman Larisa Lavina. The Political Association of Economists deputies oppose the consideration of the issue before the decision of the court on Andrejevs KGB ties. The faction also considers that Andrejevs fitness to the post is in the government competence. The Democratic Party faction approved free vote on the issue, said its member Alfreds Cepanis.
