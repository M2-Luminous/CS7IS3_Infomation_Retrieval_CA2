The last IWC conference, held in Kyoto last May, decided to set up a working group to deal with the controversial proposal which sharply divided anti-and pro-whaling nations. Agency officials said the Norfolk Island meeting will be attended by representatives from 27 members of the 40-country commission, including Kazuo Shima, the agency's deputy director general. They said the results of discussions there will be reported at the next IWC meeting in Mexico on 23-27 May.
