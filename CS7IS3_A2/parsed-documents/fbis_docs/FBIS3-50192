So far the investigation has been in the hands of eight investigators of the Sofia Investigative Service and the NIS deputy chief who conducted all the necessary preliminary investigative proceedings. The persons directly involved in the incident, as well as senior police officers were interrogated. The weapons seized, including the armament found near the scene of the incident, were submitted for expert analysis, the press release says. In the meantime some of the witnesses have disclosed certain facts and circumstances which are being investigated through the press. Such statements are unwelcome, the NIS says in its release adding that it will make its findings public when the criminal proceedings are completed. As mass media reporters have been increasingly pressing senior officials and employees of the Sofia Directorate of the Interior for interviews in connection with the Belite Brezi incident, the Directorate has got to warn them that its employees will refrain from any public statements, the Sofia Directorate of the Interior points out in a press release today. It is stressed that the investigation and the disciplinary proceedings launched have not been completed yet.
