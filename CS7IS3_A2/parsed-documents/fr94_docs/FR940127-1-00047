FR940127-1-00047 FR940127-1-00013 The spruce-fir forest at the site harboring the Avery/Caldwell County, North Carolina, population of the spruce-fir moss spider has not experienced the degree of decline that has occurred (and is occurring) at the other sites known to support (or to have supported) populations of the spider. However, the same factors that are believed to have resulted in the decline of the spruce-fir forest and the associated loss of suitable moss-mat habitat at these other sites potentially threaten this population and its habitat at this site as well. B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes The spruce-fir moss spider is not currently known to be commercially valuable; however, because of its extreme rarity and uniqueness, it is conceivable that it could be sought by collectors. It is one of only two members of the genus Microhexura , it is the only representative of the primitive family Dipluridae in eastern North America, and it is one of the smallest of the world's ``tarantulas.'' While collecting or other intentional take is not presently identified as a factor contributing to the species' decline, the low numbers, slow reproductive rate, and extremely restricted range of the spruce-fir moss spider make it unlikely that the species could withstand even moderate collecting pressure. C. Disease or Predation It is presently unknown whether disease or predation have played a role in the decline of the spruce-fir moss spider. Further research is needed in this area. While predation is not thought to be a significant threat to a healthy population of the spruce-fir moss spider, it could limit the recovery of the species or contribute to the local extirpation of populations already depleted by other factors. Possible predators of the spruce-fir moss spider include pseudoscorpions, centipedes, and other spiders (Harp 1992). D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms Neither the State of North Carolina nor the State of Tennessee include arachnids on their lists of endangered and threatened species; therefore, the species is unprotected in both States. Federal listing would provide protection for the spruce-fir moss spider throughout its range by requiring Federal permits to take the species and by requiring Federal agencies to consult with the Service when activities they fund, authorize, or carry out may affect the species. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence Only one of the four remaining populations of this species appears stable. The other three surviving populations are extremely small, and all four populations are geographically isolated from one another. Therefore, the long-term genetic viability of these populations is in doubt. Also, the restricted range of each of the surviving populations makes them extremely vulnerable to extirpation from a single event or activity, such as a severe storm, fire, land-clearing or timbering operation, pesticide/herbicide application, etc. Because they are isolated from one another, natural repopulation of an extirpated population would be unlikely without human intervention. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the spruce-fir moss spider (Microhexura montivaga ) as an endangered species. The species has been greatly reduced in numbers throughout the majority of its historic range and presently is known to occur at only four locations. At two of these locations, only lone individuals_one at each location_have been observed in recent years; at a third location the species has undergone a rapid decline in numbers and is endangered by further habitat degradation/alteration. Only one of the remaining populations appears to be stable at this time, and it is potentially threatened by many of the same factors that are believed to have resulted in the extirpation or decline of the other historically known populations. Due to the species' history of population loss and decline and the extreme vulnerability of the surviving populations, endangered status appears to be appropriate for this species. Critical habitat is not being proposed for this species at this time for the reasons discussed below.
