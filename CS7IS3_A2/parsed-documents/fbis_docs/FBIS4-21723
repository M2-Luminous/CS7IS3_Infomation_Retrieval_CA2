According to reports, the explosive device was planted in the car driven by the mayor's son, Alexander Garcia, while it was parked outside the ``Casino Sampedrano,'' a nightclub located in the city's southeastern area. Garcia was with local politicians and businessmen. The police said the bomb exploded at 2255 (0455 GMT), and the individuals responsible left a note that read: ``So the rich can also suffer,'' attributed to the Human Rights Defense Committee (Codeh]. Mayor Garcia said ``there was no mishap.'' The blast damaged his car, but nobody was injured, although there were children nearby washing cars. He said the individuals responsible for the attack are trying to mislead the police by attributing the explosion to Codeh, because it is absurd to think an organization which defends human rights is involved in acts of terrorism. Garcia denied the attack had been aimed at him, and he expressed regretted that on the threshold of the 21st century certain groups believe in social violence. Colonel Jose Martinez, commander of the 105th Infantry Brigade stationed in San Pedro Sula, said several individuals who may have been involved in the attack were arrested. Garcia governs Honduras' second largest city located 242 km north of the country. [sentence as received] He took office last January following the Liberal Party's victory in the general elections of November 1983.
