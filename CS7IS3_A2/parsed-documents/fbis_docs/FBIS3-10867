In light of this intention to oversee the elections, six parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies have unanimously condemned this sham. Legislators of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the National Action Party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, the Popular Socialist Party, the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, and the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution have not hesitated to point out that "it is one thing to accept foreign observers -- because, whether or not we like it, the eyes of the world will be upon Mexico -- but it is another thing to accept meddling by another nation." The legislators' opposition to this move is legitimate. It is not possible to let the United States supervise our government, especially now that our government has made much progress in guaranteeing transparency in the elections. If the dependability of our electoral registry is as good or better than that of the U.S. electoral registry, if our election materials possess features that make them practically unforgeable, if steps have been taken to create a tribunal in charge of investigating electoral crimes, and if the presence of international observers is being permitted as long as these observers do not belong to or sympathize with any of Mexico's political parties, then any parallel vote-counting by another nation is unacceptable. What will be decided and done by the Mexicans can only be overseen by the Mexicans. With this in mind, the position of U.S. AID and the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee makes no sense. Here, however, the situation that is emerging could be similar to that created by Representative Torricelli, who, armed with the sword of xenophobia, has launched himself against Mexico on many occasions. This type of attitude cannot be tolerated from a country that claims, at least in its public pronouncements, that it is a friend of Mexico. Only two options are valid in the face of the sham being planned by AID and some members of the U.S. House of Representatives. One would be that the U.S. Congress recant and apologize to our Chamber of Deputies. The other is that the government of Bill Clinton allow the Mexicans to oversee the forthcoming U.S. elections in order that we may show the United States how to hold absolutely clean elections.
