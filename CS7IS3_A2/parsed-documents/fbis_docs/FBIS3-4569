Of all of the prefectural governments, 46 have already decided to start supplying the rice, with the sole exception of Chiba Prefecture which is expected to make a similar decision Monday, the KYODO NEWS SERVICE questionnaire showed. The survey also showed that the supply of such rice to consumers will lead to uniform rice prices across the nation and a 30 percent price fall from current levels. Responding to the survey, local governments said they have no choice but to provide imported rice as special standard-price rice so as to ensure a stable rice supply following the worst postwar harvest last year. The survey found that in almost all prefectures such rice will consist of 60 percent U.S. rice, 20 percent Chinese rice and the remaining 20 percent Thai rice. The rice will be priced at 316 yen per kilogram, including a 3 percent consumption tax. The Food Agency had instructed prefectural governments to start supplying special standard-price rice from March in the form of either 100 percent imported rice or a blend of 70 percent imported rice and 30 percent domestically produced rice.
