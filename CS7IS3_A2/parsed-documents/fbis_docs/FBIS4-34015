Congratulations on the summit's organization. What will happen with this summit in Cartagena de Indias? [Sanin] Good morning. We will continue declaring an all-out war on poverty. We are working so that the integration, trade, and all our social policies improve living conditions for most Colombians. [Rodriguez] [Words indistinct] in the last issue of the CAMBIO 16 publication, there is a report by Isaac (Deacon) on you, Minister Sanin. It is virtually being assumed that after 7 August, you will decide your future, and may decide to form your own political movement. Is there any truth to this? [Sanin] I have been so busy with preparing the summit, among other international commitments. After 7 August, I will decide what I will do. [Rodriguez] But you do not reject the possibility of becoming fully involved in politics? [Sanin] Why impose conditions on our lives? I will be wherever I can serve Colombia best. [Rodriguez] Following a brief diplomatic career, a one-year sabbatical.... [Sanin] I truly cannot tell you what I will do yet. However, I obviously must rest a little. [Rodriguez] We have heard that most heads of state are constantly encouraging you to become fully involved in politics. Will you heed their advice? [Sanin] I must think about it, but I reiterate: after 7 August. [Rodriguez] What is the leading aspect of this summit? [Sanin] The meeting of the 21 heads of state per se is a very significant event. Their commitment to promulgate social policies so that all these economic initiatives provide an answer to the everyday needs of the people is also crucial. This is so because any trade and integration efforts obviously lead to boosting economic growth, increasing jobs, greater opportunities for consumers regarding product prices and quality. However, the leading aspect is that we are waging a war on poverty. [Rodriguez] How have other Latin American nations received the integration and free trade agreement signed by the presidents of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela? [Sanin] They have received the signing of this agreement with enthusiasm and respect because it opens many opportunities for all -- more jobs and brighter economic prospects. The existence of equality and making sure that this process begins yielding results for Colombians are pivotal for us. This process will not generate immediate results, but those results will come. [Rodriguez] A constructive criticism that is raised with regard to summits is that they usually do not go beyond well-intentioned declarations because an organization or an executive body to implement them is missing. Could the Latin American Community of Nations become that body? What is your view in this regard? [Sanin] [Words indistinct] of the Ibero-American community. Yesterday, I submitted a proposal to the foreign ministers on creating a follow-up mechanism for all cooperation plans and political agreements advanced by the presidents and heads of state. We will meet on 6 August, the eve of the inauguration of the incoming Colombian president, to determine the nature of this mechanism and the follow-up instruments for all education and health plans and the various agreements achieved during this summit. However, all the political agreements and all the prospects resulting from this summit in themselves are very important. This forum possibly gathers the largest number of heads of state. [Rodriguez] President Gaviria will inaugurate the summit at 0900. How long will his speech last? [Sanin] I cannot squeal on [chivear] the president because I would be risking my job. Let us wait to hear it. [Rodriguez] Speaking about the president, in that magazine report, you called yourself a Gavirist conservative. What does that mean? [Sanin] It means that I am committed to this phase of changes, these radical changes, this new country Colombians have built under President Gaviria's lead. [Rodriguez] Does it mean isolation from other factions of the Conservative Party? [Sanin] No. What is currently happening is that politics is being viewed from a new perspective and a new situation. There is a different attitude and a different manner of conducting it. Beyond being only a conservative or a liberal, I truly admire and have a total commitment to how President Gaviria conducts politics. [Rodriguez] Carlos Murcia in yesterday's issue of EL ESPECTADOR as well as CAMBIO 16, SEMANA, and CROMOS have suggested that you have a place in either Samper's or Pastrana's cabinet. Would you accept an offer from either Samper or Pastrana? [Sanin] Neither CROMOS nor SEMANA nor any of the best media you mentioned are entitled to make nominations. Therefore, let us take one step at a time, and let us see what happens.
