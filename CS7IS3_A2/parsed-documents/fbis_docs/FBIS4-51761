On 2 May, a high-ranking diplomatic source said: "Last weekend, North Korea told the IAEA that it was willing to accept additional inspections, including the taking of samples in the glove-box area and gamma mappings in the radiochemical laboratory, which it had not allowed during last March inspections." The source added: "North Korea has clarified the reason for this, saying it will accept additional inspections, inasmuch as the ROK has recently shown a flexible attitude by withdrawing the condition on the exchange of special envoys between the North and South--a precondition to the U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. The IAEA is discussing measures as to North Korea's acceptance of additional inspections."
