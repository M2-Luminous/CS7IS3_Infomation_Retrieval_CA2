Kovalenok under the rubric "Military Reform and Higher Educational Institutions": "Preserve and Augment Pedagogical-Science Potential"] [Text] A practical-science conference with the participation of representatives of a number of directorates of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense and the higher educational institutions of all branches of the armed forces of the Russian Federation was held in October of 1992 at the Air Forces Engineering Academy imeni Professor N.Ye. Zhukovskiy. Dissatisfaction with the current situation in the system of higher military education was distinctly heard in the papers and presentations. The contribution of higher educational science to resolving defense tasks in particular is being hindered by the sharp reduction in appropriations for its development and the lack of a streamlined mechanism for mutual relations between state budgetary and economically accountable structures, as well as the principles of financial and economic activity in the army and navy under conditions of cutbacks in the size of the armed forces and the transition to a market economy. The chief of the Air Forces Engineering Academy, Candidate of Military Sciences and Professor Colonel-General of Aviation V. Kovalenok, shares his thoughts on this problem. The results of the conference confirmed yet again that the military academies and leading higher educational institutions of the branches of the Armed Forces today should be considered centers supporting the unity of the educational and scientific processes in the training of specialists for the 21st century. Meanwhile, the rapid outflow of young and promising staffers and experienced instructors to commercial structures is taking place, and the aspiration of the trained cadres to serve only until they reach pension age is progressing, owing to their limited independence in creating and reforming the scientific- educational subunits, training and certifying pedagogical cadres and awarding them military ranks, as well as the lack of a flexible mechanism of material incentives for the labor of military scholars. The leadership of the Air Forces is taking certain steps in order to eliminate these causes. For example, specialists at a number of scientific-research institutions, in conjunction with representatives of our academy, are currently formulating a conceptual model for a unified system of training for engineering and scientific-pedagogical cadres for the Air Forces. A leading place in that is relegated to the development of new educational programs and progressive training technologies. The academy, from the standpoint of the new requirements, is also engaged in the training of aviation engineers in seventeen fields and nine specialties, as well as doctors and candidates of sciences in doctoral studies, campus or off-campus graduate study and through dissertations. A rise in the qualifications of attendees in academic courses of study has been organized. Such intensive training of military cadres in many fields poses strict demands for the level of pedagogical mastery and scientific maturity of the professor and instructor personnel. I can assert with full confidence that the scientific-pedagogical potential of the academy (there are 96 doctors and more than 500 candidates of sciences today) by and large meets the behest of the times. And that is no accident, since we devote constant attention to augmenting it. The capacity of campus graduate studies alone is 235 places today. Some 199 doctors and 2,512 candidates of sciences have been trained since the time the academy was created. More than 400 people are working on their dissertations today, including 36 at the doctoral level. The subject matter of scientific works is aimed first and foremost at raising the combat readiness and quality of aviation engineering support for the combat operations of the Air Forces with a regard for trends in the development of the means of armed struggle, flight safety, reliability and combat survivability, reducing the detectability of aircraft and creating more effective weaponry, piloting, navigational and sighting systems and means of aerial reconnaissance and electronic warfare, including those founded on new principles and phenomena of physics. I would like to emphasize that improving the systems for training pedagogues and scholars at our academy is not an end in itself. The work in this area, after all, is oriented toward the end result--the high professionalism of the graduates and the pursuit of basic scientific research. The amount of that, by the way, has increased by one-and-a-half times compared to 1989. The solution of the problem of preserving and supplementing the scientific potential of the academy, at the same time, entails certain difficulties--as it does, by the way, at other higher educational institutions as well. This pertains first and foremost to the realization of the Statute on the Completion of Active Military Service, especially by highly skilled scholars. Statistics show that a pedagogue reaches the pinnacle of academic maturity at 45--50 years of age. And that is just the age when he is subject to discharge into the reserves. I cite as an example the fact that 25 (!) doctors of sciences who had served out the stipulated term left the walls of the academy in 1987 and 1988 alone. We must urgently seek out reserves and make up for the losses. We have been left standing this time. If the cutbacks in the army continue to proceed by treating everyone alike in the future as well, however, there soon will not be a single doctor of sciences left at the higher educational institutions. I think there is no need to say where that could lead. A maximum age for military service of 60 years for doctors of sciences and 55 for candidates must be established in this regard, in the opinion of participants in the conference, once and for all getting rid of the willful approach to the procedure for discharging them, allowing the academic councils of the higher educational institutions to determine independently the term of service of each leading scholar individually and shifting the positions of the professor and instructor personnel from the category of military to civilian and vice versa. Much could be resolved at the local level using internal resources. A program to replenish and further increase the scientific potential of the academy, which envisages the training of 5--10 doctors and 80--100 candidates of sciences every year, has been developed here and is now being realized. We are getting support for this undertaking from the leadership of the Air Forces. The commander-in-chief, with his sights set on the long term, has approved the range of dissertation topics through 1995, and approved a plan to equip the academy with models of new-generation aviation hardware and armaments and the unique equipment without which the process of training engineering personnel is inconceivable. Experience testifies that the replenishment of the scientific- pedagogical potential of the higher educational institutions takes place principally through the training of graduate students within their own walls. Taking this circumstance into account, and so as not to scatter manpower and resources, it would be worth concentrating this work, in my opinion, only at the military academies and leading higher educational institutions of the branches of the armed forces that have well- developed experimental bases and scientific schools as compared to other educational establishments of the Ministry of Defense, as well as expanding the rights of chiefs at the higher educational institutions to select worthy candidates in the ranks to be admitted to graduate study and to determine the times for the start of their study. The necessity of a comprehensive approach to strengthening the intellectual potential of the Air Forces furthermore suggests the expediency of instituting the standard positions of professor, docent and apprentice instructor at the higher educational institutions for servicemen, and academic secretaries of the specialized and academic councils at the academies. I think it would not be revealing any great secret if I were to mention the fact that the supervisory personnel of all the higher educational institutions without exception of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation will have to search for additional sources of material and technical support for the teaching process, under the conditions of sharp cutbacks in appropriations for the development of science, and in particular military science. Matters are still proceeding, frankly speaking, with some difficulty owing to a lack of experience. The necessity is thus arising of creating an economically accountable scientific-research center at every higher educational institution, the chief direction of the activity of which would be to choose the sale of the "scientific and technical products" of the higher educational institution and to obtain additional--I emphasize, extrabudgetary--funds for the further development of the educational and scientific bases, the resolution of problems of social protections for the personnel etc. Such a center should undoubtedly function within the context of stipulated legislation, under the monitoring of the command, the financial bodies of the educational institution and representatives of the scientific community. There is another problem of no small importance that was vividly revealed during the years of "restructuring" in the former USSR, and has remained topical for the armed forces of Russia today as well. I have in mind the drop in prestige of the military education of the youth. I am profoundly convinced that the necessity of certifying a number of the higher educational institutions of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, and first and foremost the military academies, has become acute within the process of reforming higher schooling. I feel that such a step would make it possible for them to become competitive not only within the state, but at the international level as well, and would ensure an appreciable influx to them of both Russians and foreign servicemen. The proposals that I have expressed must naturally be considered through the prism of the educational process of each higher educational institution separately. I hope that they will find reflection in the policy of military reform, and will help us to preserve and augment the scientific-pedagogical potential of the armed forces of the Russian Federation.
