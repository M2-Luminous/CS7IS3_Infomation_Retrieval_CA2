FR940603-2-00004 FR940603-2-00003 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Survey of American Indian and Alaska Native Government Administrative Records. Form Number(s): AIANAR. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 188 hours. Number of Respondents: 569. Avg Hours Per Response: 20 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Census Bureau plans to conduct the Survey of American Indian and Alaska Native Government Administrative Records as part of a program of research and development (R&D) to assist in formulating policy and design options for the Year 2000 Decennial Census. A major part of this R&D is the investigation of the potential of administrative records to improve coverage in the census. The use of American Indian and Alaska Native government administrative records has the potential to improve coverage by reducing the coverage differential on reservations and trust lands and improving coverage in Alaska Native villages. All Federally-recognized tribal governments will be contacted to provide information about their administrative records. The records themselves will not be obtained as part of the survey. Data collection for this survey will be conducted under contract by Westat, Inc. Information gathered in this survey will help to determine whether administrative records held by tribal governments would be effective in improving coverage in the Year 2000 Decennial Census. Affected Public: State or local governments. Frequency: One time only. Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Tach√©, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.
