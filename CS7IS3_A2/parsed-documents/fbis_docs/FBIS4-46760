Ryazhentsev, under the rubric "Looking to the Upcoming Session of the Republic Supreme Soviet": "Guarantees for Investors Are Guarantees of Success in Attracting Foreign Capital to Priority Sectors of the Uzbekistan Economy"] [Text] The draft Law on Foreign Investment and Guarantees for the Activity of Foreign Investors is being broadly discussed in Uzbekistan business circles. There is great interest in it. There is, of course, a Law on Foreign Investment in effect in our republic. What is new and different in the proposed draft law? This was the subject of our conversation with S. Kh. Abdurakhimov, chief of the Administration of Analysis and Expert Examination of Investment Plans of the National Bank of Foreign Economic Activity, and Sh. A. Ishankhodzhayeva, chief of the financial-economic analysis department of this institution. "If we provide reliable guarantees for the activities of foreign investors," says Saidakbar Khodzhiakbarovich, "then you can say that we will open up a broad way into our republic for foreign capital. There is a distinction here between the already-mentioned draft law and the present one. The draft law put the very important point about guarantees for the activity of foreign investors in a special heading. "To understand the essential features of the proposed draft law better it has to be viewed together with the other laws, draft laws, and governmental directives concerning questions of foreign investment in the economy. Above all I would like to recall the recent decree of the Cabinet of Ministers entitled 'Measures To Ensure Insurance Protection for Investments in the Republic of Uzbekistan,' under which the Uzbekinvest National Insurance Company is formed. Its assets will be placed in first-class foreign banks. This will provide a reliable guarantee of insurance coverage for foreign and domestic investments. "In the present state of the reforms it is especially important for this insurance company to cover political risks. Incidentally, it is precisely political stability that attracts foreign investors to our republic. The investor must be absolutely confident that he will be able to recover the capital invested in the matter with profit under any conditions, independent of the current political situation. For our partners, therefore, the formation of Uzbekinvest opens great prospects. A business can be promoted confidently, in complete safety. After all, although Uzbekinvest is a state company, its insurance fund can be used at the stipulated moment for insurance payments to investors at the decision of the supervisory council, formed of the managers of first-class banks in various countries. "In this way a reliable protective mechanism is created, a system to insure property against expropriation and also against any kind of administrative measures that harm the interests of investors." "It must be said," Shakhnoz Agzamovna Ishankhodzhayeva continues the conversation, "that the draft Law on Foreign Investment and Guarantees of the Activities of Foreign Investors gives clear definitions of the meaning of foreign borrowing and investment and a classification of foreign debts, government guarantees, and the like. And here is what I would like to note. During discussion of the most recent version of this draft law there were significantly fewer criticisms, which indicates good cooperation between the authors of the law and the consultants from interested departments. "For example, questions related to foreign investment are today regulated by a whole set of legislative acts. But there was no bankruptcy law. The investor, though, must know exactly the conditions under which an economic unit or natural person can be judged bankrupt on a legal basis. And here the draft Law on Bankruptcy proposed to the session has a definition of the elements of bankruptcy. Civil liability is stipulated for persons whose improper actions lead to bankruptcy. Thus, the draft laws submitted for the session are one more practical step by us on the path to creating a market economy. After all, the set of laws and draft laws that are already in effect are directed to creating favorable conditions for the production of export products that meet the highest world standards and to creating a protective mechanism for investors." Because the National Bank of Foreign Economic Activity specialists took an active part in preparing the draft laws on foreign investment, I asked them to talk about some of the specific details which, if it can be put this way, have created obstacles in practical affairs. And I learned that it was in fact the bank specialists who proposed creating conditions to increase the flow of cash for investment projects during the period of credit repayment. They consistently defend the need to create conditions for investors so that the profit norm in our country is better not only for foreign entrepreneurs but also for domestic ones.
