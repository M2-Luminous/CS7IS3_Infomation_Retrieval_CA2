At a news conference on security arrangements for the election, IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said it would be unrealistic to expect no intimidation or attempted disruptions on voting days. "But the security forces are alert and ready to deal with them," he said. SA Police Deputy Commissioner Gen Johan Swart said policing the elections would be the most significant and daunting task ever undertaken by the SAP [South African Police]. "I believe the police have the expertise and the motivation to take on this enormous responsibility. We realise the eyes of the world will be focused on South Africa. We will do everything in our power to ensure the elections will be a success." Each police region had a detailed plan in place and every policeman who would be on duty at the 9,000 polling stations had received special training. All available police reservists had been called up and 8,000 had responded. "We have placed the entire police force on full standby. We will engage 93,000 men and women for functional duties. In each police region we have appointed teams of top detectives to deal with intimidation, to investigate as quickly as possible and to bring perpertrators to book," said Gen Swart. Police would be assisted by thousands of traffic officers and civil defence agencies which were on full alert. "I wish to assure the public to remain calm. There is no cause for alarm or over-reaction. Security forces will maintain high visibility." Gen Swart said there were small groups considering disrupting the elections and he warned them they would be arrested and detained until after the elections. Police would do everything possible to refuse bail. "There are areas where we expect trouble. We will monitor these areas but we will not tell you where they are," he told journalists. SADF [South African Defense Force] Communications Chief Director Gen Gert Opperman said the army was committed to the process of change and would do everything in its power to contribute to free and fair elections next week. "We have called up members of part-time forces so that we have sufficient manpower. We appeal to employers, the men called up, their relatives and friends to support the call-up as it is in the national interest. Without them the SADF will not be able to perform its expected task." Tons of ballot papers had been stored at army bases and the air force would transport ballot papers to polling stations. Operational duties had been well planned in conjunction with the SAP. Troops would be deployed near polling stations and would also supply medical support. The army would deploy 67 companies and more troops were due to report for duty before April 27. Gen Opperman said he was not in a position to give the exact number. There would be flexible and mobile deployment making it unnecessary to have large numbers of troops at every polling station. The National Peacekeeping Force was not part of the SADF and would be disbanded soon after the election. The NPKF would be deployed on the East Rand in a support role. "We pride ourselves on our professionalism. We are above party politics. We do not choose sides and we will act against any individual who threatens the process regardless of political affiliations. We are from the nation and for the nation," Gen Opperman said. Mr Justice Kriegler said voters who brought firearms or other dangerous weapons to polling stations would be arrested."Contrary to perceptions, security forces will be entitled to carry arms and will do so at the polling stations. Police personnel will be present within the inner perimeter of polling stations and will at all times be under the direction of the presiding electoral officer at that polling station." Mr Justice Kriegler criticised a Sunday newspaper report headlined "Rough Ride on Big Day", which suggested continuous friction between the IEC and the SAP. "I met with editors on an off-the-record basis and I believed I could rely on the integrity of all those present. Clearly I was wrong. The report is untrue, malicious, not in the public interest, and is calculated to induce fear into the minds of the electorate." Asked for his hopes and fears for the election, Mr Justice Kriegler raised chuckles by repyling: "I hope it goes well and I fear that it won't."
