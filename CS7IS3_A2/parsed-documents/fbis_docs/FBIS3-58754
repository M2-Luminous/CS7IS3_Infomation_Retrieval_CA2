In spite of the cutbacks involving 5 billion German marks [DM] that were allocated to the individual ministries on Monday evening [17 January], all economic risks for the current fiscal year that are discernible at this point have been covered. Thus, there is no need for a supplementary budget from today's viewpoint. The data adopted in the 1994 budget are clearly "credible targets," even though they were discredited as "faked figures" by Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Rudolf Scharping, Waigel told journalists in Bonn on Tuesday. Scharping's assessment leaves him cold because it comes from a politician who has proven to be "not very competent" in the sphere of economics, Waigel stated. He believes the financial statement at the end of 1993 and the allocation of the DM5 billion cutbacks to the various ministries will create new confidence in Bonn's economic and financial policy. Thus, the government had succeeded in completely achieving the targets concerning the major data of the budget in the last fiscal year in spite of enormous national challenges. At a net borrowing of DM67.6 billion, the government has "impressively" refuted the SPD's claim that the debt will exceed DM80 billion. The preliminary results of the 1993 tax receipts are about DM2.25 billion higher than the calculations of the "tax estimation" working group, presented in November 1993. This is a surplus of DM1.5 billion for the government, which ensures a solid basis for the 1994 budget as far as receipts are concerned. Still, the Federal Government will continue its austerity course when drafting the 1995 budget, which will be adopted by the cabinet before the summer recess, despite the election campaign. Thus, Waigel plans to include the cutbacks involving DM5 billion, adopted at the recommendation of the Bundestag Budget Committee, in the 1995 draft, too, to induce the individual ministries to save as much as possible. Regarding the receipts of the 1994 budget, he proceeds from the premise that the tax receipts will nominally rise by approximately 4 percent, which was considered feasible by the annual 1994 economic report. Waigel pointed out that he has no other data than those of the economics minister. Thus, those politicians from the Free Democratic Party of Germany who regard a supplementary budget for 1994 even now unavoidable should first check with their colleague Rexrodt whether their demands are compatible with the economic situation, Waigel pointed out. The finance minister confirmed once more that, at DM1.25 billion, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has to carry out the largest cuts within the DM5 billion austerity package. It will not be easy for the Bundeswehr to handle that, and therefore a repetition is not possible. According to Waigel, the other cuts involving hundreds of millions will fall on the following ministries and areas: Transportation DM673 million, Berlin aid DM642 million, labor and social affairs DM500 million, the economy DM373 million, research and technology DM250 million, Interior Ministry DM200 million, agriculture DM187 million, development aid DM145 million, Finance Ministry DM129 million, and the Foreign Ministry approximately DM115 million. All other items in the budget are clearly below the DM100- million limit. Only housing has to save a larger sum -- DM80 million. The finance minister sees no need for political action concerning the DM2.6 billion that the compromise of the mediation committee on the austerity package cost. He believes that this sum can be compensated for by expenditure cuts or increased receipts before the end of the year. This also applies to the costs of the action program for growth and employment planned by the coalition. The SPD described the government's budget decisions as "insufficient patchwork." The budget is a "financial torso", its economic spokesman, Oskar Lafontaine, stated. He demanded the submission of an "honest supplementary budget."
