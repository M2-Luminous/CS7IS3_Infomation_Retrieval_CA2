The Mexican Government warns police-type measures are not appropriate to deal with a socioeconomic phenomenon such as the flow of immigration. Mexico expresses regret that these types of actions are being taken, because they deteriorate relations between the border areas and create a negative atmosphere between Mexico and the United States. We are concerned by the fact these types of measures are being taken as trade is reaching unprecedented levels and tends to rapidly increase following the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico cannot accept the argument that Mexican migrant workers are to blame for the creation of economic and social problems, which are not their fault, especially because these type of remarks are made to satisfy certain short-term electoral objectives. The Mexican Foreign Relations secretariat will be alert to any abuse or discriminations that may emerge once these U.S. Government measures are adopted against Mexican illegal aliens, the communique states.
