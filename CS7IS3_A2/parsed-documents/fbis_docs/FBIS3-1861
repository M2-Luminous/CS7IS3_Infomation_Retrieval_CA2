According to Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics Bureau (SSB), the value-added returns from the agricultural sector for the whole year amounted to 665 billion yuan, up 4 percent over the previous year. Statistics released by the SSB here today showed that among yields of major farm products, the output of grain and oil-bearing crops recorded an all-time high. A notable increase was also made in the production of vegetables and fruits. However, the output of cotton and sugar crops declined. The output of grain was 456.44 million tons in 1993, a 3.1 percent increase over the figure for 1992. The output of oil- bearing seeds was 17.61 million tons, up 7.3 percent compared with 1992. According to Zhang, new progress was made in forestry. The new afforested area in 1993 was 5.89 million hectares, with improved quality. The state key forestry projects made noticeable headway, and measures against forest fires and forest diseases were reinforced. Both the forest area and forest stock increased, resulting in a continued rise in the forest coverage rate. Animal husbandry developed steadily, and the production of meat, poultry, eggs and milk and the number of livestock continued to grow, Zhang said. The output of meat was 37.8 million tons in 1993, up 10.2 percent compared with the figure for 1992. Further improvement was made in the conditions for agricultural production, according to Zhang. By the end of 1993, the aggregate power of the country's farm machinery reached 318 million kilowatts, a growth of 4.8 percent over the figure at the end of the previous year. Rural consumption of electricity in 1993 was 125.3 billion kilowatt-hours, up 13.2 percent compared with that of 1992. Meanwhile, irrigation and water conservancy facilities in rural areas were further reinforced, with a newly added acreage of 924,670 hectares of farmland under effective irrigation systems. However, Zhang said, the unauthorized use of cultivated land for other purposes still prevails, thus posing a threat to the stable growth of agricultural production.
