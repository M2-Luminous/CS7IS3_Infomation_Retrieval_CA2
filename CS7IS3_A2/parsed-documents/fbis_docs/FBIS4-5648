Ozawa told a news conference that the coalition parties, in launching a new administration, need to narrow their difference over the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan's tax system reform, basic defense and foreign policies, as well as administrative reform combined with deregulation. Ozawa made the remarks a day after Shinseito head and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata emerged as the most probable successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation last Friday. Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, is regarded as the de facto top leader of the party. Social Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo is tipped to become chief cabinet secretary under Hata. Ozawa has been advocating a tougher stand over North Korea's refusal to let international monitors fully inspect its nuclear facilities. The SDP, the biggest party in the ruling coalition, has called for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue, rather than slapping economic sanctions on Pyongyang. The SDP has maintained friendly ties with North Korea and has sent goodwill delegations of its legislators there in the past.
