VINCENT & THE GRENADINES Vincentian-Registered Ships Carrying Marijuana, Hashish, Cocaine Uncovered 94WD0152A Kingstown THE VINCENTIAN in English 19 Nov 93 p 1 94WD0152A Kingstown THE VINCENTIAN Language: English Article Type:CSO [Text] Another ship said to be registered under the flag of St Vincent and the Grenadians, has been caught with drugs. According to a CANA report, Police in Britain say that they seized 2.7 tonnes of cannabis worth 6.5 million pounds sterling that were reportedly traced to the Vincentian registered ship. On Saturday 14th last, Customs officers assisted by the Navy arrested seven people including a woman on board the mothership Poseidon, a one-thousand tonne vessel registered in St Vincent, about 100 miles off the West Coast of Ireland. A Customs spokesman said then that a further 3 tonnes of cannabis is thought to be concealed aboard the Poseidon. Reports also say that some 18 people have been arrested in connection with this latest haul. Checks with the local Registrar of Shipping have not revealed that the ship is registered here. But in view of what Labour Party Leader Stalky John said recently in another case is the practice for frequent name changes to be made, this is not surprising. Further, the details of changes made at the office in Monaco are not sent on quickly to St Vincent for the local records to be updated. About a week ago a locally owned and registered ship was caught with cocaine in Grenada's waters. In August another Vincentian registered ship, the Alexandra was arrested in Canada with 30 tonnes of hashish.
