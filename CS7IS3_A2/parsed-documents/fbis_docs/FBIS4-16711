Our Sakhalin correspondent Lyudmila Filippova shares her impressions of this session. [Begin Recording] [Filippova] A session of deputies was held in the smaller hall of the oblast administration. Both the deputies of our oblast duma and their guests had plenty of space to themselves. This is hardly surprising, because there were only 12 deputies at the first session, just like the disciples of Christ -- 11 men and one woman. The first session of the first oblast duma was opened by Nikolay Svetkin, who is the director of Aleksandrovskiy pedagogical institute. He invited Viktor Kleptsov, chairman of the oblast election commission, to report on the results of elections to the oblast duma, which we actually already knew about -- the elections in election district No.1 in central Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk were announced void. In other words, there was no one to represent a significant number of voters from the center at the first session. You can see for yourself who sat at the duma session: Sergey Osimov from the Korsakov base of ocean fishing; Viktor Kudryavtsev who is also a fisherman -- director of Korsakov cannery; (Kim Pak Toki), chairman of Korsakov (Renbok Ltd.) joint stock company; Fedor Sidorenko, mayor of Dolinsk; Igor Revin, economist of Kholmsk Commercial Bank; Leonid Osipov, mayor of the town of Shakhtersk; Lyubov Shubina from Nevelsk, who temporarily does not work; Ivan Zhdakayev, whom we know through his activity as a deputy during the Soviet era, and who is now deputy director of the innovative Sakhalin Foundation and still lives in the Pervomayskiy settlement in Smirnykhovskiy Rayon; Nikolay Dochilov, a doctor from Uglegorsk; Yuriy Kuts, deputy director of Sakhalineftestroy company from Okha; and Valiula Maksutov, chief of exploration drilling from the Val settlement in Noglikskiy rayon. They all represent voters of Kholmskiy, Korsakov and, furthest of all, Tymovskiy electoral districts. Until reelection in election district No.1 which, as Kleptsov announced, will be taking place on 30 October -- although I think the deputies will consider this and might either speed up or delay the elections -- the deputies will decide on issues connected with legislative initiatives in our oblast. A representative of the oblast administration, namely Vice Governor Vladimir Shopoval, also came to congratulate the deputies. He remarked that the duma would be working under difficult conditions, with people tired from battles between the branches of power, and with worsening living standards as the background. I certainly agree with this, with the part about living standards. Only recently I saw an old woman in oblast center in Lenin Street. She leaned against a kiosk -- blackened mouth, haggard face -- and when she looked at me I thought this is how hunger looks; it is still hiding but it exists and quite possible may take to the streets. Therefore, it is still the ordinary citizens who suffer the most, and not everyone can take the adversity offered by the Russian leaders. Anatoliy Aksenov, former chairman of Oblast Soviet, also congratulated the deputies. He remarked that the Oblast Soviet deputies started with much fanfare four years ago, but ended rather sadly. However, the duma deputies enter their term modestly and under difficult conditions, so they might end up better too. The oblast administration has already prepared the mechanism for fruitful work. Boris Tretyak, member of the State Duma who recently arrived in Sakhalin, commented that he hoped for efficient cooperation between the State Duma and Sakhalin Oblast Duma. Only then will joint productive solutions to problems troubling the Sakhalin residents become possible. After presenting deputies' certificates and uttering plaudits, the duma went for a break. I approached Deputy Valiula Maksutov from the settlement of Val of the Noglikskiy Rayon. Could you share with us your ideas about the duma? What will it be able to do? [Maksutov] We came here to work, and our only goal is influencing the existing situation so as not only to liberalize it but to give it the chance to develop, and give the producers a chance to work. [Filippova] Will you work on a professional basis? [Maksutov] I can not say yet. [Filippova] You have not decided this for yourself yet? [Maksutov] It is not that I have not decided for myself. I represent the interests of northern regions; we will discuss it and act in a way that will benefit all voters whom we represent. In other words, we will discuss this question among ourselves. [Filippova] Is it a normal phenomenon that all issues pertaining to the oblast are decided by representatives of the outlying regions? [Maksutov] We have expressed the opinion that elections should be held earlier, maybe even in June. But I think we will have to take into consideration the lack of deputies from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. [Filippova] Our province has always felt discriminated against as compared to the oblast center in terms of finance, but today no one can influence your opinion. I think you are fairly independent now. This is a unique situation. [Maksutov] This is a normal situation, and it might even be good. What is bad is the fact that elections in the election district No.1 failed. Let me repeat that we have no intentions whatsoever of infringing upon the interests of those not present here today.
