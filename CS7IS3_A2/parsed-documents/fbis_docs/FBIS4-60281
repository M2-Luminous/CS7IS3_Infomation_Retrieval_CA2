The two Israelis were released a short while ago. The men are residents of the Na'ama settlement, who apparently went to Jericho to shop. The incident was reported to our correspondent in the territories Golan Yokhpaz today by residents of the Jordan Rift Valley. One of the men who was arrested is Arye Shahar, the security officer at Na'ama. Shahar managed to use his walkie-talkie to report that he and his friend had been detained and taken to the Palestinian police station in Jericho. Na'ama residents expressed great fury at what they called a flagrant violation of the Cairo agreement. The circumstances leading to the arrest of the two Israelis remain unclear, as does the reason for their release.
