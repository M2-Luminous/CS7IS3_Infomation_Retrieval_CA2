FR940728-0-00042 FR940728-0-00014 The public can conduct searches on the Copyright Office in-process systems (COINS) database through a public access terminal in the Records Maintenance Unit for the search fee of $20 per hour or fraction of an hour. This fee will remain unchanged. VI. Copying Fees We will continue to duplicate our records under the conditions detailed in the applicable regulatory provisions and offer use of photocopy equipment and microfilm printers for the public's use at the prevailing rates established by the Photoduplication Service of the Library of Congress, except for certain specialized services for which the rates are based on our operational costs ( e.g. color photocopying). Additional charges for specialized copying, for example audio cassette copying charges, are fixed by other divisions of the Library providing these services. All of these fees may be adjusted periodically. VII. Policy Decision on Refund of Excess Fees Automatic Refund Level Our practice until 1991 was automatically to refund excess fees of more than $5.00; amounts of $5.00 or less were not refunded unless specifically requested. In 1991 we changed the automatic refund policy to provide automatic refund for payments of $10.01 or more in excess of the statutory fee; 56 FR 7812 (Feb. 26, 1991). 37 CFR 201.6(c). We are now adjusting the level at which automatic refunds of overpayments will be made from $10.01 to $50.01; we will not refund amounts of $50 or less unless specifically requested. VIII. Administrative Processing Fee for Nonregistration Services In 1991, we determined that an administrative processing fee is authorized under section 708(a) of the Copyright Code to reflect the minimum administrative cost of responding to a request for a nonregistrative service, even if the service cannot be successfully completed. For example, a request is made for a certification of records and after a search by our staff, the file cannot be found. We need to charge an administrative fee for the search even though it is unsuccessful. Accordingly in 1991, we amended 37 CFR 201.6(c) to state that in making any refund of fees remitted for nonregistration services, we could first deduct our administrative cost. Our regulation permits us to charge a processing fee ``in an amount equivalent to one hour of the requested service, or the minimum fee set by statute for the service.'' 37 CFR 201.6(c). We will not make any change to this charge.
