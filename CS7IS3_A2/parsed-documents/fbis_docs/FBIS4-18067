Opposition parties claim that neither minister remains completely untainted by the scandal surrounding the disbanding of the IRT [Interregional Investigation Team] criminal investigation unit. The IRT, which operated in the provinces of North Holland and Utrecht between 1987 and the end of last year, was unfairly disbanded according to a report made public on Thursday [24 March]. According to the Netherlands national investigation unit, it was incorrect to claim that the special police unit was shut down owing to its "controversial methods," as Hirsch, on advice from the public prosecutor and the Amsterdam police, had reported to Parliament in January. In its report, the national investigation unit described the actions of the team as "well-considered, careful, and responsible." The national investigation unit believes the real reasons for disbanding the team to be the result of jealousy: The heads of the Amsterdam criminal investigation unit wanted to do away with the IRT as it could not accept its independence. Van Thijn, former mayor of Amsterdam, does not want to accept any resignations of senior members of the public prosecutor's office or the Amsterdam police. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers is of the same opinion. The liberal opposition parties, the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66], together with the Ecologist Left opposition, are demanding a full explanation of this police affair. "Seldom has the belief in the ability to successfully combat organized crime suffered such a blow," stated D66 spokesman Kohnstamm.
