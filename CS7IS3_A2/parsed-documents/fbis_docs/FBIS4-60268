FBIS4-60268 "drnes100_d_94005" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 17 May 1994 Libya BBC Coverage of Cairo Demonstration Criticized BBC Coverage of Cairo Demonstration Criticized LD1705213894 Tripoli Libyan Television Network in Arabic 1930 GMT 17 May 94 LD1705213894 Tripoli Libyan Television Network Arabic BFN [Text] The Arabic service of the BBC, which is subordinate to the British intelligence MI6, broadcast what it called a live coverage of confrontations which took place in Cairo between the security forces and the lawyers' bar association. It also broadcast hostile statements against the Egyptian Government. JANA Arab affairs editor commented on this flagrant intervention in Egypt's internal affairs and said: Through its Arabic-speaking service, which is subordinate to the English intelligence MI6, England continues the vilification campaign on the Arab countries seizing any opportunity and exploiting any internal incident to give vent to its anger and grudge on the Arab regimes. The editor expressed extreme astonishment at the Arab governments' silence over this continued audacity exercised by the English radio and other Western racist media which makes daily subject-matter of the news, commentaries, and analyses which harm the ruling Arab regimes. It seems that the BBC is reassured of the non-existence of a deterrent in the shadow of the Western governments' encouragement and the silence of the Arab regimes, while the situation changes completely when a news item is reported by Arab mass media. The editor concluded his comment by saying that the logic of things would be that we, the Arabs, accept what is being issued by us against one another as being an internal Arab affair, and entirely refuse the West's intervention and allegations.
