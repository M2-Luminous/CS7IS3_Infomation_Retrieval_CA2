The Russian defense minister also told the Russian television program Itogi that he talked for an hour on phone with his U.S. Counterpart William Perry after a meeting of defense ministers from the U.S., Britain, France and the Netherlands. "Fortunately, they listened to Russia," he said, adding he understood from the conversation that although the defense ministers hadn't made the last decision to deal with the situation after the midnight Sunday deadline, his impression was that there would be no immediate first-round air strike Monday. The ministers would resume their meeting Monday to look into the progress of heavy weapon withdrawal and the remaining arsenals that the Serb side had failed to pull out because of the heavy snowfalls, Grachev said. Meanwhile, he said, about 400 Russian peacekeepers had arrived in the Bosnia capital and would be deployed there. The Russian deployment was part of an agreement with the Bosnian Serbs, who in turn are lifting the siege of Sarajevo.
