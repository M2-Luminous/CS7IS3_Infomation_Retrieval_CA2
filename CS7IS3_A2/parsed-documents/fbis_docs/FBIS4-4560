The cellular phone trade agreement included a private-level accord between Motorola Inc. and the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation [Japan Mobile Communications Corporation] (IDO) and a separate government-to-government accord. IDO has committed itself to building many relay stations to expand its Motorola-system cellular telephone network, while the Japanese Government has pledged to "make the utmost efforts to support the completion of IDO's commitments." IDO is expected to receive financial assistance from its main shareholders, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Tokyo Electric Power Company. How did it come about that Japan "has lavished hospitality" on the United States by making the maximum concessions? "Ichiro Ozawa was the key man," a government source said. He confirmed that Ozawa was in constant contact with U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale to find some way out of the difficulty while the negotiations between the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative were making no progress. The explanation given by the government source was as follows: "Amid the disturbance caused by the announcement of a tax-reform plan to replace the 3-percent consumption tax with a 7-percent national welfare tax, Ozawa assured Ambassador Mondale that Japan will first carry out income tax cuts for three consecutive years and increase other taxes later. However in the end, it was definitely decided to limit the income tax cut to one year, and Ambassador Mondale was greatly embarrassed by Ozawa's misjudgment. So, Ozawa managed to square himself with Ambassador Mondale by paving the way for a major concession to the U.S. demand for comparable access to Japan's cellular telephone market." Some people advocate a contrary opinion, saying, "It is a total overestimation to think that Ozawa has such influence." Another government source disclosed that "What was decisive in this case was Toyota's intention, rather than Ozawa's." "Toyota, which is a major shareholder in the mobile phone company, feared that if Japan did not yield a single point in the cellular phone case, the friction in such sectors as automobiles and auto parts might increase when the bilateral trade framework negotiations resume. This is why the automaker has strongly pressured IDO into making the maximum concessions to the U.S. demand." In any case, everyone is of the same opinion that a "high-level political decision" occurred in the settling of the dispute. For the United States, the cellular phone accord means that the Japanese Government has guaranteed to the United States access to the Japanese market. This is no more than managed trade, and there is a good possibility that the United States might ask to spread the Motorola-type deal to other sectors. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has deplored the cellular phone agreement, saying, "Seen from a strategic point of view, Japan made a big mistake that will form a source for future trouble." What it says sounds right.
