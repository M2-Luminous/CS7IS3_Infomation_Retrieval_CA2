"Equality was introduced into the three branches long ago, but presently women represent only 5 percent of military personnel. This includes 59 officers, 150 sergeants, and 750 military police," said Lieutenant Colonel Jens Christian Lund, director of Military Service and Recruiting. He added that the military was hoping to increase that number. The military's good experience with mixed-gender units was given as the reason for the campaign. "Women are not merely excellent soldiers and colleagues, they have brought a much-needed change in attitudes and standards to the formerly male-dominated milieu," said Lund.
