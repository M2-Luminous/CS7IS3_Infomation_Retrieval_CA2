The PE program will provide: i. Individual results to the laboratories, ii. Statewide and nationwide reports to regulatory agencies on individual laboratory performance on PE test events, iii. Cumulative reports and scores for each laboratory, and iv. Reports of specific laboratory failures using grading criteria acceptable to NELAP,which must be provided on a timely basis. (5) Provisions on each PE report form used by the laboratory to record PE results, an attestation statement that PE test samples were tested in the same manner as routine samples, with a signature block to be completed by the individual performing the test as well as by the laboratory management; (6) A mechanism for notifying participants of the PE shipping schedule and for participants to notify the PE testing program within three days of the expected date of receipt of the shipment that samples have not arrived or are unacceptable for testing. The program must have provisions for replacement of samples that are lost in transit or are received in a condition that is unacceptable for testing; and (7) A process to resolve technical, administrative, and scientific problems about program operations; (c) Provide and maintain the following documentation as described: (1) Reports of PE test results and all scores for each laboratory's performance (an electronic or a hard copy, or both) must be provided to the primary accreditor, NELAP, and the participating laboratory in the format required by NELAP within 60 days after the date by which the laboratory must report PE test results to the PE testing program;
