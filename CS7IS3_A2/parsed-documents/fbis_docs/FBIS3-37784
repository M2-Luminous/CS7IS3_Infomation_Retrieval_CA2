Announcer Sergey Dorenko opens the program with the following: "The top echelons of the Russian Defense Ministry are entirely engrossed in the problems of 400 Russian soldiers who became a human shield in the war in Bosnia. Here, in the defense minister's office, decisions are made that determine the lives of our soldiers in Sarajevo, the future of peace in Bosnia, and the fate of the defense minister himself, even if you are completely indifferent to it. Good evening! Four hundred Russian paratroopers occupied new positions on the southeastern front of Sarajevo. The decision to bring in troops contradicted Moscow's previous plans. We know that before this, on Friday, a sharp address with regard to NATO was to be read out. Moreover, the address was to be accompanied by the complete withdrawal of Russia's blue helmets, and also from the Serb Krajina in Croatia. And suddenly, everything changed. Moscow previously believed that troops should not be put under bullets until the warring sides sign a peace agreement. Here we are. There is no peace agreement and the decision on NATO bombings has not been changed. One should not fully trust what the Serbs or the Bosnians say, but the troops were brought in." He goes on to say that the attack on the Sarajevo market might be repeated, but this time Russian servicemen might be affected by it. He recalls that the Serbs failed to complete the disarmament, partly because of severe weather conditions, shortage of fuel, and the immobility of some of the equipment. He recaps the movement of the Russian battalion and problems it encountered on the way. He says: "In Bosnia, our paratroopers met the Ukrainian battalion. The Ukrainians have stayed in Sarajevo for a long time and they said that they were often fired on. Even the outwardly neutral Ukrainians suffer because they are Christians. Thus, a handful of Russian lads turned out to be hostage to Balkan military passions, hostage to the ambitions of military generals from NATO and hostage to terrorist gangs that are not controlled by anyone." Dorenko then interviews Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, asking: "We have learned that the Russian Government intends in the near future to ask the upper chamber of the parliament to give a go- ahead to sending another 600 servicemen to Bosnia." Grachev replies: "Our 27th motor rifle division of the Maritime district is practically ready for this purpose, and also 46th motor rifle division in the Leningrad district. They will also fulfill the task fully like 1,200 paratroopers of the 106th airborne division." Dorenko continues by saying that Russian diplomats in the area of the conflict advised the Russian battalion to move closer to the French in hope that the latter would not be bombed. The Russian Defense Ministry, he adds, hopes that NATO would not carry out "the operation of revenge that was already calculated in details without informing us first." Dorenko says today that Grachev spoke about this with his American colleague. Dorenko goes on to say that there are areas where there is just 50 meters between the trenches occupied by the Croats, Serbs, and Russians and that there might be serious clashes there in four to six months. Concluding the program, Dorenko says that "in order not to ruin your mood completely, I leave you in the company of a man who is a bit more optimistic than me, Minister Grachev." Grachev's statement ends the program: "As for my proposal to bring an additional contingent to the territory occupied by the Muslims, I know that the U.S. plan does not include the use of ground forces, but perhaps we should propose to the British, French, and Germans -- they are stationed here close enough and have enough troops and we all know well the three defense ministers -- maybe we can reach an agreement on this issue at our next meeting?"
