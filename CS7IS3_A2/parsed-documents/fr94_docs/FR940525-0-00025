ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule establishes time-limited tolerances (with an expiration date of December 31, 1998) for the fungicide propiconazole, 1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1 H -1,2,4-triazole, and its metabolites, determined as 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and expressed as parent compound, in or on the raw agricultural commodities peanuts at 0.2 part per million (ppm), peanut hay at 20.0 ppm, and peanut hulls at 1.0 ppm. This rule to establish the maximum permissible levels for residues of propiconazole in or on the commodities listed above was requested in a petition submitted by the Ciba-Geigy Corp. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective May 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written objections, identified by the document control number, [PP 8F3654/R2064], may be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. M3708, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Steve Robbins, Acting Product Manager (PM) 21, Registration Division (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of October 12, 1988 (53 FR 39783), which announced that the Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 8F3654) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.434 by establishing tolerances for the fungicide 1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1 H -1,2,4-triazole and its metabolites, determined as 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and expressed as parent compound, in or on the commodities peanuts at 0.2 ppm, peanut hay at 20.0 ppm, and peanut hulls at 1.0 ppm. The were no adverse comments received by the Agency in response to the notice of filing. Because the above notice published more than 5 years ago, it was republished in the Federal Register of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14853). There were no adverse comments received by the Agency in response to the republication of the notice of filing. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant materials have been evaluated. The data considered include the following: 1. Plant and animal metabolism studies. 2. Residue data for crop and livestock commodities. 3. Two enforcement methods and multiresidue method testing data. 4. A rat oral lethal dose (LD 50 ) of 1,517 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight. 5. A 90-day rat feeding study with a no-observable-effect level (NOEL) of 12 mg/kg/day. 6. A 90-day dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day. 7. A rabbit developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day and a developmental toxicity NOEL of greater than 400 mg/kg/day (highest dose tested (HDT)). 8. A rat teratology study with a maternal toxicity NOEL of 30 mg/kg/day and a developmental toxicity NOEL of 30 mg/kg/day. 9. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a reproductive NOEL of 125 mg/kg/day (HDT) and a developmental toxicity NOEL of 25 mg/kg/day. 10. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day. 11. A 2-year rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with a NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day with no carcinogenic potential under the conditions of the study up to and including approximately 125 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. 12. A 2-year mouse chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with a NOEL of 15 mg/kg/day and with a statistically significant increase in combined adenomas and carcinomas of the liver in male mice at approximately 375 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. 13. Ames test with and without activation, negative. 14. A mouse dominant-lethal assay, negative. 15. Chinese hamster nucleus anomaly, negative. 16. Cell transformation assay, negative. Data gaps exist concerning dosing in the mouse carcinogenicity study. These data requirements were required under reregistration, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq. As part of EPA's evaluation of potential human health risks, propiconazole has been the subject of five Peer Reviews and one Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) meeting. Propiconazole was originally evaluated by the Peer Review Committee on January 15, 1987, and classified as a Group C (possible human) carcinogen with a recommendation made for the quantification of estimated potential human risk using a linearized low-dose extrapolation. The method resulted in the establishment of a Q * of 7.9 X 10 -2 (mg/kg/day) -1 . The Peer Review Committee's decision was presented to the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel on March 2, 1988. The Panel did not concur with the committee's overall assessment of the weight-of-evidence on the carcinogenicity of propiconazole. The Panel recommended placing the chemical in Group D, indicating that the Group C classification was based on minimal evidence. The Panel's determination that EPA's Group C classification was based on minimal evidence was due to the fact that the incidence of liver tumors in male mice only occurred when the mice were given an excessive chemical dose. In the second, third, and fourth Peer Reviews that followed, the Peer Review Committee considered recommendations of the SAP as well as rebuttals by the registrant. Its conclusion, however, that propiconazole should be classified as a Group C carcinogen with a quantification of potential human risk remained unchanged. As part of a fifth Peer Review, EPA considered additional information provided by the registrant in support of the registrant's argument that the high dose was excessively toxic in the mouse carcinogenicity study. It further argued that the data from the high dose (2,500 ppm) should not be included in the evaluation of carcinogenic potential of propiconazole. In support of these arguments, the registrant provided two subchronic oral toxicity studies in mice. Ciba-Geigy also provided a reread of the pathology slides from a mouse oncogenicity study which it felt indicated sufficient concurrent liver toxicity at 2,500 ppm to document that this dose was excessive. These findings were not present in the original pathology report. Owing to the inconsistency in Ciba-Geigy's report and the original report, the Agency requested that an independent (third) evaluation of the pathology slides be made to determine if the pathology reported could be confirmed. The results of this (third) pathology evaluation were used in the fifth Peer Review in place of data resulting from the earlier evaluations provided by Ciba-Geigy. The Peer Review Committee considered the following facts regarding the toxicology data on propiconazole in a weight-of-evidence determination of carcinogenic potential: 1. Increased numbers of adenomas (increased trend and pairwise comparison) were found in the livers of male CD1 mice given 2,500 ppm of propiconazole in the diet. 2. The treated animals had earlier fatalities than the controls. 3. The numbers of carcinomas were increased (trend only) in male mice only at the 2,500 ppm dose level. Tumors were not significantly increased at the 500 ppm dose level. Adenomas observed in the treated animals were larger and more numerous than those in controls; however, the tumor type (adenoma) was the same. 4. No excessive number of tumors was found in female mice. 5. In a rat study conducted with acceptable doses of propiconazole, no excessive numbers of tumors were found. The Peer Review Committee determined, based on the additional information submitted by Ciba-Geigy from two 90-day subchronic studies in mice that the 2,500-ppm dose used in the 2-year chronic study exceeded the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the endpoint of hepatic necrosis, and the 500-ppm dose used in the chronic study was inadequate to assess the carcinogenicity of propiconazole. Based on the third pathology evaluation of the chronic study, the Peer Review Committee agreed with Ciba-Geigy's argument that the study showed excessive toxicity at the 2,500 ppm-dose and concluded that the 90-day subchronic studies are a better measure of what would be an MTD. Based upon these findings, the Peer Review Committee agreed that the classification for propiconazole should remain a Group C (possible human) carcinogen and recommended against the previously used Q * ( viz . 0.079) for risk assessment purposes. For the purpose of risk characterization the Peer Review Committee recommended that the reference dose (RfD) approach should be used for quantification of human risk. This decision was based on the disqualification of the high dose (2,500 ppm), making the data inappropriate for the calculation of Q * . Because the middle dose (500 ppm) was not considered sufficiently high enough for assessing the carcinogenetic potential of propiconazole, EPA has requested an additional mouse study at intermediate dose levels in male mice only. EPA does not expect that these data will significantly change the above cancer assessment that propiconazole poses a negligible cancer risk to humans. The reference dose (RfD) for propiconazole is 0.013 mg/kg/day, based on a no-observable-effect level (NOEL) of 1.25 mg/kg/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is taken from a 1-year feeding study in dogs which demonstrated as an effect irritation of the stomach in males. The Agency has evaluated dietary exposure to the fungicide residues based on the proposed tolerances and the commodities which have established tolerances using data on anticipated residues and percent crop treated data. The livestock burden was calculated using anticipated residues in feed items multiplied by the expected percent contribution to the diet. This dietary burden was then compared with available data from feeding studies to determine anticipated residues in meat and milk. Based on current registered uses of this chemical only 7% of the RfD is being utilized for the general U.S. population. The tolerances are expected to elicit only a minor increase in the percent utilization of the RfD for the general U.S. population. The most highly exposed subgroups, nursing and nonnursing infants less than 1 year, have Anticipated Residue Contributions (ARCs) from all published tolerances of 1.97 X 10 -3 and 3.97 X 10 -3 mg/kg bwt/day. These ARCs represent 15% and 31% of the Reference Dose for these subgroups, respectively. The proposed tolerances will add 0.03% and 0.05% of the RfD for nursing and nonnursing infants less than 1 year, respectively. Available data on storage stability of propiconazole in peanuts are unacceptable and must be redone for nutmeat, hulls, and hay. Once review of all required residue data is submitted, the petitioner may resubmit its petition for permanent tolerances. The nature of the residue in plants and animals is adequately understood, and adequate analytical methods (gas chromatography) are available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead time for establishing these tolerances and food additive regulations to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), 401 M St., S.W., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1128C, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5232. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerances are being sought. For the reasons described above, the Agency is establishing tolerances for residues of 1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1 H -1,2,4-triazole and its metabolites, determined as 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and expressed as parent compound, in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: peanuts, 0.2 ppm; peanut hay, 20 ppm; peanut hulls, 1 ppm. Because of unacceptable storage stability data on peanuts, the Agency is placing a time limitation on these tolerances. However, based on available data the Agency concludes that the established interim tolerances will protect public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.127). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food additive regulations or raising tolerance levels or food additive regulations or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (40 FR 24950). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.
