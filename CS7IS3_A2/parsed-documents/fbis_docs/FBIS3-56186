Yevgenyev report under the "Regions" rubric: "Impoverished Regions Will Not Add to the Country's Wealth"] [Text] That Russia needs a well-thought-out regional policy more than ever today is the conclusion drawn by specialists of the Institute of Experts of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in their report entitled "The Regions of Russia in the Transitional Period." For some time now we have been unable to kick the bad habit of being wise after the event (remember the bitter sobering up that occurred after the recent elections). The analysis put forward by Yevgeniy Yasin, Andrey Neshchadin, Andrey Grigoryev, and Mikhail Malyutin is an attempt to "seize the moment," to get to grips with the key problem of Russian reforms. In the experts' opinion, there are now two objectively inevitable processes under way in Russia -- decentralization and federalization. The crux of the former is the transfer of economic decisionmaking or, to be more precise, the sources of economic decisionmaking downward -- from the organs of centralized planning and management of the command economy to the marketplace. It is our common misfortune that this process, which began under the influence of the democratization of the USSR, got stuck at the level of the republics and led to its disintegration. The process was actually simply incapable of penetrating further -- to the lower, market level -- at the time. Compared with the USSR, Russia is a more uniform country in geopolitical and national terms (83 percent of the population are Russians), and its market groundwork has been better prepared. That should, as it were, reassure those who see in its fate direct analogies with the great Soviet empire. The crux of the matter, however, is that even here, in the process of decentralization, a hiatus has occurred at regional level in the devolution of power. Enterprises are not yet able to operate in a new way while the center is no longer in a position to manage in the old way. As a result the regional authorities get involved in everything under the sun from regulating prices to privatization, from subsidizing the disadvantaged to the purchase and sale of goods and the organization of inter-oblast bartering. This situation will not last forever. The development of private trade, commodity and money markets, and a labor market will set everything to rights. What we must not do is hurry events along or demand the impossible but must let the process come to fruition. But the temptation to call to order, to regulate, and to take the center to task is greater than ever today. The report examines two diametrically opposed economic management models -- one in Nizhniy Novgorod, the other in Ulyanovsk. The first model is actively reformist, with the accent on privatization, the development of enterprise, deregulation of prices [svobodnoye tsenoobrazovaniye] prices, and a very open region. The second model largely sticks to the old-type structures and relationships. There they do not much welcome the private sector, they regulate prices, set quotas for the allocation of prime necessities, and ban the export of subsidized goods from the oblast. The upshot is that inhabitants of Ulyanovsk Oblast can acquire for their income twice the quantity of staple foodstuffs that the average inhabitant of Nizhniy Novgorod can, although, from the standpoint of the future, it is the Nizhniy Novgorod strategy, which promises to yield the greatest return. But it would be a very great mistake to order everyone to march in step! The Ulyanovsk authorities' tactics are dictated by the totality of the specific conditions that obtain there, conditions that are not reproduced countrywide, such as the oblast's self-sufficiency in food and the balance between the industrial and agrarian sectors. Moreover, in Ulyanovsk, as in other regions where they regulate prices, inflation is no lower than where prices are free. No one, anyway, will be able to keep prices fixed. Of course, there is some injustice in all this: The inhabitants of Nizhniy Novgorod are working not just for their own future but the future of the whole country; in Ulyanovsk they are seeking to squeeze the maximum out of what the Lord God has sent them and have created a command system. But this is the will of the regions, and it must not not be ignored. The other process, which we are experiencing, is federalization. That is to say, the formation of a system of institutions of power bound up with the transition from a unitary union state to a truly federal one. And that is impossible without a budgetary system. So long as Moscow determines how much tax someone must pay to the center, there will always be aggrieved people who think that their neighbors are eating them out of house and home. And there will consequently be grounds for separatism. A single-channel taxation system does not suit us, experts believe, and it leads toward confederation. The German option is the most acceptable: The center sets a single value-added tax and a single moderate rate of tax on profits payable to the federal exchequer while the local authorities have the opportunity to increase it to the benefit of the regional budget and also to set and collect any other taxes for their own exchequer. That is what the theoreticians think, but the administrators? The Finance Ministry would seem not to be against. But another year has now elapsed and there is still nno clarity. Until we sort out taxes, there will be no peace in our common home. And yet structural reorganization is the most difficult task from the standpoint of the future. The authors of the report make an interesting observation. They started by trying to define what concepts of reform in general are feasible in Russia today. In the experts' opinion, there are three such options. The raw-materials option, placing reliance on the extractive sectors, whose output we could sell abroad. The conversion option, entailing the development of high-tech production and the restructuring of the military-industrial complex. And finally the third and, unlike the previous ones, self-contained option, geared toward the domestic market. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. Something else is important: Depending on the structure of their economy, all the regions gravitate toward a particular concept of reforms. The authors of the report have done a simple thing: They have taken the results of the April referendum and examined to what extent the results depend on the coincidence of the center's reform line and the structure of the region. There turns out to be a very direct link. Politics is one thing, but it is the economy that feeds us. It is the economy that determines our political sympathies. The resume will be brief: Russia is too big a country to adopt and maintain a single pure strategy of reforms. The strategy must be a mixed one, which takes account of the interests of Nadym and Kaliningrad. To press down obstinately upon a single lever while moving along such a difficult, treacherous, and unpredictable path as the one we are trying to traverse is an ineffectual activity. And a dangerous one.
