[Text] If a State governed by law does not exist or the law is not observed, if a balance and independence of powers does not exist or is not observed, if human rights do not exist or are not observed, then governmental democracy does not exist. Nor does it exist if the rights of persons are disregarded and abused. And that is what is happening today in Peru and what has been borne out in the recent "La Cantuta" and "Vaticano" cases. In suddenly passing a law to prevent the "La Cantuta" case from being ventilated in the court of original jurisdiction, what the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] has perpetrated signifies, to my understanding, that the 5 April 1992 breach of constitutionality continues in force, that the CCD is a formalism, and that we are continuing under a civil-military regime. The responsibility for this, in history, must be borne by Mr. Fujimori. Not only the congressmen of the minority but also recognized authorities in matters of constitutional law fully agree on the legal flaws in the act that was recently passed by the CCD majority. Basing my comments on their authoritative opinions, I shall refer succinctly to each of these flaws. First, the scandalous and illegal parliamentary procedure invoked to pass that law. Scandalous because it was introduced suddenly for immediate enactment, without going through committee proceedings, and was reported out for promulgation without awaiting its enactment, and without even awaiting the minority's motion for reconsideration. Illegal because, according to the Constitution adopted recently by those same congressmen: "Absent an exception stipulated in the By-Laws of the Congress, no bill shall be given the force of law without having been previously reported out by the Standing Committee concerned." I do not know, but it would be absurd were the by-laws to contemplate such exception for a law of this importance to the country's judicial institution. Second, the intrinsic unconstitutionality of the law that was passed, in that it was enacted not because of the nature of things but specifically to satisfy a special interest in an immediate political action. It is public knowledge that, following Pease's denunciation in the CCD, the top military echelon has been maneuvering to bring the investigation of the "La Cantuta" case under the military's special jurisdiction. In the view of all the jurists, it is more than evident that the case of the La Cantuta massacre does not properly fall within the competency of the military tribunals, because it does not derive from the military's functions, for it is not credible that those functions include the assassination of students. The case clearly falls within the competency of the ordinary courts, involving as it does the assassination of civilians. And this is set forth in the Penal Code. For these reasons, the civil investigating judge, Cubas Villanueva, placed an official written request on the military tribunal that it transfer the case to the court having original jurisdiction. This request, having been refused, produced a jurisdictional dispute. As set forth in the law, the solution of that dispute devolves upon the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of Justice, and requires four votes in favor of one jurisdiction or the other. In executive session, the Criminal Division vote was three for the military jurisdiction and two for the ordinary jurisdiction, thus requiring under the law that another Supreme Court magistrate be called in to cast a vote. At this point, however, the Congress stepped in and passed a law providing that for the determination of competency only a simple majority is required, and stipulating, in an incredible aberration, that this provision "is applicable to all proceedings presently in course, without requiring new voting." Thus, under its true name, it is a law determining that the La Cantuta case is to be tried by the military tribunals. Third, the law thus passed is illegal and therefore not enforceable, because it cannot replace the provisions of an organic law, which is of a higher category and specifies that the deciding votes must be four in number. It is contrary to the Constitution, in that, according to Article 139, "No authority may take over a pending case that is before the courts"--which this is--"nor interfere in the exercise of the functions of the courts." It is doubly contrary to the Constitution because, according to Article 103, "No law has retroactive force nor retroactive effect..."; and to stipulate in the new law that it is applicable immediately to proceedings in course is to enact a retroactive provision. Fourth, and gravest of all, the CCD's action obviously constitutes an intolerable intrusion by the Legislative Power upon the Judicial Power. As the CAL [Lima Bar Association] has aptly put it: "The intrusion by Congress, with a lack of conscientiousness that contradicts its constituent nature, and contradicts the brand new Constitution of 1993, is inadmissible, representing as it does a virtual coup d'etat by the Legislative Power against the independence and freedom of the Judicial Power." But the Judicial Power could have asserted its freedom and independence by disavowing such an aberrant law. And to this end, the Supreme Court justices need only have met in Plenary Session and declared that they would continue with the procedure for defining competency in accordance with the norms set forth in the Court's organic law. Lamentably, and despite the public outcry, they did not do so; and in an act of submissiveness rather than of independence, they again permitted the Judicial Power to be trampled under foot, as they did on 5 April. This attests to the fact that, in Peru, independence of the Powers is nonexistent; that a democratic State governed by law does not exist; that, beyond mere formalisms, the Legislative, bowing to an Executive dictum, hastens to pass a law that violates the very Constitution the Legislative has enacted; and that the Judicial hastens to accept it as valid. It is repulsive, but not surprising; because the magistrates who voted in favor of military competency to prosecute the case-Pantoja, Iberico, and Montes de Oca--were appointed during the current regime, as was also the current president of the Supreme Court, who throughout his term to date, and specifically in this case, has shown an absolute lack of a sense of the dignity of the position he occupies. Except for the innermost circle of governmental authorities, since even the pro-Fujimori group "Renovation" has distanced itself, and as I write these lines the rumor persists that Ministers Camet and Bustamente have resigned, public rejection of that aberrant law by the media as well as by the political groupings and opinion makers has been total. Some, not I, hoped Fujimori would not take personal responsibility for its promulgation, leaving that task to the Congress. But it did not happen that way, and following the repeated presence of the Commanding General of the Army in the Palace of the Government, the promulgation of the law was published last Thursday in EL PERUANO. A few months ago, with reference to the La Cantuta proceedings, I wrote that the last thing the military would permit would be the denying of the military tribunals' competency to hear the case. The recent "Vaticano" case, in which members of the military are also implicated, and which is another example of the trampling of the Judicial Power, provides further evidence that the Army exercises a determinative policy-making role in the running of the country. To any thinking person, it is obvious that the scandal of bringing "Vaticano" to trial as a traitor to the country, thus circumventing a public trial, and the recent enactment of this aberrant law attacking the integrity of a State governed by law, are actions that damage the legal image of Mr. Fujimori's government, that damage the possibilities of external aid, and that therefore can hardly be believed to have originated in Mr. Fujimoro's personal opinion, but rather in pressures being applied by the Joint Command of the Armed Forces.
