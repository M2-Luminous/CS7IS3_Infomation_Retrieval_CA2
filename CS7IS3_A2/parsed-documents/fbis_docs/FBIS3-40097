Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation statistics show border trade amounting to only $13 million during the beginning of reform and opening up to the outside world in 1980, $4 million of which was imports, and $9 million of which was exports. By 1992, however, China's border trade figure reached $1.865 billion, including $787 million worth of imports and $1.078 billion worth of exports. Within the short space of 12 years, border trade has shot up 142 fold. Today, China has 216 border trade points open to the outside world, and 292 markets for trading among border peoples. With the steady rise in the amount of border trade, China's economic and technical cooperation, project contracting, labor cooperation, and investment with nations on its borders, including the Commonwealth of Independent States countries, Vietnam, North Korea, Mongolia, Burma, Laos, and Pakistan have developed across the board. This increasingly lively border trade, and external economic exchanges, have given extremely great impetus to the economic development of China's border regions. It has expanded border region commodity production and commodity exchange, thereby raising the standard of living of all border region nationalities. In addition, China's trade with border countries has produced mutual benefit for certain areas, the flow of key production elements affecting a rational allocation of resources. This has not only widened the realm of China's external economic relations and trade cooperation, and opened diversified markets, but it has also actively promoted the development of the countries concerned and the regional economies of South Asia, Northeast Asia, and Central Asia. Despite the rapid development of border trade, we must not overlook problems still remaining in China's border trade that are in urgent need of solution through macroeconomic regulation and control measures. I. Major Problems Today in China's Development of Border Trade A. "Appendage" businesses make for disarray in the operating order, which is detrimental to normal development of border trade. In recent years, China's border trade has developed very rapidly, border trade administration and management system developing from scratch, and exhibiting different characteristics at each stage of development. Survey data show a lack of uniformity in both the way that each of the border provinces and regions conduct border trade and in the border trade administration and management system. Several of the provinces and regions that began border trade ahead of the others adopted what is essentially a deregulated operating system. They used "appendage" business methods to encourage diverse economic components, various economic entities, and provincial and autonomous region trade channels to join in the border trade. For example, nine corporations in Suifenhe, Heihe and Harbin in Heilongjiang Province enjoy the right to conduct border trade, and more than 5,000 companies that are appendages to these nine corporations also engage in the border trade. They include not only state-owned import-export companies, but also collectively owned, privately owned, and individually owned industrial and commercial companies. This produces a situation in which anybody and everybody is involved in border trade. This was all right during the early period of implementation of the strategy of opening up the border to the outside world to encourage border area economies to make a major effort in border trade. Today, however, when China is in process of transformation of a commodity economy system, and when the legal system is not yet completely developed, this kind of "appendage" form of border trade administration and management is not in keeping with the objective climate for full-speed development of border trade. It also runs counter to the building of a socialist market economic enterprise system in which enterprises are responsible for their own operating decisions and for their own profits and losses. The consequences it occasions are: 1) Some "appendage" companies use border trade corporations' right to engage in border trade to conclude deals with little regard for good faith. This causes problems. Eventually the border trade corporation receives the blame. This seriously disturbs the border trade operating order. 2) As a result of the lack of effective macroeconomic control, the involvement of numerous entities in importing and exporting merchandise, cut-throat competition, and each entity trying to undersell the other, an extremely serious situation exists in export trade. Some appendage enterprises or individuals gain benefits at the expense of enterprises having the right to conduct border trade and the country. The sale price of Chinese products steadily declines. For example, one could formerly readily obtain 2 tons of processed steel for 1 ton of granulated sugar, but only 1 ton is obtainable today. B. No macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism has been established to guide healthy development of border trade. Various economic, legal, and administrative regulation and control measures have not been applied promptly. This impairs improvement of overall economic returns from border trade. Border trade is developing very rapidly now, but an overall macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism for prices, information services, law, Customs, commercial inspections, technical supervision, and transportation is still lacking. Some local governments and departments do as they please, adopt a laissez-faire attitude, and practice blatant local protectionism. All these actions hurt the long-term development of China's border trade and the opening of markets in neighboring countries. For example, in recent years a substantial amount of farm machinery, including tractors and harvesters as well as motor vehicles and engineering machinery, have been imported from Russia through barter trade. Improper macroeconomic regulation and control measures, and laxity in licensing controls and Customs duties collections resulted in this equipment being dumped in China's domestic markets at lower than the international market prices. This delivered a serious blow to Chinese industries producing similar products, some of which went bankrupt or shifted to other lines of production in consequence. As another example, in June 1992 Russia revived its monopoly system for exports of strategic materials, designating specific foreign trading corporations sole agents for the export of petroleum, fuels, charcoal, rare metals, steel pipes, and timber. Russia also expanded quota export commodities, increasing the quotas for non-ferrous metals and the raw materials from which they derive. It also hiked the barter trade export tariff rate 30 percent. On 1 January 1993, it raised it another 20 percent (i.e., to 50 percent). At the same time, it revived import duties. However, China did not immediately adopt corresponding macroeconomic regulation and control measures to guide development of border trade in a healthy direction of mutual concessions for mutual benefit. C. Requisite agencies for the newly opened border entry and exit points, Customs, and commercial inspection have not been fully developed; staffing with supervisory and control personnel is not complete; and control is not strict. Consequently, some fake, fraudulent, counterfeit, and shoddy merchandise have been sent outside the country, thereby creating needless losses for border trade. Survey shows that no commercial inspection agencies have been set up for more than two-thirds of the commodities passing through the newly opened border points, and that 60 percent of the staffing of commercial inspection agencies has not been completed. A survey of more than 20 border trade points in Guangxi Province shows, for example, that aside from Pingxiang, Fangcheng, and Beihai, virtually no commercial inspection agencies have been set up elsewhere. Consequently, only 55 percent of the merchandise exported through the border trading points nationwide are subjected to commercial inspection agency inspections. In some places, it is only 10 percent. This amounts to practically no inspection at all, which is an important reason that fake, fraudulent, counterfeit, and shoddy merchandise is able to sneak into the country. D. The incompleteness of laws and regulations governing local border trade, and the lack of judicial coordination with neighboring countries are detrimental to prompt resolution of border trade disputes. The "Commercial Inspection Code," the "Regulations for Implementation of the Commercial Inspection Code," and the "Customs Code," that China has promulgated lack specific regulations for border trade, Customs, and commercial inspection agencies supervision, control, and inspection activities. They do not meet the needs of the new situation of opening of the borders during the 1990s. Second, no regulations exist for commercial inspection and customs supervision and control of things carried by individuals such as travelers and "profiteers." Loopholes exist in the application of laws. Furthermore, no bilateral judicial coordination exists between China and Russia, China and Vietnam, or China and Burma. This is also an important reason for the inability to resolve promptly cases involving the flow across the border of false, fraudulent, counterfeit, and shoddy merchandise, and trade disputes that occur. E. The other parties do not honor agreements very well, and foot dragging is a serious problem. Most contracts cannot be enforced; thus, China maintains a large trade surplus, which is detrimental to development of the border trade and to economic and technical cooperation. [passage omitted]
