At least seven CP [Conservative Party] MPs are inluded on the list, including the Mulder brothers Pieter and Corne, and CP MP Joseph Chiole who are expected to be high up. Mr Chiole said the the Front had "significant" candidates on all its lists. Apart from the CP MPs, a former National Party MP and prominent Afrikaner Volksunie [National Union -- AVU] leaders appeared on the list. He would not give names but it is understood former AVU members Chris de Jager and Moolman Mentz were included. The CP's Natal exucutive would probably form the core of the FF's candidate list in the province with former CP leader Carl Werth in a prominent position. Dr Pieter Mulder told SAPA the inclusion of CP MPs on the list did not constitute a split in Conservative ranks. He said there was no division over the concept of a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] but there were differences over strategy on how to obtain it. "I'm not fighting with the CP but against the National Party and the African National Congress." The FF candidate list was still subject to change and the names would be announced on Thursday [17 March].
