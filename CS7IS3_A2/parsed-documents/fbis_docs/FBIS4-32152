Bulgaria's representatives at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and at the United Nations and other international organizations in Vienna provided similar information to the Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The major points of the Bulgarian position, as reported by a Foreign Ministry spokesman, are the following: At this stage European standards applied by the Council of Europe, the CSCE and other international institutions, especially concerning the free expression of national identity, are much higher than those operative in Macedonia likely to be applied at census; the Government of Macedonia should take the necessary steps to secure free expression for all its citizens, in line with European standards; Bulgaria will take a stand on the results accordingly; Bulgaria attaches great importance to relations with Macedonia and is willing to promote them further.
