Speaking before the United Nations in 1993, former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin proposed a social summit to undertake a global effort to eradicate poverty, which affects millions of people around the world. During a meeting today with foreign correspondents, Frei stressed the importance of the Cartagena summit. He said he will use the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with presidents from neighboring countries, with Spanish King Juan Carlos, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, and Cuban President Fidel Castro. Regarding Cuba, with which Chile maintains ties at the consular level, Frei noted the appointment of Ambassador Patricio Pozo, the former Chilean representative to Costa Rica, as Chilean consul to Cuba. He also mentioned Chilean-Cuban commercial and tourism ties. Frei commented on the credit line granted to Cuba for the purchase of foodstuffs from Chile, as well as Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's upcoming visit. Frei said that during his talk with Castro, we will continue to discuss the strengthening of bilateral ties seeking to consolidate democracy and uphold human rights. Frei reasserted his opposition to a unilateral armed action against Haiti, but hastily condemned the serious situation in that country. He said: "We do not favor unilateral solutions and will support all multilateral measures adopted by the international community that seek to restore democracy in Haiti." Open regionalism will be one of the priority proposals to be made by Frei at the Cartagena Summit. Frei stated: "In an integrated world, in which large economic blocs like the EU, NAFTA (among the United States, Mexico and Canada), and APEC (Asian-Pacific Economic Corporation) are being consolidated we, as Latin Americans, must also be present. A Latin American union should not be a closed association, it should help us to open these markets." Development with equity, the fight against poverty and crime, and drug enforcement are also included in the Chilean proposal. Frei said: "Particularly, a clear political idea to achieve progress regarding integration." He stressed the Chilean decision to join the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) which originally comprised Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The Cartagena Summit will be the first international conference to be attended by President Eduardo Frei since he assumed power on 11 March. Frei will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on 28 June. He will attend the Rio Summit in September, and attend the APEC Summit meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, in November. During this meeting Chile will be accepted as a member country. On 9 and 10 December, Frei will attend the presidential summit in Miami called by President Clinton. Speaking about the possible duplication as a result of the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena and the Summit of the Americas in Miami, Frei said he believes all efforts to increase the number of meetings of Latin American presidents or European leaders are positive.
