Originally, the ROK Army's Sangnoksu unit was to withdraw from Somalia in July of next year. The decision for the withdrawal takes into consideration the safety of the ROK Army in Somalia. When considering the fact that the Defense Ministry showed hints for the possibility of early withdrawal rather than adhering to its policy that early withdrawal is impossible, there is high possibility that the troops will be withdrawn earlier than scheduled on the occasion of the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in the ROK which is slated for late March of next year.
