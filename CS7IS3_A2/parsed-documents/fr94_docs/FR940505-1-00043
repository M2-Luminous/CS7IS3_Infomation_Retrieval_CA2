FR940505-1-00043 FR940505-1-00012 E. Public Involvement 1. Public Participation in Development of the FIPs One of the more difficult aspects of developing these FIPs has been to build in meaningful public participation. Sufficient time is at best a luxury in meeting the court-ordered deadlines to promulgate the final FIPs. Conversely, sufficient time is an absolute necessity for full public involvement. An inevitable conflict arises when trying to meet both of these needs. If community-wide support for the changes necessary to reach attainment were easy to achieve, there would be no need for these FIPs or even the attainment deadlines in the first place. Unfortunately, any level of real public participation in matters this controversial can easily degenerate into parochial disagreements with no real benefit to anyone involved. Any participation process which facilitates consensus solutions must be designed to minimize these disagreements. Finally, given the limited resources available to EPA for actually developing the strategies in these FIPs, it is a measure of the Agency's commitment to public involvement that we have and will continue to direct them toward increasing public involvement in this effort. Irrespective of these difficulties, EPA has and will continue to engage in every possible effort to make the final plans a product of local involvement and consensus. We will do so because we believe strongly that we can best fulfill the goal of the Clean Air Act_that is, clean and healthy air for all Americans_and meet our court-ordered obligations by preparing these plans with the state and local communities, not in spite of them. We are highly cognizant of the fact that each area affected by our rules has its own unique qualities and concerns. We also believe that the only way in which EPA can fully understand those concerns_and take them into account_is through direct participation by the affected interests and communities. Ultimately we believe that the success of any air quality plan_federal, state or local_will be dependent upon the level of understanding and support which exists in the community regarding the need for and benefits of the plan. Without that understanding and support, we are unlikely to meet the difficult challenges which lie ahead. 2. Public Meetings Prior to Proposal As a result of these beliefs, we have initiated an effort to develop these plans in a manner which encourages local input. First, our plans, and their assumptions, were built with significant input from state and local air agencies, other local and state officials, and representatives of various affected interests. EPA has tried to use the best and most current data that these entities could provide within our FIP proposal timeframe. Second, our FIP development effort has included eight informal, pre-proposal public meetings (two each in Ventura and Sacramento, and four in the South Coast). The purposes of these meetings were to: (1) Begin the process of education and interaction among the various parties_local, state, federal, and the public; (2) solicit initial thoughts and concerns from the affected communities as we developed the proposals; and (3) solicit suggestions about how best to continue the interactive process through the development of the final plans due in February 1995. The results of these meetings are found throughout these FIP proposals, both in the emission reductions strategies and in the post-proposal process. Finally, our FIP development process has included numerous staff-to-staff discussions among the local and state air boards and EPA. The results of these discussions, as well, are found throughout the proposals. 3. Process for Post-Proposal Public Involvement In order to organize and facilitate meaningful community involvement during the period between proposal and the final plans, EPA plans to enhance the normal notice and comment period. Our primary effort in this area will consist of working to coordinate the FIP processes with the ongoing local processes so as to minimize public confusion and coordinate planning resources. This approach is based on comments and requests received in pre-proposal meetings, and will rely_to the greatest extent feasible_on the processes already in place at the local level. Following proposal of the FIPs, EPA will continue to meet with responsible state and local air agencies to coordinate the SIP and FIP public processes, as well as with community groups, environmental and business interests. A set of conflicts exist though, which may make it necessary for the FIP processes to also follow its own separate track. For example, the local air boards are currently developing plans which not only meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, but also must meet the requirements of the California Clean Air Act. No such California specific requirement exists for the FIPs. Further, EPA believes that it is necessary for the FIPs to apply many of the controls to all three areas or in some cases, state-wide. Reliance on the various local SIP processes to engage the public on these particular FIP measures would make it difficult for interested parties to participate fully in all aspects of the dialogue, and could lead the public to believe that EPA has the ability to tailor these measures to the conditions of the local areas. Finally, EPA must meet the mandates of the federal courts and the terms of settlement agreements which require it to promulgate final FIPs by February 1995. This deadline cannot be changed by EPA and means that coordination with ongoing local processes must be constrained to fit within EPA's timeframe. For these reasons, EPA believes that we should take additional steps outside of the local processes in order to provide an opportunity for productive public input on the proposed FIPs in a timeframe which is consistent with the final promulgation deadline of February 1995. These steps will include: (a) Following proposal of the FIPs, EPA will convene a public workshop in each FIP area in order to describe in some detail our proposals, to help us identify appropriate issues for in-depth examination, and to encourage local participation and support for issue-specific focus meetings. (b) Depending on the level of support that exists, issue-specific focus meetings may be held in each FIP area, and possibly a central forum for selected statewide issues, to help develop comments on the FIP issues of greatest concern. The goals of each issue-specific group will be to develop a consensus position, if possible, and to submit consensus comments, if possible, on its set of FIP issues. EPA will also encourage each group to direct its comments to the state and local air agencies which will be developing ozone plans due in November 1994. (c) EPA will not ``select'' specific attendees or chairpersons for these focus meetings, but will encourage participation that is sufficiently representative and inclusive so as to make any consensus real and meaningful. To the extent possible, EPA will provide contractor and staff support for the meetings. EPA will encourage the local air districts and the Air Resources Board to provide staff support as well. (d) All group meetings sponsored by EPA will be open to the public. The number of meetings for each issue area will vary by issue. (e) Following the workshops and group meetings, formal public hearings will be held in each FIP area, probably in early July 1994. Notice will be given of the formal public hearings in the Federal Register thirty (30) days prior to such hearings. (f) The public comment period will be held open from the publication of the FIP proposals until 30 days after the public hearings. (g) It is EPA's intention to give great weight to any comments on which local consensus has been reached through this public involvement process. EPA, of course, remains ultimately responsible for the content of the final rule which must meet federal legal requirements and address national policy concerns. Although EPA encourages all interested parties to participate in focus meetings and workshops, any member of the public who has chosen not to do so has the right to submit written comments and/or testify at the public hearings. EPA will consider all comments received during the public comment period. EPA realizes that the time constraints involved pose a very real obstacle to achieving consensus on issues as complex and controversial as those raised in developing clean air strategies. The requirement to finalize these FIPs by February 1995 means that EPA, and the public, will need to make very efficient use of this period until the public comment period closes in mid-summer. EPA is realistic about the level of consensus that can be reached in such a short period of time. We have decided to go forward with an expanded public involvement process because we believe that the potential benefits are great_and at a minimum, all parties will benefit from a greater understanding of the air quality problems, the concerns of affected parties, and the range of solutions.
