The SDPJ, the largest force in the seven-party coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has traditionally had friendly ties with North Korea. Chung Hae ryong [name as received], president of the Korean Residents Union in Japan (Mindan), gave an address to SDP representatives on the first day of the two-day convention. But the leader of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyun) -- effectively a Tokyo-Pyongyang contact channel as North Korea and Japan have no diplomatic relations -- did not attend the SDPJ convention. Moreover, the Workers' Party of North Korea has not sent the SDPJ a congratulatory telegram for the convention as it always had previously, SDPJ officials said. The development is regarded as an expression of Pyongyang's disapproval of the move by the SDPJ, which has gradually shifted its stance toward South Korea since joining the coalition in August. Former SDPJ Chairman Sadao Yamahana, who is currently state minister in charge of political reform, visited South Korea in September last year, the first time the head of the SDPJ has done so. The SDPJ has also adopted a new foreign policy which includes a balanced stance toward South and North Korea.
