The company said June production is expected to top the previous year's level of 313,000 units, the first year-on-year rise since may last year. "There is a strong possibility that domestic automobile sales will begin to pick up in the latter half of this year, spurred by the marketing of new models," said Iwao Isomura, vice president of the company. The company said orders for the RAV4 model totaled 17,000 in the first month after it was marketed, far surpassing the monthly sales target of 2,000 units. It said it plans to introduce restyled versions of medium-sized cars "Vista" and "Camry" in July at prices comparable to their old models. Isomura expressed hope that Toyota's car sales will expand in July, enabling the company to attain its sales goal of 2.16 million units this year.
