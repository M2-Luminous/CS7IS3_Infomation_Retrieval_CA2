This is a countermeasure against a similar move taken by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Last December, the U.S. department cut the extension period of licenses for six air routes operated by Japanese airlines from one year to 179 days, extending them until 9 June. The six air routes, whose opening was approved in a 1989 Japan-U.S. interim agreement, include a Tokyo-Washington route operated by Japan Air Lines [JAL] and a Tokyo-New York route by All Nippon Airways. A Transport Ministry official said: "It is unlikely the United States will revoke permission for Japanese airlines to extend their service to the United States beyond 9 June, but based on the principle of reciprocity, Japan has also set the expiration date at 9 June." The U.S. Department of Transportation gave notice it would "postpone" approval of a regular service between Sendai [in Miyagi Prefecture] and Hawaii, which JAL had been planning to inaugurate on 17 March. The notification was unusual in that it was made on 15 March, just two days before the opening of the service. The postponement did not mean the "rejection" of approval. But, because JAL was not allowed to operate regular flights on the route, it immediately asked the United States to allow it to fly a charter flight to carry passengers who had already booked seats on the scheduled flight. A Transport Ministry official said: "The U.S. postponement of approval apparently violates the 1989 accord." Nevertheless, the two sides have begun attempts to reduce the other's rights and interests in a feud over air services. A Miyagi Prefectural Government official said: "We do not know why, but the U.S. notification came so abruptly and it caused us much trouble." After notification, the prefectural government canceled a visit to Hawaii by the governor, which was planned to promote friendly relations between Sendai and Honolulu. This is an unfavorable development in light of exchanges between Japan and the United States. It is believed the United States has begun to take a hardline attitude as a strategy to assume the advantageous position in negotiations with Japan on beyond rights (which allow U.S. airlines to extend their routes beyond Japan to third countries). The two nations have long confronted each other over the interpretation of beyond rights. Japan asserts there is a great imbalance between its rights and interests over air services and the United States,' saying beyond rights, which were approved in 1952, are unequal and that a 1959 agreement established a framework in which the United States can freely increase its transportation capacity. On the other hand, the United States claims it can exercise free and unlimited rights, including beyond rights, for flights to Kansai International Airport in Osaka scheduled to open in September. In this way, it has begun to apply pressure on Japan. There is a great gap in assertions between the two countries. In aviation talks, Japan has been urged to make concessions while it has failed to obtain compromises from the United States. Even if it obtains concessions, Japan will not be able to use them effectively because of Japanese airlines' low management ability. This makes it difficult to resolve the aviation dispute. Nevertheless, it is not desirable for Japan and the United States to adopt tactics to reduce the other's rights and interests. The two nations should treat rights and interests over air services in such a way that they will be able to engender beneficial effects on both sides. Japan and the United States will be able to reach an agreement on the number of air routes between the two countries, a precondition in settling the aviation dispute, if they consider passengers before anything else. Japanese airlines need to enhance their competitiveness so people will choose them. On the other hand, the United States should take seriously the fact it has friction over aviation with not only Japan, but also many other countries; and, France and Thailand have scrapped their aviation agreements with the United States.
