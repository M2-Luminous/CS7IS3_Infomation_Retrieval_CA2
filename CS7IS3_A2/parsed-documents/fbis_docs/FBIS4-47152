"I did not get, however, any advice or recommendations from W. Alexander regarding our work," said BMVB head manager Farkhad Amirbekov. "This is understandable: The foreign currency exchange practically does not function, which means there are no problems worth discussing. Neither is there a foreign currency market as such in Azerbaijan today." Many questions in this area are awaiting resolution. F. Amirbekov noted that the two main components of the financial market in Azerbaijan--the interbank foreign currency market and the credit market closely associated with it, currently practically do not function. There is no free redistribution of noncash foreign currency, no normative acts of the National Bank regulating the foreign currency market, while the Law "On Foreign Currency Regulation," which the parliament has adopted, is still not operating. No system has been set up for hard currency earnings of enterprises to be redistributed between banks through unrestricted sale on the foreign currency market. Still unresolved are taxation issues for domestic and foreign enterprises on the territory of the republic that have foreign currency earnings. The Law "On Profit From Physical Persons" needs to be amended since in its current form it actually stimulates the growth of inflation. The work of the BMVB is also made more difficult by the fact that beginning in May this year a certain percentage of enterprises' hard currency earnings is to be sold to the state at the National Bank exchange rate and become part of the Common Foreign Currency Fund, while the remaining share is left with the enterprises. Thus, the National Bank does not have its own resources and revenue, and cannot act freely with respect to the exchangeable part of the Stabilization Fund's resources. In our opinion, it is necessary to transfer the Stabilization Fund to the sole jurisdiction of the National Bank and resolve the question of distribution of foreign currency. In this case the Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange will begin to function, too. It would also make sense to mandate selling a part of enterprises' foreign currency earnings through the foreign currency exchange, as is done in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Moldova.
