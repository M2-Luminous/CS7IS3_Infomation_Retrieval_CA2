Rather, it is important that action be taken within the framework of a common European Union [EU] security system against those who disrupt peace, and it is there that a neutral state can join. According to Vranitzky, there are many people, for whom "little Austria had always been shaky" in the confusion reigning during the period from World War I to the occupation. Neutrality then gave the people "for the first time the chance to breathe freely and say: We are free." According to Vranitzky, this attitude is a "healthy, positive feeling toward this state." Regarding Austria's negotiations with the EU, "this neutrality has not been called into question" in Brussels. Thus it has been made clear that Austria, as a neutral state in the EU, can participate in the establishment of a collective security system in Europe. This security system, for its part, envisages measures against those who disrupt peace, and neutral state can be a part of that. According to Vranitzky, a second referendum on neutrality as mentioned by Foreign Minister Mock, who was a guest at the EU party congress of the Greens, is not necessary. "Austrian Army abolisher" Pilz, on the other hand, is hinting at a "plan to abolish neutrality": Partial amputation now, final disposal of the rest two years later.
