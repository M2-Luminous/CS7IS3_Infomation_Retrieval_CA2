The Angolan government now occupies 80 percent of Cuito following another day of intense fighting. More than 50 people are believed to have died. Hence the peace process is threatened once more. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] wants the ban on the sale of arms and oil to be lifted. Luis Henrique Pereira reports. [Pereira] UNITA is accusing the Angolan Government of being solely responsible for the renewed fighting, mainly in the city of Cuito. In a communique signed by Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the UNITA team at the Lusaka talks, UNITA said that the negotiations are now inevitably affected by the fresh fighting on Saturday morning. If the situation deteriorates, UNITA has threatened to end the dialogue with the government because there is now much mistrust. UNITA also wants the sanctions preventing the sale of arms to UNITA to be lifted. The sanctions were ordered in September by the United Nations. Jorge Valentim said that Bosnias are being created in the UNITA areas. He added that one side is armed to its teeth and the other side is limited to buying arms [as heard]. [passage omitted]
