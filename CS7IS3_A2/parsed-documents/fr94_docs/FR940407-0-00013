$5.0 Footnotes 1 Size standards preceded by a dollar sign ($) are in millions of dollars of annual receipts. All others are in number of employees unless specified otherwise. 2 SIC code 1629_Dredging: To be considered small, a firm must perform the dredging of at least 40 percent of the yardage with its own dredging equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern. 3 SIC Division D_Manufacturing: ``Rebuilding on a factory basis or equivalent.'' For rebuilding machinery or equipment on a factory basis, use SIC code applicable for new manufactured product. The appropriate size standard is not limited to manufacturers. Ordinary repair services or preservation operations, however, are not considered rebuilding activities. 4 SIC code 2033: For purposes of Government procurement for food canning and preserving under SIC code 2033, the standard of 500 employees shall be exclusive of agricultural labor as defined in section (k) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 68A Stat. 454, 26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) 3306. 5 SIC code 2911: For purposes of Government procurement, the firm may not have more than 1,500 employees, nor may it have more than 75,000 barrels per day capacity. This capacity may be measured in terms of either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks or both, but the sum total of the various petroleum-based inputs into the process may not exceed 75,000 barrels. In addition to the direct-owned capacity of the concern in question, counted capacity will include any leased facilities or any facilities made available to the concern under an arrangement such as (but not limited to) an exchange agreement or a throughput, or other form, or processing agreement (whereby another party processes the concern's own crude or feedstocks). Such an arrangement would have the same effect as though such facilities had been leased, and this would have to be included in the concern's own capacity. The total product to be delivered in the performance of the contract must be at least 90 percent refined by the successful bidder from either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks. 6 SIC code 3011: For purposes of Government procurement, a firm is small for bidding on a contract for pneumatic tires within Census Classification codes 30111 and 30112, provided that: (1) The value of tires within Census Classification codes 30111 and 30112 which it manufactured in the United States during the previous calendar year is more than 50 percent of the value of its total worldwide manufacture, (2) the value of pneumatic tires within Census Classification codes 30111 and 30112 which it manufactured worldwide during the preceding calendar year was less than 5 percent of the value of all such tires manufactured in the United States during said period, and (3) the value of the principal product which it manufactured or otherwise produced, or sold worldwide during the preceding calendar year is less than 10 percent of the total value of such products manufactured or otherwise produced or sold in the United States during said period. 7 SIC code 4212: The component ``Garbage and Refuse, Collecting and Transporting, Without Disposal'' shall have a size standard of $6.0 million. This is the same size standard as SIC code 4953, Refuse Systems. 8 Offshore Marine Services: The applicable size standard shall be $20.5 million for firms furnishing specific transportation services to concerns engaged in offshore oil and/or natural gas exploration, drilling production, or marine research; such services encompass passenger and freight transportation, anchor handling, and related logistical services to and from the work site or at sea. 9 SIC codes 4512, 4513, and 4522: Includes passenger or cargo transportation requiring the use of one or more helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft. This does not include offshore marine transportation services as defined in footnote 8. 10 SIC codes 4724 and 6531: As measured by total revenues, but excluding funds received in trust for an unaffiliated third party, such as bookings or sales subject to commissions. The commissions received would be included as revenue. 11SIC code 4953: ``Garbage and Refuse, Collecting and Transporting, Without Disposal,'' a component of SIC code 4212, has the same size standard as SIC code 4953. 12SIC code 5599: For retail firms whose principal line of business is the retail sale of aircraft, a $7.5 million size standard shall apply. 13Most in Division H: Finance, Insurance and Real Estate_are excluded from SBA assistance. 14Major Group 60: As measured by total assets. 15Major Group 65_Leasing of building space to the Federal Government by Owners: For the purpose of Government procurement, a size standard of $15.0 million in gross receipts is established for owners of building space that is leased to the Federal Government. The standard for these procurements shall apply to the owner of the property and not to those acting as an agent for the owner. There is no size standard concerning the agent in a leasing arrangement. 16Division J_Services: For all industries not specifically listed in this division, the size standard is $5.0 million. 17SIC codes 7699 and 3728: Contracts for the rebuilding or overhaul of aircraft ground support equipment on a contract basis will be classified under SIC code 3728. 18SIC code 8731: For research and development contracts requiring the delivery of a manufactured product, the appropriate size standard to use is that of the manufacturing industry in which the specific products is classified. Research and Development, as defined in the SIC Manual, means laboratory or other physical research and development on a contractor fee basis. Research and development for purposes of size determinations does not include the following: economic, educational, engineering, operations, systems, or other nonphysical research; or computer programming, data processing, commercial and/or medical laboratory testing. For purposes of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program only, a different definition has been established by law. See ¬ß121.7 of these regulations. Research and development for guided missiles and space vehicles includes evaluation and simulation, and other services requiring thorough knowledge of complete missiles and spacecraft. 19Facilities Management, a component of SIC code 8744, has the following definition: Establishments, not elsewhere classified, which provide overall management and the personnel to perform a variety of related support services in operating a complete facility in or around a specific building, or within another business or Government establishment. Facilities management means furnishing three or more personnel supply services which may include, but are not limited to, secretarial services, typists, telephone answering, reproduction or mimeograph service, mailing service, financial or business management, public relations, conference planning, travel arrangements, word processing, maintaining files and/or libraries, switchboard operation, writers, bookkeeping, minor office equipment maintenance and repair, use of information systems (not programming), etc. 20SIC code 8744: If one of the activities of base maintenance, as defined below, can be identified with a separate industry, and that activity (or industry) accounts for 50 percent or more of the value of an entire contract, then the proper size standard shall be that for the particular industry, and not the base maintenance size standard. ``Base Maintenance'' constitutes three or more separate activities. The activities may be either service or special trade construction related activities. As services, these activities must each be in a separate industry. These activities may include, but are not limited to, such separate maintenance activities as Janitorial and Custodial Service, Protective Guard Service, Commissary Service, Fire Prevention Service, Safety Engineering Service, Messenger Service, and Grounds Maintenance and Landscaping Service. If the contract involves the use of special trade contractors (plumbing, painting, plastering, carpentering, etc.) all such specialized special trade construction activities will be considered a single activity, which is Base Housing Maintenance. This is only one activity of base maintenance and two additional activities must be present for the contract to be considered base maintenance. The size standard for Base Housing Maintenance is $7 million, the same size standard as for Special Trade Contractors. 21The size standard for map drafting services, mapmaking (including aerial), and photogrammetric mapping services, part of SIC code 7389, is $3.5 million. 22Million megawatt hours.
