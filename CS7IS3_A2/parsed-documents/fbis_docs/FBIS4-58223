He made the remark a few minutes ago in a conversation with Israeli reporters in Doha, upon the opening of the multinational talks on arms control. Our correspondent in Qatar Netan'el Semrik is on the telephone line from Qatar with the gist of the first-ever interview a Qatari foreign minister gave the Israeli media: [Semrik] Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur al-Thani, the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Qatari Emirate, smiled at the Israeli cameras and told the Israeli microphones that in principle he does not oppose visiting Israel. Everything depends on the pace of the progress of the talks on all the other tracks, he said. [Begin recording] [Al-Thani, in English] Well, I cannot answer this question but if everything goes well in all the peace process on the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks, then I do not see there is any problem. [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Would you like to invite the Israeli prime minister here to Qatar? [Al-Thani, laughing, in English] Thank you very much. [end recording] [Semrik] The minister said he cannot answer the question on whether he would like to visit Israel, but he has no problem in doing so, provided the talks on the Israeli-Syrian-Lebanese tracks make proper progress.
