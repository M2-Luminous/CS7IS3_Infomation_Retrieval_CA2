The ambassador in Islamabad [Staes] failed to inform the Ministry about the official issuing of a visa, Claes told the parliamentary foreign affairs committee on Wednesday [12 January]. Do not underestimate the consequences of the affair, said Claes, also regarding my own safety. Claes was questioned once again by Agalev [Flemish Ecology Party] Senator Magda Aelvoet about the issuing of a visa to Amanullah Khan, president of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). Khan was arrested with that visa in his pocket when he came to Brussels on 18 October, at the invitation of the Socialist Group of the European Parliament. Following a negative response by the call for his extradition to India, he was put on a plane back to Pakistan toward the end of December. Claes said Staes had confirmed on 20 October that the visa had officially been issued without consulting the central list of wanted persons (CBS), and that he (Staes) himself had approved the issuing of visas to the Khan party. In order to prove this, Claes showed the cable Staes sent him on the above-mentioned date. He refuted allegations of having quoted only selected passages from the cable from Staes in answer to questions in the parliamentary committees on 3 November. An internal inquiry is still under way.
