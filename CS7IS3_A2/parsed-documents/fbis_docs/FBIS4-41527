According to well-informed sources, the conflicting sides are unlikely to sign an agreement on a cease-fire for the period of the Tehran talks. However, the negotiating parties still hope to break the deadlock. The second round of Tajik talks is expected to result in signing a protocol to reiterate the commitment of both the former Soviet republic's government and anti-government forces to a political settlement of their differences at the negotiating table, the U.N. special envoy for Tajikistan told TASS on Sunday [26 June]. Another protocol is expected to be signed with a view to set up a joint commission, which will discuss settlement issues in periods between the rounds of talks. This commission will work in Moscow. In their respective interviews with TASS, the negotiating parties accused each other of dragging out the talks and rejecting any compromises. A Russian observer noted, however, that the opposition leaders could give up linking the proposed cease-fire to political amnesty in Tajikistan, termination of criminal proceedings against political detainees and freedom to political parties and the press. The government delegation agrees to these demands in principle, but stresses that a cease-fire should come first.
