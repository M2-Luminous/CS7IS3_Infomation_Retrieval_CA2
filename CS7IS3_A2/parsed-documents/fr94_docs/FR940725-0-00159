FR940725-0-00159 FR940725-0-00019 The scope has been expanded to cover land-side confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres in the shipyard as well as vessels and vessel sections, in other words, all of shipyard employment. The original section covered employees engaged in shiprepairing, with certain sections covering only shipbreaking. OSHA proposed to expand coverage to all shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and ship repair (53 FR 48094) and with the reopening of the record OSHA sought comment on expanding the scope to all shipyard employment. OSHA requested public comment on whether permits should be required for hot-work in all of shipyard employment, and, if so, whether the permits need to be posted (57 FR 28155, June 24, 1992). Over 30 commenters responded (Ex. 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;21, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;27, 11&hyph;28, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;36, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;38, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;40, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;43, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;34, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;47, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;51, 11&hyph;53). Most of the comments set forth the steps that must be taken before hot work may be done, regardless of whether a formal permit is issued. They noted that the spaces must be evaluated and tested to determine their conditions before entry or hot work can begin. For confined spaces determined to be ``safe for hot work,'' they said a certificate is issued by a Marine Chemist and posted at the work site. They asserted that this practice is followed throughout the maritime industry. Most indicated that requiring hot work permits in addition to the certificate would not increase the safety of hot work. The need for hot work permits in shipyards was considered and unanimously rejected by SESAC at their September 3, 1992, meeting (Tr. 470). Chairman Linwood Temple, CMC, argued that a permit system would be useless and less protective (SESAC, Tr. September 3, 1992, 468&hyph;469). Lt. Commander Joe Ocken from the 5th Coast Guard District testified that OSHA ``should not *␣*␣* take the general industry standard language [on permits] and carry that over into 1915.12'' (SESAC Tr. September 3, 1992, 461). Captain Lawrence Reed, representing NIOSH, stated that he shared: *␣*␣* The concern of Lt. Commander Joe Ocken *␣*␣* that some [of the provisions of the permit required confined space standard] *␣*␣* are less protective than the existing language of 1915.14 and [that he] would propose we go with the existing 1915.14. (SESAC Tr. September 3, 1992, 467&hyph;468) Mr. Charles Klein, representing Newport News Shipbuilding, stated: *␣*␣* What the shipbuilding industry and shiprepairing industry is doing right now with respect to confined spaces is working fine. The number of explosions that you see, the number of fatalities that you see, are virtually nil, and that would suggest that the existing language that's found in 1915 is more than adequate, and, in fact, probably would be better taken over to the general industry than what is proposed for general industry. (SESAC Tr. September 3, 1992, 465&hyph;466) Mr. Lou D'Ambrosio, representing the Washington and Northern Idaho District Council of Laborers' International Union of North America, agreed that the permit system would be less protective (SESAC Tr. September 3, 1992, 469). OSHA has considered the evidence and agrees with the SESAC consensus that workers in shipyard employment are adequately protected by the current hot work standards, without the need for a permit system. Shipyards are unique in that they rely on Marine Chemist and competent persons to oversee confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. In many locations, a Marine Chemist is required to issue a certificate before any hot work can be done. The Marine Chemist Certificate can only be issued when conditions within and adjacent to spaces which have contained a flammable or combustible gas or material have been cleaned and inspected and found to be safe (gas free). Moreover, the certificate specifies other requirements for entry and work such as ventilation, fire watch placement, and personal protective equipment, and requires a competent person to reinspect and test the space as directed in order to maintain the conditions of the Marine Chemist certificate. Similarly, the competent person cannot grant permission for hot work in those locations that he or she is allowed to test and certify until the conditions are safe for hot work. In addition, both the Marine Chemist and the competent person are required to produce written certifications that must be posted, as required in §§1915.14(a)(2) and 1915.7(d) (1) and (2) respectively. As added protection, the Marine Chemist requires a competent person to recheck the space to ensure that conditions do not change. If there is a change in the space, the competent person must stop work and recall the Marine Chemist to recertify that the space is safe for hot work before work can restart. These certifications and recordings are comparable to permits, in that an employee may not perform hot work in a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere until a certificate is issued. OSHA is persuaded that the current requirements, modified for clarity, provide protection comparable to §1910.146 to employees in the shipyard. Therefore, OSHA is not requiring hot work permits in subpart B.
