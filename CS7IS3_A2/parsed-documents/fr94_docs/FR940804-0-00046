ACTION: Prohibition of retention. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting retention of thornyhead rockfish in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and is requiring that incidental catches be treated in the same manner as prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary because the thornyhead rockfish total allowable catch (TAC) in this area has been reached. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), August 1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the TAC for thornyhead rockfish in the GOA was established by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 1,180 metric tons. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined in accordance with ยง672.20(c)(3), that the TAC for thornyhead rockfish in the GOA has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of thornyhead rockfish in the GOA be treated as prohibited species in accordance with ยง672.20(e), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t. August 1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.
