Brig. Joseph Henry Smith, commander of security operations in northern Ghana told a press conference in Tamale, about 405 miles north of Accra, that security agencies were searching for more bodies. He said the military was gradually taking control of the situation and has started disarming the warring factions. Brig. Smith said more than 2,000 shot guns have been seized. He said the number of deaths cannot be estimated because many people who have been killed in the bush or have died in their rooms when their villages were burned were yet to be found. Brig. Smith said a national emergency committee under the chairmanship of the minister of defence, Mahama Iddrisu, has been established to bring the ethnic fighting in the region under control.
