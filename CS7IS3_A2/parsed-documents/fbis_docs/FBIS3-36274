The topic of our discussion, of course, is the report prepared by the Reform Fund and the Russian Academy of Sciences Economics Department, which is entitled "Social and Economic Transformation in Russia: The Contemporary Situation and New Approaches." As I understand it, it is an analysis of the past two years and a forecast for actions in the future. [Shatalin] Yes, indeed, the report analyses what has happened during the past two years and makes the initial conclusions, that the tasks set by the government to reform our economy have not been fulfilled. I would like to be understood correctly. We -- I mean myself, naturally, and my colleagues and work comrades -- are all supporters of a market economy. These are not empty words and so I totally reject any labels in this regard. Problems about changing to a market economy do not exist. This must be understood once and for all. Nobody supports a retreat and there is no going back. In this sense, as we see it, our report gives a fairly concentrated view of [words indistinct]. What do they consist of? We declare -- or demand if you wish -- that there needs to be a distinctive public agreement, a social agreement, between all levels of society on the social cost of the reforms. There must be parameters, such social indicators as living standards; spending on science, on health, on culture, on education; the employment level; and other parameters which any reformer in carrying out any policy, be it a monetary or nonmonetary or supra-monetary policy, must not exceed. He must... [Lomakin, interrupting] In other words, something must be immutable. [Shatalin] Something needs to be like a wall which cannot be destroyed. It is a limit within the framework of which you have a right to act. Do everything else you want, reform the economy, but this is the boundary which cannot be crossed. We consider that the people should be told honestly and frankly what will happen and when, without deceit, in a sober and calm way. I cannot say that we have said everything, but nevertheless we have outlined the main contours of economic development. We support the creation of a socially oriented economy. This is not demagoguery. This kind of economy was created by (Ludwig Herford) and economies of this kind exist in Europe and beyond. This is a highly efficient economy and in terms of its motivation and development vectors, so to speak, it is aimed at putting people at the forefront, at ensuring a social orientation and motivation. In other words, we would have an economy which clearly works to improve the standard of living and which organically combines economic efficiency and social justice. It is extremely difficult to find a balance between these two facets. The world has searched for it as have entire civilizations. Europe, Sweden, Austria, France, and Great Britain are searching for it. And in this, everything depends on professionalism, not on ideological affiliations. Professionalism permits the fusion of economic efficiency with social justice. We support the idea of adequate government intervention, intervention which distinguishes between various spheres. The agrarian sector is one thing while financial and credit policy is another. Pricing policy is one thing while taxation issues are another. There are also foreign economic relations, and so forth. Adequate solutions must be found in various spheres and these are mechanisms of government regulation of the economy. We oppose revolution. Enough. Whoever it is, I do not want to name any names now. I do not want to associate the reforms being carried out in Russia with any names. This is not the crux of the problem. The crux of the problem lies essentially in what we are doing. What we began doing in 1992 is, if you wish, a new revolution. Berdyayev, who I am very fond of, said that revolutions are never successful. The course of the economic revolution in Russia during the past two years shows that Russia's latest revolution has not been successful. [Lomakin] Excuse me, I have to interrupt you since we do not have all that much time, but I have a question which I am simply obliged to ask you. I have the Saturday, 29 January issue of IZVESTIYA and its front page headline reads: Gorbachev Era Economic Advisers Propose Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin a New Life in the Old Style. It deals with your report, prepared by Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, Abalkin, and Petrakov, but to put it mildly very little of your report comes through here. So this is the first criticism to be leveled at it. Have you published your report anywhere? Have you read this article? [Shatalin] Yes, I have read it. My colleagues showed it to me today after their Sunday day off. It includes a lot of lies and distortions. It says that IZVESTIYA was the first to get this report. This is a lie. The first real copy of this report, not a manuscript of the report, was received by Russian Federation President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin on Friday, 28 January. Yesterday we sent this report to the Russian Government. The report was sent to the Federal Assembly and we plan to send it to all the papers, and so forth. I do not know how IZVESTIYA managed to get this report. Moreover, you know, there is another unpleasant side to this. This kind of criticism immediately gives the discussion an unbusinesslike tone. After all, we are talking about problems which are vitally important to Russia and the people and this kind of criticism does not help a calm discussion of the problems. It creates a neo-Bolshevist tone. I would say that rather than write Gorbachev Era Economic Advisers Propose Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin a New Life in the Old Style, they should have written Enemies of the People Propose Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin a New Life in the Old Style. It would have given it more sting, right? It is understandable, because this kind of newspaper is already calling us enemies of the people. Since you mention IZVESTIYA, I will add that previously I respected it very highly and the journalists and staff who work there too. You know that, unfortunately, now more and more newspapers...[pauses] I have forgotten its name. Previously it was DEN, now it is called POZAVCHERA [DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY], I cannot remember, or POSLEZAVTRA [DAY AFTER TOMORROW]. I cannot remember exactly. This does not do the paper any credit. I do not know how my colleagues will react to this criticism, that is their problem. I am not at all surprised that certain names are being bandied around. The main thing is that this kind of statement is an obstacle to the real task. [Lomakin] Stanislav Sergeyevich, would it not be better to wait until the specialists actually read the report and become familiar with it, until the president has familiarized himself with the report and the government and parliamentary deputies familiarize themselves with it, and then discuss it. I think that this would be the normal course of action. [Shatalin] This is precisely what we expect. We are not monopolists. We write about this honestly. We do not have a monopoly on the truth and nobody else does. We support a really calm, professional discussion of this report without any political hysterics and, if there is anything sensible in it, that can promote the beginning of a real market reform of our economy, personally I would only be happy. [Lomakin] I am sure that is exactly what will happen. Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, academician and president of the International Reform Fund. Today we talked about the report which this fund, together with the Russian Academy of Sciences Economics Department, has presented to the top people in our state for discussion. Thank you. [Shatalin] Thank you.
