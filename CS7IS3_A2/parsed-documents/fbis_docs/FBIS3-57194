He held a meeting with Estonian President Lennart Meri today. One of the key aims of Lamassoure's visit is to make preparations for the European stability pact's opening conference in the Baltic states. For Estonia, the main political importance of the European stability pact--or the so-called Balladur initiative--comes from the fact that the pact views the Baltic states as possible European Union members for the first time. Lamassoure will be leaving Estonia at noon today. He will travel on to Latvia and Lithuania.
