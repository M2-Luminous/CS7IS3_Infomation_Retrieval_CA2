FBIS4-30270 "dreas123_j_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 Indonesia Protests Against Publications Ban Reported Protests Against Publications Ban Reported `Violently' Broken Up BK2706060094 Hong Kong AFP in English 0545 GMT 27 Jun 94 BK2706060094 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Excerpts] Jakarta, June 27 (AFP) -- Baton-wielding police and soldiers violently broke up a demonstration Monday involving some 300 demonstrators protesting the Indonesian Government's suspension of three popular weekly newspapers. At least 10 people were arrested and at least several were injured and bleeding after being struck by security personnel in a main street here, witnesses said. Police said there were only four arrests, however. Hundreds of police in anti-riot gear and soldiers in combat fatigues and black T-shirts with "Operation Cleansing 1994" written on them descended on the demonstrators as they marched toward the Information Ministry. Many of the marchers were seen being beaten and kicked. The head of the Central Jakarta police station, Lieutenant-Colonel Dadang Garnida, said at the site of the protest that security personnel had no choice but to use "force" because the demonstrators ignored their demand to disperse. The demonstrators -- students, human rights activists and journalists -- held similar protests in front of the information ministry on the three previous days after the government revoked the licences of three popular weekly newspapers last Tuesday. [passage omitted covered by previously filed items] About two kilometres (a mile) away from the site of the demonstration, a group of 150 pro-government supporters favouring the ban on the weeklies gathered for about 45 minutes before dispersing peacefully, witnesses said. At the same time, lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution of the Legal Aid Foundation, a human rights organisation, was supposed to lead representatives of three weeklies to new talks with Information Ministry officials. A first meeting, with Director-General Subrata, took place Thursday. Nasution warned earlier that protests against the ban would spread across Indonesia unless it was lifted.
