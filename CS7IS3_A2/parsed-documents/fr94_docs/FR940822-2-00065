FR940822-2-00065 FR940822-2-00048 The ACLI represents that presently, of the $1.5 trillion in general account assets of domestic life insurance companies, more than $558 billion relate to life insurance, health insurance and a broad variety of annuity products purchased by employee benefit plans. General account contracts, unlike all other investment and funding vehicles offered to plans, provide risk pooling, guarantees of principal and rates of return, as well as benefit guarantees, all of which are backed by every dollar in the general account. The Applicant further states that it is this pooling and assumption of risk that distinguish insurance companies from typical investment firms and for which the state insurance regulatory agencies impose stringent reserve and capital requirements. Like any other business, insurance companies have developed new products to compete in an ever changing marketplace. In the pension area, various forms of participating general account contracts, especially deposit administration and immediate participation guarantee contracts, were specifically developed to be responsive to the expressed needs of plan sponsors. The ACLI states that even before enactment of ERISA, participating general account contracts provided a unique balance of investment participation and protection, as well as many billions of dollars of benefits to plan participants and beneficiaries. Participating contracts allow contractholders to share in the general accounts' favorable investment, mortality and morbidity experience, to obtain protection from unfavorable experience, and to provide certainty and dependability for the payment of benefits to participants and beneficiaries. According to the ACLI, these factors have enabled plan sponsors to fund their benefit promises and to increase the benefits to plan participants and beneficiaries. Since the Supreme Court rendered its decision in Harris Trust , the legal landscape applicable to general account activities has been significantly altered. The ACLI represents that the Court's decision has created uncertainty regarding the status of general account operations and activities under ERISA-governed plans and will have a long-term adverse effect on plan participants, the U.S. economy and the insurance industry in the absence of exemptive relief. The ACLI notes that insurance companies invest approximately $675 billion of general account assets in the economy each year and that this is one of the largest sources of capital available in the United States, particularly for smaller and medium-sized businesses which are the source of most of the new job creation in our country. The Applicant states that the decision in Harris Trust has begun to slow, if not totally disrupt, the nation's capital markets. Investment bankers, brokers and banks, as well as insurance companies, are all now hesitant to engage in common, commercially reasonable and economically beneficial business transactions for fear of inadvertently violating ERISA's prohibited transaction restrictions. The Applicant believes that without the relief requested in its application, many ordinary practices of the insurance industry could be called into question. The ACLI has requested unconditional retroactive relief from January 1, 1975, for all transactions that may be viewed as having been prohibited because insurance company general accounts may have held plan assets, as well as certain other transactions that may be viewed as having become prohibited merely as the result of an ERISA covered plan's purchase of a participating general account contract. The ACLI states that, although it is not possible to identify with specificity the types of transactions to be covered by the proposed exemption, such transactions would include (but are not limited to) the following: (A) all internal operations of the general account (internal transactions); (B) all investment transactions involving general account assets, including transactions between the general account and a party in interest with respect to a plan that has purchased a general account contract; and (C) the purchase by the general account of securities issued by and real property leased to employers of employees covered by plans that have purchased general account contracts. Internal Transactions The ACLI represents that general accounts engage in a variety of internal activities which, given the application of ERISA, could potentially be viewed as prohibited. For example, income and losses generated by general account investments are allocated among lines of business (or, where applicable, among segments) or to surplus. Decisions must be made regarding the use of surplus, i.e., whether and to what extent to use surplus to pay dividends to policyholders or stockholders. In addition, general operational business decisions relating to salaries and benefits for the employees of the insurer, the provision of office space and materials, advertising expenses, charitable contributions, etc., could also be transactions subject to ERISA due to the pooled nature of general account assets. Thus, the ACLI represents that conceivably any of the myriad of decisions made by an insurance company regarding the structuring or internal operation of its business would need exemptive relief. In addition, the ACLI notes that many insurance companies use affiliates to provide investment management or property management services with regard to general account properties and assets.
