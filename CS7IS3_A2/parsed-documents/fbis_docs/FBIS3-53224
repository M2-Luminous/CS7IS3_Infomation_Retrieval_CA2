The petroleum ministers of the six Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] countries will meet in Bahrain next week to study the outcome of efforts by the Omani petroleum minister. He is contacting non-OPEC members in a bid to urge them to reduce production. Oil sources have described the Omani minister's contacts as important. Oman is among the non-OPEC members that have accepted reducing production by five percent. Following the drop in oil prices and after meeting the Qatari energy minister, who is also the OPEC secretary general, the Omani petroleum minister left on a series of visits to Yemen, Egypt, Syria, Norway, Britain, and Russia--all non-OPEC countries--and gained their agreement, Norway and Britain excepted, to reduce production. After the recent GCC summit and the statement of readiness by the GCC heads to reduce oil production, the issue of agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC members has become more serious. Iran has said it is ready to reduce oil production, stressing that a decision to reduce production can be made within the OPEC framework. Many oil experts believe that in addition to the economic recession in the West and the West's oil policies, the drop in oil prices is also linked with increased production by non-OPEC members. This has led to efforts to convince these countries to reduce production in a coordinated manner. The Omani petroleum minister will continue his mission with visits to Brunei, Malaysia, and Mexico within the next few days. The reduction in oil prices has already affected the budgets of the Persian Gulf Arab countries and made Saudi Arabia, which is the largest oil producer, review its military projects and its astronomic arms purchases. The reduction in the budgets and the scrapping of ambitious military plans by the Persian Gulf countries means a drop in foreign purchases, placing economic pressure on the West's industries and military and nonmilitary finances. So, the Western countries will gradually pay for the damages that their policies on the oil-producing countries have caused. KUNA reported that the Kuwaiti petroleum minister will discuss oil developments and ways to control oil prices at the meeting of the GCC foreign [as heard] ministers in Bahrain. This shows that in addition to its impact on the economy of the Arab oil-producing countries, the reduction in oil prices may have domestic political consequences for them if left uncontrolled.
