Meanwhile the terrorists were shocked by the reports, which caused them to issue a statement on Tuesday announcing a halt to their operations for a week. However, the escape of three terrorists, among them Tal'at Yasin Hammam (Islamic Group), arouses questions about whether these fugitive are capable of carrying out new operations. What is your opinion? [Al-Alfi] Anything is possible in the situation we are going to talk about. The terrorists' method is "hit and run." It is a base method which reflects weakness, not strength. A strong organization does what it wants whenever it wants and wherever it wants, regardless of the losses. But we note that the Terrorists' method does not indicate any sign of strength at all. For our part, we are constantly directing strikes against terrorist schemes, the most recent of which was the arrest of the bombings organization. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Sami'] It is said that terrorism poses a threat to all Arab and Islamic states. To what extent are Pakistani authorities cooperating in this connection, and are there any positive signs in this cooperation under the new government there? [Al-Alfi] Contacts with Pakistan are still continuing. ['Abd-al-Sami'] Has there been any positive development under the new government headed by Benazir Bhutto, which has no fundamentalist link, in contrast to the former government of Nawaz Sharif? [Al-Alfi] To some extent. ['Abd-al-Sami'] What do you mean by "to some extent?" [Al-Alfi] I mean there is a positive development. ['Abd-al-Sami'] Has that development produced tangible results? [Al-Alfi] Yes, it has produced tangible results, but these matters cannot be discussed in the press. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Sami'] Have you detected any form of Sudanese or Iranian support for recent terrorist activities in Egypt? [Al-Alfi] It is known that there is support, and there is information whose details are being examined. States are actually involved in these actions. And some states are not interested in confronting what is happening on their territory in this connection with decisive measures. However, I tell you that many cases are under investigation or being heard in the court. And it is in the interests of the investigation not to say who is behind these operations or reveal information in this connection, so that all elements can be completed. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Sami'] How do you view Libyan allegations that U.S. and Israeli intelligence services kidnapped al-Kikhya to give these states the right to escalate their campaign against Libya and hit it? [Al-Alfi] So far none of what has been said has proved to be true. On that issue, I would like to say that al-Kikhya came to Egypt with an Algerian passport to attend a conference. He did not inform us of that. Besides, he is not a political refugee in Egypt. Any political refugee in Egypt is provided with protection, surveillance, and security. Al-Kikhya did not request any security. And he was not one of those requiring protection, because he was not resident in Egypt. He came as an ordinary person of foreign nationality, then left the country. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Sami'] How do you view the effect of the future situation in Gaza on security in Egypt, especially as regards the possibility of some terrorists' infiltrating via the Rafah crossing point if the Palestinian-Israeli disagreement over who should control this crossing point leads to a formula resulting in loopholes in control measures? [Al-Alfi] There are security preparations everywhere, especially the outlets and borders in Egypt: east, west, north, and south; on land, at sea, and in the air. I have set up a special department called the outlets department headed by an assistant minister in order to supply the outlets with the latest equipment to detect falsification and forgery, uncover wanted people and smuggled and banned items, and arrest those who infiltrate the borders. This is to be coordinated with the border guard in the Armed Forces. We have no fears over the possibility of some terrorists' infiltrating, for two reasons: First, we are in control of our side of the Rafah crossing point. This side will obviously not be subjected to any change, regardless of the formula reached between the Palestinians and the Israelis vis-a-vis control over the other side in the negotiations concerning the implementation of the declaration of principles agreement. Second, both the PLO and Israel are eager to control security in Gaza, and it cannot be said that one of them is more interested in the matter than the other. There is complete agreement that the peace agreement's success requires complete vigilance, because any terrorist schemes through the Rafah crossing point would have a bigger negative impact on the future of peace between the Palestinians and Israel than on the situation in Egypt. ['Abd-al-Sami'] I am asking that question in particular because there are fears that a relationship might be established between extremist elements from Hamas, for example, and terrorists in Egypt. [Al-Alfi] We are taking account of all that. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Sami'] Quantities of arms and explosives are seized whenever terrorist dens are attacked. Where do the extremists get these quantities of arms and explosives, when there are tight restrictions imposed on the arms trade and quarries? [Al-Alfi] A major part of them comes from the remnants of the past wars in Sinai. To this day we are still seizing dens in Sinai containing huge quantities of all types of arms, explosives, and ammunition. This is why a comprehensive survey of these areas has been launched to destroy this dangerous source, which is used by terrorists and other criminals. [passage omitted]
