In his opinion, he said, a number of views expressed by the Russian president's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, and by Russia's Foreign Ministry recently "look odd." However on the whole, Januska said, Moscow's reaction to the letter sent by the Lithuanian authorities to NATO, with the request to consider the possibility of admitting Lithuania to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, "is quite natural for Russia," and it "testifies to some vestiges of the past in Russian thinking." According to him, even the highest echelons of power in Russia evidently have not completely shed their notion of NATO as a "hostile bloc." Lithuania's decision to become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was prompted by the circumstance that the country "is not in a position to ensure full security for itself on its own," the deputy foreign minister explained. "We view NATO as the only guarantor of stability and security in Europe, and therefore we appeal to that organization," he said. "The strengthening of nationalist and expansionist forces in Russian politics gave rise to some anxiety" in Lithuania, the diplomat said. "To some extent, this is what prompted us to search for other means to ensure our security, but our striving (to join NATO - IF note) must not be explained only with this," he noted. According to Januska, sometimes Moscow tries to pretend that the desire of Russia's neighbor countries to join NATO provides the nationalist forces in Russia itself with trump cards. "If we continue to be in fear of aggravating frictions within Russia, we simply will not be able to uphold our own interests," he said. Lithuania is prepared to cooperate with the Russian Federation within the framework of the "partnership for peace" concept worked out by NATO, the deputy foreign minister said. He added, however, that Lithuania's ultimate goal is to be a "full-fledged member" of that organization.
