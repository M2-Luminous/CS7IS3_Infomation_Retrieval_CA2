Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) command and Yasushi Akashi to immediately order the deblockade of the bridge over the Sava river, close to Stara Gradiska, and warned that the population of the region will no longer tolerate such conduct which is pushing them towards death. The Stara Gradiska bridge links the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK -- formed by the local Serbs in parts of Croatia where they are in the majority in response to Croatia's secession from the former Yugoslav Federation), and the Srpska republic (RS) in the territory of ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. "By blocking the Pakrac-Okucani-Gradiska route, viewed by the Serb people as their sole lifeline, UNPROFOR has severed the supply of food and humanitarian aid, and halted the transport of the seriously ill to medical centres in RS and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," says the protest letter. The letter asks whether "the peacekeepers were deployed in this region to maintain a cease-fire and help in establishing a lasting and just peace, or if they were brought in to threaten the Serb people." RSK Deputy Prime Minister Branko Lubovac told Serbian radio Obrenovac that the Serb side fully controls the situation on the bridge and expressed hope that it will be resolved in a peaceful way, which depends on UNPROFOR. He said that the Serbs have always been willing to take part in a dialogue and expressed hope that Friday's top level meeting between the representatives of RSK and UNPROFOR will give concrete solutions to the current situation. Over 4,000 U.N. troops from Jordan, Argentina and Nepal have been deployed in western Slavonija, which is within the sector west of the U.N. Protected Area (UNPA).
