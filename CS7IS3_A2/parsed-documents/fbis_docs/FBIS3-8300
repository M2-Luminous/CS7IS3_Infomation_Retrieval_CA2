Here is a military-political commentary by Slavoljub Susic: [Susic] It is indicative that almost all new peace proposals for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina are followed by requests to increase the UN military contingent to supervise the implementation of these proposals. Does this mean that there is an a priori doubt about the effectiveness of the offered solutions that are drafted most frequently according to the interests of foreign factors? Let us recall that the failure of Cutiliero's plan in Lisbon in 1991 was followed by the dispatch of the first battalion of the UN Blue Helmets to Sarajevo -- consisting of soldiers from France, Ukraine, and Egypt -- with the task of securing the airport for the delivery of humanitarian aid. After the London conference on the former Yugoslavia in August of the same year, NATO's offer to protect relief convoys in Bosnia under the UN mandate was accepted. By the end of 1992, there were about 7,000 UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina from 10 member countries of the Western military alliance. After Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac, and Srebrenica were declared protected zones in May 1993, the Security Council decided to increase the existing contingent with an additional 7,600 troops. This was not fully realized. After the well-known Geneva plans for the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia, offered during 1993, there were about 12,000 Blue Helmets in Bosnia and more than 26,000 troops on the territory of the entire former Yugoslavia. That year, more than $1 billion was spent on their mission. In order to ensure the implementation of the Security Council resolutions adopted so far and the agreements reached by the warring parties, including the agreement reached on the creation of the Muslim-Croat federation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina in Washington this week, with a possibility of including it in a confederation with Croatia, Mr. Akashi, special envoy of the UN secretary general, and General Cot, the chief commander of the peace forces, are asking for an additional 10,650 troops. If this request, which is also strongly favored by British General Michael Rose, commander of the peace forces in Bosnia, is met, then the mission on the territory of the former Yugoslavia with nearly 40,000 deployed troops and other staff would be the largest and the most expensive peace operation by the United Nations since its founding. Judging by the mood in Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic, it appears that the request for additional forces will not be met. Russia has offered to send another 300 troops to Bosnia in addition to the 400 troops already deployed there. This has been received with visible uneasiness in the West. The United States, on the other hand, sees its contribution in support to the air force's mission, remaining consistent with its view not to send land forces to the Bosnian nightmare before an effective peace agreement acceptable to all three sides in the conflict has been reached. One could not object to this at all if the U.S. policy was in line with this stand. However, it is known that Washington favors the Muslims and the Croats in particular. This is confirmed by the latest separate agreement between these two sides without the participation of the third, the Serbian side. Thus, the fear of the possible renewal of the Muslim-Croatian coalition, which, supported by powerful protectors, could renew and even expand territorial and other demands to the detriment of the Serbs, is justifiable. The old slogan that there are many Russians and us will not be of much help to the Serbs, because one must take into account the fact that Russia as an indisputably big and influential power has strategic interests in the Balkans as a whole, as well as partnership relations with the United States and other developed countries in the West. Therefore, our expectations should not exceed the level of that reality. Russia would do enough if it contributes to the halting of further experimenting with the peoples in this region by the creators of the new world order and if it helps in finding a compromise solution acceptable to all sides. In that case even a symbolic contingent of UN peace forces would be sufficient.
