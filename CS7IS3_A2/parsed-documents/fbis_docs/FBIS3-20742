What does the establishment of telephone connections between Belgrade and Zagreb really mean? It means that the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] will have to be connected with Zagreb. If that happens, then we will some day see Croatian police in the middle of Knin again. Then it will be too late." This was Rade Leskovac, president of Seselj's Radicals in Knin, commenting on the signing of the declaration on the normalization of relations between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. We talked to him at the Serbian Army Center in Knin, where he and his followers were assessing the "situation following the endorsement of the betrayal of the republic of Serbian Krajina." [Meler] What did you decide at the meeting? [Leskovac] Without doubt, it is almost obvious that Milosevic and Tudjman have done everything to stay in power, regardless of the circumstances. To put it more simply: Milosevic has sold out his people in Krajina to remove the sanctions against Serbia. As far as we know, within a month Krajina will receive practically no help. [Meler] Are you sure that people in the RSK just want him as president? [sentence as published] [Leskovac] Babic is the only one who insists that the RSK must be an independent and sovereign country, without having Belgrade, Zagreb, or Sarajevo as a patron. Babic is one of the few who are aware that this area must not become anybody's protectorate. I am convinced that Babic, as president, would not sign anything with the Croatians as long as Croatia does not recognize our country. [Meler] Have you thought that he could change his position if Serbia threatened to discontinue aid? [Leskovac] I am sure he would not. It is true that Serbia helps us, but we pay dearly for this help. Did you know that Serbia is taking bauxite from Obrovac along with some other ores for which it pays only one-fifth of the market price? You did not know that, did you? Our standard of living is higher than in Belgrade. True, we are without power occasionally, but this is certainly not the worst problem. [Meler] Without aid you might experience certain difficulties...? [Leskovac] What kind? If you have military aid in mind, I must tell you that we are strong enough. Over the last few days, the Vojvoda [Seselj] has sent us heavy weapons. We also expect 300 Cossacks from Zhirinovskiy. These are people who have gained experience in various commando operations and are ready to liberate the occupied Serbian territories. All expenses are covered by our organizations in the United States, particularly Vojvoda Djujic's, which supports Babic and us. If necessary, he will even help us overthrow Milosevic. Milosevic has no right to be the president of Serbia anymore. He lost that right by signing the agreement which had sold out the Serbs in Krajina. His puppets Martic, Novakovic, and Bjegovic must also resign. If they do not leave voluntarily, they will be forced to. They have to go.
