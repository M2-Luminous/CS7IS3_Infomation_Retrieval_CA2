In spite of the considerable rise in the cost of imported goods, they did not remain on store shelves for long. Can we expect more stringent import controls and a new round of price increases this year? First Deputy Chairman Valeriy Kruglikov of the State Customs Committee answered the questions of a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] According to many domestic and Western businessmen, the customs tariff system is one of the most unstable sectors of the Russian economy. What is the reason for this? [Kruglikov] Customs tariffs have to be viewed from several vantage points. Export duties are calculated, for example, with a view to world prices and the cost of goods in the domestic market. Whereas world prices are more or less constant, domestic prices are always rising. The prices of some goods were compounded dozens of times over the last year. For this reason, if we were to set permanent export duties, we would be creating a genuine pitfall that could stop all exports. That is why the amounts were changed several times last year: New rates were set twice, and the Customs Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the Ministry of Economics, and the Ministry of Finance were authorized to review the rates whenever necessary. This is only a temporary phenomenon, however. As we know, there are no export duties in other countries. According to the Law on Tariffs, we will not have them either after 1 January 1996. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Could higher import duties compensate for this reduction of revenue? [Kruglikov] Imports are a different matter. We have gone through several stages in our customs policy. At first, there were no import duties in Russia for half a year. This was done on the assumption that it would help us fill the Russian market with foreign goods, but this was an abnormal situation. The state has to conduct a protectionist policy to defend its own producers and to regulate the excess income that might result from differences between domestic and world prices. Besides this, customs duties are one way of keeping Russia from becoming an appendage of Europe. After all, goods which cannot be sold in the developed countries are now being brought here. Unless we have barriers to block these shipments, our producers will be unprotected. This was the reason for the decision to institute a single tariff for all types of goods--5 percent. Later it was raised to 15 percent, and after that we began setting different rates for different types of goods. Last year's import tariffs set a specific rate for each type of commodity. Now we are working on a new draft. We expected it to be approved by the beginning of the year, but we are still working on it. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Judging by the draft, import tariffs will rise considerably. Is this the result of lobbying by Russian industrial groups? [Kruglikov] The tariff has to balance the interests of the dealer, the producers of goods within the country, and the state. Importers want to pay less. Producers want higher duties so that they will not have any competition. The state has to protect its own producers on the one hand while performing purely fiscal functions on the other, supplementing its own budget with customs duties. Some countries have been granted most-favored-nation status, and the rate on their exports is only half as high. How can all of these interests be balanced? We suggested the creation of a governmental customs tariff council, representing all of these different parties in discussions of state policy in this area, but our recommendation has not won any support yet. Sectorial ministries and departments seem to be paying closer attention to the export tariff now. They have sensed its impact on the state of the economy. Above all, this applies to agriculture. Foreign competition sometimes precludes the sale of domestic agricultural products, and this is also something the Customs Committee has to consider. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] How closely do the tariffs you are working on now correspond to the common standards of world trade, and will they evoke objections from our trade partners? [Kruglikov] As you know, Russia has applied for membership in the GATT. That is why we are taking all of the requirements of that international organization into consideration, but it would be inappropriate to compare our tariff rates to the present rates in the European Community. The present situation in Russia precludes the institution of universal rates that are acceptable today and will still be acceptable six months from now. Our tariff policy has to be flexible and has to be adjusted periodically with a view to the state of the market, the supply of goods, the interests of producers, and many other factors. If the rate is to be raised, we will have to warn exporters in advance, so that we will not upset their plans. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] It is no secret that the mechanism of customs import and export declarations is still far from perfect. What is the State Customs Committee doing to improve it? [Kruglikov] Several important documents have been approved or are being drafted at this time. Much of the procedure for declaring customs value has been borrowed from world practice. After all, exporters frequently understate the value of their goods, and the state incurs substantial losses as a result. We also plan to institute an extremely compact system of currency control. It will apply to exports of raw materials at first, then to all exports, and then to imports as well. The latest electronic equipment will be used in this process. We plan to institute stricter declaration controls, especially for goods subject to excise taxes. This is the most difficult thing we have had to do thus far. Russia's borders are still open. Unscrupulous importers are taking advantage of this to ship goods subject to excise tax through the territory of the CIS republics without paying any money to the treasury. That is why we have to change the procedure for the declaration of goods subject to excise taxes, including the rules of re-exports, re-imports, and transit shipments.
