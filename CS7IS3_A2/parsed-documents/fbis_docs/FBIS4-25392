In a joint communique released at the end of the North Atlantic Council meeting, the alliance reaffirmed its strong support for political and economic reform in Russia and recognized the important role Russia can play on a wide range of issues. "We wish to develop constructive relations of mutual respect, benefit and friendship between Russia and the alliance," said the communique. NATO foreign ministers especially expected that Russia will also join the Partnership for Peace (PFP) program and work out an "extensive and far-reaching individual plan, corresponding to its size, importance, capabilities and willingness to contribute to the pursuit of shared objectives." The PFP program, unveiled at January's NATO summit in Brussels, was designed to prevent a security vacuum by offering Warsaw Pact countries the prospect of eventual membership of the alliance, but this was interpreted by Russian nationalists as an attempt by the West to extend its influence into Russia's frontiers. During the one-day NAC spring meeting held in Istanbul, NATO ministers reviewed the implementation of the January summit decisions and voiced their particular satisfaction with the positive reception of the PFP initiative. In the context of PFP, the first peace-keeping exercises will take place this autumn in the Netherlands and Poland, said the communique. However, the NATO ministers maintained that the dialogue with former Warsaw Pact countries mof [must of] course, affect NATO's right to take its own decisions on its own responsibility by consensus of its members." In a bid to enhance the alliance's ability to respond to crisis, NATO ministers vowed to continue their work on the "combined joint task forces." Concerning the conflict in the former Yugoslavia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], the joint communique urged the parties to reach a political settlement at the negotiating table and not on the battlefield. The North Atlantic Council called for a full and timely implementation of the existing disarmament agreements. A number of other regional issues including tensions in the southern Caucasus and NATO's relations with other international institutions were discussed as well at the NAC meeting.
