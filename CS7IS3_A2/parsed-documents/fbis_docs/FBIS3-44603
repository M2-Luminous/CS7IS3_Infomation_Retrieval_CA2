The eleventh part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled: "The Family of a Leader," and focuses on Mao's influence on the life of his family members. After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong told his cousin: You are a peasant, and farming is a more stable occupation...." the documentary begins with video shots of Mao's two former residences in Zhongnanhai. Then, video cuts to show historical footage of Mao's visits to his hometown in Shaoshan in the late fifties, where he paid respects to his parents' tomb. According to interviews with local people, Mao admitted that even though he was a communist, materialist, and atheist, he should still pay respects to his parents for they had brought him into the world. As the video shows photographs of Mao's brothers, sisters, and other relatives, the narrators recounts how they, inspired by Mao's lofty ideal, joined the revolution and later became martyrs. While the narrator introduces Mao's other relatives, the video shows shots of a museum in Changsha, Hunan dedicated to Mao's first wife Yang Kaihui, where her diary, in which she confesses love for Mao, is on display. While the video continues to show historical footage and photographs of Mao's family, the narrator recounts Yan Kaihui's martyrdom in 1930 and the fate of her sons with Mao: Anying, who after spending 20 years in the Soviet Army was sent to Korea and was killed in the war in the early fifties, and Anqing, who became mentally disabled during his childhood after torture was inflicted upon him by foreign police forces in Shanghai. According to an interview with his daughter-in-law, Mao always educated his children to never seek privilege and "to live and work like the children of ordinary working people." After the narrator briefly describes Mao's life with his second wife He Zizhen in Yanan, the video shows an interview with Li Min, the only surviving daughter of his marriage to He; and Li Na, Mao's other daughter from his marriage to Jiang Qing. The daughters reminisce about the spartan way they were brought up, but say their father left them with an enormous spiritual legacy. The narrator continues: Mao brought up his offsprings the way he trained cadres. He always advocated: "The preservation of the style of being modest and prudent, and guarding against arrogance and rashness," as well as the spirit of hard work and plain living. To underscore Mao's frugal material life, the narrator cites his former head nurse, a train attendant, and bodyguards describing, with deep emotion, his thrift and simple lifestyle. As the video shows shots of his book-filled former residences in Zhongnanhai, worn-out clothes, and other articles of daily use in his living quarters, the narrator notes: The protracted struggles during the revolution made him accustomed to living sparsely. After the PRC's founding, he continued to lead a thrifty life because he wanted to set a good example for other cadres. In spite of his austere life, he always gave generously to friends and relatives in need, and explicitly stated that the money came from remuneration for books and articles he had written. At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes with video of an interview with Mao's cousin Mao Zelian, one of the relatives he refused to arrange a job for in the early years of the PRC. Mao Zelian, who is 80 and still working in the fields, recalls that Mao told him his problem should be solved by the local government, and that since he was a peasant, farming would be a stable occupation.
