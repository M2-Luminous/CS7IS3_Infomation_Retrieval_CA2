Head of the delegation Happonen declared during the meeting with the Chairman of the Idzhevan District Council that the CSCE is ready to station observers in the conflict zone within a short period of time. An observers point will be created in Idzhevan, and the delegation arrived to Ijevan to resolve corresponding technical problems. According to Happonen, thanks to the efforts of CSCE, Russia and all other countries interested in peaceful regulation of the Karabakh conflict, the peace has never been as close as today. And failing its implementation today would mean causing a disaster to the whole region. Colonel also declared that a similar delegation is currently working in Azerbaijan and, hopefully, the CSCE observers and CIS disengagement forces will be stationed along the whole Karabakh- Azeri front line.
