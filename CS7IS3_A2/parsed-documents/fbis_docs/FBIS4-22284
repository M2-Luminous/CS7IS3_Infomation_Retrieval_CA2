FBIS4-22284 "jpusr034___94061" FBIS-USR-94-034 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 16 March 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Cessna Aircraft's Plans for Russian Market Cessna Aircraft's Plans for Russian Market 944Q0260B Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian 16 Mar 94 p 10 944Q0260B Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY Russian CSO [Article by Leonid Zavarskiy and Yevgeniy Ostapov, under the "Plans of Cessna Aircraft for Russia" rubric: "The American Debut Will Hardly Draw a Full House"] [Text] A market for business jets [here and henceforth rendered in English in the original]--small jet planes which amount simultaneously to a flying office and recreation room (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 5 February)--which has evolved in Russia has prompted a fit of activity on the part of Western producers of such aircraft. The American company Cessna Aircraft, which is holding a presale traveling show of its latest business jet, the Citation VII, even resolved to make an unplanned stop in Russia. However, the Russian debut of the company--a two-day presentation of the plane, which ended yesterday--indicated that the feverish haste in the hope of getting the Russian market does not guarantee success in and of itself. Cessna Aircraft was founded in December 1927. The headquarters of the company is located in the city of Wichita (Texas) [as published]. The company produces small propeller and jet planes. During its existence, it has produced about 20,000 planes (it sells up to 110 jet planes annually). The A-37 light ground-attack jet plane is one of its best-known models. Recently, the company has been involved in manufacturing business jets, which have a 60-percent share on the American aviation market. Unscheduled travel by air that is more comfortable than in first class and has long been popular among the Russian captains of industry and is becoming increasingly popular among major private businessmen calls for adequate equipment. However, Cessna has hardly selected the best site for its first appearance in Russia: The State Scientific-Research Institute of Civil Aviation is located almost 40 kilometers away from Moscow. The Americans ended up quite a "distance" from their main competitors in Russia--the French Dassault Aviation and British Aerospace, whose Falcon-900 and BAe-125 planes have already received Russian airworthiness certificates. Besides, the cabin of the Citation VII model has smaller dimensions than the competing planes and is therefore less comfortable. Also, the range of the British and French planes is almost twice as long (see the box), which is important under Russian conditions. This is why the success of Cessna on the Russian market is uncertain. The market itself looks quite interesting at present. Neither the old obstacles to the flights of business jets nor the restrictions on passengers to be carried exist anymore. The issue is how to take advantage of existing opportunities. Any Russian businessman who has the necessary funds may now acquire a business jet for personal use. However, its cost as a rule exceeds $10 million, and one hour of flight costs almost $1,000. Only the largest companies--Ford, GM, or Fiat--or eccentric zillionaires such as Armand Hammer or Robert [as published] von Karajan (the latter prefers to sit at the controls himself) have their own planes of this class in the West. Businessmen usually charter a plane from a small company engaging in the unscheduled carriage of VIP's. About 40 such companies already exist in the CIS, and all sufficiently large airports are able to receive business jets (four or five of them land at Sheremetyevo-2 every day). As far as prospects for the acquisition of Western business jets are concerned, under the new customs tariff introduced on 15 March, the purchase will cost 50 percent more (at present, this problem concerns, for example, the head of the AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive Plant], Vladimir Kadanikov, who has only a refurbished YaK-40 at his disposal). Leasing is likely to appear preferable from now on. [Begin boxed item] Planes of the Business Jet Class in Russia About 20 Falcon-900's (eight to 14 passengers, takeoff weight 29 tonnes, cabin dimensions 11.9 by 2.34 by 1.87 meters, range 7,400 kilometers) and BAe-125-800's (eight passengers, 10 tonnes, 6.5 by 1.85 by 1.85 meters, 5,600 kilometers) which were certified last year in keeping with Russian airworthiness norms have already been purchased in the CIS. Private and state companies (the Gazprom purchased one Falcon-900) and a few airlines were the buyers. The analogous characteristics of the Citation VII (see the picture) are six to eight passengers, 10 tonnes, 5.5 by 1.7 by 1.7 meters, 4,200 kilometers. The base price is $8 million-$10 million, which is approximately 30 percent below the prices of the competition. More than 100 planes (mostly the YaK-40 and the Tu-134) have been converted into business jets in Russia. At present, there are no obstacles to operating Russian or foreign equipment of this class; however, a lengthy and inconvenient procedure exists for obtaining flight licenses. The adoption of relevant legislative documents is expected this year. [End boxed item]
