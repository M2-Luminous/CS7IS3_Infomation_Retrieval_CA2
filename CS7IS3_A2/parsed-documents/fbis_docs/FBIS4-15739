Boris Yeltsin and Felipe Gonzalez spoke about the development of relations between our two countries and about the documents they had signed. They also answered questions from journalists. Among other things, Boris Yeltsin was asked about his health. Here is what the Russian president replied. [Begin Yeltsin recording] I would like to wish every person to be as healthy as I am at my age. Can someone who constantly plays tennis very hard for an hour and a half at a time -- and mind you, playing against masters of sports and honored masters of sports; someone who swims in the Black Sea in March, with the water temperature at four degrees; can someone who does all this be in poor health? Someone who works 16 to 18 hours a day, virtually without any days off. You have got to envy me! Here's what I told the doctors: This year, let us arrange a 24-hour health check, to be attended by all journalists who so desire. Any lab, you know, blood test, come on then, whatever, so much urine [Yeltsin laughs]; and so on, for 24 hours, so that not just Russia but the whole world may know what I've got inside me. [end recording]
