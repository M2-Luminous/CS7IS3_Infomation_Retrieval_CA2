FBIS4-36853 "drnes114_v_94001" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Pakistan Bhutto Discusses Kashmir, Pressler Law, F-16's Bhutto Discusses Kashmir, Pressler Law, F-16's BK0906104994 Islamabad Radio Pakistan Network in Urdu 0200 GMT 9 Jun 94 BK0906104994 Islamabad Radio Pakistan Network Urdu BFN [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has reiterated that Pakistan intends to highlight the Kashmir issue at the international level, but it will keep the doors open for bilateral negotiations to resolve the issue. In an interview with the Dubayy daily KHALEEJ TIMES, she referred to the changes in the global scenario, saying things that seemed impossible in the Middle East, South Africa, Cambodia, and Somalia have now become possible. She said Pakistan and India cannot remain passive and allow this region to be a center of tension. Referring to her efforts to find a solution to the issue, she said that by expressing its willingness to hold the foreign secretary-level talks that took place in Islamabad, Pakistan paved the way for negotiations. This demonstrates our determination to solve this problem on a bilateral basis. She said, however, that Pakistan does not want to make bilateral talks an excuse for crushing the Kashmiris. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan has made several other proposals, such as a reduction of forces in Jammu and Kashmir; the abrogation of barbaric legislation in the occupied valley; the release of the Hurriat Conference leaders; and permission for human rights groups, the international mass media, and diplomats to visit Kashmir. Answering a question, she said another extremely important element of Pakistan's foreign policy is improving its relations with the United States through meaningful talks. The prime minister said Pakistan does not want these relations to be limited to the single aspect of the nuclear issue; we want to make these relations multidimensional. Referring to the Pressler law, she said Pakistan does not have a nuclear weapon and has demonstrated a great deal of perseverance and restraint by refraining from detonating a nuclear explosion. Pakistan has decided not to exceed the existing limits unless its existence is threatened. Thus, from a legal point of view, Pakistan has not violated the Pressler law. She said this law has assumed the form of a veto that is in India's hands. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan welcomes the Clinton administration's policy of controlling, reducing, and eliminating nuclear programs at the regional level. On the issue of the F-16 aircraft, she said Pakistan should receive these aircraft because it was a commercial deal and Pakistan has already paid for them. Pakistan should get the F-16's or the money should be refunded.
