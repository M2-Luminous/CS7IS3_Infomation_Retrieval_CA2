He told a conference in Tralee that the British Government had once again repeated what most already knew -- that the future of the Irish people was in the hands of the Irish people. Mr. Spring said it would be a future won by negotiation, agreement, and consent. It would not rely on coercion and terror. He said everything would be on the table. The tanaiste described the violence of the past 25 years as cruel and unjust. He said it had robbed the country of a significant part of its potential. He said peace would be the foundation for a dramatic surge in opportunities for investment and in development support from the European Union.
