FR940713-2-00011 FR940713-2-00007 Financial Assistance Award: MCR Enterprises AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) to MCR Enterprises under Grant Number DE&hyph;FG01&hyph;94CE15609. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $99,500 for MCR Enterprise to further develop alternate pipe cutting methods by the Radial Cutting Torch (RCT), a patented pyrotechnic cutter, for use in downhole tubular cutting operations in the petroleum industry. This tool can cut stainless steel, exotic alloy pipes, different pipe sizes and has the potential to operate in high-pressure and high-temperature environments, even in the presence of drilling mud. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the application submitted by the MCR Enterprises is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents a unique device for reducing the overall cost of pipe cutting. The use of this device has the potential to provide a cleaner cut which does not require subsequent deburring or machining steps; does not damage the exterior pipe; is reliable and provides a high level of safety. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation because the program, the Energy-Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, ATTN: Linda S. Sapp, HR&hyph;531.23, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 24 months from the date of award. Issued in Washington, DC on June 30, 1994. Richard G. Lewis, Contracting Officer, Headquarters Operation Division B, Office of Placement and Administration.
