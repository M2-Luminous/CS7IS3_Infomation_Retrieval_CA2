Attempts are being made to reproduce the phenomenon of controlled fusion in pellets filled with a gas similar to hydrogen. The current moratorium on nuclear testing -- with the possibility of a total ban treaty -- has led the major powers to begin vast simulation research programs. The final goal is to be able to begin a real process of "virtual dissuasion" and to design thermonuclear weapons without the need for a full scale testing stage. For the experts in the Atomic Energy Commission's (CEA) Military Applications Department (DAM), a nuclear test is already a simulation -- a real simulation. In an interview with SCIENCES ET AVENIR, DAM Chief Roger Baleras insisted that "performing a test is not the same as designing a weapon. Of course, the testing is done to `qualify' a weapon, but it is also a way for us to check our propositions in physics." A test serves to validate the theoretical laws of basic physics. Encyclopedic manuals tell us that there are mathematical models that can simulate every basic aspect of an explosion (equations of state, hydrodynamics, neutron transport, and radiation transfer). Running on supercomputers, these models become numerical codes that make it possible to follow the thermodynamics of the system (pressure, density, temperatures, etc.), finally giving the energy balances and the effects of nuclear reactions. To ensure that the physical laws are correct, the codes must be supplied and validated using experimental data -- obtained from nuclear testing. The current challenge is to validate these numerical codes with supercomputers rather than nuclear tests. There are two main categories of test: Safety and reliability tests related directly to designing new weapons and maintaining the existing stockpile; and tests to calculate the destructive effects of the atomic charges. Of the four "recognized" atomic powers, only the United States and France have an advanced simulation program. In France, the simulation program started in 1991 by the DAM was christened PALEN (Preparation for the Limitation of Nuclear Testing). The brain center for the operation was the Limeil-Valenton research facility, to the east of Paris. In the United States, where simulation work has been underway for a much longer time, the current AGEX (Above Ground Experiments) program draws its impetus from the fact that the three national nuclear research centers are competing with each other (Lawrence Livermore in California, and Los Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico). These programs are highly confidential. However, in this sea of "classified" data, the calmer waters of civil research into "controlled fusion" gives a slightly clearer view. For the military physicists, the basic problem -- reproducing in the laboratory the temperature, density, and radiation conditions in the confined area inside a nuclear weapon -- ties in with the civil race to "harvest" the energy produced by the fusion of hydrogen or its isotopes. In both cases an energy gain is sought: The energy released must be greater than the energy consumed by the reaction. In the civil domain, this gain is converted into electricity, while in the military domain it is converted into physical data. Simulation is only worthwhile if the phenomenon can be measured (if there is an "outgoing radiation"), or in other words, if the energy released is greater than the original energy. This is the problem for fusion reactions. The principle comes down to switching from an environment of light atoms to heavier elements. This creates a mass defect which is at the source of energy. The most efficient type of reaction consists of fusing the nuclei of deuterium and tritium (hydrogen isotopes). The neutron and nucleus of helium (an alpha particle) carry kinetic energy equivalent to 350 MJ (megajoules) per gram of deuterium-tritium mixture, i.e., as much energy as would be generated from the combustion of 10,000 liters of crude oil. In a thermonuclear bomb, this same gramme of deuterium-tritium releases energy equivalent to 20 tonnes of TNT. Nuclear physics has its limitations, however. Notably, this type of fusion requires temperatures in the region of 50 million degrees Celsius. In these conditions, the matter is in a plasmic state, meaning that the ions and electrons are dissociated. The reason for such high temperatures is that positive ions increasingly repel each other the closer they are together. To fuse them they have to impact at high speed, and it is this collision which generates the very high temperatures. How is this plasmic state of matter obtained? In a thermonuclear bomb, the fusion of deuterium and tritium is obtained by a fission reaction, with a mini A-bomb sparking the combustion. To simulate this type of explosion in the laboratory, another source of heat was required: particle beams or lasers (photon beams). In any event, what is needed is a fairly intense impulse to heat the matter to its ignition temperature. While laser is the most advanced method, we still need energy sources a hundred times more powerful than we have today to produce a sufficient gain. A French expert states: "Using very powerful lasers, we can reproduce in the laboratory the conditions (temperature, density, etc.) similar to those that exist inside nuclear weapons. We are simply trying to validate the numerical codes that in the past we checked by carrying out real tests." The Phebus laser used by the DAM at Limeil can generate several kilojoules (kJ) of energy. When applied to matter, this gives "hot plasmas" of several dozen million degrees, which is enough to recreate the heat conditions inside a thermonuclear weapon. It then remains for us to recreate the same conditions of density. To do this, laser science is opening the way up to "inertial confinement" fusion (ICF), competing on the civil level with magnetic confinement: The Joint European Torus (JET) experiments in this area have already been described at length. In either case, the plasma has to be kept confined long enough for a sufficient number of fusion reactions to occur. The exact use of inertial fusion for simulations remains "defense classified." Nevertheless, ICF -- initially designed with military aims in mind -- gives researchers an effective way of bringing matter in the laboratory to densities comparable with those inside a weapon. The DAM claims that there is another way to do this. The many parameters needed for good implosion are ensured by the type of laser impulse used. Lasting just one nanosecond, this impulse is tunable to the point where cold compression of the target occurs (this is better for gaseous bodies) while creating hot spots (the condition required for ignition). The quality of the implosion depends greatly on the beam wavelength. In the context of civil thermonuclear fusion research for energy production, the work with hot plasma done by the French National Scientific Research Center's (CNRS) Laboratory for the Use of Intense Lasers (LULI), based in the Polytechnic school at Palaiseau, has shown that short wavelengths (0.26 micron and 0.35 micron) are more efficient for converting laser beam energy into plasma heat energy. French and American experts stress, however, that this light impulse is not sufficiently uniform to attack or light the target: compression must be symmetrical at every point of the silica shell. Civil and military experts know that X-rays can give a finer degree of uniformity, and this led to the so-called "indirect attack" principle. The light energy is first converted into X-ray radiation and it is this that then attacks the target. In addition, X-rays have shorter wavelengths than lasers (10,000 times shorter). Since they carry more energy than the visible rays, X-rays can better penetrate the solid. We should note that this is one of the most "classified" aspects of the simulation debate, with indirect attack touching on the same aspects of radiation transfer as inside a weapon. In PHYSICS TODAY, John Lindl's team summarized the state of official data: "A laser beam or a particle beam is first absorbed in a cavity (a complex target, termed an `empty space') which embodies the capsule. This cavity then emits X-rays which attack the capsule until it implodes (...) The ablations of a target attacked by X-rays are hydrodynamically more stable." No further details are given, of course, on the conversion method or the materials used. Nevertheless, at the current time, no laser exists that is powerful enough to exceed the famous break-even [preceding word in English] point, i.e., capable of releasing more energy than it uses. The world's experts agree that what is needed is an ICF reactor capable of supplying megajoules of energy. This estimation results from the Halite/Centurion experiment carried out in the United States in the mid-1980's, in which the X-rays produced during a nuclear test were claimed to prove the feasibility of ICF by indirect attack. We are still a long way off, however: Currently, the largest laser in the world, the Nova at the Lawrence Livermore site, is capable of producing "only" 40 kJ. At the same frequency (0.35 micron) and for the same impulse time (1 nanosecond) the Phebus laser (American in origin) can supply 8 kJ. To arrive at the MJ or "Upgrade" [preceding word in English] laser, we need to increase power by a factor of 100. France and the United States are working together in this area to reduce costs by designing other amplification methods. Even if laser technology has an uncertain future -- the Americans claim that heavy ion particle beams (xenon, cesium, and bismuth) are better suited for the development of an ICF reactor -- it still remains the most advanced technology. Thus the first stage in the AGEX program will begin with the National Ignition Facility (the $400-million successor to the Nova laser). This new 1-to-2-MJ laser is expected to be able to produce an energy gain of 20-30 MJ...but not before the year 2002. A recent study showed that this installation will already be able to simulate many of the tests examining the effects of nuclear weapons. The French PALEN project appears less certain. Military experts state: "There will be no simulation tools if we are not allowed to validate them. In other words, we need to perform another series of experiments if we are to eliminate the need for them." The Americans would appear to be some way ahead in this area. According to a report issued by the Defense Committee of the National Assembly in November, 40 tests have already been performed in the United States to validate simulation instruments, as opposed to just one in France. The same report underlines that at least 10 tests are needed before 1997 if PALEN is to be developed, but the DAM has refused to comment on these figures. This program -- which will have a budget of 600 million French francs next year -- is only a preparation for the limitation of testing. A ministerial source states that the development of new types of weapons, such as those with variable power or triggered electromagnetically, will always require real tests, thus rejecting the political possibility of a "Comprehensive Test Ban" (CTB) on nuclear testing. No doubt political decisions will continue to affect what is a truly scientific challenge, with those small silica capsules acting as the scapegoat.
