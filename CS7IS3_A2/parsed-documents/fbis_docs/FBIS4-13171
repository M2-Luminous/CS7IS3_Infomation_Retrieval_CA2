The talks began with a separate meeting between Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and head of the Palestinian negotiating delegation, and General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli delegation, to draw up the agenda for this round of negotiations, which is expected to continue until Thursday. In a statement to correspondents beforehand, Dr. Sha'th said: We will do our best to make this round the last. He noted that they will continue to discuss the topics discussed in previous rounds, particularly those pertaining to security and water. Dr. Sha'th expressed the hope that agreement will be reached with the Israeli delegation on these issues. Regarding the impending meeting between Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Bucharest on Friday, Dr. Sha'th said its original purpose was not to try to overcome the obstacles in the current negotiations in Cairo. It will take place on the sidelines of the world economic conference, which will discuss economic cooperation in the Middle East in the era of peace. The Security, Civilian, and Legal Affairs Committees are expected to meet later today.
