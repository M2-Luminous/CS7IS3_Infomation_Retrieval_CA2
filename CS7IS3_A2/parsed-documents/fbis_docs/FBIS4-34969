This was confirmed by Army commanders at the beginning of a tour that began in Guantanamo Province and will extend to Camaguey Province, with the participation of national media directors as guests. The visit had a definite goal: [Begin unidentified commander recording] First of all, we want the comrades to learn about the work we do, the actions we carry out in the territory -- not only in the Army, but also in the territories of six provinces, where the Eastern Army is deployed. [end recording] The five-point rating given by the Eastern Army commander to this infantry exercise and the satisfactory results achieved on the shooting range by Border Guard troops showed that the personnel's preparation has achieved even better results than last year. Equally magnificent were the efforts exerted to prepare the area of military operations, the implementation of techniques, the protection of weapons, tasks in which the Eastern Army maintains a vanguard position. The Arturo Lince Gonzalez Agrarian and Livestock Enterprise in Sabanetas displayed the efforts carried out by local leaders to achieve food self sufficiency. It suffered losses last year, but it hopes to become feasible this year with higher production. We must not forget that the Eastern Army intends to double its food production, and finance almost a fifth of its budget. [Begin recording] [Unidentified female speaker] I am quite pleased to verify that the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] are very productive for the country; that it is an Army permanently involved in production activities for the country, thus setting an example of how to carry out production activities with controls, economic analyses, and efficiency. [Unidentified male speaker] I have seen what the other Armies are doing,and I believe it will be a close tie because any of the three Armies can win. I, however, think there is a strong contingent -- the Eastern Army. [end recording] The Eastern Army's commander said it is rightfully called the best FAR command, and others will have to work hard to win that title. [Begin Division General Ramon Espinoza recording] The FAR will be the winner even if we lose our title. [end recording: Guantanamo has proven that this is possible, meaning that the Eastern Army will again win the title of best FAR command.
