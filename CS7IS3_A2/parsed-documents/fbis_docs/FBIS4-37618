Answering questions in the Knesset, Shahal conceded also that there was a legal problem in enforcing any pledge signed by released Palestinian detainees not to return to terrorism. In response to an appeal by Knesset members Sandberg and Ba-Gad, the minister said that he would raise at cabinet level their request to have Kakh members under administrative detention sign a similar pledge. If they then promise to desist from terror, they could be released.
