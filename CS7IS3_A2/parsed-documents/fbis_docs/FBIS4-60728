In a statement to INA, 'Abd-al-Ghafur said the declaration by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his secessionist clique on setting up a deformed secessionist entity has only revealed the dimensions of the conspiracy and schemes hostile to both Yemeni unity and the Arab nation's hopes. He indicated that Arab Iraq stands against the enemies of both the nation and its awakening. Iraq raised the slogans of Arab unity, of the liberation of Palestine, and of independent will. Iraq fought for these slogans in the historic and immortal Mother of Battles. 'Abd-al-Ghafur added that the NPPF parties wish the Yemeni people happiness and stability throughout their unified land. He noted that the NPPF general secretariat salutes the concern of the Yemeni people, national parties, and Armed Forces to preserve Yemeni unity and to confront the secessionists and their evil schemes. These schemes are implemented with support from the enemies of the nation, the imperialists, Zionists, and reactionaries, he added.
