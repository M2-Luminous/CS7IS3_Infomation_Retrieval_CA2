These members of the legislative bodies listed the problems constituting subjects of common discussion and shared their views for resolving these problems. The dialogue, as pointed out by Sergey Yushenkov, was constructive as well as open. One of the topics examined was the pressing one of the trade in weapons produced by our countries. Russia would like to have a clear indication that the U.S. does not stand in the way of our making exports to Third World countries. America believes in the aggressive approach, in that she intends to play by the rules of a free market, under conditions of stiff competition, something which as noted by Senator Sam Nunn exists even among the closest of allies. There is as yet also a lack of unity of views on the status of Russian Armed Forces units pursuing peacekeeping missions on the soil of CIS member countries. Nonetheless, neither the State Duma members nor the U.S. senators did anything to dramatize whatever differences arose concerning their opinions and assessments. On the contrary, their feelings are fairly optimistic, and they intend, as borne out by their answers to a question put by the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, to meet regularly for the purpose of seeking points of agreement. Senator Dan Coats, one of the guests, jokingly remarked that the Americans are willing to have Russian parliamentarians "interfere" on Washington's Capitol Hill, for an exchange of opinions is useful to both sides. An example of the above are the results of examining the situation arising in Russia relative to a plan to carry out a joint exercise of armed fores peacekeeping units of the two states in the month of July. According to Vladimir Lukin, the American senators arrived at a keen understanding of the difficulties attendant to that, realizing that this is not a question of disinterest in cooperation, but rather one of delicate matters, such as national dignity and pride. Sam Nunn stated that, after completing the trip, he intends to submit a proposal for carrying out the first of a series of joint exercises on U.S. soil, on a base located in California or Georgia.
