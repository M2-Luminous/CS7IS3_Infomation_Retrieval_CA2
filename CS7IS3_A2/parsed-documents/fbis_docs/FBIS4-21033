He claims to have made tens of thousands of pounds from informants' funds while carrying on selling drugs himself. His story highlights the grey area between police attempts to arrest those already dealing in drugs and the way crimes can come to be committed which might not otherwise have happened at all. The informer is known to police by the code-name of Peter Poacher and his informer's number is 176. His real name is Nigel and he has worked under the names of Danny and John. THE GUARDIAN is not publishing his last name because it is an uncommon one and he fears reprisals against his parents, who live in the North of England. He is being sought by associates of people on whom he has informed and by lawyers acting for people he has entrapped. His revelations could lead to the reopening of cases of prisoners who claimed he was the main participant in drugs deals for which they were jailed. Nigel, now aged 26, became an informer after being arrested on a drugs charge five years ago. Since then he has worked extensively for the police. The rewards have been substantial--totalling, he claims, more than £35,000. He says he received the highest ever reward from the Number 3 Regional Crime Squad, based in Wakefield, with a payment of £11,500 for arrest of an LSD smuggler. He says he has made tens of thousands of pounds from drug dealing activities. Nigel, from Ormskirk, is the adopted son of a policeman and was introduced to drugs in Amsterdam. About five years ago, police investigating a stolen car with which he was involved raided his then home in Lincoln and found drugs. He offered to become an informer. "I gave them everything," he says. He claims he set up a flourishing amphetamine trade in Newmarket and received money both from drug dealing and in rewards from the Community Action Trust, the Home Office's international fund, and the police. Nigel also claims that he supplied the recipe for an amphetamines factory. He says that as a result of his activities more drugs become available on the streets as small-time dealers build up towards big deals. Detective Chief Inspector Geoff Cole, of Number 3 RCS, said: "We never comment on individual informants." He added: "It is standard practice that officers dealing with informants are constantly alive to the issue of agents provocateurs. If we had any reason to suspect that an informant was acting in such a role, we would terminate the operation and the informant would be liable to prosecution." Nigel is now no longer assisting the police and is planning to move abroad. Last night, John Wadham, legal officer for Liberty, said that agents provocateurs were "part of the problem, not part of the solution."
