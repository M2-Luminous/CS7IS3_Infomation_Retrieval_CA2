However, for Europe and the United States, which have experienced various difficulties such as the indifference and mutual distrust brought about by the disappearance of the Cold War threat, the several deadlocks that have occurred in the Uruguay round of negotiations, and the divergence of views over intervention in the Bosnia-Hercegovina civil war, the importance of this issue is even more important. Between 9 - 16 January, U.S. President Clinton made his first visit to Europe since taking office. Since one of the main goals of this visit was to refashion the relationship between the United States and its European allies, and between NATO and East Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, President Clinton chose Brussels as his first stop, and took part in the NATO heads of state conference there. Foreign public opinion gave fairly high marks to this visit, feeling that President Clinton's first trip to Europe was truly something that had a new and far-reaching effect. Establishing a "Peaceful Partnership" Between East and West Europe The first change in NATO brought about by the two-day Brussels heads of state conference was passage of an U.S.-sponsored plan for a "peaceful partnership," which formally answered the question of whether and how NATO would be extended to the east, which had been outstanding since the end of the cold war. East Europe's difficulties in freeing itself from restraints to establish its own independence and security following the end of the cold war made it very anxious to enter NATO. The recent clamor from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, in particular, had been loudest. Two years earlier, the NATO heads of state conference in Rome had decided to set up a North Atlantic Cooperation Committee that would accept East European and former Soviet Union countries as members to improve relations and cooperation between NATO member states and their erstwhile adversaries, and to move these countries in the direction of a western-style democracy. However, some of the East European nations were no longer entirely satisfied with that kind of extremely loose and entirely symbolic cooperation. Faced with the "power vacuum" in East Europe following the end of the cold war, the potential threat of a revival of Russian great nation chauvinism, and the instability caused by extreme nationalism and ethnic clashes in East Europe, some East European nations urgently demanded genuine security guaranties from NATO. The clamor to joint NATO increased with each passing day. In their heart of hearts, both the United States and its West European allies naturally very much wished to extend NATO eastward. At the beginning of the cold war more than 40 years earlier, the United States singlehandedly planned establishment of NATO with the goal of doing all possible to stem the increasing expansion of Soviet influence, and doing all possible to expand eastward western military power and even the west's free and democratic system. Now that the cold war was over, naturally the United States could not abandon this opportunity that it had yearned for. It was for this reason that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hastily said, "During this crucial transition period, building of such a (east and west Europe) relationship will make it possible for democracy and reform to succeed, and the possibility of this success will be far greater than the opportunities that a war would bring." However, the United States had some apprehensions about what specific actions to take. In the view of the Clinton administration, the extension of membership status to all the East European nations was really premature. First of all, in addition to the lack of any real basis at the present time for these East European countries to carry out within NATO the assurances of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty (namely, that an attack on one member nation would be regarded as an attack on all members), the tangled and complex ethnic conflicts and the latent territorial conflicts prevailing in East Europe might cause conflicts that would make the heads of NATO member states hesitate to act. NATO feared that too early acceptance of these East European nations might result in NATO becoming bogged down later on in regional conflicts like the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Furthermore, even though NATO has for many years successfully maintained a relationship between two antagonistic member nations, Greece and Turkey, there was no reason for NATO leaders to believe that the East European nations would do the same thing. Second, and more important, was the Clinton administration's unwillingness to countenance "drawing a line at the western border of Russia to replace the former iron curtain." The United States worried that too early and too speedy NATO acceptance of these East European countries that were formerly allies of the Soviet Union might intensify Russia's feelings of isolation and stimulate an anti-American and anti-western tendencies in the Russian public. It might even increase ultra-nationalist forces within Russia, thereby weakening the forces of democratic reform factions such as Yeltsin's that the United States supported. These apprehensions found greater expression when the Radical Nationalist Party headed by Zhirnovsky gained the second largest number of seats in Russia's Duma in December 1993. In fact, on the eve of Clinton's visit to Europe, a strong reaction occurred within Russia to the formal application for entry into NATO of Latvia, one of the three Baltic nations. Russian President Yeltsin warned the west not to do "anything to isolate Russia." Because of the above worries, President Clinton adopted a fairly cautious attitude about expanding NATO, showing that the issue is not whether to expand NATO but "how and when to expand it." The peaceful partnership plan that the NATO heads of state passed was a deft compromise to avoid stirring up Russia following careful consideration by the United States. In accordance with this plan, non-NATO member East European countries and former republics of the USSR will gradually develop their military relationship with NATO member countries, conducting joint training and exercises. These "peaceful partners" will become a planning team that cooperates closely with NATO in the organization of joint training and exercises in preparation for possible future joint military action. It is on the basis of this conception that NATO will nurture the ability to deal with "challenges to Europe's common security." Henceforth, should the territorial integrity, political independence, and security of any partner country be threatened at any time, NATO will conduct deliberations at once. According to Warren Christopher, founding of such a mechanism will "eliminate feelings of insecurity among East European and former Soviet Union partners, strengthening the political relationship between NATO and them." In order not to dash the hopes and to support the requests of some East European and former Soviet Union republics who desire immediate NATO entry, during his visit to Europe President Clinton constantly reiterated that the "peaceful partnership," plan does not replace arrangements for entering NATO, but is "the first step toward entering NATO." The United States explained to Europe that partner nations could demonstrate their desire and their ability to assume NATO obligations and enjoy NATO benefits by approving this plan's provisions for strengthening political and military cooperation. In future years, the situation will show which countries possess the conditions for formal entry. Then NATO can consider the question of whether to grant them formal membership status. To use Clinton's words, this is a "gradual and case-by-case expansion procedure." The Clinton administration believes that the "peaceful partner relationship" plan that it devised can kill many birds with a single stone. First, it satisfies, to a certain extent, the desires of those East European and former Soviet republics that eagerly sought entry into NATO, and it increases their confidence. It enables them to continue and accelerate progress toward western democracy while at the same time it avoids arousing ultra-nationalist sentiment in some Russians so that they do not regard NATO expansion as a military threat. Second, the plan's provisions for an expansion of military cooperation with East European countries will help NATO improve its ability to act in important new fields of crisis management, humanitarian rescue, and peace keeping, thereby effecting a smooth change in NATO's functions. Third, since the Clinton administration says that in the future NATO will unilaterally have the right to decide when to increase membership, this "single track system" of examining credentials will force those East European nations that wish to enter NATO to listen to what the United States says. They must not only take an active part in NATO activities, but more importantly -- as Clinton said -- they must demonstrate "their decision to respect the values on which NATO depends for its survival." This includes respect for individual freedom, human rights, and a system of law, and peaceful resolution of disputes without the use of armed force to change existing national borders. Thus, the United States has transformed NATO expansion, which was formerly a matter of examining member nations credentials, into a powerful lever for ensuring the peace, stability, and freedom of East Europe. Therefore, the United states has a deep sense of satisfaction about NATO heads of state approval of the "peaceful partnership" plan, as well as the acceptance of this plan by East European countries like the Czech Republic and Poland. it believes this to be an important result of President Clinton's trip to Europe. However, whether this carefully conceived plan will truly be workable, and whether it can attain the goals that the United States envisages will depend on the the test of time. Recognition of West European Allies Autonomy in Defense Matters The second important change in NATO that President Clinton brought during this visit was the United States' decision to recognize the autonomy of its West European allies on defense matters. This gives them the right to independent military action that they, particularly France, have long desired. Contrary to the United States Government's past position, during this heads of state conference, President Clinton explicitly recognized that Europe has authority over defense matters affecting its own independence; thus, West Europe has the right to make its own decisions and take independent actions to deal with defense matters purely within Europe. For this purpose, the United States said it would permit its West European allies to use NATO matriel and equipment for their own military actions. This means that the West European allies may take military action using NATO's command, reconnaissance and logistics systems in the name of the West European alliance or in the name of joint French and German forces rather than in the name of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In addition, this NATO heads of state meeting decided to set up a new military entity termed a multinational task force. Acting under the leadership of the West European Alliance or NATO, this force could undertake peace keeping, human rights rescue, and other military tasks. The United States could decide whether to take part in these military actions as circumstances warrant. United State Secretary of Defense Les Aspen said that according to this plan, "military forces and equipment that are an organic part of the NATO military organization could be used to deal with unexpected incidents of purely European concern without U.S. direction." When the cold war first ended, the United States felt at a loss about what to do for a time. On the one hand, the United States realized that the disappearance of the tremendous Soviet threat meant that it would no longer have to concern itself with every matter regarding Europe's security as it had done in the past. The United States no longer saw it worthwhile to go to war and shed blood over conflicts in regional conflicts such as the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the United States, which had been accustomed for more than 40 years to issuing orders to Europe and attending to everything itself, was unwilling to be cast aside now, allowing West European nations to make their own decisions and carry out their own actions, and it was apprehensive about it. It was with these conflicting feelings that the former Bush administration, and the Clinton administration at its outset always vacillated and contradicted itself on European affairs. This characteristic was demonstrated most markedly on the Bosnia-Hercegovina civil war issue. The West European allies were extremely unhappy about this, and U.S.-European relations consequently blew hot and cold. All these events showed that the United States Government had formed no clear-cut consensus on U.S.-European relations. It lacked a consistent policy. The change in the United States Government's position now shows that the Clinton administration has a new understanding of United States-European relations after having gone through a period of consideration. No matter how one looks at it, the security of Europe is of crucial importance to the United States; therefore, the United States must remain in Europe and continue to play a leading role. However, the United States cannot both want to play the part of leader and also side with West Europe in making empty promises when a crisis occurs in the European situation. The only workable approach is for the U.S. Government to change its former equivocal and ambiguous attitude, clearly recognize and respect Europe's autonomy in certain defense matters, and let the European allies handle matters themselves in return for their cooperation and support in matters of importance to U.S. defense. Clinton embraced just such a clear-cut understanding in making a trip to Europe. While affirming that Europe remains at the heart of U.S. security, he said that "the common enemy on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean has disappeared, but common dangers have not disappeared." By this he meant that although not as mortal as the former Soviet threat, the "quiet instability that has appeared" in Europe is fraught with danger. Both the United States and West Europe must react to this. However, this reaction should be selective. According to the current thinking of the United States Government, when a major threat occurs that endangers the western value system, the survival of the western system, and reverberates on the situation on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States will work in concert and bend efforts to cooperate with Europe. When a partial or regional crisis occurs in Europe that does not threaten the overall situation within a short period of time, acting in the spirit of "Europeans handling European affairs," the United States will not intervene. Actually, the Multinational Task Force was born out of the U.S. desire not to shed blood in European regional disputes, and in Europe's desire to make a rapid response to them. This change in the U.S. Government's position was welcomed by West Europe, especially France. For a long time, France has wanted the right to take independent military action and maintain an independent West European military force. The United States always refused, however, because it feared that this might lead to a disintegration of the western alliance. The United States' unexpected declaration at the NATO heads of state meeting and the results it obtained evoked a joyous response from France. The French Minister of Defense termed the new Atlantic alliance following this heads of state conference the "second NATO." The United States termed the proposal it made at this conference and the existing North Atlantic Treaty "each attending to his own affairs," but not each going his separate way. This means that NATO and the West European Alliance will be complementary rather than mutually exclusive in the future. Nevertheless, the U.S. attitude shows that its effect on European affairs has declined. It is a choice that the United States had to make after the situation changed in order to avoid even grater damage to Europe-U.S. relations. No wonder that after President Clinton said that the United States was resolved to remain in Europe that some European public opinion still suspected that this change in the U.S. position might be the first step in its gradual withdrawal from Europe. Results of the Brussels heads of state conference showed that a change in the control and even the purpose of NATO was unavoidable. The direction that this conference set for east-west and Europe-U.S. relations, in particular, means that the Brussels heads of state conference has become yet another important milestone in the more than 40 year history of NATO. As a WASHINGTON POST editorial said, the conclusion of this conference marks "a quiet revolution" that is going on within NATO.
