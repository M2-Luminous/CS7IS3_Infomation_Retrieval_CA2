The answer is no. The United States is the godfather of the settlement and negotiations are being held on its territory. Because of this, a U.S. delegation, led by Dennis Ross, is touring the Arab capitals to expedite the negotiations. The Americans themselves consider their role in the peace process a full-partner role. But such a partnership cannot hold when Washington is appeasing and blindly siding with the Israeli occupiers. It even pressures the Arab parties, including Jordan, under the pretext of its stand on the war in the Gulf; a war that ended more than three years ago and in which Jordan played no role. As far as we know, several U.S. promises were given over the past two years to lift the unjust siege imposed on the port of al-'Aqabah, Jordan's only maritime outlet to the world. These promises have not been realized at all, even while the U.S. statements were praising the responsible Jordanian role on more than one level, inducing its role in the peace process. This situation dictates a legitimate Jordanian stand in the face of the violations, which threaten the rights of sea navigation and trade and which cause major damage to the Jordanian economy. These challenges are not founded on international law or the resolutions of international legitimacy. They are brought about by a U.S. decision aimed at pressuring Jordan and influencing its steadfastness and stability. This will later reflect on the course of the negotiations, where Israeli intransigence continues on the Jordanian-Israeli track of negotiations as well as on other tracks. Consequently, if Washington is truly concerned--and so far it is not--about the stability and growth of the Jordanian-U.S. relationship and for the resumption of negotiations in an appropriate atmosphere, then there has to be a swift U.S. decision to lift the unfair and illogical siege imposed on the only Jordanian port. It also requires pressuring Tel Aviv, the aggressor party, to abide by the resolutions of international legitimacy and start implementing them by withdrawing from the occupied territories, including the Jordanian territory. This will herald the beginning of a new age in the region; an age that guarantees the rights and interests of all parties without exception; and an age that ends once and for all the use of force or the threat of the use of force, as Israel has always done. Israel is the only state in the region that carries out military infringement and violations under the very eyes of the United States, and collects limitless support from it as well.
