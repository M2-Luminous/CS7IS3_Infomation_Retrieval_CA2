The initial police report said the ganja appeared to have been in the water for some time. Drugs Squad officers were to examine the ganja Wednesday and Thursday to determine if the drugs were originally destined for Cayman or part of a shipment dumped at sea and washed ashore by accident. The 110 pounds of ganja would have a street value of slightly more than CI$105,000. [passage omitted]
