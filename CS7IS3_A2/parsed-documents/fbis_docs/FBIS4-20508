Sixty thousand copies of the document are expected to circulate in research circles, kicking off the minister-initiated national discussion that will culminate in a great parliamentary debate in June. In January, 1982, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, then minister of research and technology under the Mauroy government, inaugurated the "National Research and Technology Days." Twelve years later, Francois Fillon has borrowed the formula to "survey the state of French research" and "collectively define strategic priorities." The national research debate was announced last May and aims to "wipe the slate clean and redefine priorities." It was ultimately postponed until last fall, when a group of experts headed by atomic energy high commissioner Roger Dautray compiled a preliminary report. The first draft of the expert report was written between 14 September and 3 December, 1993, and barely scratched the surface. Overly concerned about circumscribing the debate, its authors were careful not to make any final decisions or suggest priorities or strategies. The only exception was a series of remarks and questions on the prickly issue of higher education and research organizations, and how to reconcile cutting-edge research with mass university education. Since then, various people involved in research have enriched the report with their thoughts, desires, and questions concerning universities, research organizations, big institutions (Academy, College of France, Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology), manufacturers, and trade unions. Six regional symposia to be held between mid-February and mid-March in Marseille, Grenoble, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Lille, and Le Mans will base their work sessions on the report, which features four main chapters[.sup]1[/]: -- Basic research. In the opinion of the reporters, France, despite several weaknesses, "is active on most basic research fronts, and is well-positioned to compete internationally." But they emphasize the need to raise questions about how to "maintain research's vitality and dynamism." Examples of such questions include how to combat the "persistent inadequacy of engineering sciences"; how to spur research professors and researchers to "take risks"; how to increase the ability of research organizations, whose resources are mostly allocated to "personnel and other fixed expenditures," to take initiatives; and how to keep budgets for big programs and equipment from adversely affecting small science. Regional symposia participants will try to answer those questions. -- Science and society. Aware that research often leads to "results that transform personal and collective life," the reporters believe "the scientific community cannot remain indifferent to the expectations or criticisms of citizens." Accordingly, they recommend more communication, through a broader inclusion of learned societies and Parliament in discussions. They also suggest that scientists listen more carefully and "pay greater heed to human and social sciences, which, by shedding light on the factors that determine scientific and technical creativity and on society's demands, can bolster interaction [between laymen and researchers]." -- Research, technologies, and companies. To no one's surprise, the report's findings here are "worrisome." French companies spend only 1.3 percent of GDP on research, against approximately 1.9 percent in competitor countries. The report stresses, for instance, that German industry conducts nearly twice as much research and development work as its French counterpart, and employs twice as many researchers. Moreover, although "the big state-led and -supported programs (in aeronautics, space, nuclear power, telecommunications, and so on) have scored many successes," their "effect is only decisive in their own industry" and "spills over very little into others." Isn't it time, the reporters wonder, to question the relevence of objectives and the methods used to achieve them? Shouldn't S&T policy seek to revitalize the technological fabric of small and medium-size companies; inject a little science into traditional industries such as construction, public works, agriculture and food, etc.; and redefine research priorities for higher education and the big professional schools? -- Higher education and research organizations. A significant amount of research, especially basic research, is conducted in establishments of higher education and specialized organizations. But in the opinion of the reporters, particularly Academy of Sciences president Jacques Friedel, higher education must adapt to future needs without delay. Put another way, the reporters suggest that there may be a need to team up with regions, companies, and local government agencies to create short, accessible technology-training programs better suited to mass education. This would not be done at the expense of university research, whose level would be maintained through the development of centers of excellence. The reporters seem to favor such a shift, just as they appear open to the idea of more overlap between the research and teaching communities. This contrasts with their December observation that "the notion floated by some of a future merging of the two professions would require an exhaustive study to assess its relevence and feasibility." The reporters tried to soften their remarks on the question this time around, for it is a sensitive one. The new document states that "without abandoning a system of research organizations that has proven its worth," we must "think about how we can incorporate that system into the university fabric." NOMINATION: Jacques Joussot-Dubien as the vice-president of the Higher Council on Research and Technology. Higher education and research minister Francois Fillon installed the new Higher Council on Research and Technology (CSRT) on Tuesday, 1 February. The research minister is the lawful president of this body, which elected 65-year-old Jacques Joussot-Dubien as vice-president. The CRST was created in 1982 to advise the government on important science and technology choices, and consists of 40 members who sit for two-year terms. [Jacques Joussot-Dubien, born in Oran, Algeria on 12 April, 1928, specializes in photochemistry and lasers. He is a professor at the University of Bordeaux-I, director of the Wave/Matter Interaction Physics Laboratory of the Bordeaux National Advanced School of Chemistry and Physics, and an elected correspondent of the Academy of Sciences as of 1980. Joussot-Dubien was research director at the central administration of the National Education Ministry from 1986 to 1988.] Footnotes 1. Plus a very short fifth chapter on regions, Europe, and the world.
