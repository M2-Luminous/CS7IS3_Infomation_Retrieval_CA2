FBIS4-5906 "dreas073_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 South Korea Resolution of PRC History Book Issue `Unlikely' Resolution of PRC History Book Issue `Unlikely' SK1504084294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0549 GMT 15 Apr 94 SK1504084294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, hinted at the possibility of revising the Chinese school textbooks that claim South Korea attacked the North to trigger the Korean war (1950-53) during his recent visit, but education authorities see little coming of it. Since ties were normalized in August 1992, South Korean and Chinese textbook editors have discussed correcting inaccurate accounts of the other's country in school textbooks at several seminars, but failed to reach any agreement, Education Ministry officials said Friday. One Chinese textbook reads: "A war erupted in Choson (Korea). American imperialists invaded the North." Seoul wants it stated clearly that a Southward invasion took place, but Beijing is unwilling because it would mean China supported the invader. The Chinese communists apparently wanted to assert they helped the North Koreans because a northward push by the Americans could have threatened their country, justifying their involvement in the war. For Beijing's part, it wants Seoul to indicate that Manchuria belongs to its northeastern region and Taiwan is one of its provinces. These disagreements make it unlikely that China will correct its textbooks anytime in the near future, officials here said. The ministry, nonetheless, will continue to invite Chinese textbook editors to seminars and hold more discussions.
