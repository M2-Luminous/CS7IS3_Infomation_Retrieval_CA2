A. Orlov; UDC 621.534.8] [Abstract] Simple mathematical models of microwaveguides are proposed. These microwaveguides are based on scalar isotropic approximation. A numerical algorithm for calculating the transfer characteristics of devices with a waveguide transmission line is developed. In order to reduce the influence of solid waves, a uniform directional coupler is proposed for use. The amplitude- frequency characteristics of a filter containing two aperture apodized interdigital transducers joined by a directional coupler are measured and the results given. The topology of the devices is also analyzed. It is shown that the mathematical model which is used for the waveguide is adequate for the results of the experimental research. Moreover, the technical characteristics of the devices exceed traditional analogs. Figures 5; references 7.
