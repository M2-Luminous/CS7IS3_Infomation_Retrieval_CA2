Financial authorities like the Ministry of Finance [MOF] and the Bank of Japan [BOJ], both of which have a role in formulating and implementing government policy and supervising Japan's financial institutions, have thus become the subject of growing interest. This series presents a honest profile of those agencies, introducing readers to their personnel, organization, and policy-making structures. When the decision was made on 21 September 1993 to lower the official discount rate, the seventh in the Bank of Japan's history, BOJ's released statement referred to what it called "an unprecedented low interest rate" ("somewhat an exaggeration," according to Governor Yasushi Mieno of the central bank) and became the subject of much discussion within financial circles. The announcement was drafted in the Planning Division of the central bank's Policy Planning Bureau. Manipulations of the official discount rate stir up a great deal of interest not only at home but in other countries. As recently shown, when people reacted to the central bank's action as a "lowering of interest to save the banks," the public often refuses to take BOJ's explanations literally, and generations of planning division heads have had to put a great deal of thoughts and labor into drafting such announcements. The Planning Division is where the basic direction for the bank's monetary policy is formulated and is considered BOJ's "brain center." The division formulates important policy on matters such as the official discount rate on the basis of information gathered from each bureau and branch office. Because of its importance in policy formulation, the division is considered a "gateway to success" within the bank for those who become division chiefs. Of those currently in the leadership ranks of the organization, many have at one time or another headed the Planning Division, including Governor Mieno (Class of 1947 [year in which he entered BOJ]) and central bank director Toshihiko Fukui (1958). Masaaki Shirakawa (1972), who currently heads the division, was chief of the Credit Systems Division for three years and was appointed to his present post May 1993 after handling a number of difficult cases, including [the dissolution of] Toyo Credit Bank. In addition to monetary policy, another important area of concern for the Planning Division are measures to stabilize the financial system. It is studying the problem along with the Credit Systems Bureau and Operations Bureau. At a lecture given at the end of 1993, Governor Mieno touched on the need to free up the flow of credit, citing the example of the United States. He was thus planting the seeds for what has become a lively debate on the merits of establishing a market to buy and sell nonperforming loans. In other words, an idea planted by the central bank has started people to think in a new direction. This too is the work of the Planning Division. Its job is to put together the ideas that are officially presented later by the central bank governor at press conferences, or at lectures, or in reply to parliamentary interpellation. Also, under the Planning Division are various deliberative bodies, including the Fiscal System Council, the Securities and Exchange Council, and the Financial Problems Forum. Thus, division members are in frequent contact with private-sector banks and those in other ministries and agencies to exchange views. The situation, says Division Chief Shirakawa, "hardly gives them any time during the day to sit down." [6 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Policy Planning Bureau/Coordination and Public Relations Divisions--Setting Up a Same Day Account Settlements System The goals of the Bank of Japan, as defined in Article 1 of the Japanese Banking Law, are to regulate the money supply, control currency, and maintain and foster the credit system. For the Coordination Division of the Policy Planning Bureau--a division which examines the appropriateness of new operations to BOJ's objectives and then contacts and coordinates its actions with departments and agencies within and outside the central bank--Article 1 provides the most important rationale for whatever it undertakes. By "coordinating" a matter after it has been studied and examined means making adjustments that are necessary for it to be in conformity with various rules and regulations that are pertinent to the bank's mission, including the Japanese Banking Law, articles of incorporation and bylaws. Of course, a wealth of knowledge about existing systems and regulations is required of staff, and the division is fully represented by those who have successfully passed the national law examination. Last year, the division grappled with the task of converting the domestic exchange settlement system (All Bank System) into a system of same day funds and preparing the way for government bond accounts to be settled on a cash on delivery (or delivery versus payment [DVP]) basis. In either case, these are recalled by Division Chief Chikanobu Mori (1972) as "measures to respond to fluctuations in assets and the transactions of financial institutions." The division is also responsible for carefully checking contracts between BOJ and outside groups when, for example, a computer system is introduced or equipment and furnishings are purchased. In other words, its members carefully watch if there aren't any mistakes in internal matters or in those related to outside agencies. The Public Relations Division was inaugurated in May 1990 when the Information Division, which until then had been in charge of general information, was reorganized as a window to the bank for other information organs. Its main work is to 1) arrange press conferences and interviews with the bank governor, 2) assist in collecting news and information about the bank and, 3) disseminate information and answer inquiries about the central bank. The third to head the unit since its reorganization, Division Chief Yasuo Nakayama (1976) notes that the BOJ has "recently been getting a lot of foreign media coverage." As the recession drags on, the public has grown more critical of the central bank. As division chief, Nakayama wants to get to understand the sentiments and views of the public through closer contact with the mass media. At the same time, he wants to make the BOJ's views and policies more accessible to the public and "to build a two-way relationship." [7 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Credit Systems Bureau/Credit Systems Division--A Group Well-Versed in Laws and Regulations The Credit Systems Bureau was born (in May 1990) out of the first large-scale organizational reform to be undertaken since the BOJ was founded. The Credit Systems Division, a pivotal component in the bureau, was formed when the maintenance of credit systems, until then under the divided charge of the General Affairs and Bank Examination Bureaus was made the responsibility of a single, newly created division. Behind this move was the failure of a series of financial institutions in the United States and concern about the stability of Japan's own financial system. A new unit, which is headed by Eizo Kobayashi (Class of 1992), still only the second division chief it has had. He came to his post May 1993 after heading the Bank Examination Division to replace his predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa (1972), who headed the Credit Systems Division for three years before becoming division chief in charge of the Policy Planning Division. As Kobayashi notes, "there seems to be no end in sight to what we still have to learn from other countries." As his words suggest, one of the division's priorities is to look into deposit insurance systems in other countries as case studies and to research financial regulatory systems at home and abroad. Therefore, the division has a group of people, including a Havard Law School graduate, who are very well-versed in law within the BOJ. Also under the division's charge is the Committee of Bank Supervisors for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). From the start, the division has been involved in creating specific measures to deal with BIS's capital-to-asset ratio requirements, which were adopted by Japanese banks from March 1993. With plans to introduce a second set of regulations (market risk regulations) intended to address risks with fluctuations in the exchange and stock markets, the division has born part of the responsibility for creating new regulations while taking into account the views of Japan's financial institutions. Since the division was formed, it has handled cases using the deposit insurance system when financial institutions have gone bankrupt, including mergers and aquisitions of Toho Mutual Savings and Loan Bank by Iyo Bank and of Toyo Credit Union by Sanwa Bank and the liquidation of Kamaishi Credit Union. It has become an important function of the Credit Systems Division to carefully the activities of financial instititutions and prevent trends from developing which might disrupt or cause creditors and depositors to lose confidence in the financial system. [11 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Credit Systems Bureau/Settlement System Division--Eliminating Inter-Bank Settlement Risks One day, somewhere in the world, a bank fails and a financial institution in Japan, operating in a different time zone, finds it cannot recover the payments due on its loan. With the internationalization of financial markets and their computerization, the risk of nonpayment because of a lag in settlement dates caused by time differences or inadequacies in the system has grown and has become a concern for financial authorities throughout the world. That worry became justified in July 1991 when financial authorities in Europe and the United States suddenly froze the accounts of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) due to their discovery of bank irregularities and misconduct. Repercussions were felt in Japan, when Nippon Kogyo Bank, which had been doing yen-dollar transactions with BCCI, reported a loss of about $30 million. "A fairly strong sense of crisis took hold," recalls Hajimu Mizuno (1975), who currently heads the BOJ's Settlement Division. At the time he had just been transferred from the Information and Computer Systems Bureau to the Policy Planning Bureau's Coordination Division. Fearing a domino effect, the BOJ asked financial institutions in Japan to stay calm and, in effect, the incident passed without causing a major disruption to Japan's financial system. Rather, according to Mizuno, the BCCI incident "gave Japan's financial institutions a chance to realize, first hand, the importance of being able to respond to settlement risks." While endeavoring to eliminate these risks, the Settlement System Division tackles the job of putting together plans and measures that will enable Japan's settlement system to operate with stability and efficiency. Mizuno assumed his current post as division chief last May and is highly regarded for his skills not only in responding to the BCCI incident but also in developing and putting into operation the central bank's [computer] network which enables accounts with private financial institutions to be settled immediately. A number of those in his division took part in developing this network, and with today's rapidly advancing technology at their command, they form a management team, which is highly skilled in the latest technology, to anticipate failures and risks inherent in their system. Until last spring, private financial institutions, which had been using the system of next-day settlements (All Bank System) for domestic exchange accounts, changed to a system of same-day settlements. It was this division which was urging the necessity for such a change at the time, arguing that "the key antidote to risk was reducing outstanding balances on account." Based on plans drawn up by this division, the BOJ is also targeting the end of this fiscal year to introduce a DVP [delivery versus payment] system for government bonds, which would make it possible to receive payment for such bonds at the time they are surrendered or the delivery of bonds at the time of their purchase. However, the kind of problem that surfaced in the BCCI case--the lag time in settlement dates for yen-foreign currency transactions--still has not been resolved. "We still have a lot to learn," says Mizuno. Apparently, this division's battle against risk will be continuing for awhile. [12 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Financial Division--On the Backline in Lending, on the Frontline in Restructuring In the Financial Division of the Bank of Japan's Operations Bureau, there is a tacit understanding: If the division chief plans to be away on a long holiday, he is to indicate where he can be reached; in principle, vacations outside Japan are to be discouraged. The Financial Division stands on the frontlines of Japan's efforts to restructure its financial system. Among the central bank's various roles, the one that falls to the Financial Division is that of "final lender." The division is in close contact with each of the financial institutions which have current accounts with the central bank and keeps a close, daily watch on their activities. City bank officials shrug their shoulders. "Whether you get financing or not is ultimately up to the Financial Division," says one. Before being reorganized in May 1990, the General Affairs Division, which is in the Operations Bureau, was responsible for the day-to-day regulation of financial markets, but the job of supervising the flow and absorption of funds for these markets as a whole now falls to the Markets Division. This division, too, is in the Operations Bureau. The role of the Financial Division is to decide what to do about lending to individual financial institutions. Important, along with regulating the fund raising activities of individual financial institutions, is the work of analyzing trends among financial institutions with regard to lending and deposits. "Window guidance," the practice whereby the BOJ determined lending limits for each bank, was abolished in July 1991, but it is still necessary to monitor the activities of each bank in terms of how funds are absorbed and invested. With the problem that has developed with regard to nonperforming loans, another important role for the division is responding to anxieties about the financial system and being able to prevent any future disruptions to the settlement system. A special team was formed last year to carefully monitor trends among nonbanks and companies specializing in housing loans, sectors which have been hard hit by nonperforming loans. The reorganization of divisions was also an opportunity to shift the job of monitoring the international affairs of banks from the Foreign Division to the Financial Division. The aim was for this division to be able to monitor the domestic activities of individual banks as well as their activities abroad. Also coming under the charge of the Finance Division is the job of determining the soundness of the collateral offered by city banks when the BOJ extends credit to them. The head position in the Financial Division, like the head position in the Planning Division, is considered a star post for aspiring bureaucrats. Eiji Hirano (Class of 1973), who represents the third-generation of division chiefs to head the financial unit, feels that "in addition to developing the banking sector's future image, it is necessary to create the kind of environment that fosters competitiveness among banks." He says he would like to see "financial deregulation bring out more diversity and individuality among banks." [13 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Securities Division--Groping Its Way Toward Structural Reform in the Capital Market In December 1992, the Bank of Japan released a report titled "Regarding the Functions of the Stock Market." Its position, for the first time directly broaching the subject of stocks, sent ripples through the market community. The report, which pointed out the importance of the stock market as a way of restraining the behavior of firms, was co-authored by the Securities Division (Operations Bureau) together with the Research and Statistics Bureau. The analysis of the capital market by the Securities Division became the rationale for Governor Mieno's proposal last year for creating a market for the sale and purchase of nonperforming assets. After the conspicuous failure of capital market to function adequately following the collapse of the economic bubble, there has been more attention than even before on the Securities Division. The 18-member division is located on the second floor of the BOJ building between offices occupied by the Markets Division and the Financial Division. Following the panic on the securities market in 1965, it was finally elevated to its present divisional status in 1968; it was formerly the "securities desk" in the bureau's General Affairs Division. The Operations Bureau's current setup, with its Markets Division, Financial Division, and Securities Division--is the result of the organizational reform that was undertaken in 1990. Because there are strong ties between these three divisions, two members of the Securities Division also work in the Markets Division. The Securities Division collects information from securities firms with which the bank does business and monitors the ability of the capital market takes in and absorbs the central bank's directives. At the same time, its role is to pick up signals the market sends out and to input them into policy decisions. Compared to the Markets Division, which follows the market on daily basis, the Securities Division's role is to focus its attention on medium- and long-range problems. It guards a broad territory, and besides making recommendations to improve the system--for example, rationalizing corporate bond transactions--the division handles the job of assessing the market value of collateral securities when the bank loans out money. It also decides on suitable collateral. Just as the Financial Division superintends bank operations, one of the duties of the Securities Division is to monitor the operations of securities firms. Its top priorities, however, are policies aimed at restructuring the market and other such macro-level analyses. Division Chief Nobuo Inaba (Class of 1974) says that, when the average price of listings on the Nikkei suddenly nose dived soon after he assumed his post in May 1992, the question constantly on his mind was "what cause the sudden drop and what could be done about it," he recalls. Compared to the money market, the capital market--to the degree that it is less within the reach of the government arm--seems for those at the central bank to be where the market principle has been taken in and assimilated to a greater degree. With a strained smile, Inaba refers to the report released a year ago on the stock market. "We were told by those who work at securities firms," he says, "that matters are never that neat and clean." It looks as though it will be awhile yet before the Securities Division's goal--to build a better system in order to revitalize the capital market--will be able to actually change the real world. [14 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Markets Division--Monetary Regulation on a Day-to-Day Basis When the Nikkei average suddenly fell to the 15,000 yen level at the end of November 1993, the Bank of Japan promptly moved to increase the supply of funds to financial markets and urged lowering of the interest on unsecured next-day call [loans]. Lower interest rates then spread to the 3-month CD market and, in December, were linked to a 0.375 percent drop in the short-term prime rate offered by city banks. In other words, by regulating the money supply, the central bank was carrying out an easy-money policy and trying to apply brakes to falling stock prices. The unit responsible for carrying out monetary regulation on a day-by-day basis is the Markets Division in BOJ's Operations Bureau. The money market may be short of funds one day and oversupplied the next. In order to smooth out these bumps, monetary regulation sees to it that funds are supplied to or absorbed by the market. When funds continue to be slightly on the oversupply-side, it is taken as a sign of easy money. Minoru Masubuchi (Class of 1966), a consultant to the Operations Bureau, is the man currently responsible for monetary regulation. "I'm still doing the same work I did when I was young and in charge of such matters," he says wryly. With increasing progress being made toward deregulation, interest rates on bank deposits and on loans have come to respond sensitively to the slightest monetary adjustment, and such adjustments have taken on an even greater importance. The short-term money market, where the central bank makes its adjustments to the money supply, is also becoming more tightly interconnected with the stock, securities, and foreign exchange markets. Although all three divisions are under the Operations Bureau, it is the Markets Division that is becoming more closely tied to day-by-day monetary regulation and to monetary policy (for example, changes in the official discount rate) than the Financial and Securities Divisions. The Markets Division is under the overall supervision of Toshihiko Fukui (1958), a BOJ director who is also in charge of policy matters for the central bank. Both the Financial and Securities Divisions are under the charge of BOJ director Kunio Kojima (1960). An accurate understanding of the financial markets is indispensable when determining monetary policy. Members of the Market Division, which has been called an "information switchboard," are on the telephone with financial institutions even before the markets open, assiduously trying to decipher even the slightest market trends. Division Chief Masanori Tanabe (1975), who took his post last May, says, "With the market expanding and transactions becoming more complicated, it is important, so as not to lose sight of the market's view on interest rates, to at least keep an open mind to the market's rich, diverse texture." [18 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Bank Examination Bureau/Bank Examination and Management Divisions--Looking for Sound Bank Management "There was more commotion around here than we've ever seen." This is how Bank Examination Division Chief Yasuo Mizota (Class of 1972), a nine-year veteran of the bureau, characterizes last year in retrospect. Certainly, it was a year to jolt the Bank Examination Bureau's equanimity. In January, it was reported that information from the bureau's examination of Mitsubishi Bank documents had gotten into other hands, perhaps leaked, and the bureau chief was penalized with a drop in pay. Then, again in October, several newspapers reported the same thing happening in the bureau's examination of Fuji Bank's documents. The BOJ denied the allegations, but interest has grown in its information management system. Despite these events, it is also true, however, that in the midst of noticeably worsening bank profits, bank examinations are becoming increasingly important as a way of checking the soundness of bank management. "We must earn the people's trust by carrying out our business rigorously," stresses Mizota. The bureau's examiners are sent into the field to do on-site inspections and, in so far as they check for trouble spots, are like the Ministry of Finance's banking inspectors. One difference is that the MOF inspections are mandatory since the ministry has supervisory authority over the banks. The BOJ's examinations, on the other hand, assume a relationship of trust between the central bank and the financial institutions which are its customers. Again, unlike the MOF's inspections, which are made without prior notice, the BOJ's examinations are scheduled one month in advance. The Banking Examination Division actually carries out the examinations, to carry out the examinations, which are scheduled once every two-to-three years and usually last about three weeks. They are intended to give an accurate picture of the way banks are being managed and include interviews with bank officers and department heads, an inspection of the administrative operations of branch offices, and an inspection of bank documents. More recently, the emphasis has been on bank's risk management system. This is because banks are now subject to more complicated, high-tech risks. In addition to the appearance of so-called derivatives (financial derivative commodities), for example, banks are turning increasingly to computer systems. Thus, there are also efforts within the Bank Examination Division to upgrade skills through staff training courses taught by its more experienced members. The Management Division collects data related to a financial institution's management, including information on its profit situation. This information is collected on a regular basis and helps examiners during their site visits. Again, division members work closely with the Credit Systems and Operations Bureaus to consult on restructuring plans for financial institutions and then follow up on their progress. According to Division Chief Masahiro Sumikawa (Class of 1972), it is important, in order to maintain the stability of the financial system, to be able to see things through the eyes of the private sector. That attitude, he says, is something he wants his division to maintain. [19 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ International Bureau/General Affairs, Foreign Exchange Divisions--Central Bank's Intervention Task Force "The Bank of Japan [BOJ] is only one of many participants in the foreign exchange market. It can't control everything that happens." The speaker, the man who heads the International Bureau's Foreign Exchange Division, is Hirohisa Hashimoto (Class of 1974). Every day finds him hard at work trying to maintain "dialogue with the market." It is the Foreign Exchange Division chief who leads in the troops when the central bank decides to intervene and influence the exchange rate. When Hashimoto stepped into that position June 1993, every passing day seemed to be boosting the yen to another record high, and it wasn't unusual for him to be awakened late at night by an overseas caller. Though daily exchanges of information with the Ministry of Finance International Finance Bureau's Foreign Exchange Division might be expected, quite unexpected was the volume of calls, day and night, from overseas central banks in New York, Germany, and other countries. Despite of heroic efforts to intervene by selling off several billion dollars in yen currency, the exchange rate went $1 = 100.40 yen on 17 August, thrusting the yen to the threshold of a new era. Two days later, on the 19th, however, the Federal Reserve Bank in New York intervened to stop the massive selling of yen and somehow prevented the exchange rate from breaking through the 100 yen per dollar mark. Hashimoto managed to escape a serious crisis in his battle with the market. Qualified to act as the Minister of Finance's representative, the Foreign Exchange Division has the authority to intervene and buy or sell yen through the Foreign Exchange Fund Special Account. There are many ways to intervene. Depending on the situation, there may be efforts, for example, to "boost" the exchange rate level or to use some "behind-the-door" method. The Foreign Exchange Division will also undertake analyses of foreign economies with the primary aim of influencing exchange rates or investing in foreign markets using funds from Japan's foreign currency reserve. The job of coordinating activities within the International Bureau, including the Foreign Exchange Division, falls to the General Affairs Division. It is headed by Fumiaki Kimura (Class of 1972), who likens his division to "the BOJ's international strategy task force." Its work concerns laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Exchange Control Law, as they pertain to negotiations with foreign countries and agencies like the Ministry of Finance. It also concerns official pronouncements by the Bank of Japan governor--at meetings of the foreign ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven Nations (G7) or at Bank for International Settlements (BIS) meetings of central bank governors. As Division Chief Kimura has also been expending a great deal of his energies recently in establishing and maintaining relationships with Asian countries. In the past, economic diplomacy has been directed mainly toward Europe and the United States. This "Asia effort" means broadening Japan's economic ties with its more immediate neighbors through technical assistance and meetings with the heads of the central banks of some 11 Asian nations, including those of China and Southeast Asia. Last December, BOJ officials were also dispatched to Vietnam and Kyrgyzstan. Rather than the kind of bilateral ties that now exists between Japan and the United States and Japan and Europe, Kimura says his dream is to move toward "establishing multinational ties." [20 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ International Bureau/International Financial Division, Investment Division, Balance of Payments Division--Struggling with Derivative Commodities There is a theory--the "Age 35 Rule"--that says financial derivatives, which require a command of higher mathematics, is beyond the understanding of those past their mid-thirties. The International Financial Division's job is to look into these new products and devise the rules that will help eliminate the risks associated with them. For example, in the case of forward rate agreements (FAA), where the two parties involved agree on the interest rate to be paid at a future date, there is a question as to whether or not such estimates of future rates are a form of illegal gambling. Those in charge are charting new and unfamiliar territory, looking into laws and regulations, both national and foreign, they may never have imagined existed, and trying to understand if there are any market risks in such products. "It's all Greek to someone like me, who is past 35," says Division Chief Shinichi Yoshikuni (Class of 1973). "But the younger ones look on this new area as a challenge." His staff, which (unusual for BOJ) includes a graduate of Tokyo University's Engineering Department, is wrestling with a problem that has become an urgent concern for every central bank in the world. Staff members here are also responsible for studying the economic situation in regions throughout the world. International specialists, some with experience working with the International Monetary Fund, are Asia- and U.S.-watchers, studying to see where the economies of these countries are headed. The International Balance of Payments Division, on the other hand, collects microeconomic data regarding foreign countries and trade. Last August, for example, when the yen suddenly started to gain in value, the division held fact-finding hearings to address such questions as the impact of the stronger yen on export profits and on corporate plans to restructure or invest in plants and equipment. Staff members are constantly in touch with trading companies and manufacturers to put together figures on the balance of international payments. Their particular field is the collection and analysis of industrial data. Up-to-the minute information of this kind is then used as the basis for monetary policy decisions as it was last September when the official discount rate was lowered. Another pressing task before the division is to revise, for the first time in 30 years, [the type of data it gathers for] its statistics on the balance of payments. Japan's statistics are singled out as being behind-the-times by foreign critics. Says Division Chief Takayoshi Hatayama (Class of 1973), "We want to restructure our statistics to reflect the trend toward securitization that has emerged and toward more services like lease transactions and get a better grasp of the money flow." The Investment Division is entrusted by the minister of finance to superintend administrative matters concerning foreign exchanges such as the notification of receipt of foreign direct investments. With more and more progress being made toward internationalization, investment activities are getting more complicated every year. Understandably, Division Chief Kazuo Taneda (Class of 1972) is determined that his office will "respond with speed, clarity, and accuracy." [21 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Business Management Bureau/Divisions--Processing Data, Managing the Shop The Bank of Japan's image is closely tied to its role as a policy organization, which implements monetary policies (for example, by manipulating the official discount rate) and measures to maintain and foster Japan's credit system. However, as its name implies, it is also a "bank." The Business Management Bureau bears the responsibility for carrying out that role. Michiaki Morita (Class of 1972), who heads the General Affairs Division under this bureau, says of his goal: "As a banker's bank, we should be able to settle final accounts with the same ease that a fish takes to the water or bird takes to the air." His division is in charge of "regular business," as written in Article 20 of the Banking Law and is responsible for laying the groundwork which will facilitate the implementation of policy. One of the Business Bureau's main jobs is processing and managing data. For example, the bank handles 30,000 transactions (receipts and payments), the equivalent of 300 trillion yen, each day in its business with financial institutions which have current accounts with the bank. It also handles 3,600 transactions, the equivalent of 15 trillion yen, a day in settling government bond accounts. Again, as the National Treasury, it handles 500,000 transactions, or 4.5 trillion yen, per day in the receipt and disbursement of national funds such as annual pension funds. Data concerning these transactions are quickly processed by four divisions: the Settlement of Accounts Division, the National Treasury Services Division, the National Treasury Accounting Division, and the Government Bonds and Securities Division. "Needless to say, the work in these divisions is very exacting," says Katsutada Akiyama (Class of 1974), who heads the General Coordinating Division. "They bear very heavy responsibilities." With the installment of BOJ's computer network in 1988, it has been possible to effect large-scale rationalization in areas such as the settlement of bond accounts and transfers between current accounts. For disbursements of national funds, however, magnetic tapes are sent from the Ministry of Finance's accounting center, and on the basis of these tapes, itemized lists and portfolios are drawn up and distributed to financial institutions on a daily basis. Thus, the bureau is studying the possibility of switching in 1995 to computerized data processing in this area as well. The Market Affairs Division puts monetary adjustments as specified by the Markets Division of the Operations Bureau into effect. It is through this "window," opened to private-sector financial institutions, that incentives to lower short-term interest rates are carried out. It is also this division that carries out the central bank's government bond operations. The General Affairs Division works together with the Settlement System Division of the Credit Systems Bureau to study measures that can be taken to avoid non-payment or other settlement risks. According to Division Chief Morita, his staff is "considering various options that will enable accounts to be settled smoothly even in the unlikely event that a financial institution fails." The division is also giving its input into policy matters in order that the central bank's broad-ranging work can continue to proceed smoothly. [26 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Information and Computer Systems Bureau and Its Three Divisions--Providing Support for Japan's Settlement of Accounts System Last July a "fortress" was unveiled in an industrial park in Fuchu (Tokyo). The gray-walled nine-story building dominates the scene, looking sturdy enough to easily withstand even a temblor on the scale of the Great Kanto Earthquake. It is here that the computer system which supports Japan's financial structure is located. It is the central bank's network, controlling account settlements between fellow financial institutions. It is in this Fuchu annex, which the BOJ newly constructed to accommodate the growing volume of business it handles, that one finds the Information and Computer Systems Bureau ensconced far from the familiar environs of Nihonbashi. The bureau is in charge of developing, managing, and operating the entire computer system. The General Affairs Division is in charge of the plans and proposals that are entered into the system and is also responsible for coordinating divisions and carrying out communications with them. The division's new chief, Michitaka Yoneda (Class of 1973), assumed his post October 1993. "BOJ's network," he says, "supports the settlement system, which is the infrastructure of Japan's economy," and thus forcefully argues the importance of its mission. The Systems Development Division, with its staff of systems engineers, is involved in developing computer software. The Systems Operation Division's main job is to operate the system under normal circumstances and to be ready to respond when problems arise. Two important themes informing the development of the system were efficiency and stability. BOJ's network, which was put into operation in 1988, was equipped to meet both of these criteria. The current account deposits which banks and other institutions make with the central bank and build up as their reserve deposit are also used when banks exchange funds among themselves for domestic and foreign exchange transactions and for check clearances. Before, in order to transfer funds from such current accounts, a bank official would have to go to one of the central bank's teller windows and present a written request for the transfer. With the establishment of BOJ's computer network, however, the entire transaction can now be completed very simply at one of the computer terminals at the withdrawer's bank. Of course, in order to access BOJ's net by terminal, users will have to negotiate many layers of safeguards that have been put into place (for example, they will have to have the appropriate identification card and password). The system is also completely "hacker-safe." The Information and Computer Systems Bureau has also undertaken the development of a system to process information for use within the central bank. It also provides support, from the computer and systems end, for the delivery of taxes to the National Treasury, located in the central bank; for the disbursement of pension funds; for the management of financial statistics; and for the purposes of understanding the loan status or fund raising status of individual financial institutions. Sometimes systems development falls prone to the error of not keeping up with the latest technology. Conversely, it may latch on to technology that is so new as to be virtually unusable. The task then, says Division Chief Yoneda, is to "find a way to incorporate the best technology in a timely fashion," a task which is easier said than done when advances in technology are, as he says, occurring so rapidly. [28 Jan 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Research and Statistics Bureau/Economic Research Division, Planning and Research Division--Research in Step With Real World Realities Critics said, "The Economic Planning Agency announced the recession has bottomed out. Why hasn't the Bank of Japan?" Pressed by such critics, Akinari Horii (Class of 1974), head of the Economic Research Division, responded May 1993 with a statement that there were no signs to a recovery. Unfortunately, there has been no change in the economic recovery as Horii predicted. The Economic Research Division has the onerous responsibility of making economic assessments. The macro-side, his staff pursues trends in personal consumption and plant and equipment investment and, on the micro-side, financial trends and trends in corporate supply and demand. Equipped with this data and other information gathered from its branch offices, staff then put together the material that becomes the basis for economic assessments. This is done every quarter. Besides having worked in the Ministry of Finance, Horii has been assigned on temporary loan to work at the Bank for International Settlements as well as the World Peace Institute, which was established by former Prime Minister Nakasone. Including his years as an exchange student in the United States, he says, "out of my 20 years with the bank, eight were spend abroad." Which may be why, as he says, "the aim of our research is not necessarily to fit in with BOJ's reality but with the wider reality outside our doors." After Horii assumed his present post, that attitude has shown itself in the fact that the texts for public statements about the economy are written concisely and in a way easily understood by the general public. His aim, he says, is not to be swayed by policy or other such considerations but to produce "research that is accurate and neutral." If the Economic Research Division is likened to a regular army, in charge of studying economic trends over a certain period of time, then the bureau's irregular army is the Planning and Research Division, which undertakes studies targeting specific problems. "Shouldn't there be a quantitative measure we can use to judge the progress companies are making in adjusting their balance sheets?" "Is there an indicator we can use instead of money supply?" These are the kinds of probing questions this division asks. Its division chief is Kunio Okina (Class of 1974), a man with a scholarly bent, who has had many years of experience working at the BOJ Financial Institute and as an assistant professor at the University of Tsukuba (teaching international monetary theory). Economic Analysis of Expectation and Speculation, called by Ryuichi Tate, Tokyo University professor emeritus, "probably the first systematic study in the world on the bubble phenomenon," was released in 1985, early pointing out the dangers of an inflationary "bubble" economy. However, as Division Chief Okina reflects, "The publication came out too early to sound any alarms." Since then, he adheres to the view that research should be "a half step ahead of the economy." "If it tries to be two steps ahead," he says, "its findings won't be accepted." Given the dizzying speed at which the economic and financial situation changes, one can understand his determination to choose only those research topics that have the greatest time value. [1 Feb 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Research and Statistics Bureau/Economic Statistics Division, Commodity Price Statistics Divison--Economic Statistics, Promptly Compiled It was at 1345 on 10 December 1993, a crowd of over 500 stood at the east gate of the Bank of Japan building. They were from corporations and private research groups trying to get just-released copies of the November edition of BOJ's Short-Term Economic Survey of Principal Enterprises in Japan. As such scenes may indicate, interest is very high these days, not only at home but also overseas, in Japan's economy and particularly the kind of economic indicators that are released by the Bank of Japan and other knowledgeable sources. This is all the more true because of Japan's prolonged business slump and the lack of any visible signs of an exit door. Because BOJ's short-term survey contains both current data and information stretching back over many years, it is widely used by other government agencies and research groups to gain an understanding of the current state of the economy as well as to make forecasts and predictions about its future course. It is the Economic Statistics Division which handles the analysis and questionnaire survey. The division has a staff of about 40 people working on the Short-Term Survey, either in the corporate statistics group or in the financial statistics group, which is responsible for compiling data on deposits and loans and the money supply. Their goal, says Division Chief Mitsuo Fujimoto (Class of 1972), is to "work expediously to compile statistics that have a high degree of precision and reliability so as to reflect the actual state of the economy." That attitude shows itself in the fact that the number of those surveyed for the November edition has been increased to nearly 3,000 companies, many of the additional respondents coming from smaller enterprises and from the nonmanufacturing sector. Also important in getting an accurate picture of the economy are trends in the price of goods and services. The corporate service price index and wholesale price index are compiled by the Commodity Price Statistics Division, which is headed by Hiroshi Nakagawa (1975). "Commodity prices," he explains, "are a measure of the value of the currency. They are also like body temperature.' [A good thermometer] will register trends in goods and services." The division's work covers three areas: 1) thermometry (compiling statistics), 2) assessing changes in temperature (analysis), and 3) polishing thermometers (improving research and analytical methods). For example, to take the case of the wholesale price index, over 1,200 items are covered. This is over 90 percent of all products and merchandise traded among businesses. To get this data, staff members will actually go to the company or will make inquiries by phone and then enter their findings into computer terminals. Statistics are compiled at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of each month. The Bank of Japan states the objective of monetary policy is the launch Japan's economy "on the road to sustainable, inflation-less growth." These economic and commodity price statistics are important sign posts for the bank in giving direction to monetary policy. [3 Feb 94 p 2] [Text] BOJ Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies--Emphasizing Long-Term Returns on Basic Research Walking down the red-carpeted corridors on the second floor of the old Bank of Japan building, one's eyes are drawn to the portraits of bank governors, past and present, which are hanging on the walls. Unlike the busy corridors of the headquarters of the central bank, the atmosphere here is quiet. The room at the end of the corridor belongs to BOJ's Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies. The institute assumed its present form in 1982--the same year as BOJ celebrated its 100th anniversary. At the time of the institute's founding, then governor Haruo Maekawa spoke of the reason for establishing the institute. "What we anticipate from the institute," he said, "is basic research which will be of valuable use, if not immediately, then at least in the long run. It may seem at times to be research that is irrelevant to our immediate interests or that it is a long, roundabout way to get somewhere. But if we lengthen our horizons and take a long-term view, we ought to be able to see its value as one important link among many." An important difference between the institute and the Research and Statistics Bureau is that, while the latter provides the basic data from which to make daily policy decisions, the institute stresses basic research which will be useful in the long term. Researchers, here, are not only limited to in-house staff but are also brought in from outside the bank. According to Hiroo Taguchi (1971), who heads the First Research Division, "an important role of the institute is to serve as a bridge between the academic world and the real world of finance." The Research Institute has three divisions. The First Division, which Taguchi heads, is concerned with theoretical research dealing with basic questions about economies, monetary matters, and public finance. The Second Division is involved in research on regulations and systems related to economic problems and the Third Division, historical research. The Third Division is also in charge of running the famous Currency Museum as one of its field study courses. Research findings are published every month in Kinyu kenkyu, a collection of papers covering a broad range of research topics. Among the subjects covered in recent issues, for example, one finds papers titled: "Regarding Consumer Logic and Currency Demand" (December 1993), "Problems Concerning the Tax System and Financial Accounting" (October 1993), and "An Observation Regarding Deposit Insurance and Moral-Hazard Risk-Neutral Insurance Premiums" (October 1992). In each case the research represents a very specialized field of interest and yet is related to a current concern. For example, the paper on deposit insurance in the October 1992 issue. When viewed in light of events in the United States--where troubled banks have rushed to get insured deposits--the relationship between deposit insurance and the presence of moral hazard incentives needs to be considered in Japan as well. While it is basic research, it is research that tries to incorporate a contemporary perspective. This seems to be, in fact, one of the research institute's distinctive features. [4 Feb 94 p 2] [Text] MPT Postal Savings Bureau/Operations and Planning Division--Building the Framework for Deregulation The deregulation of interest rates on current, or floating, deposits has become the target of a great deal of interest and concern among private financial institutions. Hoping to put the deregulation of interest rates into effect by mid-1994, the Ministries of Finance [MOF] and Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] are on the final leg of their negotiations. Trying to build the framework for deregulation on the MPT side is the Planning Division in the Postal Savings Bureau. This is the division, considered the "brains" of the Postal Savings Bureau, which is involved in creating "products" [savings account plans] that are more attractive to depositors. It also formulates proposals to amend any regulations affecting such accounts. The unit is considered an elite post for those assigned there as division chief, a position held at one time or another by a number of the ministry's top-ranking officials. The current head of the Postal Savings Bureau, Akemi Yamaguchi (Class of 1963), and Chief Secretary Tsuyoshi Kimura (1966), for example, were both formerly division chiefs here. The man who currently heads the Operations and Planning Division, Chikanori Saio (1974), has been with the Postal Savings Bureau since 1989. The Operations and Planning Division is one of the few places that will receive advance notice of a change in the official discount. Word will be passed quietly into the chief's ear by a member of the Ministry of Finance. Communications of this sort is necessary because changes in the official discount rate are closely tied to changes in the interest paid on postal savings accounts. After last June's deregulation of interest rates on fixed-amount savings accounts, the most popular type of postal account, only the interest on regular savings accounts remained linked to the official discount rate. Before June 1993, advance word of a change would come several days before the change took effect. When the official discount rate was lowered in September [1993], however, word came only the night before. Perhaps, after regular savings account interest rates are deregulated, contact between the Ministry of Finance and the Operations and Planning Division--at least over the matter of the official discount rate--will stop entirely. Instead, what has become more important work for the division is deciding on interest rates for fixed term (new fixed-term) and fixed-amount savings. Here, the decisions have to be made on the basis of trends in market interest rates. As a rule, rates change for fixed-term savings every Monday and for fixed-amount savings on the first and third Mondays of each month. But the Operations and Planning Division announces changes in its rates on the Monday prior to their taking effect. Private financial institutions, which have competing fixed-term savings accounts, are very interested in those figures. Questions concerning current deposits, which have become the focus of much attention recently, are handled directly within the Operations and Planning Division by the unit set up to promote financial deregulation. This unit is headed by Seiji Katsuno (1978), an expert of long standing in the savings area. Negotiations on how to decide what the interest rate on regular savings accounts should be (it is now 1.32 percent per annum) are sailing on rough waters, and since last autumn Katsuno's unit has been swamped with work as negotiation with the Ministry of Finance continues.
