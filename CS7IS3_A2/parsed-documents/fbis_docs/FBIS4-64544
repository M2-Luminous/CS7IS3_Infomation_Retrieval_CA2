You should now try to influence the Greek Cypriot side." Prime Minister Tansu Ciller decided to send a letter after she returned from the United States and after Volkan Vural, chief adviser to the Prime Minister's Office, visited north Cyprus. The letter was conveyed to the U.S. Embassy in Ankara on Friday [29 April]. A copy of it was conveyed to the Turkish Embassy in Washington. Ciller's letter was also in reply to a letter she received from President Clinton before the local elections in Turkey. According to circles close to the Prime Minister's Office, the message that was conveyed in Ciller's letter to President Clinton was: "TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas agreed to the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. That was what he was expected to do. However, the CBM's package was later changed. In view of that, the ball is now in the Greek Cypriot side's court. We ask you to try to see to it that the Greek Cypriot side takes a conciliatory approach." It will be recalled that President Clinton met Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at the White House last month. He asked her to pressure Denktas to agree to the CBM's.
