The KYODO NEWS SERVICE today quoted Japanese Government sources as saying that the U.S. Government has suggested that financial services, glass, intellectual property, lumber, and antitrust policy and deregulation be added to the list of priority areas for negotiations. Currently, the priority sectors in the wide-ranging framework are government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, insurance, and auto parts. The sources were quoted as saying that the Japanese Government will basically accept the U.S. proposals apart from the lumber sector. KYODO said the proposal was made during vice ministerial-level discussions in Washington which led to the breakthrough in the framework talks following a three-month stalemate. The trade framework negotiations were agreed upon last July as a means of cutting Japan's swelling trade surplus with the United States, but hit a snag in February this year due to a discord over a U.S. demand for "objective criteria" to measure the opening of Japan's market to foreign imports. Meanwhile, Japan's Ambassador to the United States Takakazu Kuriyama said his country needed to take steps to significantly reduce its politically sensitive current account surplus and implement a market-opening package to successfully conclude the bilateral trade talks. Kuriyama, who is currently in Japan to prepare for the upcoming visit to the United States by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, made the statement at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. He said Tokyo and Washington agreed to resume the stalled framework talks because both sides shared the view that it is undesirable to keep tense economic and trade relations "drifting" since that would hurt overall bilateral relations. He added that the two countries also reached the accord because it deepened understanding about each other's positions on the trade talks.
