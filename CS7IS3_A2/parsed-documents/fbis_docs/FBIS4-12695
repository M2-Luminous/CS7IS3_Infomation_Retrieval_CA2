He will be released within two weeks, the Supreme Court decided today. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that Ben-Yishay was issued an order confining him to the boundaries of Qiryat Arba' and compelling him to report to the police every day for two months. He also undertook not to give interviews to the media, address public rallies, or engage in incitement. The Jerusalem District Court gave Mendes Qeysar, an inhabitant of Qiryat Arba', a 21-month suspended sentence because he took part in a disturbance in the course of which he attacked a policeman under aggravated circumstances. Qeysar was fined 12,000 shekels for the attack on the policeman. Our police affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that an Arab inhabitant of East Jerusalem was shot dead in a disturbance near Hebron five months ago, but the shooter was not caught.
