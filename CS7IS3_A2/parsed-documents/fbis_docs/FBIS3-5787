"Our forces are based at the same positions of Sala Krau, 10 kilometers (six miles) north of Pailin, and Samlot, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Pailin, and along Road 10," General Chum Chheang told AFP. "We did not move our forces up because of the king's appeal recently that we and the NADK (Khmer Rouge) must stop fighting. So our forces are waiting for the order from the government," the general said in Phnom Penh. "I strongly believe that the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have sufficient capability to capture Pailin if there is the order from the government," he added. [passage omitted] Khieu Samphan, the nominal leader of the Marxist Khmer Rouge, issued a statement from his jungle base on Tuesday, accepting the monarch's proposal. [passage omitted] But Chum Chheang cast doubt on Khieu Samphan's statement. The Khmer Rouge leader "never rejects the king's proposals, but he always practices the opposite," Chum Chheang said. "He always says this and does the other way." Cambodian forces began first serious moves to take Pailin, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh, last Saturday when they captured Sala Krau and Samlot and began advancing along Road 10. In addition to the three-pronged assault, an elite unit of 200 paratroops was stationed to the west of Pailin to cut off any retreat of the Khmer Rouge across the border with Thailand, some 10 kilometers (six miles) away. [passage omitted] There had been unconfirmed reports that government forces had begun shelling Pailin with long range artillery, but Chum Chheang denied this. "I did not receive any report from the front line as saying government troops have started shelling," he said. The general also denied Khmer Rouge accusations that the Cambodian government would buy guns with the money provided by the International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia, which began Thursday in Tokyo. "This is not true," Chum Chheang said. "We can not take development aid to buy guns." [passage omitted]
