The poll was conducted by telephone with 1,002 persons from Monday [21 March] to Wednesday, that is, in the middle of the hectic final talks in Brussels. To the question of which party they would vote for if the Storting election were now, 72.7 percent of the interviewed gave a reply. For the first time in a very long time there are no fluctuations beyond what the normal margin of error would allow for. The Center Party advances by 0.9 percent, but in February suffered a considerable decline, so that the March progress may signify an adjustment upward to what the party's real level is. Another thing to note is that the number of undecideds is increasing. The background data indicate that this is true for voters from all parties. The Labor Party, in spite of a decline of 0.8 percent, is stable at a very high level; it is clear that they benefit from a very high mobilization of their voters. The Conservative Party's decline has stopped. The party has stabilized at a level very close to the election outcome of last September. All the attention the media has given to the Conservatives' search for a leader does not appear to have caused the party's faithful to waver. This will be a good foundation for the party's new leadership to build on. There are two other parties it will be exciting to follow in the coming months: the Christian People's Party and the Socialist Left. The former is struggling at an alarmingly low level and is having problems holding on to its voters. With regard to the Socialist Left, we can see from the background data that there are clear warning signals for this party also. Loyalty has dropped by 20 percent, and even though the March poll figures are almost identical to the election results last September, there are indications that the Socialist Left voters have become less stable. Time will tell whether the Socialist Left and the Christian People's Party will be able to do anything about their problems with the voters. Today's poll prompts these questions, but we cannot draw any firm conclusions. - Poll results 16 March: Labor 39.3, Conservatives 17.4, Center Party 16.8, Socialist Left 8.0, Christian People's 6.1, Progress 5.6, Liberals 3.1, Red Electoral 1.0, Others 2.7. - Poll results 9 February: Labor 40.1, Conservatives 17.0, Center Party 15.9, Socialist Left 9.1, Christian People's 6.2, Progress 5.3, Liberals 3.5, Red Electoral 1.4, Others 1.5. - Poll results 12 January: Labor 41.6, Conservatives 16.0, Center Party 18.1, Socialist Left 7.4, Christian People's 6.6, Progress 5.7, Liberals 2.9, Red Electoral 0.6, Others 1.2.
