Nichimen Corporation will formally conclude a contract with the Kazakh Government on behalf of Japanese partners in the consortium. The total project cost is estimated at $1.2 billion and the Japanese partners are likely to win a more than $600-million contract. The Bank of Export and Import of Japan is committed to extending $300 million in loans to Kazakhstan and it is highly possible that Japan's trade insurance will be applied for the first time to that country. The Japanese Government and oil companies, that are eager to diversify energy supply sources for Japan and increase Japan's aid to former Soviet republics other than Russia, are eyeing Central Asian nations that are rich in resources. The oil-refinery modernization project is likely to provide an impetus for improving relations between Japan and Central Asian nations. The Japanese partners in the oil-refinery modernization project are three general trading firms -- Nissho Corporation, Marubeni Corporation, and Itochu Corporation -- and Chiyoda Corporation and JGC Corporation. The Kazakh oil refinery to be modernized under the project is the Adeirau [name as published] Oil Refinery on the northern coast of the Caspian Sea, which was built with U.S. aid. The refinery, which went into operation in 1945, is highly obsolete. The oil refinery is known to be capable of refining 6 million tons of oil a year, but its capacity has dropped to 4.5 million tons. The oil-refinery modernization project will bring its capacity back to 6 million tons by replacing one refinery facility with two oil facilities. The project also will improve the oil refinery's productivity by raising the refining rate of lead-free diesel and gasoline. With regard to the project, Hydra Carbon Engineering [name as published], a French firm, and Ronald Service, a British firm, that had continued to negotiate with the Kazakhs, concluded a basic contract last summer. Later, however, the two European firms were found to be unable to implement the project. For this reason, the six Japanese firms and Fueros Tal [name as published], a German construction firm, have been asked to participate in the project.
