Because Bophuthatswana seems to have faded away. What are we dealing with here? [Van der Walt] There is a very small distinction between the laws of Bophuthatswana and South Africa. In many respects, the laws of Bophuthatswana are more advanced than those of South Africa. But to make it easy, those Bophuthatswana laws that is not in a position to be a free and fair election will still apply. [Mashokwe] What are we dealing with here, Dr. van der Walt? Please explain to me. Is Bophuthatswana still in place, but the government administration has been removed? Therefore the laws of Bophuthatswana are still in place, and Bophuthatswana is still an entity, as it were. [Van der Walt] I spoke to the chief justice this afternoon and asked him to continue with the legal procedures as usual, so all the normal Bophuthatswana laws are still in place, and we'd like to do this as legally as possible. But there has been an outcry. There has been a deep-felt concern from the people in Bophuthatswana that they want to participate in the election. So that's why I say those laws in Bophuthatswana that inhibit free and fair political activity is null and void. [Mashokwe] Are you saying to me the laws in South Africa will now apply in Bophuthatswana, which is independent? [Van der Walt] No specific law will apply there. [Mashokwe] You don't need a parliament or anything to ratify the [word indistinct] of the policies, the new governor, new administer to somehow come in with all [word indistinct]? [Van der Walt] Because of the agreement between the two defense forces, and because of the fact that Bophuthatswana Defense Force requested us to come in here, and because I've got to (?read) reality, I value human life, human quality of life, I'll remain within the confines of the law as far as humanely possible in that sense, even to the niceties, but at this stage the priority is to get the country moving once again. [Mashokwe] Let's elaborate on moving once again. When are people going back to work? [Van der Walt] Tomorrow. [Mashokwe] Have they been informed? [Van der Walt] Yes, we requested them to go back. I had discussions with senior civil servants. I meet a delegation again tonight. I'll be speaking to civil servants again tomorrow at nine. I had discussions with leaders of the public. So we call on the civil servants and people in public to go back to work as normal, and we will address their grievances. But by all means, let this part of South Africa get moving once again. And in that sense, let's say: Make what Bophuthatswana has achieved in the past 16 years still alive and an asset for the Province North-West. [Mashokwe] Okay, the people of Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation, for instance, have been fired--all of them--lock, stock, and barrel. Are they going to be reemployed and going back to their posts tomorrow? [Van der Walt] Yes indeed, and that applies to all civil servants. My government will guarantee their salary, their pension, their possessions. Whether they've been fired or not in all departments. Secondly, we're urgently looking at parity because, in quite a number of ways, Bophuthatswana is lagging behind South Africa. Of course, this will take a bit of time, so the civil servants at least can expect this month their normal pay. Next month, we'll have had time to look at the situation so that we can be all equal -- equal work, equal pay. [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand this: They demanded 50 percent increase or they will strike. Are you saying you'll give that to them come the first of May. You'll only have a government of what, like 30 days after the [word indistinct]. [Van der Walt] Yes, we're meeting with them. Indeed there are certain structures within the civil service who are 50 percent behind salaries, not only in the Republic of South Africa, but in Transkei, Venda, and Ciskei. So what we want to have is parity, equality. We will deal with each case with the greatest responsibility and in closest consultation. [Mashokwe] Are you talking of addressing....[pauses] Talking of parity, Dr. van der Walt, is it going to be backdated? -- because parity that these people are looking for does not date from the first of April or the first of May. They say other civil servants in South Africa were given these increases years ago, months ago. How are you going to deal with that? [Van der Walt] I'm not a one-man-show. I have committees working with this kind of thing, but I'd like to assure the people that we'll see that justice is being done. I can't go into the details. I do refer to the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation, the remnants of the board, and unfortunately quite often when you deal with structures here I've got to speak about the remnants. They met this afternoon. They assured me that they hoped to be on the air, television and radio, by 1100 tomorrow, and then we'll have the possibility of direct communication with the broader public. So our priority is to go back to work normal. There is still communication, because that was a serious problem in the past, and then we move ahead. [Mashokwe] The chairman, is he still chairman, the son of the president? [Van der Walt] No, he is out. [Mashokwe] Is he out? What about the oldies, the pensioners who haven't been paid? They are hungry sitting over there and complaining? [Van der Walt] We've got to get....[pauses] Our priorities is this way; deal with the bigger picture, see what we can do with the general structure, and then the sooner we can look at individual cases we'll do that, but I urgently ask people to be patient at this stage. We referred earlier to political rallies, et cetera, et cetera. My urgent plea would be, be calm; Justice Kriegler will give us a program. Give us time to put those things in order, and may I say I'm very happy that Mr. Mandela already responded to our serious call to postpone his coming here for at least a day. All political leaders are welcome, but at this stage it is a risk to have a rally or demonstration or mass meeting. [Mashokwe] He's not coming tomorrow then. When is he coming? [Van der Walt] He's not coming tomorrow. At this [word indistinct] preliminary on Tuesday. My personal wish would be just give us a little more time. [Mashokwe] Dr. Tjaart van der Walt thanks for talking to us, and thanks for your time. [Van der Walt] Thank you very much. It's a privilege, and let's do something to make Bophuthatswana an asset for the new South Africa.
