Therefore, it is appropriate to stress the efforts of workers at the Santa Cruz del Norte power plant. Victor Veiga, head mechanic, will explain the work they are doing and will refer also to past experience and future prospects. [Begin recording] [Veiga] Before beginning the maintenance work, we held a meeting of all the workers -- 72 in all, counting mechanics, operators, electricians, and other support workers -- and we agreed to work longer shifts in order to have the engine ready by Sunday and not by Monday, so as to guarantee the peak consumption time on 1 May. We hope to complete our work by then. This is the main objective of our repairs. So far, the maintenance work has not been fully successful because we have had problems with the water supply from the Santa Cruz del Norte aqueduct. Nevertheless, we have overcome other difficult situations and we are trying to overcome these problems. We were to do the cracking [craqueo] in boiler No. 1 to eliminate dirt and smut from the boiler. We must first remove the dirt to make the cleaning job easier. We were unable to do so because we did not have enough water. The pipes had experienced some damage and we needed more water. [Garcia] Veiga also explained that they are already beginning to clean the water pipe system. [Veiga] We have located all the problems and are now in the process of washing the [words indistinct] and superheaters so as to begin the repair work and to finish it by Saturday night, at the latest, so the engine will be ready for Sunday. We believe that if the water supply is normalized; we should have no problem in resuming full operation on Sunday to meet peak consumption hours. But if we have the same problem, if the water pressure is not increased and we are short of water, we cannot guarantee operation either on Sunday or on Monday. This plant has three units: No. 1, which is now under light maintenance but is operational; No. 2, under full maintenance that is expected to conclude in approximately 110 or 115 days; and No. 3, which is in a stage of investment. We hope to begin the first stages of operation by the end of the year. We also have boiler No. 4 in the back yard; but after the suspension of trade and commercial relations with the Soviet Union, we decided that we could fix up only to unit No. 3. As the minister [not further specified] has explained, this year we intend to put at least up to unit No. 3 into operation. [Garcia] Some of the workers who are really busy with these repair activities will also give their impressions. [First worker] I am Gilberto Azardena and I am in charge of maintenance here. I am the head of the maintenance team, in charge of repairing turbogenerator No. 1. Right now we are in the process of repairing a number of failures in the engine. [Second worker] My name is Jose Luis Vargas Ramirez and I am trying to recover a valve that was in poor condition. So far, we are facing the problems on a rather average level -- not too well, I would say. [Garcia] But are you resolving them? [Second worker] Yes, of course. We are making progress. [Garcia] Maintenance on unit No. 1 of the Santa Cruz plant is one of many being carried out in the country, and the efficiency and expeditiousness with which this work is done depends to a great extent on the possibilities for improving the current capacity of the national energy system.
