Andreas Khol, the South Tirol expert of the Austrian People's Party, said in an interview with KURIER: -- about Mitolo's demand: "He is not alone; his statements must be taken very seriously. For the first time, the neofascists are in the government in Rome. In this respect the situation is more dangerous than any time since 1945." -- about consequences for Austria: "We must remain level-headed. We are willing to defend the vital rights of the South Tiroleans, if they are threatened. The conference in Vienna must send a clear signal to Italy that we will prevent any restriction of autonomy. At the moment everything is just a controversy among the parties, but if the new Italian Government were to implement specific measures, the Austrian Government would have to react." -- about potential countermeasures: "The ambassador could be recalled for consultations and the Italian ambassador could be summoned to the Foreign Ministry to receive a note of protest. One could call for negotiations. Rome knows that any violation of the autonomy package will end up before the International Court of Justice. It is the great advantage of the package that it guarantees an international instance." -- about the effects on the border at the Brenner: "The other side determines the tone. We are interested in friendly relations. If Italy, however, were to question the borders, it must accept that we will call the Brenner border into question."
