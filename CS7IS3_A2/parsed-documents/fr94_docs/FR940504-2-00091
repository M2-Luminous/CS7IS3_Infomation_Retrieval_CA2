FR940504-2-00091 FR940504-2-00079 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Meridan National Corporation, Common Stock, $0.01 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;10286 April 28, 1994. Meridan National Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on October 25, 1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the BSE. The Company's Common Stock will continue to be traded in the over-the-counter market. The decision of the Board was based upon belief that listing of the Company on the BSE was not beneficial to its stockholders in that there was little or no activity in the Company's Common Stock. Any interested person may, on or before May 19, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
