He was addressing an IFP rally at Ngwelezana just outside Empangeni in Natal, a day after the IFP's Central Committee decision that the party is not to take part in the elections. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Linda van Tilburg] The Youth Brigade, his young lions as Dr. Buthelezi calls them, came to listen to their leaders' message, but his words did not hold much hope for a peaceful new South Africa. [Buthelezi in English] I would like to say that sadly -- it is also a sign of apprehension -- I am forced to warn you that there are difficult times ahead of us. [Van Tilburg] Even some of his older supporters, some with sticks and [word indistinct] in their hands, all gathered with the young people at the Ngwelezana sport field. Many had been transported from the nearby Esikhawini township. For those people who have been living with violence for a long time, he said they must fight back when IFP members were being attacked. To the government and the ANC [African National Congress] Dr. Buthelezi once again set out the demands for his party's participation in the election. They asked for recognition of the king's powers, a double ballot paper, an own tax base for regions, autonomy of Natal-kwaZulu, and also a federal system. [end recording]
