We cannot alone rely on the authority that the new Russian constitution grants to President B. Yeltsin to exercise a large influence on the country's foreign and domestic policies. There is no doubt that B. Yeltsin, being under pressure from the militant wing of the legislature, will make certain compromises that will have a negative effect on the Baltic states. It is difficult to predict today what definite moves will be made in this direction. It is clear, however, that our currently complicated relations with the great neighbor will be even more complex. Therefore, our policy toward Russia must be better considered and adequately diplomatic. First of all, we must take more intensive care of the integration of Lithuania, as well as of other Baltic states, with West European security structures. This, of course, does not mean Lithuania's militarization, but only a protective umbrella against any aggression. I think that the first significant move in this direction was made last Wednesday [15 December] during a meeting of the three Baltic presidents in Tallinn. The presidents clearly formulated and expressed the desire of their countries to integrate with West European security structures. It is probable that West European countries will also become more attentive to the wishes of the Baltic states after the change in Russia's political situation. The second problem that we should consider seriously today is the possible economic pressure on our country. After the collapse of the monopoly of Russia's Government as the sole manager of production, private business structures, out of pure economic interest, will do business with those who will bring a higher profit. Under political pressure, economic ties with Russia may become more complicated. Therefore, it is vital for Lithuania to look for alternatives in other countries. The advancement of the construction of the oil terminal becomes simply crucial within this context. To put it short, Lithuania, as well as other Baltic states, must closely observe events in Russia today and speed up its integration into Western Europe by all possible measures; certainly, by maintaining normal relations with all neighbors.
