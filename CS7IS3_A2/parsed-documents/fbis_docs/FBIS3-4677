In view of their importance to the people of the two countries, that is a worrying and regrettable fact. The immediate cause of the situation is the rupture of the recent talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Clinton on the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations. Some argued that the breakdown of the talks was a sign of "maturing relations" between the two countries. Given the subsequent chorus of criticism of Japan by the U.S. Government and Congress, as well as the fact that Japanese Government officials were upset by that criticism, however, it is difficult to see the "mature relations" between the two countries that the prime minister talked about. It is also of concern that arguments hailing Japan's saying "No" to U.S. demands are tinged with nationalism. Nobody will deny that the relations between Japan and the United States must mature further. That is all the more reason why we must have a sense of balance and think of the current trade frictions in the context of the total Japan-U.S. relationship. We must be coolheaded and not lose sight of the mid-and long-term trends. Both the Japanese and the U.S. Governments consider the partnership of the two countries on three levels: "political and security matters," "economy," and "cooperation in tackling worldwide problems." They have also agreed that the economic link is the weakest among the three. The economic framework talks were arranged precisely for the purpose of strengthening such a weak link in bilateral relations. Many Japanese and American people who had expected the two leaders to have talks from the broad perspective of turning point in world history -- even though the talks were part of new economic consultations -- must have been bewildered that their talks were like trade negotiations. Nor can it be overlooked that the present Japan-U.S. relations reflect the nature of the U.S. administration. The Clinton administration gives the highest priority to putting the U.S. domestic economy on track and has no qualms in targeting American diplomacy at creating jobs in the United States and promoting its exports. It has also been pointed out that the American President does not have insightful and influential advisers who make up for his inexperience in diplomacy. After the end of the Cold War, the Americans became inward- looking, and Congress, trade unions, and the industry tend to be protectionist-minded. Under such circumstances, the President may have thought he would lose nothing in domestic politics by adopting a strong attitude against Japan, which racked up a trade surplus with the United States amounting to nearly $60 billion a year. On the other hand, Prime Minister Hosokawa did not show any willingness to rise to the occasion by implementing deregulation and economic pump-priming measures to meet the wishes of the people here and abroad. The rupture in the talks, which at first glance looked as if it were the outcome of hard decisions made by the two leaders, really resulted from Clinton and Hosokawa evading the more difficult choice of exercising leadership from a broad perspective in their respective domestic politics. To open the domestic market, put the economy on a road toward growth driven by domestic demand, and build a consumer-oriented nation are policy options that were not adopted to please the Americans or any other people. Those are choices made to usher in a brighter future for the Japanese themselves and are aimed at building the "nation with substance" that the prime minister propounded. What is important is not to make a fuss over responses to immediate problems, but to steadfastly take measures that are meaningful in the medium and long-term. If we take a little broader view, we find the Americans have begun to regain confidence in themselves as the economy has started to recover. At the state level, Japanese investment in the United States has been favorably evaluated. The Americans' understanding of the mutual dependence between Japan and the United States has gradually been gaining ground, though the trend is slowing. Immediately before and after the summit talks between the Japanese and U.S. leaders, there were noticeably levelheaded arguments in the U.S. media that "the Japanese had a good case." And an opinion poll published by the Prime Minister's Office in Japan showed that the Japanese who thought that "the Americans were also partly right" in the trade frictions between the two countries outnumbered those who thought the friction resulted from the Americans' emotional response. Signs of "maturity" should be sought in such aspects of Japanese and American opinion. What is most needed now is a reasonable attitude so that the mutual mistrust and impatience exhibited by political leaders and bureaucrats will not widen and create mutual distrust at the grass- roots level.
