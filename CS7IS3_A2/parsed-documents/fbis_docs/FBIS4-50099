Holger Svensson, a renowned bridge expert from Germany, made this remark here yesterday while visiting the Yangpu Bridge together with some 100 other bridge engineers from 19 countries and regions. These experts are attending the 1994 International Symposium on Cable-Stayed Bridges here. He praised the design of the Yangpu Bridge, with a span of 602 m [meters], as "first-rate", its welding techniques as "perfect" and its structure as "excellent". Walter Podolney, a structural engineer with the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, said that the erection of the Yangpu Bridge across the Huangpu River is not only a matter of pride for the entire Chinese people, but also for mankind in conquering rivers. He added that so far the bridge still has the biggest span of any cable-stayed bridge in the world. However, cable-stayed bridges with even bigger spans are being built in France and Japan. "So, there is no limit to the progress made by mankind," he noted. Dr. Man Chung Tang, a professor at Columbia University and chairman of DRC Consultants Inc. of the United States, revealed that a cable-stayed bridge with a span of 865 m in Normandy, France, is scheduled for completion later this year. Another cable-stayed bridge, with a span of 890 m, in Japan is set for completion in 1997, said Man, who helped the Asian Development Bank examine all data concerning the Yangpu Bridge in 1991. The bridge was built with a loan from the bank. The bridge in France is a concrete bridge, while the bridge in Japan is a steel one, he said. But the Yangpu Bridge is a concrete and steel composite girder bridge, he said, noting that it is different from the above two bridges in terms of structure. Lin Yuanpei, chief architect of the Yangpu Bridge, accompanied the foreign guests on their visit to the bridge. Lin said that the erection of the Yangpu Bridge is inseparable from contributions from foreign bridge experts. "Yes, it belongs to China and yet it is a crystallization of mankind's engineering progress," he said.
