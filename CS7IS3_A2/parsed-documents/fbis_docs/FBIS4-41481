The so-called "intelligence community" of the United States is reminiscent of a gigantic octopus. It comprises agencies like the CIA with a budget of $3 billion, the National Reconnaissance Office [natsionalnoye razvedyvatelnoye upravleniye] which is responsible for satellite intelligence and receives $7 billion annually, the National Security Agency which gathers information by electronic means and spends $4 billion, the Pentagon's Operational Agency for Tactical Intelligence [operatsionnoye upravleniye takticheskoy razvedki] with a budget of $12 billion, and the Department of Defense Defense Intelligence Agency whose annual expenditure comes to $600 million. Today, even in Washington people are beginning to realize that such expenditure on spying activities cannot be justified. The U.S. National Security Council has set about studying how best to define the intelligence community's role in the present circumstances. THE WASHINGTON POST wrote that the main purpose of their ongoing investigation is "first to identify the threats which the United States will encounter in the next 10-20 years, and second to determine the manpower and resources available to neutralize them." The study of U.S. intelligence activities is still far from being completed. But it is already clear that the individual changes which have recently been implemented in the major U.S. intelligence agencies are cosmetic in nature and do not provide for fundamental change. Their previous structure remains unchanged, though the problems they solve and the volume of their work have changed significantly. Even certain former high-ranking CIA staffers now openly admit that it is essential to fundamentally reform the intelligence agencies and to limit their role. Each state, of course, strives to possess the fullest possible information about what is happening in the world, what threats they might expect, and from where these threats might come. Such information is gathered in various ways, including intelligence sources. But it is one thing when some country comes up against major potential dangers, as was the case during the period of global confrontation along an East-West axis. It is a completely different matter when it is only a question of conflicts at a regional level, like, for example, those the United States has come up against in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia. Thus, you get the impression that the wind of change blowing across the world has not affected the U.S. intelligence community. It continues to act in accordance with past standards. Naturally, the billions of dollars are not being spent on spying against the Cocos Islands or Transkei. But the question naturally arises: Against whom then?
