It plunged the fragile coalition into its most serious political crisis. Members of the coalition were evidently embarrassed when senators and the opposition collaborated to defeat the government on a procedural vote over which amendments to take first. They eventually voted together to get the opposition's bill adopted by the Parliament in its first reading. Two days before the extraordinary session was due to begin, the opposition tore up a gentleman's agreement made on Feb 15 -- that eight of the 25 proposed amendments would be introduced first, and after they had been passed, the others would be considered. What happened yesterday was indeed an eye-opener. That the opposition is serious about national unity is certainly a joke. Promoting democracy is definitely the last thing on their mind and wanting to give a facelift to the Constitution so that it incorporates the aspirations, rights and liberties of all Thais was, and never has been, on their agenda. The many technical flaws which are obvious in the hastily drawn-up charter draft only dilutes the opposition leaders' claim that it was a serious piece of legislation. Chat Thai leader Praman Adireksan, who is also the opposition leader, said the opposition was not bargaining for anything in introducing to Parliament a new charter draft. The opposition has carefully studied the changes for the people's interests, so he claimed. We have to take this with a pinch of salt. The opposition has chosen the 1978 Constitution as a model for a new charter because it would benefit senators, bureaucrats and political parties. Ordinary citizens come last. The 1978 Constitution sets the size of the Senate at three- quarters that of the Lower House, which means that the number of senators would remain at 270 and not be reduced to 120, as had been agreed upon by the government and opposition on Feb 15. It allows senators to submit interpellations to Cabinet members and allows a nonelected official to become prime minister. The opposition in fact baited the Senate to garner its support and it comes as no surprise why the Upper House fell hook, line and sinker for it. Without doubt, the interests of senators, many of whom are military men and senior bureaucrats whose vocabularies do not include the word democracy, would be protected. On Tuesday, the opposition announced it wanted to do away with the-present Constitution because it was a legacy of the National Peacekeeping Council (NPKC) which staged the February 1991 coup. The irony of ironies is that yesterday they had no qualms about joining hands with the Senate which was appointed by the military junta in early 1992. Rather embarrassing to our fledgling democracy, which was won on Rachadamnoen Avenue in May 1992, has been the Senate which has been described as an unwanted legacy of the NPKC. They have, all this while, withstood any attempts to revamp their selection methods, curb their powers and reduce their numbers. As the saying goes: Birds of a feather flock together. That the "satanic" character of the opposition should again rear its ugly head is indeed no surprise. In 1992, some of them were clearly in the NPKC camp and, prior to the shootings of prodemocracy demonstrators on Rachadamnoen Avenue, were backing then prime minister Suchinda Kraprayun to the hilt. The fact that all the key military leaders, including Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak and Army Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit, voted for the opposition's draft yesterday should have a far-reaching impact. But it is too early to draw a conclusion that they are deserting the coalition in favour of the opposition. Technically speaking, with only 193 votes in Parliament, the government is really in for a hard time, especially when it can no longer count on the Senate for support. However, it has to be remembered that this is the government for which blood was shed in May 1992. In the September 1992 elections it was voted into power on a mandate of popular support. The Senate's revolt yesterday should serve as a rude awakening for the Chuan government. Its initial vacillating over the amending of the charter has disappointed many people and paved the way for the opposition's offensive. The coalition has to take equal blame for what happened yesterday. It is obvious that the opposition's ultimate aim is to force Chuan to dissolve the House with the hope that it can return with more seats in a snap election. Of course, it would be foolish to believe that a new election will bring in a new generation of MPs with an "angelic quality". The sure bet is that most, if not all, of the politicians associated with money politics will be able to buy their way right back into Parliament. Our hope is that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and his government learn a lesson from this latest political episode. It is still not too late for him and his coalition members to leave behind political bickerings to seriously set their sights on tackling issues besetting the nation. Only through serious work can the coalition hope to regain the public's faith which is fast dwindling. What can save the Chuan government now is not how it can outsmart the opposition, but how it can win over the hearts of the people.
