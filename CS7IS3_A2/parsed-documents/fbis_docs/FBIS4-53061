[Ichikawa] There are now so many issues to be dealt with by Japan, such as expanding domestic demand, market liberalization, and the suspected DPRK (North Korea) nuclear arms program. These problems are difficult to deal with regardless of who is in the cabinet. We are a minority in the Diet, but I think we should find a way through--by making efforts to turn the cabinet into one which is supported by the public. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is some talk about the possibility of the House of Representatives being dissolved soon. [Ichikawa] I expect many issues to be raised in the course of the Diet deliberations on the budget bill, but I do not think that will trigger dissolution of the house. Dissolution of the house or the resignation en masse of the cabinet can be considered only when the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] presents a motion of no confidence in the cabinet, and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] supports it. But if that happens, I would like to ask this question--what is the justification for it? If the SDPJ decides to cooperate in the motion, that will only mean the political regime of 1955 will be revived. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think about the possibility of the next general election being conducted under the current medium electoral district system? [Ichikawa] The next general election should be held under the new single-seat district system combined with the proportional representation system. After all, the political reform bills were passed with the approval of both the LDP and the SDPJ. SDPJ Chairman Murayama recently said, "the general election should be held under the current system after an agreement is made on the zoning of the single-seat districts." What he said can be interpreted as meaning he wants to crush political reform and revert to the original state. If that happens, it will constitute an act of blackmailing the people. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When do you want the bill on zoning of the single-seat districts to be enacted? [Ichikawa] We will try to get it passed at the current session of the Diet. We must not ignore the intentions of the review council, but we should hasten to get ready so that the lower house can be dissolved for an election under the new system. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Now that the SDPJ has left the coalition, will the concept for "another new party" envisaged by Komeito undergo a change? [Ichikawa] If it is assumed that the next general election will be held under the new election system, another new party is a necessity. There is no change in my belief that two political forces should compete for government power. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The bases for political world reorganization are becoming fragile. [Ichikawa] Under the existing tripolar structure, it will be a minority government regardless of which party assumes power. If the LDP and the SDPJ agree on a coalition, it would be tantamount to the two parties committing suicide. The key is how the public will judge and decide to act if it turns out that a ruling party cannot perform its tasks because it is a minority in power. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you have a "next move" aimed at changing the situation? [Ichikawa] I do not have any particular plan. We do not need to raise issues from our side. When a major problem does arise, people concerned about the problem will speak up. We must face problems squarely and not play tricks. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] You severely criticized remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano about the Nanjing massacre. [Ichikawa] If you consider the war not simply as a Japan-U.S. war, but as a 15-year war that started with the Manchurian conflict in 1931, the nature of aggression of the war becomes clear. There is no question that Japan invaded Asian countries to reign over them. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] That view differs from the view on history of some of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] members. [Icikawa] There may be differences. If Japan wants to live in the international community, however, the country cannot gain the understanding of the Asian countries unless it does some soul-searching and recognizes the past war as a war of aggression. I feel so strongly about that I believe it cannot be helped even if our party's relationship with Shinseito is jeopardized over differences of this historic view in the future. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What are the prospects for holding talks on the tax system reform question? [Ichikawa] We will need to come up with a conclusion on consistent policy direction. A tax system reform has become a sort of international commitment. The way for the cabinet to survive is to come up with that conclusion.
