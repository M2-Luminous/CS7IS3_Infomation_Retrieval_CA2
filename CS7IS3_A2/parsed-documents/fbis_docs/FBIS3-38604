The minister for [agriculture and] fisheries said only that the meeting will probably take place in the late morning. Balladur went on to the Regional Council. [passage omitted] At the beginning of his remarks, the prime minister of course started by mentioning the fishing dispute: [Begin Balladur recording] Faced with this crisis, we are ready to use all means possible to come to the help of those who are threatened or let down by the evolution of the world and the evolution of society. We have already applied this principle in the farming sector. We are applying this same principle to industrial sectors which are in difficulty. I am resolved to apply the same principle also to the fishing sector, which, in its turn is also experiencing difficulties caused by many different factors. But, whatever the cause, the government intends to resolve problems which occur, and we will do for the fishing industry what we did for the farming industry. In other words, we will make sure that those involved in Brittany or elsewhere will have a better future to look forward to. [end recording]
