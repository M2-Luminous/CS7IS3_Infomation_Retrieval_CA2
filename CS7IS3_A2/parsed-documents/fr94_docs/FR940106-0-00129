FR940106-0-00129 FR940106-0-00022 In considering where in the regulations the clarification of the Department's position should be made, the Department took into account the fact that there are other time limits expressed in the regulations, such as in §§617.10(b), 617.31(c), 617.41(c), and 617.43(b). Since all such time limits may be vulnerable to the same deviations that occurred with respect to the 210-day time limit, it was decided that a general rule was needed that is applicable to all of part 617. The placement of this general rule thus fell logically in paragraph (d) of §617.50. Accordingly, paragraph (d) of §617.50 is amended to add the general rule that no provision of State law or regulations as to good cause for waiver of any time limit or for late filing of any claim shall apply in the case of any time limitation stated in part 617, unless such State law or regulation is made applicable by a specific provision of part 617. This change eliminates any uncertainty about the Department's position, and places a clear obligation on the States to adhere to the time limitations in all of part 617. P. Revision of §617.55 Section 243 of the Act, on Fraud and Recovery of Overpayments, is interpreted as being drawn in broad terms so as to impose liability for repayment of all improper payments under the Act, and to impose penalties for all false statements or representations resulting in improper payments. Subsection (a) imposes repayment liability upon any ``person'' receiving an improper payment, whereas subsections (b) and (c) use the term ``individual'' in the fraud and recovery provisions. In §617.55, in contrast, the term ``individual'' is used throughout the liability, fraud, and waiver provisions of the regulations. Recent experience in the administration of the TAA program has highlighted the difference between ``person'' and ``individual'' as such terms are commonly understood in other areas of law. The term ``person'' is more comprehensive, and may include an employer or other entity or organization as well as an individual, whereas the term ``individual'' as used throughout part 617 typically means the individual workers who are the beneficiaries of the program. The question that arose was whether §617.55(a) was sufficiently broad in wording to impose repayment liability upon an employer who had received improper payments for the on-the-job training. In examining this issue it became apparent that the same issue existed with respect to payments for training of individuals that are made directly to training providers. Although the payments in both cases may be said to be made on behalf of the individual workers, it is evident that, in many cases (particularly in the case of on-the-job training), liability for repayment as well as responsibility for fraud is more properly assignable primarily to the employer and possibly the training provider. To clarify the regulations, and to reflect the broad interpretation given to section 243 of the Act, §617.55 is revised throughout to make it specifically applicable to any person or individual, and paragraph (i) is added to define person as any employer or other entity or organization as well as the officers and officials thereof who may bear individual responsibility. Q. Revision of §617.60 A new §617.60, on Administrative requirements, was included in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988, for comment. Although no comments were received, the substance of several of the provisions are affected by other administrative regulations. Since further work is required to bring the TAA administrative requirements into full conformity with those other regulations, the decision was made to reserve §617.60 for use when the revised TAA administrative requirements are completed and published. R. Revision of §617.64 In the 1986 Amendments to the Trade Act, section 285 was amended by, among other things, adding a subsection (b), to provide that ``no assistance, allowance, or other payments may be provided under chapter 2 *␣*␣* after September 30, 1991.'' This new subsection (b) superseded the current provisions in §617.64, which were consistent with the amendments made by section 2512 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. Section 1426(a) of the OTCA extended the termination of the program to September 30, 1993. While the 1986 and 1988 amendments to the TAA program changed the termination dates to September 30, 1991 and 1993, respectively, appropriate changes were not made to §617.64 concerning the payment of TAA program benefits after the termination date in the Act. Therefore, §617.64 is amended to bring it into accord with the amended language in section 285 of the Act. A strict construction of the law, prohibiting the actual payment of TAA program benefits to individuals after the termination date in the Act, would have a profound effect on those persons who completed approved TAA program services, but, because of State processing requirements, payment for such services cannot be made by the State agency until after the termination date in the Act. This strict construction would unnecessarily make the orderly termination of the program impossible. It would deny payment of benefits to individuals for the period prior to the termination date of the program simply because it was administratively infeasible to make the payment before the termination date. Therefore, in order to avoid these untoward results stemming from a strict construction, a more liberal construction of section 285(b) is necessary to effectuate the Congressional intent. A ``payment,'' within the meaning of section 285(b), will be deemed to have been made before the termination date of the program, if a final determination on the amount payable to, or on behalf of, the individual for TAA program services was made on or before the termination date of the program, for which payment was due.
