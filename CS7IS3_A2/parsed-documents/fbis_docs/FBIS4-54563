This morning he met with his departmental counterpart, Pavel Kanis. Our correspondent Miroslav Minar reports: [Minar] The Czech defense minister's visit is taking place in connection with the first unofficial working meeting between Minister Baudys and former Slovak Defense Minister [Imrich] Andrejcak at Vranov nad Dyji. The special military plane from Prague landed at Milan Rastislav Stefanik airport at 0930, and, shortly after that, the Czech guest was welcomed on Slovak territory by Defense Minister Pavel Kanis. The talks, which took place after the welcoming ceremony, were attended by experts from both sides and contained, above all, a proposal of the agreement between the defense ministries of the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic on mutual cooperation. The two sides will exchange information to the extent of the powers entrusted to them and stipulated by Slovak and Czech legal regulations and will cooperate on the basis of reciprocity and mutual advantage. The first glance at the text of the agreement shows that the extent of cooperation is broad and that the individual spheres concern all parts of the military. For example, in the coming period, the parties to the agreement should cooperate in building their armies and mobilization systems in conditions of peace, technical development, military training and science, personnel work, social and health security, culture, and sport. [passage omitted] During the joint events, the official languages of the two states that are parties to the agreement will be used. Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and Slovak Defense Minister Pavel Kanis signed the text of the agreement on mutual cooperation shortly before 1200. A news conference is under way at this time.
