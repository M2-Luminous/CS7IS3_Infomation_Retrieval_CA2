Earlier this week the country learned that the U.S. Government would possibly cut its economic aid to El Salvador by 60 percent for the present year--from $230 million down to $94 million. President Alfredo Cristiani has said in this regard that the reduction will not affect adversely the country's development, because the economy has improved. [Begin Cristiani recording] The country has shown an economic improvement, meaning it is capable of sustaining a decrease in aid so that we can stand on our own. I believe it is the final objective, because we cannot live off of foreign donations. [end recording] We learned on Thursday that UN Human Rights expert (Pedro Nicken) had certain difficulties in entering the country, but President Cristiani has denied his entry had been disallowed. Cristiani has said the UN official may draft his report when he wishes. [Begin Cristiani recording] He may come here whenever he wants. He can visit the country and see for himself. I believe he will take a look at Onusal's [UN Observers for El Salvador] reports before drafting his own report. [end recording] President Cristiani inaugurated on Thursday a soft-drink processing plant, which will operate in the area of Soyapango, at a cost of 75 million colons. Its high technology will lead to better methods of quality control.
