And certain news items even found their way into Zhongnanhai, causing the hearts of supreme CPC leaders to beat faster. The latest astounding news was that Yang Shangkun was attacked in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Yang flew to Shenzhen from Beijing 8 January. According to the joint arrangements by the CPC Central Committee General Office, the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and the Yang Shangkun Office, Yang was to spend one week in Shenzhen. Beginning 10 January, he was scheduled to visit two fairly large foreign-funded joint-venture enterprises; meet with scientific and technological personnel and financial experts in Shenzhen as well as elderly Shenzhen citizens; visit the animal park and the Splendid China miniature scenic spots; attend an organization meeting of Shenzhen's veteran cadres; meet with representatives from Shenzhen's armed police and public security and judicial departments; attend a forum of representatives of the teaching staff of Shenzhen's colleges and high schools; and go sightseeing in the city. However, all these arrangements were changed very quickly. Yang was scheduled to stay at the Nanhai Hotel for one day and the Shenzhen Bay Hotel for another but the plan was scrapped later. The reason was that Yang was exposed to danger. At midday on 10 January, a squad of special police was transferred from Guangzhou to reinforce Yang's security team. Homemade Bombs Were Delivered to Yang and the Shenzhen City CPC Committee --On the morning of 9 January, a stolen car containing five kg of explosives, petroleum, and detonators, was found 20 meters from the Shenzhen Guest House. In the afternoon of the same day, a black leather bag was discovered in the joint Shenzhen City CPC Committee and Government reception room. In the bag were two homemade bombs, on which was written: "One for Yang Shangkun and the other for the city party committee" and signed "Communists." --On the evening of 9 January, the city party committee and the city's public security bureau received an anonymous telephone call threatening to destroy Yang's special car and saying a time bomb had been planted in a certain place. --At midday on 10 January, "reactionary" posters and leaflets were found in Shenzhen and Shekou which read: "Do not be misled by the false appearances covering up the corrupt Shenzhen City CPC Committee!"; "What is the difference between the Kuomintang in 1949 and the Communist Party in the 1990's?"; "If Yang Shangkun rids the people of a scourge, he is welcome; if he shelters officials, he must quit!"; "Shenzhen is not the people's paradise but a place where high officials and noble lords gain fame and fortune." It has been learned that leaflets were elegantly printed and their contents were endorsed by Shenzhen residents. The local government has ordered the public security bureau to crack the case and regard it as a serious one. They want to prevent the news about the case from spreading. A Demobilized Soldier Threw a Bottle of Liquid Fuel at Yang's Car On the morning of 9 January, Yang spent an hour taking a walk in the Four Seas Park. As he was getting in his car to leave an emergency occurred took place within two meters of his car and a person in his thirties was arrested by the special police. According to a report, the Molotov cocktail thrower, called Xu, was a local demobilized soldier-turned security chief of a certain luxury hotel. He darted through the cordon and threw the Molotov cocktail at Yang's limousine. When the bottle hit the ground the liquid splashed toward the car but the flames were immediately put out by the special police using the fire extinguishers in the car. In the evening of the same day, shots were heard outside the Silver Lake Hotel where Yang was staying. The local public security bureau disclosed that some people fired shots into the air over the Yinhu Hotel and over the Shekou China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Guest House for senior cadres, where Yang was supposed to stay. It is reported that the Shenzhen City CPC Committee Standing Committee and leading cadres of the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau were kept very busy by the incidents. When the CPC hierarchy learned about the incidents, they were concerned for Yang's safety. As a result, Yang's itinerary was amended and an additional two special police vehicles were ordered to escort him as of 10 January. Eight Units Asked for an Interview With Yang To Present Petitions On 11 January, representatives from eight local government departments went to the city party committee secretary's office to ask permission to see Yang and submit petitions. The government departments reportedly included the local procuratorate, court, and discipline inspection commissions. Some government departments in other areas across the province also sent representatives to Shenzhen to ask for an interview with Yang and present petitions when they learned that Yang was there. According to a source, the staffers of the city party committee adopted a rude attitude towards the representatives and the two parties had a row. The city committee standing committee members on duty told the representatives to write directly to the central authorities or to Yang to make complaints. It is reported that most complaints concerned corruption in the party and government departments including manmade resistance and pressure encountered by judicial departments in investigating and handling serious economic cases as well as collusion between local and central departments in practicing graft and taking bribes. The Shenzhen Discipline Inspection Commission some days ago told the provincial party committee that 80 percent of criminal cases defied investigation and that 70 percent of discipline inspection commission members had asked to be transferred to other posts. When commenting on the incidents in Shenzhen and Shekou, a Beijing public security cadre conjectured in private that the incidents were organized by some people who were angry with corruption and bureaucracy in the party and government departments. He added: "Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that the incidents were caused by personal grudges. Yang was possibly only an `innocent victim.' The incidents were more likely designed to serve as a warning to the hierarchy: You must not always praise the special economic zone; instead, you must try to find out the situation with the party, the political situation, and public opinion." The cadre said: Nobody should use violence, no matter what kind of grudge they may have. "On the other hand, the central authorities should make a self-examination and draw a lesson from the incidents--they should allow the people the freedom to vent their spleen instead of strengthening the dictatorship."
