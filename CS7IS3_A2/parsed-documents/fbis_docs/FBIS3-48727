The official said the worrisome air is being fed by the recent wholesale report by the American press of a U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in Korea, the dispatch of a U.S. intelligence support team to Korea and the introduction of Apache helicopters by the U.S. forces in Korea. "The government has expressed to the United States the wish that U.S. military authorities will restrain themselves from leaking such information," he said. The official said the deployment of Patriot missiles was first requested by the commander of the U.S. forces in Korea to President Bill Clinton toward the end of last year as part of steps to beef up his command's conventional strength. "Presently it is in the stage of being affirmatively reviewed and it would take several months before they are actually operationally deployed," the official said. He added that the introduction of Patriots missile will have no effect on the North Korean nuclear issues. As for Apache helicopters, the official said the issue is by no means anything new. "Their introduction was decided on in the late 1980s," he said. Regarding the intelligence support team, the official said it is true that the U.S.'s DIA has sent a state intelligence support team of five to six men to Seoul. But, he said, their tour is a routine mission designed to see if intelligence-gathering programs are going on alright. "Their stay here does not mean that the U.S. intelligence team here has been reinforced," said the official. "They will leave Korea before long."
