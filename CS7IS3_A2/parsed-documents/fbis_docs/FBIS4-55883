The germ of enterprise has been preserved. With the replacement of the political system and the change of climate and attitude in Serbia, private initiative has gained momentum. This government and its prime minister realized, however, the significance and potential of private enterprise in Serbia, and formed the Ministry of Private Enterprise. The ministry's goal and task is, in a completely new ministry with new people and different views and ideas, to promote private business and to carry out the necessary institutional changes for that purpose. Having that kind of potential and using it poorly is inappropriate for a serious state, and we claim to be a serious state and to attribute significance to private enterprise, in view of the trend toward the transformation of social property into private property. The future of Serbia is thus in private enterprise. I do not believe that we will use that term "private" and "social" any longer, because the "most social" person is the one who engages in socially useful work either by producing or by providing necessary services to citizens. Encouraging Production There are now about 186,000 private enterprises and 210,000 independent craft, commercial, and other shops functioning in the Republic of Serbia. Unfortunately for us, fewer than 10 percent of them are involved in production: 16,000 enterprises in industry and mining, 3,800 in construction, 3,000 in transportation, and 95,600 in commerce. There is a disproportionate ratio between enterprises engaged in production and enterprises engaged in commerce, because commerce is in effect the superstructure of the production base. There are 2,700 private enterprises operating in the hotel industry, 4,000 in crafts and services, and 14,000 in the area of financial and other services. The budget of the Republic of Serbia has therefore provided for very serious funds to encourage production and development, which will be invested through commercial banks in those programs and given to those people who will put them to use quickly and repay them. Changes in the Tax System This government inherited a tax system that was never based on valid parameters, and so in 1993, during the period of hyperinflation, it completely collapsed. The previous government, rushing to solve the budget problem, made very, very big mistakes in determining the amounts of (?FIRMARINE) and tax obligations for entrepreneurs without paying attention to their economic strength, or performing the necessary selection, since not everyone has the same strength, size, and ability to pay. That is even against the constitution. Admittedly, we are applying the laws that are in force, but we want to replace them with better ones. Very soon we will send the Serbian Assembly a bill that would regulate tax obligations differently and selectively. Specifically, we will eliminate the tax on financial transactions, but a sales tax that is enormously high will remain--27 percent, while for a few goods the tax rate has been reduced from 44 to 27 percent, but for most it has been increased by 7 percent. That is the reason for the boom of the black market in which those who do not pay customs duties, sales tax, contributions to employees, etc., work. The state gets nothing out of that. My team, however, will prove mathematically that low tax rates will contribute higher budget revenue, facilitate business, and increase employees' wages--and it will be good for everyone. We will do everything analytically with the goal of ending this year with the kind of legal and derivative acts that will guarantee certainty to everyone to intends to engage in business next year. In other words, people will no longer live from decree to decree, and the laws will be logical--but Serbia's economic regulations consist of 135 legal acts. I would like to see a lawyer who could cope with that, but we want to create an atmosphere here for the normal, average citizen of Serbia. It will be a long-term job, but private businessmen know how difficult, arduous, and slow it is to make progress. Don't suspect that your minister will have weak nerves or short breath. But remember--that will give us the right to establish a strong control function for the state. Distribution of the "Poorly Distributed" Taxes are not the only problem, however. In fact, a bigger problem is the enormous disparity between the number of private enterprises and the number of workers employed in them. The official data do not give a correct picture. It is true that there are more than 300,000 people in Serbia who are working "illegally" in the private sector. That is why our goal is not only to employ these people legally, but also to correct the structure of employees and substantially increase their number. We will try to create the kind of environment in which economic logic will lead the unemployed to the private sector to seek a livelihood there themselves. We will carry out this transition painlessly, by adopting appropriate regulations, whose implementation will not cause upheavals. I have always said that there is not a surplus of employees in this country, but rather only poorly distributed ones. In addition to the absolutely abnormal tax system, the enormous contributions that are withheld from employees' wages also encourage "illegal" work. More than 95 percent of both socialized and private enterprises and shops do not show salaries realistically through the payroll. Because of the high contributions, wages are drastically reduced. Everyone loses. Our goal is to reduce contributions so much that no one will have a reason to employ workers "illegally," and we will not be very tolerant, because there will no longer be a reason for anyone to complain that we have put too much of a burden on him. Returning Jurisdiction to the Municipalities I know quite well how much the municipalities have been crippled by the redistribution of jurisdiction at the republic level. One should expect changes along these lines soon, because it is unnatural that a municipality does not have insight into and influence over the development of the economy in its surroundings and on its territory. In fact, it is natural for a municipality to be very interested and to be very concerned and involved with strengthening the local economy for the purpose of raising the standard of living and wages, and developing the infrastructure, education, and everything else that constitutes the social superstructure for a better and higher-quality life. Furthermore, I have taken the initiative for us to bring educated young people from all regions, and then from every municipality, to be trained in the Serbian Government, and afterwards sent back to rural areas to apply what has been learned and agreed upon. Construction of Small Shops The construction of small shops is our "festering wound." City planning conditions and infrastructure are very bad, and the corresponding laws and derivative acts resemble an impassable forest that has not been cleared since 1967-1971, in which not even a highly educated lawyer can find his way, much less an average businessman who has to conduct his business. We will very soon formulate a draft law that will solve this problem in every municipality in Serbia, so that every municipality would build a small industrial zone, and create opportunities for the rapid construction of production facilities. My estimates indicate that in every municipality at least 10 people would immediately start construction if given the chance, which yields the figure of 2,000 small factories for the 200 municipalities in Serbia. I don't have to explain how much that means for the construction materials industry, brick, iron, insulation material, construction workers.... We are also convinced that every owner of his own small shop will seek to develop business and become a serious partner for the large enterprises in the socialized sector. The new Law on the Transformation of Social Capital, which implies the complete independence of socially owned economic entities to choose the form of ownership transformation, is also contributing to a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, it is a characteristic of our mentality that honest people are accused of dishonest intentions, the consequence of which will be that entrepreneurs who decide to build facilities with a couple of hundred "square meters" will continue to make progress faster than those who wait for the implementation of this law. I know quite well that this is an enslavement of capital, but years will pass before we solve the problem through the laws and decrees that we intend to adopt soon in order to stimulate this process. Admittedly, there are already government decrees on the priority use of unemployed production capacities. It is fortunate that the large socialized enterprises, on their own initiative, are visiting the smaller private firms and seeking a suitable form of cooperation. Nevertheless, I think that this form of communication will be accelerated soon. Bringing the Socialized and Private Sectors Closer Together Along those lines, I spoke recently with the director of the Belgrade Fair about the idea of having commercial banks organize successful private entrepreneurs with whom they are already cooperating on the fairgrounds, as part of the traditional Entrepreneurs' Fair. As the sponsor of this fair, the government has already adopted a decision on a symbolic price for renting space in the hall, which the Fair's administration has accepted. The purpose is for people from public enterprises to see in one place everything that can and must be bought in Serbia from producers in the private sector, who, during the blockade, have even succeeded in producing incredible things. The task of us in the government is to "link" the private and socialized sectors, to bring them closer together and refer them to each other. It has also been agreed with Belgrade TV that every day, in prime time, it will promote this campaign, so that people throughout Serbia will become acquainted with the enormous capabilities of our private sector, including that of Cacak. Imitation of Privatization Public enterprises are one more "festering wound" for the Republic of Serbia. Their amorphous nature represents a big problem for the Serbian economy, but their ownership transformation, which has been carried out to date through the distribution of worthless internal papers, constitutes nothing more than an imitation of real privatization. That is why it will be subject to audit, and a new law on ownership transformation, which will sanction those who have exploited this process in the most primitive way to steal social property. Those who have done this job correctly do not have any reason to fear an audit. Furthermore, the budget provides for expenditures to "extract" welfare policy from socialized firms, which should make it easier for them to begin a different policy toward surplus employees. [Box, p 8] I am abolishing the term "small business," because this state lives on private entrepreneurs. It no longer lives on the Smederevo Steelworks, or EI [Electronics Plant] Nis, but rather on us, private businessmen. If 68 percent of employees in the European Union work in companies with at most 10 workers, why should we be ashamed of small numbers? It seems that we like everything that is big, even if it is inefficient. With respect to efficiency, in just the Steelworks, for example, 90 percent of its capacity is idle, because of a shortage of spare parts. I maintain that our private businessmen throughout Serbia can successfully produce 95 percent of the missing amounts. Our public enterprises, however, seem to have people who will not give 100,000 German marks, for instance, to our people, but prefer to give an amount several times higher to import the same product from abroad, or to watch trains standing motionless. [Box, p 8] Monetary Political Institutions I do not consider the banks in which budgetary funds on which interest is not paid are deposited to be real banks. I am saying publicly that they are monetary political institutions. [Box, p 8] At Vranje's Side I am extremely delighted by the fact that in the Cacak municipality, with 70,000 residents, as many as 43,000 people are employed. That is an extremely high employment rate, which only Vranje also has in Serbia.
