The facility had been producing fuel for the initial loading of the Monju prototype FBR power plant (electrical output, 28 kW; located in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture), but a breakdown in the continuous sintering furnace on 7 June caused a temporary suspension of the fuel production. Monju was to achieve criticality in October, but that date was pushed up about six months because of the suspension of fuel production. For that reason the PNC invested in a batch furnace to augment the continuous sintering furnace and has been producing fuel with the two furnaces in parallel since October. With the regular operation of the continuous sintering furnace now started, the FBR fuel production line is completely restored.
