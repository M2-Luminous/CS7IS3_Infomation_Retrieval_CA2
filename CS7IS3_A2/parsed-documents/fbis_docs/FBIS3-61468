Chusovitin; UDC 621.315.592] [Abstract]The surface properties and pulse luminescence spectra of relatively thick a-Si : H films (approximately 1 micrometer) are researched. It is shown that the porous structure on the surface of the films leads to the appearance of a wide band of shortwave luminescence and a drop in shortwave photoconductivity. It is shown that there is no strip of luminescence in homogenous films (without columns) which have ultraviolent photoconductivity. 3 graphs and 5 references.
