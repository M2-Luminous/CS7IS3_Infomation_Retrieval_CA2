VECHIRNIY KYYIV has often criticized the provincialism, low artistic and professional level of television programs, undemocratic atmosphere, and the introduction of internal political censorship at the state television and radio company. Naturally, in doing so, it was not our intention to insult the directors of the company and, least of all, our fellow journalists, who have very little influence over what is happening under the existing system. The purpose of our criticism -- and various people have expressed themselves on this subject -- was to help eliminate the shortcomings listed above. Like the majority of television viewers and radio listeners, we are sincerely concerned about national television and radio broadcasting, and it pains us to see its backwoods [sharovarnu --from "sharovary" -- the baggy pantaloons originally worn by the Cossacks, now symbolizing the folkloric traditions promoted by Soviet authorities in place of normal cultural development] ineptness. To be sure, standing out against the general backdrop of drabness, we find some successful programs and brilliant journalists, but these are not able to reveal their full potential and evolve into a system that would allow us to give a sigh of relief that here, at last, we are witnessing the emergence of our own national television. Naively, one might have expected that the serious criticism (which appeared in many newspapers, not just the VECHIRKA) would produce serious changes in the television and radio company itself. But this did not happen; a few cosmetic changes and a reshuffling among the top management did not result in any improvements. There are two reasons for this: first, the state television and radio company is fully financed by the state and has no serious competition, and, second, the small group of top managers, headed by Mr. Okhmakevych and Mr. Pasak, have established a strong defensive position on this state-protected high ground out of range of cannon fire. As for any competitors that emerge on the inside, the company has learned to make short work of them very quickly. Thus this particular piece has been provoked by an article by Vitaliy Ablitsov, director of the Kultura Creative Association of Ukrainian Television [UT], that appeared in the newspaper HOLOS UKRAYINY on 5 February 1994 under the title: "UT: A Symbol of Provincialism or the Rebirth of Hope?" Understandably, Mr. Ablitsov assumes the role of advocate of the management, but even he cannot help but admit that "Ukrainian television as an integral system of the electronic medium of communication simply does not exist. What we have today is merely an aggregate of television broadcasts and programs gasping for breath in the vise of foreign-language television networks. The authors of these programs, because of our technical backwardness, and frequently due to their own creative ineptness, are incapable of handling the swelling flood of information." The author then proceeds to portray the criticism of the UT management that had appeared in the newspapers NEZAVISIMOST, VECHIRNIY KYYIV, and LIBERALNA HAZETA as a "noisy campaign on the theme `Help! They are introducing censorship in television and radio'." Yet he produces not a single argument to refute the criticism published in the press. Instead, we find accusations levelled in the usual Pasak style that the journalists from the newspapers named above are, at best, creatively inept. Let these charges remain on Mr. Ablitsov's conscience, while I cite an example of how the internal climate at the television and radio company is viewed by the company's own journalists. "Let me name the employees of the state television and radio company who at different times were forced to leave their jobs either because they were hounded from their positions or because they became totally disillusioned about the ability of Mykola Okhmakevych's company to provide viewers with truthful and honest information: Vasyl Yurychko -- vice-president of the company (his ouster was masterminded by Viktor Pasak, who has taken over his post); Mykola Orlovskyy -- former editor in chief of UT's Main Information Department (he was ousted from his job on Okhmakevych's orders by Yarema Frydrak, the former vice-president of the company, who was later himself ousted by Okhmakevych); Mykola Knyazhytskyy -- pushed out because of his courageous political commentaries; Mykola Kanishevskyy -- could no longer tolerate the atmosphere of lies that reigns at the television company; Natalka Hryhorchuk -- correspondent of the Main Information Department (the case against her was fabricated by Ivan Kukhar, who, following a certain fiasco, was transferred from his post as editor in chief of UT's Main Information Department to his old position of director of the correspondents' network). "Stepan Demyanchuk, the general director of UT programming, was harrassed for a prolonged period of time under the personal direction of Okhmakevych, and only his death "saved" him from being dismissed in disgrace. "At Ukrainian Radio, persecution shortened the lives of Mynko, Kulakivskyy, Bil. The person responsible for this was Volodymyr Reznikov, who now heads the Main Directorate of Programs at UT. "This list is incomplete -- there is not enough time. Let me just say that Kuzmenko is next on the hit list..." I have not named the author for understandable reasons. Nor have I provided the names of other journalists at the television and radio company who are being persecuted by the management -- they are still employed by the company. But let me describe what happened to the Hart Youth Program and its director, Viktor Pavlyuk. Because the program criticized the governing structures, it was not permitted to air and Viktor Pavlyuk was threatened with dismissal. The incident became widely known. Pavlyuk filed a suit in court, and Okhmakevych and Co. are doing their best to hush up the conflict. Having brought up the Hart Studio, we should mention that the stifling conservative atmosphere at the television and radio company recently forced such talented journalists as Vasyl Yatsura, Volodymyr Nechyporuk, and Serhiy Sotnychenko to leave the company. They are now working for UNIAN. And what about the many highly qualified television camera operators and video engineers who found themselves jobs outside UT--at least half of the entire staff has done so in recent years. Quite a few of them have gone to Moscow. Given these facts, is it any wonder that the level of our television programming is as low as it is? Do the people in the government structures to whom the State Television and Radio Company is answerable know all this? Of course, they do: they received letters from the people who were persecuted at this company. Then why do they not apply the necessary measures? We can only assume that they think that it is better to have this kind of management as long as it is loyal, that it is better to have an inept television and radio as long as it is biddable. The question of Mr. Okhmakevych's directorship of the company has been raised several times in the Supreme Council, but each time he has managed to get out of the water without getting wet. It means a great deal to have powerful patrons. The handling of the election campaign -- perhaps the most important event in the life of Ukraine today -- is a separate topic that deserves mention. In this extremely important sphere, national television and radio could do a great deal to provide objective coverage of the process of putting forward candidates, the registration of candidates for the office of deputy, the candidates' ideas and programs. They could help citizens to find their way around the myriad of names that have emerged on the electoral horizon. They could -- if they wanted to. Not only are our television and radio, which have been leased out to Messrs. Kulyk and Pasak, not portraying the campaign objectively, but they are failing to comply with the letter and spirit of the Election Law. For example, candidates have absolutely no access to UT-1 [Ukrainian Television's Channel 1]. Mr. Kulyk is of the opinion that it is enough for political parties to present their platforms. There is nothing wrong in that -- the people ought to know what the parties stand for. But, first, the Election Law gives the right of access to television and radio not only to parties but also to candidates, associations of citizens, labor collectives who put forward candidates, and other representatives, and, second, what about the independent candidates who do not belong to any party? Mr. Kulyk could not care less. Thus, UT-1 is virtually closed to candidates. UT's attitude is: let them appear on regional programs. Meanwhile, UT-1 is itself covertly taking part in the preelection struggle. For instance, our readers have noted that for some reason attention has recently been focused on the Popilnya Rayon of Zhytomyr Oblast. If it isn't the presidential representative, then it's the collective farm chairman on our television screens. Popilnya has been receiving more television coverage in the last few weeks than during the entire past year. The reason for all this attention is very simple: that is where Mr. Okhmakevych himself is running for the office of deputy. He has the right to do so under the Election Law, but what has state television to do with this? Thus, contrary to the Election Law and common sense, the management of the television and radio company has banished candidates for the office of deputy from UT-1 and forced them to go to regional television programs. Moreover, on instructions from the management of the company, the Kiev program (on UT-2) is now airing candidates' appearances from 1600 to 1800. Can conscientous citizens who work in production and in institutions benefit from television's role as an intermediary? It seems that the television management has done everything in its power to torpedo the election in the informational sphere. Whether it has done so on its own initiative or at the behest of the government -- I do not pretend to know. But facts are facts. The last thing I want the management of the television and radio company to think is that this article is in response to the unceremonious interference in the form of a preelection propaganda campaign waged against me by state radio on their initiative. One would be hard put to find an incident of this sort in a democratic country. No other state permits this kind of pressure on voters. But this has no bearing on the subject under discussion -- a subject that has long caused great concern to all who care about the fate of national television and radio. As to the direct participation of state television and radio in the preelection propaganda campaign against me, why do so covertly, anonymously, making use of the Kiev radio program, whose journalists have no connection to this matter whatsoever? I would like to suggest a simple but honest move to the esteemed directors of the company: let us go public and hold a discussion on live radio or television. I am willing to meet with either Mr. Okhmakevych, or Mr. Pasak, or Mr. Kulyk, or all three. A frank and open discussion which would allow both sides to have their say and would be a democratic [word illegible], inasmuch as people would have an opportunity to judge for themselves the truth and [word illegible] of the arguments put forward by both sides and draw their own conclusions. I am at your service, gentlemen, [Signed] Vitaliy Karpen
