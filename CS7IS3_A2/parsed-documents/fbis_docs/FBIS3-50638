Reporters who managed to cross roadblocks erected about 18 km from Ocosingo have said that there are still clashes in that town. The Army surrounded it while EZLN members were barricaded in several houses. They added that several dead are lying in the streets and injured people are seeking refuge. The rebels retreated, taking the injured with them, between a place known as Rancho Nuevo, about 15 km east of San Cristobal, and the town of Altamirano, near Ocosingo. Residents of Oxchuc and Altamirano are nervous and afraid that the EZLN will return, because there is no Army presence there. Several residents have assured the media that combatants from El Salvador and Guatemala are among the rebel ranks. "We have noticed the way they talk and their strong bodies, and there are no people like that here," a peasant said. In Oxchuc, 60 km from San Cristobal, angry residents have managed to capture six rebels, beat them up, tie up their feet and hands, and take them to the town's main kiosk to turn them over to the Mexican Army. The captured, injured by the crowd's beatings, told the media that they are EZLN members and came to Oxchuc to pick up some companeros. Jose Perez Mendez, a 24-year-old peasant whose face was bloodstained, said that he has been a member of the subversive movement for the past three years, because "the government has paid us no attention" and denied that combatants from other countries are among his companeros. The neighbors shouted in the Tzeltal language that they did not want the guerrillas, according to Juan Santis, who said they were angry because the rebels stole their vehicles, burned and destroyed municipal offices, and kidnapped the assistant town councillor, a policeman, and two other civilians, whom they used as their drivers. According to a detainee, the 200 residents who had scrambled into the kiosk were saying in Tzeltal that they wanted the guerrillas killed. Altamirano, which the EZLN has called "the first liberated town," the municipal palace of which was partially destroyed, was abandoned between Monday night and Tuesday morning after the guerrillas fled into the nearby mountains. On Monday night "some 10 individuals arrived to take away six injured relatives, one of them in serious condition, in a freight truck," bound for an unknown site, according to an official at a hospital run by nuns from the Order of the Daughters of Charity. The injured rebels, all with bullet wounds, need treatment by doctors and medicines, but they did not take anything from the hospital, the official said. Neighbors gathered around the journalists in the town square to ask them to tell the authorities that they have no means of communications and that the Mexican Army should be deployed there to protect the lives of the civilian population. On the road leading from Altamirano to San Cristobal, dozens of Tzeltal Indian peasants could be seen leaving their villages, but rebels were not seen as in previous days. The Army, whose presence is demanded by the residents, was not to be seen either.
