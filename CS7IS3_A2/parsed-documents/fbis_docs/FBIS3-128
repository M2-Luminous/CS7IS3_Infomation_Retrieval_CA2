Natal MB0103120494 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1142 GMT 1 Mar 94 MB0103120494 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Cape Town March 1 SAPA -- Between 500 and 1,000 people were being trained and armed in Northern Natal every fortnight, ANC [African National Congress] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa, told the Transitional Executive Committee on Tuesday. He said people in the Umfolozi area were being armed by white conservative farmers who were assisting in training them. The only objective could be to serve the stated goal by certain parties that there would be no election allowed in the territory. "The activities clearly show something is afoot in preparing a number of people who are fully armed, probably to launch an attack on people going to vote." Mr Ramaphosa quoted from a letter received from a local chief in December. "It demonstrates the problems we will face in Natal," he said. Guns were being deployed throughout the territory.
