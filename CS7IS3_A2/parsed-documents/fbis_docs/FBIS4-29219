"During the just-ended trade session, both parties agreed to take time toward July 31 this year in studying the issue," Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, told a press conference. Japan and the United States must decide whether or not to end the 1991 chip accord by the end of July. The accord calls for Japan to maintain a "gradual and steady" increase in the foreign share of the Japanese microchip market above 20 percent. The two-day microchip trade talks followed an announcement that foreign-made semiconductors continued to seize more than 20 percent of the Japanese market in the January-March period.
