On 25 January, Chen Xitong and his party went to Mengtougou District and met with the newly elected district party committee standing committee members. They also went to Sanggu Village of Junxiang Township, an old revolutionary area, to understand the situation and called on the veteran party members who had joined the early stage of revolution and some households with difficulties. These two districts have shared the common characteristics as follows: Emancipate the mind; proceed from reality; base on the local natural resources; develop, on a large scale, economic forests and building materials; and quicken the pace of seeking wealth and stepping toward the target of becoming fairly well-off. Song Xiyou, newly elected secretary of the Mengtougou District Party Committee, said: The newly elected members of the leading body are at an average age of 43.5 years. The youngest standing committee member is only 29 years old. Thus, the leading body is basically "installed in the shape of ladder." Except that only one person is graduated from the secondary specialized school, the rest have an educational level of university or higher. It can be said that the new leading body is full of vitality, is able to realize the target of becoming fairly well-off, and enjoys the support of the broad masses of party members and veteran cadres. We maintain that this is a strategic measure for strengthening the building of leading bodies. Song Xiyou also reported on the district's strategic idea for becoming fairly well-off in 1997 and the plan for relying on the natural resources of the mountain areas to build Shilong small industrial zone and five major bases engaged in the production of building materials, coal, and fruit products and the development of tourist trade. He said: Practice showed that it is accurate to persist in the new ideas of "relying on the mountain areas to making a living, going out of the mountain areas to build mountain areas, entering markets to seek wealth, and make the mountain areas wealthy by opening to the outside world and development; and it is right to persist in the work methods of conducting investigations and study on a large scale and proceeding from reality. Mengtougou, a district with mountains, changes itself from "having no ways to make development" into "having methods to make development" because it has persisted in the accurate development ideas and work methods. Chen Xitong congratulated Mengtougou District on the successful convocation of the party congress, praised that representatives of party members and veteran cadres have strategic foresight to support the election of younger leading body members, and fully affirmed the district's strategic ideas of conducting investigations and study, proceeding from reality, and becoming fairly well-off ahead of schedule. He stressed: The new leading body's tasks are to work under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee, to work in line with the work guiding principles of the municipal party committee and the municipal government and in reliance on the district's party members and people, to proceed from the reality of the mountain areas, and to make the work be submitted to and serve the target of quickening the pace of becoming wealthy and the target of becoming fairly well-off. On the basis of the local natural resources, Fangshan District with rich natural resources has vigorously developed the fruit tree planting industry, the household-based breeding industry, and the tourist trade. So, the peasants in the district start to take on the path of seeking wealth. Last year, the total product of the district reached 7.9 billion yuan, an increase of 60 percent over 1992. This year, this district further eliminated the thinking of small-scale development; set forth, according to the local actual conditions, a plan for building a 10,000-mu kiwi production garden, a 10,000-mu apricot production garden, a 10,000-mu Chinese toon production garden, and a 10,000-mu chestnut production garden; and also started to implement the plan. So far, Xibaidai Village of Zhangfang Town has sown kiwis on 1,000 mu of land and has a good marketing prospect. Jiudu Village has also gained benefits from developing the breeding industry. Of 160 households, 130 households are engaged in the breeding of coypus. Last year, the village's revenues netted 800,000 yuan and the village's savings deposits increased by a big margin. Chen Xitong fully affirmed Fangshan District's practice of emancipating the mind, using the local advantages to develop the economy, and guiding the peasants to step toward the target of becoming fairly well-off. He especially pointed out that in the past, the mountains and rivers in Shidu scenic spot were of no use; but now, the people there have emancipated the mind, opened the mountain areas to the outside world, and thought out methods. With these methods, the mountains and rivers have been changed into wealth. When calling on veteran party members and households with difficulties, Chen Xitong urged again and again that districts and villages should give more concerns and support to them and have them experience the concerns of the party and the warmth of the socialist society. He especially praised Mengtougou District and the townships and villages of the district for giving monthly living subsidies to veteran party members and giving temporary and special subsidies to those with difficulties. He also told the cadres that the old revolutionary areas have many old party members, fighters, and comrades. They made sacrifice and contributions to the revolution. We must never forget them. So, we should do more good and concrete deeds for them and have them spend a good Spring Festival. In Jiudu Village of Fangshan District, Chen Xitong especially urged that the comrades in the district should help Veteran Party Member Liu Xianfu and help cure his eye diseases. It was informed that the No. 1 hospital of the district has diagnosed his illness and worked out a treatment program for him.
