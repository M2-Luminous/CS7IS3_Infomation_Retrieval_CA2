The revaluation and lack of innovation are their main concerns. Our country's best development option is to open the market, but major adjustments will have to be made by the next government, particularly in terms of implementation. If we are to battle crime and guerrilla-backed violence, we shall not only be forced to consolidate justice, but to strengthen the government's ability to maintain law and order. Nor can the possibility of negotiating with armed groups be ruled out. This the view which the country's main business associations take of national development priorities in the years lying ahead. By June of this year, the National Council of Associations (CNG) will have finished drafting a program containing proposals to be presented to the next president-elect on how to handle the country's economic, political, and social issues. The DIARIO ECONOMICO obtained a copy of the second draft of the associations' program. In it, they express great concern over the process of revaluing the peso, a process that "may be stepped up in the future." The associations believe that it is important for the government to intervene in markets, but solely for the purpose of correcting distortions. However, with respect to technological innovation and social management, they hint that it should take more direct action than it has heretofore done. The program says that in the future, it will be of exceeding importance to use concerted action as a tool to consolidate democracy. It announces that business associations will participate in the various legally constituted councils and commissions in order to reach agreement with the government on such issues as maintaining high rates of growth and employment, lowering inflation, and achieving better planning. Better Execution "In the debate on the future role of the Colombian Government and its priorities, rather than questioning its active role in areas such as infrastructure, education, science and technology, law enforcement, the adoption of market reforms, and the need to give top priority to reaching the poorest population groups, it would be more appropriate to question how this redefinition of the method and field of government action has been expressed in practical terms," one draft says. Concerning the new system of overall social security, it states that an attempt must be made to apply it "as a key policy in order to provide stability for the model of development." It admits that while so-called social spending as a proportion of the gross domestic product has gradually begun to climb again in the 1990's, "it is still below levels reached in the mid '80's and remains far below national needs." This and other problems remain unsolved: inadequate execution of the budget and weak, uncoordinated social institutions, combined with a lack of coherent medium- and long-term programs. With respect to how the exchange rate is to be handled, the production associations say, "it has been observed that because of its constitutional mandate to oversee the purchasing power of the currency, the new monetary authority (the board of directors of the Bank of the Republic) is not in a position to impede this process affecting the behavior of the production of salable goods. It will have to take an in-depth look at future trends of the macroeconomic variables having the greatest impact on the price of the currency and propose policies preventing any spread of the so-called "Dutch disease." They agree that because of problems besetting agriculture such as climatic changes and sudden variations in foreign prices for agricultural products, subsidies must be instituted for the sector, but of a type that will not "weaken the ability to compete with other related activities, if one wants to avoid the cost of extending protection to the rest of the productive system." The draft exhibits a tendency to give priority to the conservation of natural resources over their indiscriminate exploitation aimed at improving the economic situation. "If it is to be consolidated in long-range terms, the new model of development will require policies making it sustainable. There is increasing awareness of the need to face up to the depletion of natural resources, put a stop to alarming pollution, and adopt a different type of urban development that will halt the decline in the quality of life in our cities and make it possible to accommodate the projected population increase without undue trauma." Justice, Lack of Safety, and Violence In order to face the challenge of violence and crime, the National Council of Business Associations maintains that not only will it be necessary to consolidate justice as democracy's instrument par excellence for solving social conflicts, but also to strengthen the government's ability to maintain law and order. "Colombia is one of the most violent countries in the world and has in recent years been forced to face a resurgence of what experts call "organized violence," which is linked to guerrilla movements, drug trafficking, and organized crime." The various methods "will therefore require complex solutions in terms of their options, including a possible attempt on the part of the government to engage in negotiations that might lead armed groups to disarm." "In terms of daily violence," the document says, "in addition to strengthening the police, we must undertake more complex action aimed at countering its causes, which include a lack of flexible legal means to resolve conflicts, weapons possession, the use of alcohol and drugs, inadequate monitoring of the conduct of administrative officials, and the lack of educational and recreational facilities." Finally, the business associations are not attacking the Gaviria government, but rather, trying to project their own model into the future.
