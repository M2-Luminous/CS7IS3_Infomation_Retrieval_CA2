Last week Meshkov called on members of parliament to adopt a law giving legal authority to presidential decrees on matters, which are not currently subject to Crimean legislation. Karpov said that at the talks between Kiev and Simferopol, at which he was a participant, the Ukrainian side was very well prepared while the Crimean delegates were not sufficiently qualified. For this reason the leadership had decided to change the composition of the delegation to include experienced lawyers and economists. Karpov said that the Ukrainian delegation had begun by looking for a purely political solution to the problem. However, at the insistence of the Crimean side, both political and economic aspects had been considered. He added that the Crimean side had suggested concluding a treaty on the basis of that which exists between Russia and Tatarstan. Karpov said that this would cause problems relating to the Ukrainian constitution, which maintains Ukraine is a unitary state, unlike Russia which is a federation. He added that during the discussions both sides had agreed that there was a need to make changes to both the Crimean and Ukrainian constitutions. Asked what changes they had in mind, Karpov said that Crimea needed more political and economic powers. If this happened, he said, the Crimean experience of economic reforms would be transferred to the whole of Ukraine. "We do not want to be burden for Kiev, we can and we want to earn our own money," Karpov said. On the question of the Black Sea Fleet Karpov said that the fleet "is a Russia fleet on Crimean territory. For this reason it should pay rent. It should be based at Sevastopol and the Ukrainian Navy should be based outside Crimea in Odessa and Nikolaevo."
