FR940318-0-00010 FR940318-0-00002 ( 2 ) Prepare a 50 percent solution of RBC's by adding equal volumes of packed RBC's to PBS. Mix well. ( 3 ) Add 25 μL of 50 percent RBC solution to the serum dilutions. ( 4 ) Vortex gently to mix. ( 5 ) Incubate at 4 ○C for 1 hour. ( 6 ) Centrifuge to pellet the RBC's. ( 7 ) Use the supernatant to perform the HI assay. Modify the dilution scheme in the assay to consider the initial 1:5 dilution prepared in the treatment. For the 1:5 dilution scheme, do not add PBS to row A. Add 50 μL of the 1:5 treated supernatant to row A. Serially dilute 25 μL from rows A through H. This prepares a serum dilution of 1:10 through 1:640 in rows B through H. 24. In part 147, ``Subpart B_Bacteriological Examination Procedure,'' a new §147.10 is added to read as follows: §147.10 Laboratory procedure recommended for the bacteriological examination of egg-type breeding flocks with salmonella enteritidis positive environments. Birds selected for bacteriological examination from egg-type breeding flocks positive for Salmonella enteritidis after environmental monitoring should be examined as described in §147.11(a) of this subpart, with the following exceptions and modifications allowed due to the high number of birds required for examination: (a) Except when visibly pathological tissues are present, direct culture, §147.11(a)(1) of this subpart, may be omitted; and (b) Enrichment culture of organ (non-intestinal) tissues using a non- selective broth, §147.11(a)(2) of this subpart, may be omitted. 25. Section 147.11 is amended as follows: a. Footnotes 1 through 4 and their references in the regulatory text are redesignated as footnotes 7 through 10. b. Paragraphs (a) through (j) are redesignated as follows: ␣ 1Old section 1New section 147.11(a) 147.11(b)(1). 147.11(b) introductory text 147.11(b)(2) introductory tex.t 147.11(b)(1) 147.11(b)(2)(i). 147.11(b)(2) 147.11(b)(2)(ii). 147.11(b)(3) 147.11(b)(2)(iii). 147.11(b)(4) 147.11(b)(2)(iv). 147.11(b)(5) 147.11(b)(2)(v). 147.11(c) introductory text 147.11(b)(3) introductory text. 147.11(c)(1) 147.11(b)(3)(i). 147.11(c)(2) 147.11(b)(3)(ii). 147.11(c)(3) 147.11(b)(3)(iii). 147.11(c)(4) 147.11(b)(3)(iv). 147.11(c)(5) 147.11(b)(3)(v). 147.11(c)(6) 147.11(b)(3)(vi). 147.11(d) 147.11(b)(4). 147.11(e) 147.11(b)(5). 147.11(f) 147.11(b)(6). 147.11(g) 147.11(b)(7). 147.11(h) 147.11(b)(8). 147.11(i) 147.11(b)(9). 147.11(j) 147.11(b)(10). c. A new paragraph (a) and a paragraph heading for paragraph (b) are added to read as set forth below. d. At the end of the regulatory text of the section, the words ``(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0579&hyph; 0007)'' are added. §147.11 Laboratory procedure recommended for the bacteriological examination of salmonella. (a) For egg- and meat-type chickens, waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds. All reactors to the Pullorum-Typhoid tests, up to at least four birds, should be cultured in accordance with both direct (paragraph (a)(1)) and selective enrichment (paragraph (a)(2)) procedures described in this section. Careful aseptic technique should be used when collecting all tissue samples. (1) Direct culture (refer to illustration 1). Grossly normal or diseased liver, heart, pericardial sac, spleen, lung, kidney, peritoneum, gallbladder, oviduct, misshapen ova or testes, inflamed or unabsorbed yolk sac, and other visibly pathological tissues where purulent, necrotic, or proliferative lesions are seen (including cysts, abscesses, hypopyon, and inflamed serosal surfaces), should be sampled for direct culture using either flamed wire loops or sterile swabs. Since some strains may not dependably survive and grow in certain selective media, inoculate non-selective plates in addition to two selective plating media. Refer to illustration 1 for recommended bacteriological recovery and identification procedures. 6 Proceed immediately with collection of organs and tissues for selective enrichment culture. 6 Biochemical identification charts may be obtained from ``A Laboratory Manual for the Isolation and Identification of Avian Pathogens,'' chapter 1, Salmonellosis. Third edition, 1989, American Association of Avian Pathologists, Inc., Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co., Dubuque, IA 52004&hyph;0539. (2) Selective enrichment culture (refer to illustration 2). Collect and culture organ samples separately from intestinal samples, with intestinal tissues collected last to prevent cross-contamination. Samples from the following organs or sites should be collected for culture in selective enrichment broth. A non-selective broth culture (illustration 1) of pooled organs and sites should also be included as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
