It has also refused to allow electioneering in the state, and to allow monitoring of the election process. The Bophuthatswana government refused to cooperate with the IEC at a meeting between the two parties at Mmabatho this morning. Bophuthatswana said that the IEC request would amount to acceptance of South Africa's nonrecognition of its sovereignty. Meanwhile the streets of Mmabatho were the scene of further unrest this morning as clashes between Bophuthatswana police and striking public servants continued. Our reporter in Mmabatho said the town had been calm until midmorning when a long motorcade of protesters moved through the streets. Protesters were joined by students when they passed the university. Police in armored vehicles then moved in and fired tear gas. In another incident South African Police stationed at the embassy in the capital had to intervene when an explosive situation developed between Bophuthatswana police and striking teachers outside the embassy building. The Bophuthatswana broadcasting center has been closed as a result of the strike by broadcasting workers.
