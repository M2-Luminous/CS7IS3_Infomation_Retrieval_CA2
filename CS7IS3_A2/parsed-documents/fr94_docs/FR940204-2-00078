Inquiries may be made to the Science Advisory Board (1400F), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Pursuant to section 10(d) of the U.S.C. appendix 1 and 5 U.S.C. 522(c), I hereby determine that this meeting is concerned with information exempt from disclosure, and that the public interest requires that this meeting be closed. The Science Advisory Board shall be responsible for maintaining records of the meeting, and for providing an annual report setting forth a summary of the meeting consistent with the policy of U.S.C. appendix 1, section 10(d).
