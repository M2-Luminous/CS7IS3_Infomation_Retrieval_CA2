They had a one-on-one conversation in the papal library. Instead of 30 minutes envisaged by the protocol, the conversation lasted for about an hour. Chernomyrdin told reporters that the meeting was extremely effective and cordial. Pope John Paul II remarked in Russian that this could not have been otherwise as this is the first time a head of the Russian government is received in the Vatican. Later Chernomyrdin met with State Secretary Cardinal Angelo Sodano. A guard of honour of Swiss guards salutted the distinguished guest in the ceremonial hall of the Apostolic palace.
