[Begin Strazdins recording] The situation in Latvia is becoming alarming. In January of this year our criminal police conducted the first cocaine inspection purchase. This means that they checked the information--was it true, was there indeed cocaine in Latvia? Yes, there is already cocaine in Latvia. It is the most terrible narcotic substance that one is able at all to imagine, which causes an exceedingly strong dependence. The only, well, one must say, fortune of our poor people is that it is very expensive. But it is here. Whereas previously we had widespread drug addiction among the criminal element, then at present narcotics has become especially widespread among the young people. We have such endemic hotbeds where it is especially widespread. These is the Latgale suburb of our city of Riga, the town of Olaine, to a certain extent also the Kurzeme suburb [of Riga], there is already a little in the Vidzeme suburb [of Riga]. At present, drug addiction is beginning to spread in Jurmala, in Tukums, in Rezekne, in Liepaja, and in Daugavpils. But, unfortunately, we do not know the true extent of drug addiction in Latvia. I would guess 6-10,000, which is a more or less objective data, because this is our criminal police data. The young people will be compelled to steal, to rob, and sooner or later they will be caught, because it is not possible to buy such expensive narcotic substances with one's wages. [end recording]
