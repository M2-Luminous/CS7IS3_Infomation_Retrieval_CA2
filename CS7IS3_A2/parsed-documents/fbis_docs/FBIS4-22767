This designation is not part of the law on state secrets, but continues to perform its service in some agencies along with the "Not For Publication" stamp. Therefore we learn what kind of special service taxpayers are financing almost four months later, when the absurd designation is removed from the statute and the FCS' organizational development is already complete. This is how "imperceptibly" Russia took its first step down the path to creating a civilized special service. We also have to name the project's authors. Most likely we should count as such former FCS Director Nikolay Golushko, Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov, Sergey Stepashin, and Yuriy Baturin, although the latter joined the "process" at a later stage. And it will be Sergey Stepashin, FCS current director, who will have to prove that the mechanisms offered by him, first, will work, and second, are civilized. In the uncivilized category in the former organs was the ability to conduct political surveillance. On the other hand, over the past few months the MB [Ministry of Security] was constantly being accused of reluctance to take on radical groups and inability to keep the president and society informed in a timely manner on the political situation in the country. Such criticisms were heard after 1 May 1993, when an OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachment] soldier was killed, and after the events of 3-4 October, at which Barkashov commandos appeared. The authors of the statute defined this sphere of FCS activities very delicately as "suppression of illegally created or banned public associations encroaching on the constitutional system of the Russian Federation." Also, they included it in the same point as "combating terrorism, illegal arms distribution and drug trafficking, and illegal armed formations," which indirectly indicates the administration to which the transformed functions of the former Fifth--ideological--Directorate for Protection of Constitutional System will be transferred. In addition, according to the statute, among FCS tasks now are: --counteracting foreign special services; --obtaining information on threats to the Russian Federation security; --providing this information to the president; --protecting state secrets; --counterintelligence support for state borders. The FCS staff is set at 75,000 persons, although Stepashin himself considers this figure inadequate; the statute gives him the right to submit to the president a proposal to increase it. According to the statute these thousands of counterintelligence officers are divided into military counterintelligence organs in the armed services, and territorial organs. Also, their independence from local bodies of authority is emphasized. There is also a separate point that emphasizes FCS independence from the legislative branch: Point 3--"The FCS is subordinated directly to the president of the Russian Federation." There is not a word in the statute about the parliament. One can easily foresee great arguments in the future around this point. Quite possibly this summer the State Duma will be adopting the law on the FCS, similar to the law on foreign intelligence, already in effect since 11 August 1992. In the new draft law the deputies will probably attempt to move away from such a categorical wording, at least closer to the one written in the law on the FIS [Foreign Intelligence Service]: "The general leadership of foreign intelligence organs is carried out by the Russian Federation president." In addition to general provisions, tasks, and functions, the statute sets forth the special service's administrative organs. It is "headed by the director, appointed to the job and relieved from the job by the Russian Federation president." The director, his deputies, as well as several other high-ranking officials comprise the FCS collegium, which "considers and makes decisions by simple vote on the most important issues. The director, however, has power of veto." The productivity (that is, what kind, how much, and the quality of information the president will receive) of the new special service is limited by the financial abilities of the state. At a press conference on Friday Sergey Stepashin for the first time announced approximate figures for his service's budget. "All in all" it is envisaged to appropriate for the FCS "about 700-800 billion--up to 1 trillion rubles [R]." One would salute such openness on the part of the director if he also told us how long this money is supposed to last. If this is the annual budget, one can only sympathize with FCS staff: There will be only about R100,000 a month per each of them. One should not judge the statute's authors harshly. First, because they had only two weeks--which included New Year celebrations--to draft it. And second, nobody in Russia so far had any knowledge as to how a civilized special service is supposed to function. Therefore, the best thing to do is not rely on the statute's dry provisions but count on time, willy-nilly, making a real special service out of the former organs.
