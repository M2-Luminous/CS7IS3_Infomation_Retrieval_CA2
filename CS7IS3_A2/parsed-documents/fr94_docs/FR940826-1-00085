Legal Authority Today's notice is published under the authority of section 304(m) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1314(m). II. Introduction A. Purpose of Today's Notice Today's notice announces the Agency's third biennial plan for developing new and revised effluent guidelines pursuant to sec. 304(m) of the Clean Water Act. EPA published a proposed Effluent Guidelines Plan (the ``Proposed Plan'') on May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25859). The Agency invited comment on the notice until June 17, 1994. Today's notice summarizes and addresses the major comments the Agency received. B. Overview of Today's Notice The Agency intends to develop effluent limitation guidelines and standards (``effluent guidelines'') as follows: 1. Continue development of nine rules listed in the Proposed Plan. The categories are: Pulp, Paper and Paperboard; Pesticide Chemicals (Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging); Coastal Oil and Gas Extraction; Centralized Waste Treatment; Pharmaceutical Manufacturing; Metal Products and Machinery, Phase 1; Landfills and Incinerators; Industrial Laundries; and Transportation Equipment Cleaning. 2. Begin development of effluent guidelines for the Metal Products and Machinery category, Phase 2. 3. Continue to initiate approximately two preliminary studies per year to assist in determining whether new or revised rules should be developed for particular categories. Each preliminary study will generally take approximately two years to complete. 4. Plan for development of eight additional effluent guidelines, either new or revised, between 1996 and 2003. The point source categories to be covered by these guidelines will be identified in future Federal Register notices. EPA intends to begin development of two rules each year from 1996 to 1999, with proposed rules published between 1998 and 2001, and final action taken between 2000 and 2003 respectively.
