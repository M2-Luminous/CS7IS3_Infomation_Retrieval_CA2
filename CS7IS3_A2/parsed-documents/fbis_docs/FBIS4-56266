FBIS4-56266 "drlat084_p_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 Ecuador Official Results Confirm PSC Victory Official Results Confirm PSC Victory PA0205033894 Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0127 GMT 2 May 94 PA0205033894 Hamburg DPA Spanish BFN [Text] Quito, 1 May (DPA) -- Official results have confirm the victory of the rightist Social Christian Party [PSC], which obtained approximately 38 percent of the total vote and one-third of the 65 deputy seats up for election in Ecuador today. Thus, the PSC shed the regional nature that has characterized it as a coastal organization and became the leading national force by winning the election in more than 10 provinces spread throughout the country's four natural regions. This victory leaves 47-year-old Jaime Nebot, the PSC presidential candidate, as the front-runner for the presidency in 1996. Nebot said the PSC faction in the unicameral Congress will demand changes from President Sixto Duran-Ballen's liberal government and will strive from the opposition to see that "the poor Ecuadorean is taken care of." The official vote count confirmed both the popularity of the right coalesced in the Roldosista Party as the country's second leading force and the weakening of the traditionally strong center-left Democratic Left and Popular Democracy parties. According to official figures, the surprise of the election was the reemergence of the Maoist influenced Popular Democratic Movement as the country's third strongest political force and the leftist populism represented by Popular Revolutionary Action. The rest of the Marxist leftist parties have been virtually extinguished. All of the political parties that obtained seats in Congress have announced they will continue to oppose the government. At the same time, however, they will try to improve the image of Congress, whose popularity has reached an all-time low as a result of the inactivity in the past two years. The period of Congress sessions during which the new deputies will be sworn in will open on 10 August. On that same day, liberal President Duran-Ballen will begin the final two years of his term with no possibility for reelection. Although the government received more support in the elections than predicted by opinion polls, it will have to face a hostile Congress for the rest of the term. In this last stage, the government will try to implement its plan for economic opening and to privatize public corporations regarded as inefficient and unproductive, an action the PSC will surely support despite its avowed opposition.
