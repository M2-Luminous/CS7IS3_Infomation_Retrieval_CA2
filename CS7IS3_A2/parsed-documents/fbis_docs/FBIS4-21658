At the request of the Russian Defense Ministry Information and Press Directorate, Lieutenant General of Medical Services Valentin Ivanovich Yevstigneyev, deputy chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection Forces, comments on these assertions. Yevstigneyev: First of all I wish to note that the continuing campaign in the West to accuse Russia of carrying out work on the creation of biological weapons is patently intended to divert public attention from their own programs which contravene the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons. As is well known, Russia advocates the setting up of a large-scale mechanism for verification of compliance with this convention. But such a mechanism is evidently not in the interests of those who are continuing to improve a scientific, technical, and industrial potential which could be used for the production of biological weapons. We have observed that peaks in the activeness of this campaign coincide, as a rule, with major international talks concerning the 1972 Convention. The present press item is no exception. It came out on the eve of a session of the preparatory committee for a special conference to examine possible measures for verification of compliance with the 1972 Convention, at which the Russian side intends to continue work aimed at setting up a mechanism for verification of compliance with the said treaty. As for the accusations against the Russian Defense Ministry, I wish to remind the author of the SUNDAY TIMES item that in accordance with Edict No. 390 of the President of the Russian Federation, 11 April 1992, all work contrary to the requirements of the 1972 Convention was stopped. Verification of the fulfillment of the said edict on Russian territory is carried out by the Committee on Convention Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons under the President of the Russian Federation. In 1993 amendments were made to legislation, making provision for criminal accountability for the development, production, acquisition, or storage of biological weapons. Every year our country submits to the United Nations an exhaustive report on its biological facilities and activity associated with protection against biological weapons. Russia's biological facilities, including those belonging to the Defense Ministry, have repeatedly been visited by representatives of the mass media and the local authorities and by foreign experts. Back in November 1992 an independent commission of leading Russian scientists and foreign experts visited the Institute of Ultrapure Biological Products, at which the United States and Britain suspected that work was being carried out on the "superplague" mentioned in the article. The commission found the institute's activity to be fully in accordance with the requirements of the 1972 Convention. Immediately following the completion of the commission's work, the U.S. and British representatives also voiced no complaints about the work being carried out at the Institute. So any suspicions concerning violations by Russia of the ban on the development, production, or storage of biological weapons are completely unfounded.
