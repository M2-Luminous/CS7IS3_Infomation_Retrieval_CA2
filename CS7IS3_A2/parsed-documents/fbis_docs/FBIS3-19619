A delay in joining the EU would mean that Sweden would lose a year's rebate, or between 1 and 3 billion kronor [SKr]. Wibble's argument in Brussels was that the contribution to the EU would hit hardest in the first years of membership, when the expected positive social effects of membership would not yet have occurred. In the negotiations with the EU, Sweden won a rebate of SKr4.4 billion in 1994, SKr3.9 billion in 1996, and SKr0.5 billion in the two subsequent years. If Swedish accession to the EU does not happen until 1996, the Swedes will have to accept that the EU side would consider the SKr4.4 billion rebate to have been lost, a centrally placed source in the membership negotiations said: "That will be the EU's point of departure. Sweden would probably then be able to make a case for a renegotiation of the rebate, but it will never get back all the SKr4.4 billion -- half of them at most." The reason why the Swedish rebate can only last until 1998 at the latest is that the following year the EU budget will be renegotiated. If at that point a country has a rebate on its budget contribution, the view is that it will have an incentive to block an agreement because the rebate will remain in place until a new budget is decided.
