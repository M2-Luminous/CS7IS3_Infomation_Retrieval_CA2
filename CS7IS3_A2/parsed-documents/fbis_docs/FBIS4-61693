By a decree of Yuriy Meshkov, the president of the republic, this day has been declared a holiday. The Crimean constitution was adopted on 6 May 1992 and, as the participants in the rally pointed out, it reflects most fully the aspirations of Crimeans. It envisions that Crimea's relations with Ukraine will be based on a treaty and agreements. It stipulates the right to dual citizenship and independence vis-a-vis other states. However, at the insistence of the Ukrainian leadership, these articles were removed. They do not appear in the present, official constitution. The Crimean Republic Movement and a number of other parties and public organizations have been campaigning for the restoration of the original wording. Participants in a poll of Crimean citizens recently called for a revision of the constitution. Evidently this is why President Yuriy Meshkov decided that constitution day should be celebrated on 6 May, rather than some other day. Addressing the rally, Meshkov said that Crimea had signed a treaty with the administration of Moscow and that a treaty would soon be signed with the Russian Federation. Crimean Constitution Day was also celebrated by patriotic forces in Sevastopol and by citizens of other towns.
