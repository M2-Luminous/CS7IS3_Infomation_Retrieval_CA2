For the first time, a proposed international treaty was made an electoral issue in this country. The nation's largest political party, now ruling at the Centre, had chosen to defend before the electorate its decision to accept the Dunkel draft. The implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade proposals, its election manifesto sought to say, would be a great boon to the Indian peasantry. The government should cherish no illusions: the Dunkel draft has not received Aryavarta's mandate, and particularly not the mandate of the Uttar Pradesh farm belt. Perhaps that will not bother the government too much. Decisions on crucial economic questions have for some while ceased to be made on the basis of any objective assessment of the predilections and interests of citizens. Discussion in Parliament on the implications of the GATT document has been carefully avoided for as long as possible. Negotiating an international agreement, the prime minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, has obliquely suggested, is the prerogative of the government. Were the final signed document to turn out not to the liking of the representatives of the people the latter could, he seems to imply, move a vote of no confidence against the government. It would now perhaps be claimed on behalf of the prime minister that just as the assembly elections were not a referendum on the performance of his government, they constituted no referendum on the Dunkel draft either. The prime minister and his party would clearly be caught in a bit of a contradiction here. The backtracking would, however, be understandable. Politicians, at least those who are without ideology and have assumed politics to be not dissimilar to any other random profession, have to survive in power, which compulsion necessitates occasional dissembling. The issue will still not go away. The Dunkel draft is not like any other ordinary international treaty dealing with this or that aspect of external relations. It is going to interfere with India's internal economic processes. Under the guise of ushering in an international trade regime untramelled by tariffs and other restrictions, it would restructure production, distribution and pricing arrangements in country after country, including in this one. The government would be on extremely vulnerable grounds were it to suggest the effects of such restructuring on the people is no business of Parliament. Provisions in the draft concerning the pharmaceutical or software industries, biodiversities, finance and communications aside, two matters stand out. The consequences for the country's public distribution system including the system of food and necessity subsidy, and the vulnerability of agriculture if farm products from overseas were allowed entry into the country. The government, faithfully adherent to the notes furnished by the GATT secretariat, has sought to laugh away the possibility of any post-Dunkel upheaval affecting the existing public distribution arrangements. Its point of view is deceptively simple. Subsidy in the case of a foodgrain distributed by a government agency, the draft says, must not be more than 10 per cent of the prevailing market price of the grain. In no year in the past decade, it seems, has the subsidy for publicly distributed wheat or rice exceeded this margin. What has not happened in the past is unlikely to happen in the future either, the government argues. The apprehensions of economists and Opposition politicians, it suggests, are altogether unfounded. The discretionary margin allowed by the draft agreement is sufficiently wide for the power to distribute subsidised food to the weaker sections of society to be left unimpaired. But will it? No major crop failure has taken place in the country during the past decade. The demands placed on the public distribution system have naturally been modest and the gap between the market price and the price in ration and fair price shops for the main cereals has been relatively narrow. However, if the rains fail in some years in the proximate future this will change. And this could well happen as the country has had good rains successively for five years. The resulting crop failure might then lead to a steep decline in market supplies. Foodgrain prices could skyrocket. Going by what was experienced in the mid-Sixties, it is by no means certain that a price rise of 200 to 300 per cent would not take place in the event of a mere 20 per cent drop in output. The market price for the principal cereals could shoot up to as much as Rs 20 per kilogram--if not everywhere, at least in some parts of the country. Were the Dunkel proposals to become the law of the land the government would in that eventuality be precluded from distributing rice or wheat at less than Rs 18 per kilogram. Few of the nation's poor would be able to afford this price. In case the government were to announce, as part of famine relief operations, the free distribution of grain to distressed people, nothing would stop a free market zealot from requesting the GATT authorities that penal action be initiated against the Indian authorities for distributing farm products at a 100 per cent subsidy. What is more, once the draft is signed, the government will have to allow the import of any and every agricultural commodity to the extent of 3.3 per cent of its domestic output. This is not as harmless as it sounds. Economic textbooks are full of examples of the violent price fluctuations of a farm product that could be brought about by a marginal increase or decrease in its supplies. Once expectations are queered in a particular manner, and speculators and buyers are conditioned in their behaviour, even a marginal augmentation of supply is capable of bringing down prices by as much as 50 or 60 per cent, and thereby ruining the peasantry. This clause inserted in the Dunkel proposals is not necessarily an innocent academic proviso. Some years ago, a group of strategists ensconced in the World Bank had floated a trial balloon. Global efficiency of production deserved to be maximised, including farm output. Agricultural productivity in the United States and Canada, as is common knowledge, is way ahead of productivity in other parts of the world, including of course Asia, Africa and Latin America. If the objective is--as it should be--to raise global resource use to its most feasible level, would it therefore not be sensible to concentrate all farm activity in the US and Canada alone? The strategists ensconced inside the World Bank were not deterred by piffling little details. They did not care to spell out the alternative occupation or livelihood the poor peasantry in the inefficient countries could switch to if they surrendered their right to cultivate their land and became wholly dependent on imports. Though the peasants of these poor lands would be without any occupation or income, it might nonetheless be insisted upon they pay for their imports at proper North American prices. It would be too bad if they failed to pay such prices. Imports would stop and they would be welcome to starve and die. What is apocalypse to some is millenium to others. The Dunkel draft incorporates in itself the vision of a millenium thought up by the world's rich. Should the agriculture of a poor country collapse, the multinational monopolies could comfortably move in and do whatever they wanted with the country's food and agricultural policy. It is a beautiful scheme. Once the signatures get appended to the Dunkel proposals, it would be binding on the government. The latter has for months on end refused to face Parliament on the issue, and it would be furiously denied that the verdict in UP is in part an expression of the people's wrath at the endorsement of the GATT final draft. Cheered by Western governments and the multinational lobby, it would proceed to arrange the noose around the nation's neck, nor would it feel ashamed at being present at its own beheading.
