FR940819-2-00118 FR940819-2-00070 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,904] J&G Shake, Forks, WA; Notice of Revised Determination on Reopening On August 3, 1994, the Department on its own reopened its investigation for workers and former workers of the subject firm. The initial investigation resulted in a denial for workers of J&G Shake, Forks, Washington. The denial notice will soon be published in the Federal Register . New investigation findings on reopening show a major customer increased its reliance on imported cedar shakes and shingles in the relevant period. The customer accounted for the preponderance of the subject firm's sales decline in the relevant period. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, it is concluded that increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with cedar shakes and shingles produced by J&G Shake, Forks, Washington contributed importantly to the decline in sales and production and to the total or partial separation of workers at J&G Shake, Forks, Washington. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination: ``All workers and former workers of J&G Shake, Fork, Washington who became totally of partially separated from employment on or after April 21, 1993 through two years from the date of certification are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974'' Signed in Washington, D.C. this 8th day of August, 1994. Violet L. Thompson, Deputy Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20472 Filed 8&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
