At the opening ceremonies of the Sino-U.S. talks on trade and investment projects held today, this female Chinese minister stressed that China hopes to resolve the MFN status unconditionally. The MFN status is a pure trade issue; it is unwise to link it to the "human rights" issue, nor does it comply with strategic thinking. The Chinese Government trade and economic relations delegation headed by Wu Yi arrived in Los Angeles on 8 April and will leave for Washington D.C. tomorrow to attend the Eighth Session of the Sino- U.S. Joint Committee for Commerce and Trade. During the four-day stay in Los Angeles, Wu Yi has answered questions on the MFN status on several occasions put by figures from various circles. She said that the MFN status is the kernel clause in the Sino- U.S. Agreement on Trade Relations signed in 1979. It is not a favor bestowed by one country on another but an arrangement of mutual benefit on an equal footing. She believed that, should the United States cancel the MFN status, China would suffer certain losses; however, the United States would likewise suffer and its losses would be bigger than those of China. The United States would lose the huge Chinese market whereas more products, technology, and funds from other countries would find their way into the Chinese market. Today, Wu Yi repeatedly called on the United States to adopt a practical attitude, weigh the pros and cons, and remove manmade obstacles to enable Sino-U.S. ties in trade and economic relations to develop healthily.
