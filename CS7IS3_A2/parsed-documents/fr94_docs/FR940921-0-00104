FR940921-0-00104 FR940921-0-00016 58. Section 86.135&hyph;94 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.135&hyph;94 Dynamometer procedure. * * * * * (a) Overview. The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ``cold'' start test, after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak according to the provisions of §§86.132 and 86.133, and a ``hot'' start test following the ``cold'' start by 10 minutes. Engine startup (with all accessories turned off), operation over the UDDS and engine shutdown make a complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air in the dilution tunnel as shown in Figure B94&hyph;5 and Figure B94&hyph;6. A dilution tunnel is not required for testing vehicles waived from the requirement to measure particulates. Six particulate samples are collected on filters for weighing; the first sample plus backup is collected during the first 505 seconds of the cold start test; the second sample plus backup is collected during the remainder of the cold start test (including shutdown); the third sample plus backup is collected during the hot start test. Continuous proportional samples of gaseous emissions are collected for analysis during each test phase. For gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the composite samples collected in bags are analyzed for THC, CO, CO 2 , CH 4 and NO X . For petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles (optional for natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles), THC is sampled and analyzed continuously according to the provisions of §86.110. Parallel samples of the dilution air are similarly analyzed for THC, CO, CO 2 , CH 4 and NO X . For natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles, bag samples are collected and analyzed for THC (if not sampled continuously), CO, CO 2 , CH 4 and NO X . For methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde samples are taken for both exhaust emissions and dilution air (a single dilution air formaldehyde sample, covering the total test period may be collected). Parallel bag samples of dilution air are analyzed for THC, CO, CO 2 , CH 4 and NO X . Methanol and formaldehyde samples may be omitted for 1990 through 1994 model years when a FID calibrated on methanol is used. * * * * * 59. Section 86.136&hyph;90 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (a) heading and introductory text and (b), to read as follows: §86.136&hyph;90 Engine starting and restarting. (a) Otto-cycle vehicles. Paragraph (a) of this section applies to Otto-cycle vehicles. * * * * * (b) Diesel vehicles. The engine shall be started according to the manufacturers recommended starting procedures in the owners manual. The initial 20-second idle period shall begin when the engine starts. The transmission shall be placed in gear 15 seconds after the engine is started. If necessary, braking may be employed to keep the drive wheels from turning. * * * * * 60. Section 86.138&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.138&hyph;96 Hot soak test. (a) (1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. For gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles, the hot soak test shall be conducted immediately following the running loss test. However, sampling of emissions from the running loss test is not required as preparation for the hot soak test. (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. Since gaseous-fueled vehicles are not required to perform a running loss test, the hot soak test shall be conducted within five minutes of the hot start exhaust test. * * * * * 61. Section 86.140&hyph;94 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text and (b) introductory text, to read as follows: §86.140&hyph;94 Exhaust sample analysis. * * * * * (a) For CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , NO X , and for Otto-cycle and methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled (if non-heated FID option is used) diesel vehicle HC: * * * * * (b) For petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled (if HFID is used) diesel vehicle HC: * * * * *
