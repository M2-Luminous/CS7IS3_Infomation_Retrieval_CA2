Located in the arid and semi-arid area, Ningxia has a population of 4.9 million, one third being of the Hui nationality. The Hui people are well known for personal hygiene and like to grow flowers, lawns and trees. "It is their good habit and tradition that have made it easy for the regional government to push through its environment protection measures," said Sun Ningzhang, director of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Environment Protection Agency. Sun noted that the rapid economic development has inevitably caused pollution. To control it, the regional government has worked out a package of rules and regulations while building a number of pollution prevention and control facilities. All these have got enthusiastic support from the local people. A survey shows that the regional capacity of treating waste water has doubled, and that of treating waste gas increased by 45 percent. So far the region has transformed 267,000 hectares of sandy land and 8,390 square kilometers of areas suffering from soil erosion. In addition, the region has planted trees on 267,000 hectares of hilly areas and set up some nature reserves of animals and plants.
