Palcevic: "Brilliant Victory in Gorazde"] [Text] Uzice -- An interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, was published in the Labor Day edition of VESTI in Uzice. Asked by Vitomir Tomic, the news editor of VESTI, what the next steps of the Srpska republic or their enemies were, Karadzic answered: "Our steps will include strengthening our positions and lines. We shall prepare ourselves for defense. As far as the steps of our enemies are concerned, they will start an offensive from a protected area, such as Tuzla or Bihac, or, for example, an attack against the Serbian corridor. We shall defend ourselves for a time, and then we shall openly threaten them with a counteroffensive, as was the case with Gorazde. If we start a counteroffensive, the international community will mourn the Muslims. They, on the other hand, will complain and ask the whole world to save them and create a state for them. The victory in Gorazde is a brilliant victory for our army and our people. Based on the Gorazde crisis, in which we showed our superiority, the world must conclude that quick steps toward peace have to be taken. It seems to me that the value of this victory lies in the fact that we succeeded in showing the world that the Muslims are not able to conquer new territories. If the United States gets involved, it will become one of the warring factions, just as it was in the Vietnam war. The world has to decide whether it is more important to help the Muslims or to establish peace." As for the immediate and long-term aims of the Srpska republic, its leader Karadzic said that the immediate aims were to defend the borders and obtain recognition, and that the long-term aim was to become a part of Serbia. "We do not want to establish a Serbian federation. We think that a future Serbian state has to be unitary. It should consist of districts and should never again enter such a federation as could put its existence at stake. The present leadership and this generation of the people in the republic of Srpska has absolutely no inclination toward autonomy. We want to be Serbia. It can happen that the republic of Srpska is independent for a time, but it will be in a federation with Serbia. This only because the international community cannot accept that Serbia, accused of aggression, has won a war in which it did not even participate. The international community does not want to accept "a greater Serbia," as they call it. If we are forced to live in a federation with Serbia looser than planned for a year or two, this will not change our long-term aim in any way.
