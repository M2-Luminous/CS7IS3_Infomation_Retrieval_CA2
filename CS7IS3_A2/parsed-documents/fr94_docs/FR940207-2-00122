FR940207-2-00122 FR940207-2-00065 The proposal provides that to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the CBOE will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the related securities which can affect the pricing of the foreign security underlying the ADR option. 6 Under the proposal, the CBOE will determine that at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume in a particular foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market if the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's common stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, is not less than 50% of the sum of (1) the combined trading volume for all classes of the foreign issuer's common stock, and (2) the combined trading volume for all ADRs overlying any of these classes of stock. 7 The above noted calculation also will be used to determine if the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market falls below 30% of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying foreign security. 8 6 Under the proposal, such related securities include all classes of common stock issued by the foreign issuer and ADRs that overlie any one of these classes of common stock. See letter from Richard G. DuFour, Executive Vice President, CBOE, to Richard L. Zack, Branch Chief, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division, Commission, dated January 26, 1994 (``ADR Letter''). 7 See ADR Letter, supra note 6, and telephone conversation between Richard G. DuFour, Executive Vice President, CBOE, and Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division, Commission, on January 27, 1994. 8 See ADR Letter, supra note 6. Under this calculation, the trading volume for any U.S. ADR trading on an exchange that is not part of the U.S. ADR market will be included in the determination of world-wide trading volume, but not in the determination of U.S. ADR market trading volume. The CBOE also represents that it will use its best efforts to discover all markets (foreign and U.S.) on which the foreign security (and any related securities) underlying the ADR options trades. The proposal also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') 9 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS''). 10 The U.S. self-regulatory organizations that currently make up the U.S. ADR market are the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE, the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx. 11 9 ISG was formed on July 14, 1983 to, among other things, coordinate more effectively surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets. See Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the ISG Agreement, which incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members on January 29, 1990. See Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, January 29, 1990. The members of the ISG are: the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``AMEX''), the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), the CBOE, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE''), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''). 10 ITS is a communications system designed to facilitate trading among competing markets by providing each market with order routing capabilities based on current quotation information. The system links the participant markets and provides facilities and procedures for: (1) The display of composite quotation information at each participant market, so that brokers are able to determine readily the best bid and offer available from any participant for multiple trading securities; (2) efficient routing of orders and sending administrative messages (on the functioning of the system) to all participating markets; (3) participation, under certain conditions, by members of all participating markets in opening transactions in those markets; and (4) routing orders from a participating market to a participating market with a better price. The exchanges on which Empresas ADRs trade are ITS participant markets. The NASD's Computer Assisted Execution System links NASD market makers, for order routing and execution purposes, to ITS for ADRs. 11 See ADR Letter, supra note 6. III. Discussion The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). 12 Specifically, the Commission finds that allowing options to trade on ADRs, among other things, gives investors a better means to hedge their positions in the ADRs, as well as enhanced market timing opportunities. 13 Further, the pricing of the ADRs underlying ADR options may become more efficient and market makers in these ADRs, by virtue of enhanced hedging opportunities, may be able to provide deeper and more liquid markets. 14 In sum, options on ADRs likely engender the same benefits to investors and the market place that exist with respect to options on common stock. 15 12 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 13 For example, if an investor wants to invest in ADRs but does not have sufficient cash available until a future date, he can purchase an ADR option now for less money and exercise the option to purchase the ADRs at a later date. 14 See e.g. Report of the Special Study of the Options Markets to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (Comm. Print No. 96&hyph;IFC3, December 22, 1978). 15 Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new securities product upon a finding that the introduction of such new product is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns.
