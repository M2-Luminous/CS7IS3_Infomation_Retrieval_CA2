A news blackout has been imposed on the controversy over the law, which was to have been approved by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in April. "It is now doubtful whether the law can be passed before 1995," a member of the drafting team said. "This has turned into a deeply political problem." A draft handed over to the National People's Congress legal work committee in January contained provisions which would allow shares in state-owned firms to trade freely on stock exchanges. Backed by securities authorities, the head of the drafting team, Professor Li Yining of Beijing University, argued that "state shares should be tradable, otherwise they are dead". Some senior leaders, notably Chen Qingtai, a vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission in charge of reform of state enterprises, said enterprise reforms should first be given a chance to work before the door is opened for state firms to be privatised. "It's a debate about when this approach should be taken," the drafting team member said. "Some people feel the central government should take measures to make sure this does not happen too fast." While the public ownership issue has been looming since drafting work began last year, a new ideological conflict has arisen on winners and losers in the country's volatile stock markets which has further complicated passage of the proposed securities law, the member said. Beijing is afraid that the rapid worsening of fortunes among China's relatively well educated and informed new stock investors may set off protests as more cases of insider trading and corruption are revealed, the member said. A survey by the State Commission for Economic Reform at the end of last year found that 43.2 per cent of China's shareholders lost money, while only 23.8 per cent made money and 32.4 per cent broke even. The poor overall returns were explained by the fact that more than half of China's 25 million-plus shareholders bought shares for the first time in 1993, when profits from share trading suddenly became thin. "They have realised that the upstart millionaires are usually of low cultural quality, but are well-connected, while the bulk of those who lose money are well-educated," the member said. "The central government has become more cautious since secondary markets have been less profitable," the source said. "The situation is different from (the riots) in Shenzhen in 1992, when workers and peasants protested because of corruption. Now it's a question of middle-class people losing money." More than 58 per cent in the survey felt the operation of markets was not fair, with 86 per cent identifying administrative interference, incomplete laws or insider trading as the biggest problem. Beijing intends to sit on the new securities law for most of this year while asking the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets to continue improving trading, listing and disclosure systems, the source said. Big cases of corruption will also be rooted out to "pacify the worries of the shareholders". Beijing last week sentenced to death Shen Taifu, chairman of the Great Wall Electrical Machinery Company, which illegally raised more than a billion renminbi [RMB] (HK$888m) [Hong Kong dollars] from investors last year, of which Shen embezzled more than RMB4m and handed out RMB250,000 in bribes. Last month a brokerage affiliated to the Agricultural Bank of China was heavily fined for making RMB6.72m on insider trading. "The government feels the need to stabilise the worries of the majority of shareholders before allowing any more development of the stock markets," the member said.
