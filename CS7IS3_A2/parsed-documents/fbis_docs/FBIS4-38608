He told INTERFAX that Washington's obstruction of Russian weapon export, as in the case of the failed sales of MiG-29 fighter planes to Venezuela, forced Russia to deal with undesirable partners. As a result, Yushenkov said, odious dictatorial regimes obtained weapons through third or fourth countries and created tension for the entire world community.
