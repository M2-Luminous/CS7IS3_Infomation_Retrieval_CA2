In particular the processing industry has recovered -- by 21.5 percent during the first quarter compared with the same period last year. In its monthly report for June the Bundesbank assesses this as a sign of the increasing competitiveness of eastern German products -- but only on the domestic market for the time being. There, however, orders by German customers have risen by 26.5 percent within a year, because foreign business has not yet been able to find a replacement for the losses on the markets in East Europe: The share of export business in overall turnover has shrunk to about 10 percent. According to the Bundesbank, the construction sector remains an essential factor of economic recovery: Not only in the public and industrial sector but also in housing construction has there been a strong expansion in building activities. At the moment, new buildings are also being ordered in increasing numbers, in addition to the improvement and renovation of apartments. The guardians of the currency see a glimmer of hope for the working people: Despite the still "alarmingly high" unemployment of 1.16 million people at the end of May, the reduction of personnel in the processing industry has come to a standstill. However, apart from structural problems, a "wage policy that is little appropriate for the actual conditions" has so far worsened employment prospects, the Bundesbank notes reproachfully.
