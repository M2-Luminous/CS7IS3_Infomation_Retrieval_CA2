In the authors' opinion, Boris Yeltsin accepts "coolly" the idea and "will never come forward with integrational banner." Democrats stand behind Yeltsin, write the authors, are "the pragmatic people who do not conceal their view that Russia needs no poor relatives, while the former Soviet republics...only in a few years were ruined to such an extent that they reached and overrun in that sense many African states". Ambiguous situation has been created when Yeltsin does not explicitly support Nazarbayev's idea, meanwhile, there may hide much danger in such a passivity. It is this very ambiguity that creates the situation today when Russia on one hand stands as a leader of at least economic union reconstruction, while on the other hand no particular steps are made in this direction. Should however one other republic make conclusions from this tendency and try to solve its own destiny, Russia will immediately raise the brows and undertake the measures to punish the guilty, write "GA" analysts. With reference to certain observers' opinion "GA" claims that even if the integrational processes go more intensively, one may speak at a first phase only of three Slavic states' union, plus possibly Kazakhstan. The paper observes that Nazarbayev's idea was as yet backed only by Kyrgyzstan, and the leaders of Transcaucasus preferred not to appear on that topic.
