That figure comes from the Hospital Foundation, which has now counted 1,070 people in the public network's hospitals and health centers who are carriers of the virus and 492 who have developed the disease. If that pace continues, AIDS will be the fifth-ranking cause of death in the Federal District within five years, in the opinion of Luiz Bezerra, medical officer in the Department of Public Health. The disease occupies 15th place among the chief causes of death in the city. Rosely Cerqueira, coordinator of the AIDS Program and director of the Department of Public Health, believes that the number of victims in the capital is larger than that recorded because the AIDS Program is unaware of cases reported to private hospitals and independent physicians. Although she considers the situation "worrying," Rosely points out that the picture was even worse two years ago. Figures by the Hospital Foundation's AIDS Program show that unlike the situation in previous years, the disease has been spreading faster among heterosexuals and intravenous drug users -- in the latter case because of the practice of sharing syringes. "AIDS is not a disease that attacks only specific groups such as homosexuals," Rosely Cerqueira warns. Through September 1993, 19 cases had been reported among homosexuals, compared to 36 among heterosexuals and 35 among intravenous drug users. The capital's young and productive population is the major victim of the disease, which is spreading among people over 15 years of age. Women have come to constitute an important segment of the group in question. In the 1980's, there were 20 infected men for every infected woman. For every three men carrying the virus in the capital today, there is one infected woman. Campaigns--The lack of information is pointed to as one of the main reasons why the disease is spreading. "People feel that they will never become infected with the AIDS virus," says Marcelo Idalga, president of GAPA (AIDS Support and Prevention Group). To alert the public to AIDS, about 15 members of the group, including students, government employees, and members of the liberal professions, meet regularly to organize debates and enlightenment campaigns. The group has also set up an AIDS hot line (349-8000) to help AIDS victims and inform the public about the disease. One example cited by GAPA to illustrate the misinformation about the disease that is heard on the hot line concerned a woman who was desperate because she worked in the same room as a carrier of the virus. Marcelo Idalgo [spelling variation as published] recalls: "She believed that she could be infected through the air." Another recorded case was that of a man who had asked the janitor to keep a few kegs of milk in his house and then panicked when he learned that the man had AIDS. The rumor then spread through the neighborhood that the milk might be contaminated. People did not calm down until it was explained over the AIDS hot line that the virus would never survive inside a keg.
