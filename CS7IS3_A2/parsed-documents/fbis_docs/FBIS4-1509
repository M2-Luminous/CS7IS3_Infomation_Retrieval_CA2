FBIS4-1509 "drchi062_v_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 TAIWAN Japanese Semiconductor Delegation To Visit Japanese Semiconductor Delegation To Visit OW3103080894 Taipei CNA in English 0731 GMT 31 Mar 94 OW3103080894 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Danielle Yang] [Text] Taipei, March 31 (CNA) -- A 45-member Japanese delegation will visit Taiwan April 26 to attend a trade seminar and discuss the purchase of semiconductor products, a China External Trade Development Council (Cetra) spokesman announced Thursday. The April 26-28 seminar will be sponsored by Cetra, the Electronic Industry Association of Japan (EIAJ), and the Coordination Council of ROC-Japan Business Affairs. During the seminar, 19 noted Japanese business groups will meet with 16 Taiwan electronic manufacturers and suppliers at the Taipei International Convention Center. The Japanese delegation will include representatives from Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Toshiba, and Sanyo, the spokesman noted. The visit comes after eight Taiwan semiconductor producers, led by the United Electronic Corp., visited Japan last December. During the tour, Taiwan producers reaped more than U.S.$40 million in integrated circuit (IC) and other computer peripheral products trade. Semiconductors are widely used in electronic products such as computers and televisions. Taiwan exported some U.S.$2.5 billion worth of semiconductor products to Japan in 1993, topping all other electronic products exported to Japan and registering an annual growth rate of 35 percent. The Cetra spokesman said the forthcoming visit not only signifies Japanese affirmation of Taiwan's semiconductor industry, but will also help in correcting Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan. The meeting will be a good opportunity for Taiwan manufacturers to expand trade in the closed Japanese market, the Cetra spokesman added. After the talks, the Japanese traders will visit factories in the Hsinchu science-based industrial park before returning to Japan.
