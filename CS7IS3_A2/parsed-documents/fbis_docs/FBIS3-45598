According to the information released by Reporter (Shu Shouchun) on the evening of 20 January, while staying at Jingtang Harbor, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua inspected, along the wide newly built road, the construction situation of the harbor development area, listened to the report on planning and development situation of the harbor, and inquired about the detailed situation in building traffic, water supply, power supply, and communications facilities of the harbor as well as existing problems. Vice Governor Chen Liyou introduced: Although Jingtang Harbor and Tianjin's Qinhuangdao Harbor may complement each other, while they cannot replace each other in functions. Through various forms, including the transfer of property right, Jingtang Harbor will cooperate with Beijing and Shanxi to build itself to meet the demands of economic development and opening up of the hinterland areas. At the same time, the harbor will take advantage of its large expense of sea beaches within the development area to absorb foreign investment and develop the near-the-harbor industry in order to build itself into a multi-functional harbor which combines industry with foreign trade. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua agreed to this idea on building the harbor and exhorted the harbor to develop the near-the-harbor industry within the development area in order to make full use of the harbor. During the inspection tour, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua also listened to the report on economic development of Tangshan city and construction of the harbor. He pointed out: Since the restoration of construction after being hit by earthquakes, Tangshan city has witnessed a very rapid progress in developing the economy, and thus there will be bright prospects for the development of the harbor. First, Tangshan city has such hinterland areas as Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia. Second, the city has vast land resources which is exempt the city from taking over land for construction and from relocating the people. Third, combining the harbor with the development area is conducive to developing the near-the-harbor industry. In addition, the cooperation with Beijing is very important. Among the several major cities around Bo Hai, only Beijing has no sea outlet. Now, Beijing has chosen Tangshan Harbor is of great significance to both Beijing and Tangshan. At present, the harbor has already have the condition for attracting goods from inland areas. We hope that Jingtang Harbor will successfully radiate itself to inland areas, select its own points of radiation, and strive to achieve success in building the near-the-harbor industry. Also accompanied Zou Jiahua on his inspection tour were Zhang Kezhi, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Ye Qing and Chen Yaobang, vice ministers of the State Planning Commission; Xu Penghang, vice minister of State Economic and Trade Commission; Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical industry; Liu Qi, minister of metallurgical industry; Liu E, vice minister of communications; Sun Yongfu, vice minister of railways; and Zha Keming, vice minister of power industry.
