During a telephone conversation with EFE, Susana Seleme said from her home in Santa Cruz, 851 km east of La Paz, that she had never been arrested and that the FELCN had not summoned her to testify. Radio Panamericana of La Paz today said that Seleme had been arrested for alleged links with drug trafficking. Interior Minister German Quiroga did not want either to confirm or deny the arrest of Seleme because, he said, it is "confidential information." In statements to Radio Panamericana, Quiroga also did not confirm or deny that an arrest warrant has been issued against other leaders in Paz Zamora's party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR).
