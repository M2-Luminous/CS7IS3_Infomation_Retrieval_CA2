By the turn of the millennium the number of refugees may have increased to half a billion, the International Red Cross fears. Against this background, Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger (Christian Social Union) presented a concept on "refugee policy within the framework of development cooperation" on Tuesday [12 April], which aims at fighting the reasons for flight and at promoting the chances of returning. The program continues the refugee concept that was adopted by the Federal Cabinet in September 1990. "There is an ethical and humane obligation to prevent people from having to leave their homes against their will," Spranger said during the presentation of the concept, "and there is an ethical and humane obligation to help people who are on the run." However, helping refugees is also important purely from the point of view of development policy, because the refugees are mostly the most mobile and energetic part of a population. They are people who are needed most urgently for the development of their countries of origin. A program that provides start-up aid for returnees is aimed especially at skilled workers so that they can use the skills that they have developed in Germany in their own country. Thus, jointly financed loan funds for helping people found a new existence have been established together with Chile, Eritrea, Turkey, Slovenia, and Vietnam. In 1993, 505 companies founded by returnees were supported in Vietnam alone and more than 6,000 jobs were created. This year about 70 million German marks [DM] are available for this aid to returnees. In total, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) spent about DM490 million on refugee-related measures in 1993. In addition, about DM100 million was spent within the framework of the European Union. Focal areas of the BMZ are southeastern Europe and northern Africa, as well as the regions of the horn of Africa and Afghanistan/Pakistan, which are particularly affected by refugee crises. Social Democratic Party of Germany development expert Ingomar Hauchler criticized the concept as insufficient. Spranger's ideas are, in addition, suspected of being a "mere instrument of isolation" against people.
