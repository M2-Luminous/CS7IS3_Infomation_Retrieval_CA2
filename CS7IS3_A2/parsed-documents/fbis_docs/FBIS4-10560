FBIS4-10560 "drlat072_n_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 18 Feb 1994 Chile CUT Leaders Oppose Further Privatizations CUT Leaders Oppose Further Privatizations 94SM0295C Santiago LA NACION in Spanish 18 Feb 94 p 4 94SM0295C Santiago LA NACION Spanish CSO [Text] The United Labor Confederation (CUT) has called for a mass meeting in March "to inform the right wing and those who want or intend to promote the idea of privatizing the enterprises of all the Chilean citizens that the workers will not allow the continued draining of the state so that private citizens can take over the patrimony of the people of Chile." Arturo Martinez, the vice president of the trade-union organization, together with other leaders, met with representatives of the Copper Workers' Federation (FTC). Martinez offered the support of the trade-union body for the petition being drafted by the FTC demanding clarity and penalties for those who are guilty of causing harm. This leader expressed regret that the executives of the CODELCO [Copper Company], who are responsible for the administration of the enterprise, have "betrayed" the confidence of President Aylwin. "There is abandonment here in terms of concern and respect for their responsibilities." And this, he explained, applies to all of those who have had the responsibility for the management of the enterprise. "We are alarmed that the political right wing has seized upon this most regrettable fact, which will mean less money to be used to aid the poorest of the people, in order to renew their intention of privatizing the CODELCO and other state enterprises once again." Atmosphere of Peace Endangered Martinez noted that the CUT collaborated with the establishment of democracy and the development of an atmosphere of social peace, "very frequently postponing the legitimate interests of the workers. But we want to warn the businessmen, the right wing, and the political parties that this climate of social peace may change if the efforts to privatize and plunder the national assets are continued. "If the modernization of the enterprise is carried out without the workers, it goes against the workers," he warned, proposing that there be dialogue rather than unilateral decisions. In this connection, he noted that the FTC has proposed a plan for CODELCO expenditures that "the enterprise has not wanted to adopt or hear about. "We are defending the assets of all the people of Chile. We will proceed through every necessary measure if we are not heard." He recalled that it was the CUT that "within an atmosphere of bullying, ousted Pinochet and his dictatorship. It was neither the parties nor any of the technocratic officials in the government who initiated the battle in 1983. It was the Chilean workers." No Mixed Companies He also expressed the view that an attitude of the CODELCO administration favorable to privatization began when some services were transferred with the approval of the executives. "We want the next administration to discuss the modernization of the business with the workers, so that it will not mean mixed companies. We are prepared to take all the necessary steps, including separation of the divisions into departments, but not to discuss privatization or mixed companies." Meanwhile, Carlos Gomez, the secretary general of the FTC, reiterated that the Investigative Commission of the Chamber of Deputies will be asked to review the situation of all of the divisions, the transfers to the sectors of third parties in particular. He stated that the CODELCO has 22,000 workers, and that it is a "deception of the nation" to say that the personnel strength has been reduced, since there are 18,000 contractors. He noted that there is work that has been passed on to third parties for two years, but has had to be returned to the CODELCO to be done by its employees because they are more efficient. A meeting of the National Advisory Council of the FTC is scheduled for 2 March. At that meeting, the proposal regarding the future of the CODELCO will be analyzed. This document will be debated at the base levels and in the social entities, and then reexamined with a view to approval during the National Congress in April.
