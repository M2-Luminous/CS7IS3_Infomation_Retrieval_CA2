"Considering how confident the National Party [NP] was of winning the election or gaining enough support to curb the ANC in a government of national unity, the poll comes as a shock to many of its followers (although previous polls showed a similar trend in favour of the ANC). The NP's confidence was misplaced from the outset. Not only did it not take into account the historical fact that liberation organisations win the elections in Africa, but it puts its faith in a possible alliance of moderates that would counter ANC. In the event the NP ended up with no allies, moderate or otherwise." The NP's "biggest mistake was to seek an accommodation with the ANC while ignoring the others." THE STAR Township Residents Urged To End Rent, Services Boycott--The ending of the 10-year-old township rent and service charge boycott, now endorsed by Nelson Mandela, "should mark the beginning of a process to restore effective governance to South Africa's dormitory towns," declares a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 January. The "root cause" of the township problem "is to be found in the misguided conviction by the architects of apartheid that township residents, without any industrial tax base or outside support, could keep those areas financially viable." "Today many townships are bereft of effective leadership and in a state of administrative collapse. They are also burdened with a collective R[rand]1.84 billion debt resulting from boycotts." Residents are urged to heed Mandela's plea to end the boycott of rents and service payments, and "concentrate on making the townships governable." BUSINESS DAY ANC Urged To Take Stand Against Hospital Workers--Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 January in a page-6 editorial notes that the sporadic strikes at various hospitals "have been the result of disputes over a well-intended gesture by the Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] in granting a R[rand]500 bonus to staff at Baragwanath as a reward for their efforts in trying circumstances last year." The bonus was withdrawn when a similar payment was demanded by all and sundry at other hospitals -- "a concession both unreasonable and beyond the means of the TPA to pay." Hospital workers are "threatening the future of hospital services. It won't be long now before an ANC government is faced with this kind of union trouble in the public service. How, we wonder, would it go about implementing its new health policy if faced with the collapse of services over a bonus to which staff were not entitled?" The ANC is urged to take a "public stand against irresponsible actions by public service trade union in essential services." RAPPORT Editorial Views ANC Election List--"The chief characteristic of the ANC's list of candidates for the 27 April election is that it is not representative of a single party. It encompasses, rather, a broad alliance of known leaders from the ANC itself, a whole group of communists, socialist trade union leaders, homeland leaders, members of parliament from the tricameral parliament, and even a few members from the entertainment industry," begins a page-22 editorial in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 23 January. "With this list the ANC is a step ahead of its opponents, among whom there is no talk of election alliances, with others still debating whether or not to participate in the election. In addition to this, the ANC has already released important elements of its policy documents, including health and economic policies. Both, as expected, contain strong socialist elements." "What stands out like a pole above water is that the ANC is dominated by a spirit of ideological dogmatism in its quest to reintroduce policies totally discredited in other parts of the world." "The ANC does not give the impression that it is an opposition party striving for power, but rather that it is a `liberation organization' waiting impatiently to take over power." "This psychosis must be stopped by opponents of the ANC. It should not be allowed to pose arrogantly as the overwhelming favorite of `the people' with the rest being seen as powerless, confused, and disparate small enclaves of opposition." BEELD Announcement on Afrikaner Election `Misleading'--Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 1 January says in a page-8 editorial: "The announcement in the Conservative Party mouthpiece, PATRIOT, that an own election for `Boer Afrikaners' will be held on or before 27 April would be funny were it not so tragically misleading. In addition to the homeland dream by which voters are being taken for a ride, right-wing leaders recently also announced that an own cabinet and an own government would be put in place as soon as the Transitional Executive Council began functioning. Nothing, of course, came of that, as with so many other right-wing escapist promises. One can, therefore, also predict that nothing will come of this latest, absurd election promise. Should 1 million people countrywide vote for a homeland, and 20 million others vote for a new dispensation under the new constitution, what will the former have proven? Only that they are a minority who have no right to grab power and territory. The tension within the Afrikaner National Front hopefully indicates that there is a significant number of right-wing Afrikaners who want to play a constructive role by negotiating for their people, rather than threatening war all day long."
