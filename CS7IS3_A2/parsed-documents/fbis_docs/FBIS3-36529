This is because it will open a new chapter in the relations between Vietnam and the United States, and it reflects the process of a new international situation since the end of the Cold War. Clinton pointed out that the current decision does not mean complete normalization of relations between the two sides and that there still remains the problem of clarifying the fate of all the missing U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam war. Therefore, a plan is being set up to establish a U.S. liaison office in Hanoi. According to political observers, the lifting of the trade embargo is nothing but an initial measure in the road for achieving complete normalization between Vietnam and the United States. This process itself shows that a lot of time will still be consumed until diplomatic relations are restored. The important thing, however, is that the lifting of the trade embargo was achieved. The door for carrying out trade relations has opened. Hanoi is linking the lifting of the trade embargo with the great hope of introducing U.S. capital. According to Vietnamese economists' estimates, this will make it possible to enhance the role of Vietnam in the current international economic-related system which puts into practice important reforms and strengthens market organizations. The Vietnamese side was successful in changing the position of the Washington administration by consistently overcoming various barriers. For example, the Vietnamese Government carried out much work to clarify the fate of all the missing U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam war and prepared and handed over original documents regarding this matter to the U.S. side. The U.S. side is willing to conduct future joint searches to finish this task. In a word, Hanoi has shown sincerity, ended the era when bombs and bullets determined the relations between the two countries, and has shown a good intention. Promoting economic relations and commercial cooperation is a top priority. U.S. businessmen who consider the tremendous potential of the Vietnamese market to be good have expressed great interest in the development of working relations between the United States and Vietnam. They were allowed to make preliminary contacts with their Vietnamese counterparts in December 1992. Ten representative offices opened. The U.S. Treasury Department allowed U.S. companies to participate in economic reforms in Vietnam toward the end of last year. It did so under the condition that international capital would be introduced. All the obstacles that had existed for 30 years have been removed. Hanoi is not alone in welcoming the lifting of the economic embargo against Vietnam: Moscow, Beijing, and capitals of other countries of the world welcome the lifting of the embargo, saying that this is an example of a sound way of thinking and an affirmative measure for the future stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.
