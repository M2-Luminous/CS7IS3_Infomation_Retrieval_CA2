The British warship Sir Geraint, anchored in the Split port on 21 January, and completed customs procedures in possession of valid documents. However, during the regular customs inspection, the customs officers discovered an irregularity -- namely, one of the eight registered containers, declared as dangerous cargo, contained, instead of registered gas and petrol, a large amount of ammunition of various calibres, military equipment, hand grenades, and 43 boxes with 14 kg of explosives each. As is the regular procedure according to Croatian regulations, which are in line with international laws, a commission will be formed to estimate the value of the illegal cargo. Criminal charges will be brought against the ship commander, while the illegally imported container, already been stored in the customs warehouse in Split, will be confiscated.
