FBIS TRENDS-29APR94-HUNGARY Election: Socialists Lead But Face Coalition Problems SUMMARY Leading in all the major polls on the eve of the May parliamentary election, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) is apparently poised to make a remarkable comeback despite its liabilities as the successor of the former ruling communist party's reformist wing. Since the party is expected to fall short of an absolute majority and lacks close allies, however, it is by no means certain that it will lead the new government coalition. END SUMMARY All recent polls indicate that the MSZP, whose popularity has climbed considerably over the past year, is the strongest party going into the 8 May election and will emerge as the victor after the second round of balloting on 29 May. According to a Hungarian Gallup Institute poll, based on data collected the middle of March, of those who indicate a party preference--29 percent are undecided--31 percent would vote for the MSZP, four percent more than in the previous month (Magyar Hirlap, 5 April). Two other major public opinion research organizations, polling those who say they are "certain" to vote, also put the MSZP in first place. According to the Szonda Ipsos organization's March findings, 23 percent of those "certain" to vote choose the MSZP (Magyar Hirlap, 25 March), while the Median organization's March data show that in the same category, the MSZP has the support of 21 percent (Heti Vilaggazdasag, 2 April). While none of these polls give the MSZP an overwhelming lead, their data tend to confirm that the party has a clear advantage over its nearest competitors. All three polling organizations indicate that the two liberal parties, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) and the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz) are running neck and neck, well behind the MSZP: -- According to Gallup, among those who have a party preference, Fidesz has 15 percent support and the SZDSZ 14 percent (as opposed to the MSZP's 31 percent). -- According to Szonda Ipsos, Fidesz and SZDSZ each have 10 percent support among those who are "certain" to vote (compared to the MSZP's 23 percent). -- According to Median, the SZDSZ and Fidesz have 11 and 9 percent support respectively among the "certain" voters (compared to 21 percent for the MSZP). The big loser appears to be the main party in the present governing coalition, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). The three polling organizations are virtually unanimous in reporting drastically decreased support for the MDF--which in 1990 got close to 25 percent of the vote in the first election round and ended up with 42 percent of the parliamentary seats--with Gallup giving the MDF 10 percent, Szonda Ipsos 9, and Median 7. Two other parties are given a good chance of reaching the 5 percent threshold necessary for entering parliament: the Independent Smallholders Party (FKGP) and the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP). Polling Reliability Although polling agencies in Hungary did not forecast the decisive victory of the MDF in the second round of balloting in 1990, they were fairly successful in assessing the parties' relative standing prior to the vote. According to a table in the 14 December 1993 issue of the weekly 168 Ora, the major polling organizations operating then--Gallup, Median, and the Public Opinion Research Institute (a now defunct organization, many of whose leading personnel currently work for Szonda Ipsos)--all correctly identified the MDF and the SZDSZ as the leading contenders, all correctly predicted that the MSZP would be soundly defeated, and all correctly predicted that Fidesz and the KDNP, along with the MSZP, would be the smallest parliamentary parties. Even discounting probable improvements in polling procedures since then, it is likely that the pollsters are now at least roughly accurate in gauging the parties' relative strength. Moderate Spectrum While the alignment of parties in the new government is expected to change, the new parliament will comprise essentially the same parties that were voted into office in 1990. With the possible exception of the Smallholders, an agrarian party that has tended to be fractious and unpredictable, all the parties that have a good chance of gaining entry to parliament fall into a relatively narrow political spectrum, all advocating integration with the West and privatization, despite their bitter debates over the process and pace of change. The polls all indicate that extremist parties such as the far right Hungarian Justice and Life Party of Istvan Csurka or the far left Hungarian Workers Party--the remnant of the Kadarist Communist party--are unlikely to surmount the five percent threshold for entry to parliament, although Magyar Hirlap noted on 21 January that Csurka may have some "hidden" support that goes beyond the "less than one percent" registered by Szonda Ipsos. According to the polls, the only minor parties that have some chance of gaining enough votes to enter parliament are the Entrepreneurs Party, the Republic Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Agrarian Federation- -all moderate parties close to the political center. Coalition Scenarios Although the MSZP will probably have considerably more parliamentary seats after the election than the next largest party, it is highly unlikely to have a majority and will almost certainly face serious problems when it tries to form a government, because it has no natural allies among the other parties. It is quite possible, as a journalist noted in the 20 April issue of the centrist daily Magyar Hirlap, that the socialists, the liberals, and the parties of the present right- of-center coalition will each have one third of the seats, creating a situation in which "it will be difficult to form" any government. Since it would be virtually impossible for the MSZP and the MDF to bridge their differences--Horn said that it would be "equivalent to deceiving the electors" if the MSZP formed a coalition with the MDF (Nepszabadsag, 1 April), while Prime Minister and MDF leader Peter Boross has said that his party would "by no means" form a coalition with the MSZP (MTI, 13 April)--the formation of a governing coalition would seem to depend on the willingness of the liberals to cooperate with either the left or the right. Even though a left-liberal or a right-liberal coalition appears to be the most likely outcome, forming either coalition will be a difficult feat: MSZP-SZDSZ-Fidesz The party that is most likely to enter a coalition with the MSZP is the SZDSZ, but it is certain to drive a hard bargain. Aware of its difficult position, the MSZP has indicated that it is prepared to make major concessions to the SZDSZ, possibly even giving up the post of prime minister. Asserting that his party does not rule out supporting SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate Gabor Kuncze after the election, MSZP chairman Horn has said that it is "not a key issue" for his party "that the leader of the new cabinet should come from the MSZP" (Magyar Hirlap, 5 January). Recently, prominent MSZP economic expert Laszlo Bekesi also indicated that his party "does not exclude" supporting a prime minister "from outside the party." Calling Kuncze "an excellent person," Bekesi said that he saw no objection to Kuncze as prime minister (168 Ora, 19 April). However, the MSZP and SZDSZ may not by themselves win a majority of the parliamentary seats, which they would need to form a government. Moreover, the SZDSZ has indicated that being given the post of prime minister would not, by itself, be enough to draw it into the coalition as a junior partner. Signaling a hardening of the SZDSZ's position, at a press conference on 1 April SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar "stressed" that the SZDSZ would take part "only in a coalition that has a liberal majority" (Magyar Hirlap, 2 April). As long as the SZDSZ insists on a liberal majority in the coalition, Fidesz, the other main liberal party, could be in a position to make or break a socialist-liberal coalition, even if the MSZP and SZDSZ alone could form a majority government. Except in the unlikely event that a small centrist party such as the Entrepreneurs Party gets into parliament and helps the MSZP and SZDSZ form a majority, the MSZP's prospects will depend to a great extent on Fidesz--and the top Fidesz leadership is openly hostile to the MSZP. After the wing of Fidesz that tended to pull more to the left went over to the SZDSZ last fall as the result of acrimonious intraparty struggles, Fidesz chairman Viktor Orban made it increasingly clear that although his party is highly critical of the right of center MDF government, it considers the post-communist left to be less acceptable politically than the right. Orban said in a recent interview that it would be "impossible" for his party to join a coalition with the MSZP because the Hungarian public would "not forgive" the SZDSZ and Fidesz, which were the "most radical anti-communist parties" four years ago, for abandoning their principles. Responding to the interviewer's comment that there is a "war of messages" between him and MSZP chairman Gyula Horn--whom Orban holds to account for taking part in the armed suppression of the 1956 anti-communist uprising--Orban accused the MSZP of threatening to take "revenge" on "everyone, especially us." At the same time, Orban acknowledged that there is some "difference" between him and one faction of Fidesz regarding cooperation with the MSZP (Magyar Hirlap, 20 April), suggesting that he may be under pressure to consider entering a coalition with the socialists if the liberals gain significant concessions. SZDSZ-MDF-Fidesz-KDNP Although there is deep animosity between the SZDSZ and the MDF, they still might join forces against the MSZP. With the rise in the MSZP's popularity, the MDF has reluctantly come to the conclusion that the SZDSZ is the lesser of two evils. Contradicting an earlier statement by MDF spokesman Karoly Herenyi that the MDF would not join a coalition with either the MSZP or the SZDSZ "under any circumstances" (Magyar Nemzet, 28 December 1993), MDF parliamentary group chief Ferenc Kulin said that a coalition of the two liberal and two conservative parties is "possible" (Magyar Nemzet, 14 January). Moreover, Prime Minister and MDF leader Peter Boross recently made a distinction between his party's two main rivals, saying that while he has "serious reservations" about the SZDSZ, he does not reject it outright as a prospective coalition partner as he does the MSZP (MTI, 13 April). For its part the SZDSZ has not declared that it is willing to cooperate with the MDF, but it appears ready to consider alternatives to the socialists. Prime ministerial candidate Gabor Kuncze acknowledged in the April issue of the monthly Kritika that the SZDSZ has "reservations" about the MSZP, saying that his party is concerned that the MSZP's close ties to the powerful trade unions would undermine economic reform and that MSZP rule would encourage the "dangerous" spirit of "revenge" that has developed among former communists. While it is unlikely that the MDF and SZDSZ alone would gain enough seats in parliament to form a government, if they managed to come to terms with each other they would probably be able to draw Fidesz and the KDNP into a liberal-right coalition. Although Defense Minister and MDF chairman Lajos Fur has complained that Fidesz speaks "lightly" of the MDF, making it difficult to find a "basis for cooperation" (Magyar Hirlap, 20 April), both Fidesz and the MDF have indicated that they are striving to overcome their distaste for each other in the interest of cooperating against the left. Similarly, although the KDNP has recently tried to "distance itself" from the MDF (Magyar Hirlap, 19 March) and has balked at the MDF's attempts to speed up privatization, for the most part the KDNP has been a reliable coalition partner of the MDF and shares many of its policy positions, making it highly probable that MDF-KDNP cooperation will continue. Implications It is entirely possible that the MSZP will not lead the next Hungarian government, even if it wins the election. Although strains between the SZDSZ and Fidesz--caused mainly by disagreement over whether the liberals should be closer to the left or the right--have weakened the liberals, if they manage to draw together they may well be in a position to determine whether Hungary's next government is a left-liberal or right-liberal coalition. Because the SZDSZ is likely to emerge as the stronger liberal party in the elections--polls show that SZDSZ supporters are more likely to vote than supporters of Fidesz (Magyar Hirlap, 5 April) and that fewer voters reject the SZDSZ completely (Heti Vilaggazdasag, 2 April)--it may end up with the post of prime minister in either a left-liberal or right-liberal scenario. Although the MDF would be less likely than the socialists to give up the post of prime minister in the interest of forming a viable coalition, it might yield if SZDSZ moderates, supported by Fidesz, are persuasive in urging anti-left cooperation. In any case, SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate Gabor Kuncze appears to be well suited to conducting his party's negotiations with either the left or right. The pro-MDF paper Pesti Hirlap (16-17 April) has said that Kuncze was chosen by the SZDSZ as its candidate because he is a "presentable and even likable person in the center who can be accepted by the country's public," suggesting that he may have considerable strength as a conciliator. It is far from certain, however, that he-- or anyone else--will be able to hold together Hungary's next governing coalition, which is likely to include far more disparate political elements than the present government.
