Nesvizhskiy: "Tallinn and Moscow Argue About the Border"] [Text] Residents of Pechora Region obtaining Estonian passports Debates about state ownership of Pechora Region, transferred in 1944 to the RSFSR [Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic], have been going on since the proclamation of independence by neighboring Estonia. Not recognizing "Stalinist" boundaries, the Estonian side continues to refer to "the only internationally recognized document"--the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920, in accordance with which Pechora Region was part of Estonia. Russia, naturally, prefers to proceed from current administrative borders, gradually transforming them into state borders, and refers to the will of the current population of the region, renewed by 90 percent in recent years. For Russia today it is the state border here, while Estonia stubbornly adheres to the term "control line" with regard to it, at the same time the boundary designation remains in the stage of "informal transparency." "The border essentially exists for the transportation flow, and if I should want to by-pass the border check point, I can enter Estonia without any difficulties," Vitaliy Kustov, deputy chief of administration of Pechora Region, admitted to the SEGODNYA correspondent in the course of an interview. The problem lies not so much in the shortage of border guards (of which, as commonly known, there is an abundance in Russia) as in the complicated nature of the present-day border which is yet to be demarcated. A couple of weeks ago Estonian border guards detained several Russian loggers on territory which they sincerely believed to be Estonian. Some 850 meters of a road linking the Estonian villages of Vyarsk and Sats belong to Russia, which established two check points there with two armed guards at each one, while the road home from the Russian island of Kolpino lies through Estonian territory. During summer exchanges of "detained foreigners," consisting of mushroom pickers and children who wandered into the neighboring country, are conducted by border guards at the check points. After transfer of the region to RSFSR a major part of the indigenous population (before the war there was approximately an equal number of Russians and Estonians in Pechora) moved to Estonia. Those left were mainly old people with children or relatives in Estonia. By contrast with the northern segment of the border, where residents of Narva and Ivangorod on the border received passes, there is nothing like that in Pechora and many found themselves in a difficult situation. A solution was swiftly suggested "from the other side": in accordance with Estonian law residents of the republic born prior to 1940 (within the old borders that included Pechora Region) as well as their descendants are Estonian citizens and eligible to receive an Estonian passport. A special Pechora branch of the Department of Estonian Citizenship was opened in the border Estonian village of Vyarsk, where residents of the region are issued Estonian passports. According to Vitaliy Kustov around 1,000 Pechora Region residents, both Estonians and Russians, have already obtained them. It is, however, impossible to cite an exact figure since there is no dual citizenship treaty between Russia and Estonia and holders of the passport with three lions prefer not to advertise their foreign document. Estonians in turn also refuse to submit lists of their citizens in Pechora. As reported by Juri Vaidla, chief of "the Department of Citizenship of the Pechora Region of Estonia," to a SEGODNYA correspondent, the lists are so highly classified that even the authorities cannot always gain access to them: "We fear repressions against those people in Pechora, and the lists may be obtained by only one person in Tallinn--the minister of internal affairs of Estonia." The same may be heard from others as well. Citizens receive Estonian passports as a matter of course thanks to the "wise" policy of Pechora authorities which do not allow even those to go abroad whom the Estonians are prepared to admit. Estonian entry visas for some reason are specifically checked by our side (for the Estonians it is sufficient for a passport to show Pechora Region as the birthplace). The latest innovation of the local administration differs little from the previous ones. The Pechora Railway Station, where those wishing to visit their neighbors are required to disembark in accordance with decree No. 48 of the regional administration, has been declared a control zone. Russian NTV television company personnel were not admitted there with the explanation that their Tallinn colleagues had spent two hours in a militia station for attempting to disembark at the railway station with a television camera. "Pechora leadership is aiming to cut itself off from the neighbors with a stone wall"--says a Russian woman from the island of Kolpino, who arrived in Vyarsk for a passport. "We are simply unable to travel to St. Petersburg each time for a visa." Meanwhile Pechora Region land is now being claimed not only by Pechora residents: on the eve of a new round of Russo-Estonian negotiations there was a meeting of "owners of land in Pechora Region" in Vyarsk last Saturday. In accordance with Estonian laws all property confiscated in the years of Soviet power must be returned to them. "If Russia is not prepared to recognize our jurisdiction over Pechora, let it at least recognize the rights of the heirs," Jaak Herodes, deputy of the State Assembly of Estonia, declared. In any case the issue concerning return of property to the heirs will be placed on the agenda of Russo-Estonian negotiations in the very near future. We do not divide by nationality--Estonian, Russian, or Jew: all these people are citizens of Estonia and it is obliged to protect their rights." He believes that issuance of Estonian passports will help residents of Pechora Region to avoid problems even if only with the Estonian side. Many of his colleagues, however, have a more radical view: Ein Tarto, deputy of the State Assembly of Estonia from the ruling Isamaa [Fatherland] coalition party, who arrived in Vyarsk, is confident that Russia will sooner or later return Pechora Region to the republic. Judging by everything the growing number of Estonian citizens in the disputed region may become a trump card for Tallinn. If Estonia refuses to participate in the determination of a new border, the Russian side will designate the border in a unilateral manner. But according to Russian law a state border is established on the basis of bilateral agreements, and Estonia, armed with the Tartu Treaty of 1920, will hardly agree to sign a new one. The territorial dispute promises to be endless.
