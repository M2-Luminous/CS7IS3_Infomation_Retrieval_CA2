Traders estimate at least 500,000 tonnes (4.4 million barrels) of fuel oil arrived in the country in May alone and a similar amount is expected this month. The state-owned giant, Unipec, which distributes oil products, including diesel and petrol, is one of the key importers along with independent traders, according to Hong Kong analysts and traders. Mainland authorities decreed a two-month ban on imports of oil and petroleum at the start of May in a bid to reimpose central control on the sector and push down rising inflationary pressures. The key area of concern was a growing number of independent operators importing oil products for speculative purposes and selling it at vastly inflated prices. But the ban aimed at choking off these independent oil traders, appears to be regularly flouted by the state companies, independents and some large multinational oil companies with a steady flow of products still reaching the mainland. "Originally, small lots (of diesel) were transported in barges up the Pearl River," one source said. "But last week we heard of consignments of 10,000-20,000 metric tonnes being ordered. The larger quantities will probably be supplied by the majors." Traders at several independent Hong Kong-based companies estimate that up to 40,000 tonnes of diesel alone entered China since the curb was imposed. The most common method used by independent companies to import crude products without official permission is to persuade port officials to turn a blind eye to the landing of a shipment. "In China, as in some other Third World countries, a job at a customs posts is given out as a reward with tacit approval for any extra income the official may be able to manage," said a respected shipping commentator. Shipments which are taken by pipeline to storage beyond port boundaries do not have to be declared as having been landed at the port. There are only a few ports in southern China where this is possible, the chief ones being Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ningbo, Xiamen, Maoming and Zhanjiang. All these ports are capable of accommodating oil tankers, and have extensive storage facilities. Major international oil companies and the Hong Kong-based independent companies supply the booming industries in the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) on China's southern coast, which rely on diesel to power their generators. Both groups say diesel sales are increasing with most current Chinese requirements planned for June delivery. But why is Unipec ignoring the government ban? In a word, expediency. "It seems there are exceptions to the ban," said one source. "If a company in, say, Guangzhou, can demonstrate that it has a requirement, the Government might say `sure, go ahead'." This is happening at the same time that Beijing maintains domestic stocks of these products are already high, and that importing them is a serious drain on the country's foreign exchange. Stocks in the north of the country -- where oil is produced -- do seem to be high, but the demand is in the south and the infrastructure is too poor to transport it efficiently. In any case, domestic production cannot match supply, and the Government relies on the industries in southern China to generate foreign exchange. Imports of oil and products -- which only began last year when burgeoning private enterprise increased domestic demand many times over -- have played a large part in China's alarming 1993 US$12.25 billion (about HK$94.5 billion) trade deficit. Last year, for the first time, China became a net importer of oil and products. About 10 per cent of the 1.1 billion barrels processed nationwide was bought on the spot market, mostly from Australia and West Africa. This proportion is forecast to rise dramatically this year. The Government has entered long-term agreements with Middle East states and is considering doing the same with Brunei. In 1992, Sinochem -- China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation -- exported 20.87 million tonnes of crude oil, and 4.28 million tonnes of oil products. In 1993, exports of oil and products were virtually nil; imports of crude oil were 14 million metric tonnes, and imports of products totalled 11 million metric tonnes. China's official imports of diesel in 1993 are put at 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes per month. Increased imports are not entirely bad news for the exchequer, however. On May 7 this year Beijing set new ceilings for prices of domestic crude, diesel and petrol -- 900 yuan, 1,900 yuan and 2,430 yuan respectively -- virtually doubling the existing prices and thereby bringing them closer to world spot market prices. These prices allow the Government to buy on the international spot market, add various taxes and then sell the products on the domestic market at the new prices. A Singapore-based trader said the current ban on imports was aimed at the 200 to 300 independent Chinese companies that had been importing shipments which they sold for big profits and which had contributed to inflation. The first real casualties of the current ban seem to be the major oil companies hoping for a foothold in the Chinese market. Beijing would like to limit the operations of foreign companies, and the companies see the current ban as the latest in a long list of difficulties they have to deal with. Recent reports have outlined several reasons why these firms find dealing with the mainland "a nightmare" and concluded by saying that the "gifts" required by bureaucrats are growing and therefore eating into profits. Oil companies were quoted as "having taken enough". Other problems include import bans, reneging on contracts, price ceilings which have slashed profits and constantly changing official policy. Privately, many companies have also complained about the preferential treatment accorded to certain joint ventures and companies. Analysts say the Chinese energy sector needs the raw materials, cash, expertise and technology that Western companies can provide, but Beijing is obviously determined to have the upper hand in all dealings. "The Chinese have a different attitude to doing business," said one source. "Western companies regard the signing for a contract as the end of a process; the Chinese regard it as a beginning. "This used to trouble me, but I have grown to accept it now; it is the only way to continue doing business." The agency report, however, makes it clear that the major companies have run out of patience, as some of them find their best efforts in China are resulting in losses instead of the expected profits. At least three majors are engaged in lawsuits worth more than US$1 million each against a Chinese company that failed to honour spot deals. Perhaps one should give Beijing the benefit of the doubt and accept that the Western oil companies are incidental casualties; after all, the Government's intention is to drive Chinese independent companies out of business. According to a document to be published soon, Beijing intends to buy up or close down these companies. Spokesmen from Sinopec and Unipec admit that independent traders have succeeded in landing imports despite the previous and current ban. The officials, who asked not to be named, said that only small quantities of oil and products were involved, and that the Government was not greatly concerned about the problem. The official view of the quantities concerned may well be correct, but even if it does not make a significant impact on the overall economy, it shows Beijing has less control of the sector than it would like. "The Government may issue directives," said another Singapore-based trader, "but whether they will be carried out is another matter; connections play a very large part in getting business done in China." What are the prospects of success for the Government? "Hard to say; I don't know enough about the mechanics of imposing government wishes. But I think that if the Government can't exercise more control over the energy sector they might as well pack up," said the trader. Analysts say China's economic growth requires the finance and expertise of foreign oil companies, and pulling out of the country now would be foolhardy. The troubled state of the domestic industry was highlighted two weeks ago when the Huabei oil field near Beijing closed 21 inefficient wells and decided to run another 34 only intermittently to save money. China currently produces 1.2 million barrels per day of the low- grade Daqing oil from Heilongjiang Province, and 600,000 barrels per day of slightly higher-grade Shengli from Shandong. This is about 142 million tonnes annually. Offshore output is expected to be 5.5 million tonnes this year. On May 18, Beijing announced it had set aside 24 blocks of land covering 294,00 square kilometres for oil exploration by domestic companies. Two days later it opened 13 areas covering 40,000 sq km in the South China Sea for offshore exploration by foreign companies. It was the first time China had invited bids through acreage promotion, and the move was prompted by a lack of funding and inadequate technology. Exploration, however, is a notoriously long-term and uncertain operation.
