The Declaration asks the international community that they [the Serbian citizens] be included in negotiations on the integral peace solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite the fact that many assessments consider that the Congress should have been organized at a much earlier date, this assembly in Sarajevo marks the process of differentiation and a national awakening of the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It shows that this process is not deadlocked and it raises to the surface the question of whether the national feeling of the Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina will take the form of the Bosnian Serbs journeying to a civic society. Yesterday's Congress in Sarajevo answers this question. This Congress was the matriculation examination for the Serbs who live in Bosnia-Herzegovina, their "No" to fascism, primitivism, and national socialism. What had been halted by force and ideology -- as was evident at yesterday's Congress of the Serbian People in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- has come out of the shadows and offered light in place of darkness and truth in place of lies. It has also shown a tie to the Bosnian land and the desire to live with all the other peoples. Karadzic's grim ideology, an ideology of darkness, murder, massacre, expulsion, national socialism, was unmasked at the Sarajevo Congress, and the [word indistinct] that he represents all the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina was taken away from him. With this, the Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina have lifted to the level of reality their chance not to live at the tail of events, but to move on toward Europe, toward a civic society. The personal feeling of belonging to an ethnic identity must certainly be respected, and it will be. That is why we need to differentiate both in alphabet and speech. The right to be called Bosnian Serbs belongs to that part of the Serbian people that yesterday clearly expressed its political position. To put it as nicely as one of the participants in the Congress of Serbian People in Bosnia-Herzegovina put it: Karadzic can probably represent only that part of the people that voted for him and that unreservedly support him, or -- more precisely -- the chetnik part, the part that sees the chetnik ideology as its own. This ideology has always ended up on the garbage heap of history. Of course, yesterday's Congress in Sarajevo did not appeal to the [word indistinct] factory of lies. A commentary speaks about passers-by that were picked up off the street. However, in the name of truth, the Serbian people -- those who may have been unable to see this gathering -- need to be told that the following people actively participated and were present in the congress hall: Ljubomir Berberovic, Tihomir Berberovic, lawyer Zarko Bulic, Miro Lazovic [B-H Assembly chairman], [Presidency member] Tatjana Ljujic-Mijatovic, [Presidency member] Mirko Pejanovic, Dragutin Braco Kosovac, Mico Rakic, Nikola Kovac, Nada Mladina, Gavrilo Grahovac, Goran Simic, and Zivko Babic. Every Serb, regardless of where he lives, is probably aware that Dragutin Braco Kosovac, Mico Rakic, and Ljubomir Berberovic have far more distinguished reputations than the criminals Karadzic, Koljevic, and Krajisnik. Theories that advocate the existence of (?worthless) peoples and states are wrong. Yesterday's Congress of the citizens of Serbian nationality struck a blow to Karadzic's theory of the impossibility of joint existence and his primitive nationalism, and this blow will send it to where it belongs -- the garbage heap of history.
