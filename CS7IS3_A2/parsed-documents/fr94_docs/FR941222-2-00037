FR941222-2-00037 FR941222-2-00031 Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy Implementation of Special Refund Procedures Names of Firms: Ed's Exxon; Ron's Shell Date of Filing: July 20, 1993 Case Numbers: LEF&hyph;0078; LEF&hyph;0084 On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute the funds received pursuant to Remedial Orders issued by the DOE to Ed's Exxon of Cotati, California, and Ron's Shell of Danville, California (hereinafter jointly referred to as the remedial order firms). In accordance with the provisions of the procedural regulations at 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of regulatory violations set forth in the Remedial Order. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds. I. Background Each of the remedial order firms was a retailer of motor gasoline during the periods relevant to this proceeding. The ERA issued Proposed Remedial Orders (PROs) to each of the firms. 1 The PROs alleged that, during separate periods beginning on August 1, 1979, the remedial order firms had: charged more than the maximum lawful selling price for one or more grades of gasoline in violation of 10 C.F.R. 212.93; failed to post and maintain the maximum lawful selling price or a proper certification in violation of 10 C.F.R. 212.129; failed to keep and maintain books and records to support the lawfulness of the price for gasoline on the audit date in violation of 10 C.F.R. 210.92 and 212.93; and/or engaged in unlawful or discriminatory business practices in violation of 10 C.F.R. 210.62. 1 Ed's Exxon was issued a PRO on January 25, 1980; Ron's Shell was issued a PRO on December 31, 1980. After considering and dismissing the firms' objections to the PROs, the DOE issued final Remedial Orders. Ed's Exxon, 8 DOE ¶83,035 (1981); Alameda Chevron Service, et al., 9 DOE ¶83,027 (1982). 2 Each of the firms has since remitted a specified amount in compliance with the Remedial Orders, to which interest has since accrued. These funds are being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution. 2 A Remedial Order was issued to Ed's Exxon on September 30, 1981. A Remedial Order was issued to Ron's Shell on April 27, 1982. II. Jurisdiction and Authority The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan of distribution of funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. 4501 et seq., Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981), and Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981) ( Vickers ). We have considered the ERA's petition that we implement Subpart V proceedings with respect to the above remedial order funds and have determined that such proceedings are appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute these funds. Before taking the actions proposed in this Decision, we intend to publicize our proposal and solicit comments from interested parties. Comments regarding the tentative distribution processes set forth in this Proposed Decision and Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publication in the Federal Register . III. Proposed Refund Procedures We propose to implement a two-stage refund procedure for distribution of the remedial order funds, by which purchasers of gasoline from the remedial order firms during the period covered by the Remedial Orders may submit Applications for Refund in the initial stage. From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants generally will be limited to ultimate consumers (``end-users''). Therefore, we do not anticipate that it will be necessary to employ the injury presumptions that we have used in past proceedings in evaluating applications submitted by refiners, resellers, and retailers. 3 3 If a refiner, reseller, or retailer should file an application in any of the refund proceedings, however, we will utilize the standards and appropriate presumptions established in previous proceedings. See, e.g., Starks Shell Service, 23 DOE ¶85,017 (1993); Shell Oil Co., 18 DOE ¶85,492 (1989). A. First Stage Refund Procedures. In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submit a schedule of its monthly purchases of gasoline from the remedial order firm during the period covered by the Remedial Order. Our experience indicates that the use of certain presumptions permits claimants to participate in the refund process without incurring inordinate expense and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficient manner possible. See Marathon Petroleum Co., 14 DOE ¶85,269 (1986) ( Marathon ). Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorized by the applicable Subpart V regulations at 10 C.F.R. §205.282(e). Accordingly, we propose to adopt the presumptions set forth below. 1. Calculation of Refunds. First, we will adopt a presumption that the overcharges were dispersed equally in all of the remedial order firms' sales of gasoline during the period covered by the Remedial Orders. In accordance with this presumption, refunds will be made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis. 4 In the absence of better information, a volumetric refund is appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices. 4 If an individual claimant believes that it was injured by more than its volumetric share, it may elect to forego this presumption and file a refund application based upon a claim that it suffered a disproportionate share of the remedial firm's overcharges. See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp./Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co., 20 DOE ¶85,788 (1990); Mobil Oil Corp./Marine Corps Exchange Service, 17 DOE ¶85,714 (1988). Such a claim will only be granted if the claimant makes a persuasive showing that it was ``overcharged'' by a specific amount, and that it absorbed those overcharges. See Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co./Western Petroleum Co., 19 DOE ¶85,705 (1989). To the degree that a claimant makes this showing, it will receive an above-volumetric refund. Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of a Remedial Order fund is equal to the number of gallons purchased from the remedial order firm during the period covered by that Remedial Order times the per gallon refund amount. 5 We derived the per gallon refund figures by dividing the amount of each Remedial Order fund by the total volume of gasoline which each remedial order firm sold during the period specified in that Remedial Order. An applicant that establishes its eligibility for a refund will receive all or a portion of its allocable share plus a pro-rata share of the accrued interest. 6 5 The per gallon refund amount is $0.0251 for claimants applying in the Ed's Exxon proceeding ($2,500 remitted/99,651 gallons sold), $0.0072 in the Ron's Shell proceeding ($1,157.84 remitted/160,777.9 gallons sold). 6 As in previous cases, we will establish a minimum refund amount of $15. We have found through our experience that the cost of processing claims in which refunds for amounts less than $15 are sought outweighs the benefits of restitution in those instances. See Exxon Corp., 17 DOE ¶85,590, at 89,150 (1988) ( Exxon ). In addition to the volumetric presumption, we will adopt a presumption regarding injury for end-users. 2. End-Users. In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we will adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumer of gasoline purchased from one of the remedial order firms whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the overcharges resolved by the Remedial Order. See, e.g., Texas Oil and Gas Corp., 12 DOE ¶85,069 at 88,209 (1984) ( TOGCO ). Members of this group generally were not subject to price controls during the period covered by the Remedial Order, and were not required to keep records which justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysis of the impact of the overcharges on the final prices of goods and services produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. Id. End-users of gasoline purchased from the remedial order firms need only document their purchase volumes from the firm during the period covered by the Remedial Order to make a sufficient showing that they were injured by the overcharges. B. Refund Applications Filed by Representatives. We will adopt the standard OHA procedures relating to refund applications filed on behalf of applicants by ``representatives,'' including refund filing services, consulting firms, accountants, and attorneys. See, e.g., Starks Shell Service, 23 DOE ¶85,017 (1993); Texaco Inc., 20 DOE ¶85,147 (1990); Shell Oil Co., 18 DOE ¶85,492 (1989). We will also require strict compliance with the filing requirements as specified in 10 C.F.R. §205.283, particularly the requirement that applications and the accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant. The OHA reiterates its policy to scrutinize applications filed by filing services closely. Applications submitted by a filing service should contain all of the information indicated in the final Decision and Order in this proceeding. D. Distribution of Funds Remaining After First Stage. We propose that any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and any funds in the Remedial Order funds that the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA. It Is Therefore Ordered That: The payments remitted to the Department of Energy by Ed's Exxon and Ron's Shell pursuant to the Remedial Orders dated September 30, 1981 and April 27, 1982 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.
