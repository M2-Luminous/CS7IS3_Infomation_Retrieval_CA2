FR941028-0-00061 FR941028-0-00009 Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed §773.23 would have required that the regulatory authority not approve the permit application unless and until it determined that all ownership or control links between the applicant and any person cited in a violation notice were erroneous or had been rebutted, or the regulatory authority determined that the violation to which the applicant had been linked had been corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) or the State program equivalent. The determinations to be made by the regulatory authority under paragraph (b)(2) of the proposed regulation were to have been made in accordance with the provisions of proposed §773.24, procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS, and proposed §773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, or their State program equivalents. Paragraph (c) of proposed §773.23 would have required that, following the regulatory authority's decision on the application or following the applicant's withdrawal of the application, the regulatory authority be required to promptly enter all relevant information related to the decision or withdrawal into AVS. The regulatory authority's decision could have included unconditional issuance, conditional issuance, or denial of the permit. The requirement that all relevant information be promptly entered into AVS was intended to insure that AVS was continually updated to reflect the most current information available with respect to permit applicants. A critical source of such information would be the regulatory authority. Commenters representing members of the coal industry criticized the provisions of the proposed regulation as being unnecessarily duplicative of the provisions of proposed §773.22 and of 30 CFR 773.15(b). In support of this position, they pointed to the provisions of the proposed regulation which require the review of violation information and ownership or control links to determine whether an application could be approved. They questioned why the requirements of proposed §§773.22 and 773.23 would be imposed as two separate stages, rather than as a single stage of the permit application process under 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). OSM disagrees with the view that the provisions of proposed §§773.22 and 773.23 are duplicative or redundant to each other or with respect to the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Further, OSM does not believe that these provisions should be consolidated with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). While each of the regulatory sections at issue are part of the permit application and review process, the two proposed §§773.22 and 773.23 represent separate tasks for the regulatory authority. In implementing the provisions of proposed §773.22, the regulatory authority would be focusing upon information contained in the permit application and attempting to verify such information by comparing it with other readily available sources of information. The purpose of such activity is to identify complete and accurate information with respect to the application, including identification of the person or persons who will own or control the surface coal mining operation. In implementing the provisions of proposed § 773.23, the regulatory authority takes the information gleaned from its research on the application and then evaluates whether there are any ownership or control links between the applicant and any person cited in a violation notice. In this stage, the focus of inquiry is to determine whether the permit can be approved in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). While both of these stages involve the use of AVS, this does not mean that such stages are redundant or duplicative. The AVS should be consulted throughout the permit application process to assure that the regulatory authority has the most current ownership or control and violation information available from OSM and other State regulatory authorities. The AVS is an evolving information system which is routinely supplemented with new information. The use of AVS in the earlier stage, proposed §773.22, provides an information resource for comparison with application ownership or control information and a basis for inquiry with the applicant. During the later stage, proposed §773.23, the regulatory authority takes previously developed ownership or control information and compares such information with outstanding violation information in deciding whether or not to issue the permit. The use of AVS in this stage enables the regulatory authority to have the benefit of any information which may have been subsequently added to AVS by OSM or other State regulatory authorities.
