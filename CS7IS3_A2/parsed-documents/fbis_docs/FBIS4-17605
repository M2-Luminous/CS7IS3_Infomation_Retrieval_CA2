The delegation's opinion is that this "starting document" infringes the national interests of Azerbaijan. If this plan is adopted as a basis, they argue, the republic would lose control over some more of its territories. The Azerbaijani side expressed bewilderment over the suggested establishment of a number of checkpoints in now non-occupied lands and the zone of combat operations. Similar unacceptable proposals, they assert, are also envisaged for railway sections linking Azerbaijan with Armenia and located far away from the conflict zone. The Azerbaijani parliamentarians are particularly concerned over issues related to the return of tens of thousands of Azerbaijani refugees to Nagorno-Karabakh, which did not find reflection in the new Russian initiatives. While coming out in favour of an immediate cessation of fire and hostilities, they nevertheless believe that talks on a settlement of the conflict should be equal and fair. Lukin's opinion is that the problem is that it is essential to cease fire to resolve the conflict but this does not at all mean that thereby someone demands the Azerbaijani side's recognition that the Russia-suggested plan is ideal and fair in every respect. There are no ideal documents in the world except the holy scriptures and the Koran, Lukin remarked. The State Duma committee chairman is convinced that following a ceasefire it is necessary to sit down at the negotiating table to discuss all contenctions aspects to reflected in the Russian plan concerning in particular the delimitaiton of the conflicting forces and the forthcoming signing of an agreement on the cessation of hostilities. As far as occupied Azerbaijani territories are concerned, they are to be vacated within 40 days in accordance with the suggested time-table, it was stated during the meeting. Lukin said the Russian proposals are of benefit to the Azerbaijani side. These are not just Russian initiatives. They have been elaborated in conjunction with the conference on security and cooperation in Europe. It is difficult to resolve otherwise the problems that have piled up over the years, Lukin emphasised. The development and deepening of economic departments between Russia and Azerbaijan depend in many respects on the cessation of military operations in the region, speakers said during the meeting. On Tuesday the Azerbaijani MPs also met with representatives from various factions of deputies in Russia's State Duma. They are expected to meet with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev on Tuesday afternoon.
