The test conducted by the Del Picchia Institute of Sao Paulo indicated that the sheets had not been prepared one month after the other, as monthly accounting sheets would have been expected to be. The test indicated that they had been prepared recently. Biscaia did not allow an official test to be conducted. He used the documents as evidence in charges that involved bribery with money resulting from the illegal game, drug trafficking, and arms smuggling. Appellate Court Judge Gama Malcher ordered that the documents be tested again.
