Denny] [Text] Umtata March 23 SAPA -- Transkei military leader Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa on Wednesday [23 March] criticised the call-up of part-time SA Defence Force [SADF] members for the election and called for the mobilisation of all forces, including those of the TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] homelands, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] and the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA]. "It is obvious that the decision does not emanate from the (Transitional Executive Council) sub-council on defence, but is a unilateral decision by the government," he said in a statement in Umtata on Wednesday. Gen Holomisa said all forces, "including the TBVC armies, policemen, MK and APLA", should be mobilised for the election to maintain law and order. "The mobilisation of the SADF can only be construed as an attempt by the white establishment to intimidate and con voters into voting for a particular party," he said.
