[Text] The Kazakhs have said: it is easy to get married, difficult to establish a household. We have obtained our sovereignty. Now we must think about becoming a nation and forming a large country which, on a basis of equality and on the same level with all the civilized nations, will be able to express itself politically and produce economically. That is no easy task. To achieve it we must renew our thinking, renew way we organize, and renew the way we carry out our tasks. It is a wonderful thing that all the internal and external policies of the head of the state and of the government are being directed at such objectives, and that ways are being sought for getting out of the crisis through economic reform. It is a good thing that an effort is being made at the presently ongoing session of the Supreme Kenges to look in detail at drafts of laws suggested for the agenda of parliament members, to discuss them carefully, and to look at problems from the point of view of the people. All of this is the result of the freedom and liberation which we have attained. It is a great achievement and a great spiritual victory that the people have gained the right to think about their own affairs, to collect themselves, and to look at the present and the future. The special quality of sovereignty is that our nation has been awakened, that we have returned to our language and our religion, and that we have obtained freedom in regulating our lives and in going about our businesses. It was no secret that, during the time we were under the rule of the former Soviet Union, we had to keep our peace in the face of the disorders of a planned economy, that we were hesitant to oppose it, and that, when we gave a blessing at the head of the table, we were unable to console ourselves and we carried a burden in our hearts. The demands of independence broke those chains once and for all. Now, as is completely obvious, we have taken the economic reins into our own hands, and have acquired power as a result of laws on local self-government. We are revitalizing the important customs and traditions of our nation. This means that no one can slap our hands. What else do we need? We must know how to organize. We must think about efficient ways to achieve this, and we must seek practical means for raising living standards. In any case we cannot say that we have solved all the critical and difficult economic questions, and that we have eliminated all the difficulties plaguing the people during two years. That was not possible. However, it is true that we have accomplished noteworthy things in strengthening the nation and in laying the foundations for tomorrow. Le us take my oblast as an example. When Qyzylorda was once mentioned, the image of rice flashed before peoples' eyes. It is true that the foundation of our economy is rice growing. This is because this was the way it was before. It was decided from above what a given region was to be involved in. Instructions came down from above as to what crops were to be planted and what products produced. This is the value of independence: now we ourselves decide what we need, and how to produce it. This year we obtained an increase of 105 from every hundred adult animals in the oblast and have become one of the leaders. We have harvested 47 centners from every hectare of rice. Likewise, we are undertaking measures to supply the inhabitants of the oblast with local vegetables, fruit, and berry products. At the end of the harvest we had threshed 60,000 tons of golden grain. By way of comparison, this was 100 kilo each for every inhabitant of Qyzylorda, from the crawling baby to the bent old man. All of this, in a word, we understand as the fruit of freedom provided by sovereignty. Everything, in addition to its positive side, has its down side too. We still do not understand the meaning of democratic processes. We are not managing economic reform exactly right, and we have made erroneous decisions restraining energetic development. Difficult days have now begun to be experienced in agriculture. Products are being produced, economic indicators are high, but this is having a limited effect on maintaining living standards. There is disorganization in the pricing system. Wages are becoming worthless, and there is looseness in finances and in banking. There are deficiencies in the policy of social protection. All of this makes any fundamental change in agriculture impossible. We are independent. Whatever the decision, we have the right to take it into our own hands as we see fit and according to circumstances. While this is the case, up to the present we have been unable to liberate ourselves from the lasso of higher powers. Nonetheless, the view has been expressed by those managing the state that we are free to use agricultural surplus for state needs at the rayon and oblast level. In fact this is not so. The reason is that there are licenses and quotas set by the state. We cannot avoid them. Is that freedom? Rather than benefiting by such limitations, which free us on the one hand and tie us up on the other, we are, in my view, being harmed. We have truly gone over to market place relationships. Is it not proper then that we should now be totally free in all ways? To tell the bitter truth, things like trying to solve the agrarian cadre question from a central authority is obstruction of the old type. If we cannot free ourselves from such a stereotyped psychology, it is doubtful that we will be able to strengthen our sovereignty, mobilize local people, and gain their understanding. I think that, while there should be supervision from afar, there is too much direct intervention in [local] administration. No one must have any doubts that managers of a region and local people know best the situation in local areas. There are 32 sovkhozes in our oblast concerned with sheep raising. As I mentioned above, they are among the leaders in raising livestock. Compared to last year, there was little loss and livestock increased. Nonetheless, we must increase the profits of sheep herders and the income of enterprises. However, more specifically, the problem is not this at all. The sheepherders and enterprises achieved such high rates of increase, but ended up at the end of the year with a debt to the state of 2 billion rubles. Likewise, there was no way to repay on time a loan of 20 billion rubles obtained by the government. Why? The reason the loan was late was because of problems arising from failure to take agricultural production costs into account and because of price instability. What must we do now? The 32 sheepraising sovkhozes makeup about half of the state enterprises in our oblast. Should we rely on privatization to break them up? These days there is little to be gained by privatization. For that reason special attention to agriculture must be shown by the government. Nonetheless, it would be no surprise if, under present circumstances, we should choose to deprive ourselves of things which we now have in hand in the blink of an eye. It is no secret, tomorrow some sheepherders (and they are almost all Kazakhs) will be at the limit of their endurance. If we throw away their prop, what will we do then? On the contrary, while we express our thanks to them for looking after themselves and for their work of mercy on behalf of others, are we not forced to consider well-thought-out plans for restoring them morally, materially, and linking their enterprises? Time is both judge and jury. Our present labor at the very beginning of independence will, as time passes, receive appropriate evaluation and be judged. One thing is already clear, the Declaration of Sovereignty, ratified three years ago, opened a new path for Kazakhstan. We have begun to exonerate our history which was for a long time dragged in the dust. We have renewed vanished spiritual riches. We have made a place in the hearts of the masses for the names of our khans, heroes, who guarded our nation in a time of difficulty, and who long ago knew the entire people. One thing should be mentioned in this regard: there have been pronouncements from the mouth of some to the effect that these [anniversary] celebrations are getting out of hand. At a time that is already difficult enough why are we wasting money here and there? In my view this is a sign of limited understanding. In fact, through our celebration of the festival of some hero are we not honoring the spirits of all the people who lived at that time and bowing our heads to all the people who suffered the vissitudes of a time? If our people take examples from the past, what fault is there in that? Whatever nationality a person is, they have a duty to defend their native land. It is fact that the heroism of our ancestors, who did not give in to hostile enemies, who faced them on all sides, is a lesson and a model for us. In short, we have planted seeds in the garden of sovereignty. The roots are now striking deep, and we must struggle for an abundant harvest. The path we have to tread is, in any case, a long one. However, if we travel a distant road, will we not draw close [to our goal]? For that reason we will achieve something by pressing forward without considering the difficulty.
