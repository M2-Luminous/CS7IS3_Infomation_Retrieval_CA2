The government is loath to allow the home visit of Rev. Yi Yong-pin, 68, active in Germany, on the ground that he had engaged in pro-North Korean activities abroad. Yi, an outspoken critic of the past authoritarian regimes, had not been allowed into the country for decades in the past. An official of the "committee for the promotion of Rev. Yi Yong-pin's return home" in Seoul said his committee on Thursday received a notification that the government would not allow Rev. Yi's return home unless he repents in writing of the "seditious activities" he made while visiting North Korea. "The government notification is something unexpected. But, we will go ahead with the plan to have Rev. Yi come to Seoul on April 4," he said. Rev. Yi who went to West Germany in 1955 for study, is noted for his struggles against the authoritarian governments of the past, and also for arranging talks between South and North Korean Christian leaders since early 1980s, in the course of which he visited Pyongyang in 1980.
