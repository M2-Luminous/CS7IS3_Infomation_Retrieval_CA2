Dayrah told AL-HAYAH yesterday that the committee stemmed from a conference called for by the ulema and mosque preachers in Libya during the month of Ramadan. During that conference, four committees were formed to go to Islamic hotbeds of tension to help put an end to Muslim tragedies. "One committee proceeded to Somalia, a second committee went to Bosnia-Herzegovina, a third to the Kurds, and a fourth to Afghanistan." On the reasons for the committee's late arrival, he said that "the U.S. blockade against Libya and visa procedures and complications contributed to the delay." The committee chairman denied the existence of any preconceived plan. He said: "We are judges and we must hear the views of all parties and then give our opinion as to how the problem could be solved." He urged all the factions "not to waste the gains of 14 years of jihad." He added: "We have long-standing relations with the mujahidin. We do not object to mediation by any country for the desired peace. Libya is not a state neighboring Afghanistan. We have no interests there and we do not covet its wealth. All we want is to see peace established there." Informed Afghan sources told AL-HAYAH yesterday that Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar have accepted the Libyan mediation which coincides with the work of other Afghan and non-Afghan committees.
