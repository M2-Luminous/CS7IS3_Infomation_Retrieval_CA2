FR941202-2-00094 FR941202-2-00064 MBS received two comment letters generally supporting the proposed rule change. 9 Both commenters, however, raised concerns regarding MBS's use of message information sent or received by the EPN user. Under the proposed rule change, MBS will have the right to use message information to assist MBS in its operation of the clearing system or EPN service or for other purposes as MBS may determine from time to time. 10 The commenters were concerned that the language of the rule allowed MBS to use sensitive information relating to a firm's proprietary trading which may be contained in EPN messages. In response, MBS stated that it will only use the information contained in EPN messages for internal business purposes and the information will otherwise be confidential. 11 The Commission agrees that the information contained in EPN messages can facilitate MBS's assessment of the volume and concentration of trading done by participants and believes that this, in turn, can help MBS fulfill its safeguarding obligations. 9 Letter from Gregory W. Burnes, Vice President, CS First Boston Corporation, to Dennis Paganucci, MBS (April 25, 1994) and letter from L. LoCosa and S. Mellas, Morgan Stanley, to Lynn Douglas and Dennis Paganucci, MBS (January 10, 1994). 10 MBS Rules, Article VII, Rule 2, Section 8. 11 Telephone conversation between Dennis Paganucci, MBS, and Ari Burstein, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 4, 1994). During the temporary approval period, MBS will continue to test the EPN service and will begin to run the service on a pilot basis. 12 In addition, MBS will create a disaster recovery program for the EPN service in case of emergency and will keep the Commission informed on the progress of the disaster recovery program's development. 12 MBS will inform the Commission by letter when they begin the pilot program. III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, in particular with Section 17A of the Act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 13 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MBS&hyph;94&hyph;02) be, and hereby is, temporarily approved through November 30, 1995. 13 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 14 14 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a) (12).
