FR941212-0-00066 FR941212-0-00018 Classification NMFS has determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, also finds for good cause that the reasons justifying promulgation of this rule on an emergency basis also make it impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide additional notice and opportunity for public comment, or to delay for 30 days the effective date of these emergency regulations, under the provisions of sections 553(b) and (d) of the Administrative Procedure Act. All of the measures have received some public comment during Council meetings and in connection with the development of Amendment 5 or proposed Amendment 7 to the FMP. Implementation of these emergency measures will provide much- needed immediate interim protection to declining multispecies stocks. This emergency rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. This rule is exempt from the procedures of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis because the rule is issued without opportunity for prior public comment. No analysis has been prepared. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 651 Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: December 6, 1994.
