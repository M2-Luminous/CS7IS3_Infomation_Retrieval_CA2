Whether such cooperation can be realized will depend on the British side's attitude and actions. With regard to Hong Kong's economy and Hong Kong people's livelihood, the first thing that requires cooperation is the airport issue. Does the British side actually have sincerity for cooperation? Chris Patten said: "The sincerity the Chinese side talked about meant that the British side had to completely comply with the Chinese side's idea." He tried to mislead Hong Kong people and this showed an irresponsible attitude. The attitude of the Chinese side is open and above board. The Chinese side holds that if there are agreements between the Chinese side and the British side, things should be done in accordance with the agreements. China has never required the British side to act in compliance with the Chinese side's ideas. The agreements were reached by the two sides on the basis of equality, mutual accommodation, and complete willingness. Acting according to the agreements does not mean that the British side has to be obedient to the Chinese side; instead, this just means that the British side should respect and abide by its own promises and should keep good faith. China and Britain signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport in 1991 and both sides agreed that the new airport should be constructed at low cost and should achieve high economic efficiency. "The Hong Kong Government is responsible for the 10 key projects related to the new airport" and "will not leave any financial burdens for the Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government." "The Hong Kong Government will hold HK$25 billion as financial reserves for the SAR Government" and "will consult the Chinese Government if it needs to contract loans over HK$5 billion." All this was the solemn agreement on which neither side can go back. The British side signed the agreement in 1991 but, after that, it has continued to distort and negate the provisions it did not like. Did it not just regard the agreement as a mere scrap of paper? In such circumstances, China must resolutely safeguard the agreement. As a matter of fact, the Memorandum of Understanding did not include any concrete financial package. In 1991, Anson Chan openly announced that the British Hong Kong Government had sufficient financial capacity for the new airport projects. If that was the case, since the memorandum had been signed, the British side should have been able to start the projects in full scale and there should not have been any more trouble. However, the British side did not really want to act according to the memorandum. It required the Chinese side to provide a guarantee for over HK$5 billion of debt and required that talks be held on its financial package. Why did the British side insist on holding further talks? It just tried to gain the Chinese side's endorsement in order to contract loans from the private financial institutions. Because the loans will be repaid after 1997 and after the withdrawal of the British people and Hong Kong will then be a SAR of China, without the Chinese Government's guarantee, the financial syndicates are not willing to arrange the loans. The first financial package dished out by the Hong Kong Government included HK$73 billion of "callable equity." The second financial package included HK$45 billion in loans. The third financial package included HK$28 billion in debts. The fourth financial package included HK$23 billion in debts and mentioned that the debts owed by the Temporary Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation would not be included in the debts limited by the memorandum of understanding as they did not require Hong Kong Government guarantees. Therefore, there were many questionable and vague points in the fourth package and the British side should clarify them. Otherwise, the debts can become unlimited and the talks on the financial package may become meaningless. The British side said that, by 1997, it would leave HK$120 billion in financial surplus to the SAR but it was unwilling to spend this financial surplus on the airport projects. However, the existence of thi HK$120 billion is rather doubtful. The Chinese side held that it was not necessary to leave such a large financial surplus to the SAR, and HK$25 billion would be enough. The remaining amount could be spent on the construction of the airport. Is not that a simple way to resolve the airport financial problem? The British Hong Kong authorities are unwilling to spend the huge financial surplus and just want to contract loans at an interest rate of over 10 percent so that the SAR will have to repay both interest and principal of the debts. What is their real intention? Do they want to give the British financial institutions a business opportunity by enabling them to earn long-term and high-rate interest income? The interest expenditure will have to be borne by Hong Kong people in the future; is this a reasonable option? It is not impossible to contract loans over the ceiling of HK$5 billion but it is impossible to exceed the ceiling by too much. Moreover, the Chinese side must be consulted if the loans exceed the ceiling. The British Hong Kong authorities should be able find some ways to quicken the pace of the financial talks as long as they work out a more reasonable package in accordance with the memorandum of understanding.
