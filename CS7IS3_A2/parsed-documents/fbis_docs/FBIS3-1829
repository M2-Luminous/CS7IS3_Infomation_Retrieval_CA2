Legislators with the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) revealed yesterday that bugging devices had been detected during counter-surveillance sweeps of the party's offices. UDHK elected member for Kowloon West, James To, told the SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD that bugs had been found in the party's Kowloon head quarters and in the office of a UDHK legislator. "When we set up our Kowloon office (on Nathan Road) near Prince Edward, we had a person go around with a field meter to try and detect any devices," he said. "The result was positive. That means there was a bug in the office. But we didn't hire anybody to remove the bug at that time since we had no secrets. When we tried the experiment on (legislator) Lau Chin-shek's office (in Tsim Sha Tsui), the pointer on the meter moved even more vigorously. That meant there were several devices in the room." Mr Lau is director of the Christian Industrial Committee, an organisation that has been active in the pro-democracy movement since the 1970s. A mainlander by birth, he has close ties with leading Chinese dissidents, including trade union leader Han Dongfang, who was last year refused permission to reenter China. Mr Lau said yesterday that he believed he had been followed both in Hong Kong and in China. During the SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD's investigation into political bugging in Hong Kong, it was revealed that a bug had also been removed from a UDHK legislator's office in May last year. The latest development in political espionage in the territory follows last week's revelations that Australian spies had been hired by the British intelligence service MI6 to spy on Chinese political and commercial activities in Hong Kong. UDHK chairman Martin Lee admitted that security was a problem for the party. "At some stage last year we had a discussion because we were worried about security," he said. "I don't remember the details or what happened exactly." Liberal Party legislator Selina Chow said her party did not take any special precautions beyond basic security measures. "It is difficult for us as a political organisation to be entirely full proof [as published]," she said. "We are conscious of possible problems but nothing has surfaced yet." A recent investigation by the HONGKONG STANDARD revealed that espionage was becoming a serious problem for business and industry in Hong Kong. Listening devices have been found placed under desks, in telephones, light sockets, electrical plugs and in walls. Frank Knight, chairman of Asian Security and Investigation Services, said: "Certain organisations have the most superior equipment." He said such devices could pick up sounds 100 metres away. The signals could then be transmitted to a receiver outside the building. He said the point of a listening device placed in a wall need be no bigger than a pin head. Private investigation companies charge anything between $3,000 and $14,000 for counter-surveillance undertakings.
