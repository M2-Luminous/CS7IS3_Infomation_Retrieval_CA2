Marithza Ruiz de Vielman assumed the position that had been held since June by Arturo Fajardo Maldonado. Ruiz de Vielman is the second professional to join the cabinet in less than 24 hours, after the president swore in Ana Ordonez de Molina as new finance minister on Tuesday afternoon. The changes within the cabinet correspond to the new direction adopted by the president as part of his work agenda for the current year, according to De Leon Carpio. [Begin De Vielman recording] [Words indistinct] to achieve satisfactory results. Guatemala is a country that is struggling to consolidate its democracy, strengthen its Constitution, attain peace, and gain openings in international trade. To that end, we need the assistance of a team and the confidence that we can carry out that task. We are a country that, just as any other developing country, has very limited economic resources. Consequently, we must increase the effectiveness of our missions abroad and the effort of the people who work here at the Foreign Relations Ministry to achieve all said objectives. As I said before, these objectives must be achieved with very limited resources, but we are hopeful and confident because Guatemala deserves it. In addition, I want to thank Dr. Fajardo for the cooperation and assistance he is giving me. All persons who preceded me in this difficult position have done a great job. Dr. Fajardo has expressed his willingness and desire to cooperate because in this ministers' change, there is only a change of persons. However, the state [word indistinct] and the interest of the country also [words indistinct]. Then I want to ask for the cooperation of all of you and once more thank the president for his trust in me. [applause] I also want to announce, with the authorization of the president of the Republic, that in the task I now assume I will have the cooperation of two persons who are well-known and appreciated in [word indistinct]. In the work I have done in the area of international trade, I learned to respect their ability and I realize that accepting the post of foreign minister, which is in fact a difficult task, I have the advantage of counting on very valuable staffers at the Foreign Relations Ministry. Two of them will accompany me as deputy ministers, but there are many more officials. The Foreign Relations Ministry has professional personnel that I am sure will also help me. With the authorization of the president, I would also like to announce and confirm to the media that the deputy ministers who will be appointed are Dr. Bernardo Arevalo and Carlos Ramirez Martinez.
