Mr Patten said the view that democracy was unsuited to Asian societies was patronising and racist. He also described communism as "wicked" and "a failure". His remarks will infuriate Beijing, which opposes his plans for democratic reform in Hong Kong. Mr Patten, who is visiting Sydney, asked in a speech: "Are some Asian leaders really prepared to argue that respect for human dignity is an exclusively European or North American or Australian concept"? "I don't believe for a moment that human rights stop at the borders of Asia, and nor, I believe, do most Asians". "If you argued outside Asia that human rights weren't really appropriate for Asians, or for Latin Americans or for Africans, that would rightly be regarded as a deeply patronising argument -- not to say a racist one." On Sunday, Mr Patten told reporters he would not be using his visit to Australia to canvass support for his political reform plans. He was mainly concerned to promote trade and investment. But following yesterday's remarks, China will see the visit as another attempt to internationalise an issue it believes should remain a strictly bilateral affair between London and Beijing. More to the point, it will regard the Governor's speech as an attack on its own human rights position, which was restated in yesterday's Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily. The paper accused foreign critics of trying to impose alien values on China, and of failing to live up to their own lofty standards at home. All factors should be taken into account in any dialogue on human rights, and the developing world should not blindly accept doctrines handed down by the West. "The human rights philosophy of the European capitalist revolution has made historical contributions ... but the world has gone through great changes, and we should make our choices with judgment," People's Daily said. "Outside Europe, there are other, even older glorious civilisations with which to compare and make choices." Mr Patten said the argument about cultural relativism and human rights did not stand up, and denied that those who stood up for individual freedoms were interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. "The truth is that those who try to sweep human rights under the carpet tend to do so for baser motives -- to stamp on opposition and keep a tight grip on political power," he said in an address to the Australia-Asia Society. "Communism failed because, in attempting to crush initiative and suppress individualism, it went right against the grain of human nature. It collapsed because of its wicked and expensive failures." He dismissed arguments that Asia was barren ground for democracy. "First, there is nothing inherent in Asian society that makes democracy a non-starter. Japan is evidence enough of that". "Second, there is no evidence to support the claim that while rising living standards in Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, may lead to rising political aspirations, the same does not apply in Asia". "I accept there may not be a mechanistic relationship between growing prosperity and an increasing demand for participative government. But the evidence is that in Asia, as in other places, people who have more in their wallets sooner or later want more say in the way they are governed." Mr Patten's remarks amounted to further evidence, if any were needed, that his approach to problems inside and outside of Hong Kong is fundamentally at variance with China's, and that the prospects for cooperation between Britain and Beijing over the territory seem virtually non-existent.
