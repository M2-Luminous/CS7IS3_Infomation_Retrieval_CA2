FR940127-0-00007 FR940127-0-00002 Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements of this interim rule at 7 CFR part 703 have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for expedited approval under provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 33. Approval of the forms is requested by February 1, 1994. The public reporting burden for the information collections that would be required for compliance with these regulations is estimated to average 39 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Executive Order 12778 This interim rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this interim rule are not retroactive and preempt State and local laws to the extent such laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this interim rule. Before an action may be brought in a Federal court of competent jurisdiction, the administrative appeal rights afforded program participants at 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. Discussion of Program The current regulations in 7 CFR part 703, published as a final rule on June 4, 1992 (57 FR 23908), implemented the 1992 pilot WRP, which is authorized by title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended (1985 Act). Under the WRP, ASCS will purchase easements, in lump-sum payments, from persons owning cropland who voluntarily agree to restore and protect farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands, substantially altered lands, and eligible adjacent acres. Fund and acreage allocations will be provided to States based on landowner interest and other factors as determined by the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, ASCS, in consultation with the Soil Conservation Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Land eligible for enrollment in the WRP includes farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands, but not lands converted after December 23, 1985, or substantially altered lands, together with adjacent lands on which the wetlands are functionally dependent so long as the likelihood of successful restoration of such land and the wetland values merit inclusion in the program taking into account the cost of restoring the wetlands. ASCS is also permitted to include in the program: (1) Farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands, or substantially altered lands and adjoining lands which are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), as authorized by title XII of the 1985 Act, with the highest wetland functions and values and that are likely to return to production at the end of the CRP contract; (2) Other wetlands that would not otherwise be eligible if it is determined that inclusion in the program would add to the value of the easement; and (3) Riparian areas that link wetlands which are protected by easements or by some other device or circumstance that achieves the same purpose as an easement. Landowners are not eligible to receive funding under both the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the WRP on the same acreage. ECP payments received on acreage offered for WRP must be refunded, provided the ECP practice is still within its lifespan provisions, before any WRP payment will be disbursed. This interim rule does not impact the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program as authorized by the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Relief From the Major, Widespread Flooding in the Midwest Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;75). Statutory Changes During fiscal year 1992, WRP was authorized in the following States: California, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Section 1237 of the 1985 Act was amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 to specify that the Secretary shall enroll in the WRP a total of not less than 330,000 acres by the end of 1995 and a total of not less than 975,000 acres during 1991 through 2000. Congress has appropriated $66,675,000 to be used to enroll no more than 75,000 acres in fiscal year 1994. This interim rule amends 7 CFR part 703 for WRP to: (1) With respect to fiscal year 1994 only, identify enrollment availability in 20 States, including the nine States in the fiscal year 1992 pilot program; (2) Provide for the appraisal for easements by licensed appraisers who are also approved by ASCS; and (3) Make other changes based on experience gained from administering the pilot WRP in fiscal year 1992. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 703 Administrative practices and procedures, Appraisals, Compliance procedures, Easements, Natural resources, Technical assistance, Wetlands Reserve Plan of Operations (WRPO). Accordingly, 7 CFR part 703 is amended as follows: PART 703_WETLANDS RESERVE PROGRAM 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 703 is revised to read as follows: Authority: Public Law 99&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 739; 16 U.S.C. 3837 et. seq. 2. Section 703.1 is revised to read as follows: ยง703.1 Applicability. (a) The regulations in this part govern the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). For fiscal year 1992 only, the WRP shall be available to producers in California, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. For fiscal year 1994 only, the WRP shall be available in these nine States and in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. These states have been determined to have a high incidence of: (1) Significant acreage of hydric cropland; (2) Potential capacity of restoration; (3) Diversity in kinds of wetlands; or (4) Substantial benefits for migratory birds and other wildlife. (b) Under the WRP, ASCS will accept voluntary offers of acreage for the purchase of easements from eligible persons who have eligible land with respect to which they agree to restore and protect farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands, or substantially altered lands, and eligible adjacent lands. Such voluntary easements will be for the purpose of restoring the hydrology and vegetation and protecting the functions and values of wetlands for wildlife habitat, water quality improvement, flood water retention, ground water recharge, open space, aesthetic values, environmental education, and other values determined appropriate by ASCS. ยง703.2 [Amended] 3. In ยง703.2, paragraph (f)(1) is amended by removing the words ``cost of the restoration'' and adding in their place, the words ``costs of restoration and of acquiring the easement'', and paragraph (f)(2) is amended by inserting the word ``not'' after the word ``will''. 4. Section 703.3(b) is amended by: A. Revising the definitions of ``Bid'', ``Non-permanent easement'', ``Participant'', and ``Permanent easement'', and B.
