The French Government has agreed to supply the company with Fr2 billion, and no one seriously expected more. Aerospatiale has had a difficult year with Airbus and military sales low. Its sales decreased 5 percent in 1993. Despite this situation, its debt has been reduced. However, the group's balance sheet remains burdened by a colossal debt even though it has been reduced by 9 percent in 1993: it is Frl5 billion, or twice shareholders' equity (Fr6 billion). "The state has done its duty as a shareholder," commented Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery commented. According to him, the EU Commission can not criticize the Fr2 billion. Aerospatiale, unlike [failing computer company] Bull, is not in difficulty and the austerity plan which has been enacted [at Aerospatiale] should allow a return to profitability in 1995. In the meantime, privatization is not the order of the day. Alphandery confirmed that the Fr2 billion will come from the Fr21-billion funds budgeted by the government for public companies.
