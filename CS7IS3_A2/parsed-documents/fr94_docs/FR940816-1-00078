FR940816-1-00078 FR940816-1-00011 Wolves would be moved on a case-by-case basis to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental population area. Generally there would not be attempts to locate and/or move lone wolves dispersing in this area, although this may occur. Hunting, trapping, and animal damage control activities are regulated inside and outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Most of the area within the wolf reintroduction area is remote and sparsely inhabited wild lands. There are some risks to wolf recovery that would be associated with take of wolves, other land uses, and various recreational activities. However, these risks are low because take of wolves should occur so infrequently that wolf recovery would not be significantly affected. The Service finds that the stated protective measures and management practices are necessary and advisable for the conservation and recovery of the gray wolf in central Idaho and southwestern Montana. No additional Federal regulations appear to be needed. The Service also finds that the proposed nonessential experimental status is appropriate for gray wolves released in central Idaho that are taken from unendangered wild populations. As discussed above, although once extirpated from its historic range in most of the conterminous United States, the gray wolf is common in western Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000) and they are increasing in the Great Lakes area. The gray wolf has also recently been recovering in a small portion of its range in the western United States. Therefore, taking fewer than 100 wolves from Canada will pose no threat to the survival of the species in the wild. An additional management flexibility would result from using the nonessential status for wolves introduced into the central Idaho, due to less stringent requirements of section 7 of the Act (interagency consultation) for wolves that may occur outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Wolves that are part of the nonessential experimental population would be treated as animals proposed for listing, rather than listed, when occurring outside of a National Park or National Wildlife Refuge, and only two provisions of section 7 apply to Federal actions outside National parks and refuges: section 7 (a)(l), which authorizes all Federal agencies to establish conservation programs; and section 7(a)(4), which requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on actions that are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. The results of a conference are advisory in nature; agencies are not required to refrain from commitment of resources to projects as a result of a conference. There are no conflicts envisioned with any current or anticipated management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal agencies in the reintroduction area. National Forests are typically managed in such a fashion as to produce wild animals that would be natural prey to wolves. The Service finds that there are no threats to the success of the reintroduction project or the overall continued existence of the gray wolf from the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated with the nonessential designation. The full provisions of section 7 apply to nonessential experimental populations in a National Park or National Wildlife Refuge. The Service, Forest Service, or any other Federal agency is prohibited from authorizing, funding, or carrying out an action within a National Park or National Wildlife Refuge that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf. Pursuant to 50 CFR 17.83(b), section 7 determinations consider all experimental and nonexperimental wolves as a single listed species for analysis purposes. The Service has reviewed all ongoing and proposed uses of the affected National Forests and found none that are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf, nor will such uses adversely affect the success of the reintroduction program. Potential uses that could adversely affect success are hunting, trapping, animal damage control activities and high speed vehicular traffic. Hunting and trapping, and USDA Animal Damage Control programs are prohibited or tightly regulated in National Forests and are closely regulated by State and Federal law and policy in other areas. There are very few paved roads in the proposed reintroduction area, and wolf encounters with vehicles are likely to be infrequent. Even most of the unpaved roads are used seasonally. In addition, these unpaved roads typically have low vehicle traffic and are constructed for low-speed use. Location of Experimental Population The release site for reintroducing wolves will be on National Forest lands in central Idaho. The experimental population area will include that portion of Idaho and Montana that is west of Interstate 15 and south of Interstate 90. Current information indicates that, if wolves are found south of Interstate 90, they would likely be experimental wolves from the central Idaho area. Wolves north of the Interstate 90 would likely be naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana or Canada.
