The latter are also recorded by seismic instruments. However, the constant and completely inexplicable failures in the struggle against seismic damage has led to the idea that something here is not as it seems and that the seismic engineers are protecting buildings not from actual danger, but rather, from a false danger. The actual danger, however, has remained unnoticed up till now. This mistake had not been discovered only because, up till now, the seismic engineers and seismologists have been the only ones concerned with the most complicated problem of seismic damage. At the same time, all the prominent specialists in the theory of the threshold equilibrium, destruction and durability of structures disregarded it. And it never occurred to anyone that the patterns of seismic damage are a unique source of invaluable scientific information about the true nature of the seismic effect on buildings. When I reproduced a series of standard seismic strength analyses with due consideration of the ground vibrations recorded at the same time, I obtained a paradoxical result. It turned out that, in half of the instances, the buildings should not have been damaged at all, while, in the rest of the instances, the damage should have been completely different. Consequently, the results of the currently used standard seismic strength analyses do not reflect at all the actual pattern of the phenomenon at all. After analyzing the nature, properties and regularities of all the seismic damage from the standpoint of structural mechanics, I managed to reproduce the mysterious effect which caused it. Up till now, this problem had not been solved. It turned out that the seismic damage represented the precise replication (or impression) of the sought-after effect and it is only necessary to know how to interpret it. As a result, I managed to discover some very interesting facts which had not been known previously and which, however, are of extraordinarily important practical value. All the damage during earthquakes takes the highly unusual form of a ``clean shear.'' This is completely ``abnormal'' for the behavior of reinforced concrete columns, partitions and lintels from the point of view of structural mechanics. Such damage contradicts the standard properties of the flexible components which should always fracture and not shear. Moreover, this kind of damage differs in its nature from all known types and is not encountered anywhere else. So far, it has not been possible to reproduce it artificially, even by means of underground explosions. In its form, it absolutely does not correspond to and is even at variance with the ground vibrations which have been recorded at the time of its appearance. Consequently, these vibrations cannot cause the actual damage. It follows completely obviously from all these facts that the main premise in the current seismic ``vibrational'' doctrine is false. The true damaging effect which corresponds to the pattern of seismic damage may be not the vibrations, but rather, just the compression shock waves which are not recorded by current instruments. It is precisely these waves which give rise to the shear shock waves in the columns and walls of buildings and instantaneously shear them. The columns do not even have time to bend and the buildings do not have time to sway. This automatically means that all the currently used quake-proofing measures and designs are absolutely useless. They protect buildings from ground vibrations but, in principle, they are not capable of protecting them from shear shock waves. For example, we frequently place buildings on flexible columns, saving them from resonance vibrations, while, as a result of an earthquake, these protective columns simply snap like wooden matches and the buildings collapse without even having had time to shake. When there are ground vibrations and they cause buildings to vibrate, the columns and partitions should fracture on the ends. But one of the many seismic paradoxes is the fact that such fractures of columns, partitions and lintels do not develop during earthquakes. Instead of them, an oblique shear develops in the columns (most often in the middle), as if they are being cut in two by a giant saber. Inasmuch as there is no fracturing of flexible structural elements during earthquakes, this means that there are no dangerous ground vibrations there. But then, just what kinds of vibrations, in actual fact, are the current seismic instruments showing us? The instruments are not recording actual ground vibrations at all, but only their own vibrations, which have been caused by the shock waves in the ground. Up till now, such an interpretation of the accelerometer recordings, one disagreeable for the seismic engineers, did not occur to anyone. As soon as the seismologists handed over the information about seismic ground movements to the builders for their use, they immediately also lost the monopoly for the assessment of its accuracy. Their mistake ``crossed'' into another's field, one not under their control, the field of structural mechanics. And this is one of the most experiment-based and precise sciences. It possesses a unique ability for determining the accuracy of the description of any external effect on a structure (including a seismic one). The strength analyzer gives it this ability, since it establishes the firm connection between the initial effect and the structural damage pattern which corresponds to it. If the damage pattern expected by analysis does not match the actual pattern, this means that the description of the external effect is also invalid. It is precisely this result which occurs in all seismic strength analyses. So, structural mechanics indisputably establishes the erroneousness of the seismologists' information about dangerous seismic ground movements. As a result, we have clarified the fact that qualitatively different principles, measures and designs are needed to protect buildings from shock waves. The development and experimental testing of new protective designs for buildings of any type and constructional design (both planned and already existing ones) have already begun.
