FR940304-0-00028 FR940304-0-00010 Pending original and supplemental applications for premarket approval for daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses currently filed with the agency must be examined to identify: (1) Those that are no longer subject to premarket approval review and can be converted to 510(k)'s or withdrawn and resubmitted to FDA by the applicant to be evaluated through the 510(k) process; and (2) those which can be withdrawn by the applicant and are not required to be resubmitted and evaluated as a 510(k) prior to implementing the request. FDA review of affected premarket approval applications (PMA's) will be suspended until the respective sponsor amends its application, setting forth the status of the devices and the administrative actions requested to be taken regarding its application. Sponsors of PMA's affected by the reclassification should refer to the order published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register for information on actions necessary regarding any pending applications affected by the automatic reclassification. Environmental Impact The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Economic Impact FDA has carefully examined the costs and benefits of this action in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). The agency concludes that the rule is not a significant rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The reclassification will reduce the regulatory costs to manufacturers of these lenses because the cost of complying with premarket notification requirements is substantially less than the cost of complying with premarket approval requirements. Accordingly, the regulations at §§886.5916 and 886.5925 (21 CFR 886.5916 and 886.5925) are amended as set forth below.
