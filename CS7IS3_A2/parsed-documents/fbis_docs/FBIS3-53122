Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi met with Yasir 'Arafat and Executive Committee members for four days this week in Tunis. Ghawshah pointed out that the Executive Committee authorized Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who submitted to the Palestinian president a memorandum demanding that reforms be made in PLO institutions, to choose members of the national dialogue committee without intervention from the PLO leadership. He added that the Executive Committee has agreed in principle to set up a special department to develop human resources in the PLO and admit new capabilities to the planning council supervising the Palestinian planning center belonging to the PLO. Ghawshah denied that the Executive Committee members are responsible for President 'Arafat's monopolization of power and decisionmaking. At a press conference held in Tunis the day before yesterday Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi criticized the Executive Committee members, saying they were encouraging him ('Arafat) by keeping silent about his continued monopolization of power. But Ghawshah stressed to AL-HAYAH that he had sent to three Executive Committee members -- namely Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, and Sulayman al-Najjab -- an internal memorandum to President 'Arafat containing four major points to change the leadership's working methods toward democracy. He pointed out that the four Executive Committee members returned recently to attend the committee's meetings after a period of seclusion, following the president's agreement to their demands, which are: 1. To hold the Executive Committee meetings on the basis of a quorum, that is half the members plus one (10 members), considering it the source of decisions, with the possibility of holding mini-meetings for consultations only, but at which no decisions should be made. 2. To reactivate the committee following up the negotiations and consider it the body supervising the negotiation process. The Executive Committee responded to this demand and decided officially to revive the committee, which includes Abu-Mazin (chairman), 'Abd-Rabbuh (deputy chairman), al-Najjab, and Ghawshah. 3. To submit a detailed report on the financial crisis in the PLO and to consider the Executive Committee the body authorized to supervise financial matters in the PLO. Juwayd al-Ghusayn, chairman of the Palestinian National Fund, pledged to submit a comprehensive report on financial conditions in the PLO at the Executive Committee's next meeting. 4. To draft the basic law of the national authority on a democratic basis and to lay the foundations capable of effecting PLO institutions. At the end of last month the Executive Committee devoted three meetings to discussing the draft fundamental law (constitution). Then it referred it to Palestinian committees and institutions inside and in the diaspora to debate it and express their views. At another level, Ghawshah confirmed that the Executive Committee will convene after the delegation headed by PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi returns to Tunis in order to discuss Palestinian-Jordanian relations in the stage ahead.
