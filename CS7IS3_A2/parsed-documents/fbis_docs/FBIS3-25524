Yao Agboyibo, the leader of the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], the main opposition party, told reporters that his party and its allies had obtained an absolute majority having won 41 seats in the 81-member legislature. Agboyibo said that the results from 79 constituencies were already known, although the official National Election Commission had not yet issued any results from the second round poll held on Sunday. Earlier Eyadema's ruling Togolese People's Rally (RPT), which has helped the military strongman maintain his monopoly grip on power since 1967, made charges of "massive fraud" by the opposition. In a statement, the RPT called for legal action against "certain political leaders," who it alleged had tried to "upset the vote by defamation, violence and fraud." Twenty-four parliamentary seats were at stake in the run-off round of the elections, with the opposition sure of taking 12 seats and well placed in seven other constituencies. Outbreaks of violence occurred in three of the 11 constituencies where opposition candidates were directly up against supporters of General Eyadema, who has ruled Togo for 27 years. Under the terms of the constitution, the victory of the opposition, if confirmed, obliges Eyadema to name a prime minister from the ranks of the new majority parties. Asked whether he would become the next premier, Agboyibo refused to rule it out but said he would beforehand call a "round table" meeting of all political parties and social/professional groups to get their assent to the government's policies. The "round table" would also announce a "general armistice covering the opposition and people in power, including the military." The armistice would allow the return of civilian refugees and soldiers estimated to number around 50,000 people, Agboyibo said. The opposition leader added that his becoming prime minister would depend upon Eyadema accepting his government's programme. "Cohabiting with Eyadema is the problem. We'll have to negotiate the cohabitation," he said. The Constitution demands that the government, responsible to the National Assembly, should "lead and determine national policy". The head of state signs decrees and orders and promulgates laws. He can dissolve parliament but not during the 12 months following an election. "Our chief concern is to create a climate of social peace," said Agboyibo, adding that he wanted "to see the head of state less involved in public affairs". Since Eyadema took power in 1967, he and his followers in the RPT have maintained an unbroken absolute rule except for during the first few months of the transition period started in August 1991. Agboyibo admitted fears for his security. "There have been death threats against me and my deputies," he said, without providing any details.
