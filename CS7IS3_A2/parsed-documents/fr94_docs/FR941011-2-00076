FR941011-2-00076 FR941011-2-00044 [FRL&hyph;5088&hyph;6] Technical Corrections on Additional Data Available on Cement Kiln Dust Waste Studied in the Report to Congress on Cement Kiln Dust AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of corrections to data available for comment in RCRA Docket No. F&hyph;94&hyph;RC2A&hyph;FFFFF and extension of comment period on corrected materials. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability, for public inspection and comment, of corrections to certain portions of data recently made available for public comment (see 59 FR 47133&hyph;47135, September 14, 1994), pertinent to additional assessments of potential risks from cement kiln dust waste. This Notice also extends the period for public comment on the corrected materials. Specifically, these corrections pertain to Pages 1&hyph;19 through 1&hyph;30 and Attachment 1&hyph;4 of Section 1 of the Technical Background Document on Human Health and Environmental Risk Assessment in Support of the Regulatory Determination on Cement Kiln Dust, Section 1 being titled ``Expanded Risk Assessment for the Onsite Management of Cement Kiln Dust.'' This Technical Background Document is Number S0019 in RCRA Docket No. F&hyph;94&hyph;RC2A&hyph;FFFFF. The corrected materials, in the form of substitute pages 1&hyph;19 (revised) through 1&hyph;30 (revised) and Attachment 1&hyph;4 (revised), have been placed in RCRA Docket No. F&hyph;94&hyph;RC2A&hyph;FFFFF as docket entry No. S0019.A, and have also been placed in EPA's Superfund electronic bulletin board (CLU&hyph;IN). There were five general errors in the CKD human health risk assessment materials which need to be corrected. They include: _Fixing a ``rounding'' error which inadvertently assigned all facilities into a risk category one order of magnitude higher than estimated. _Revising risk results for 5 sites to represent ``best-estimate'' results. (High-end risk estimates were inadvertently used.) _Revised risk estimates for two sites located near lakes. The dilution capacity of the two lakes is actually orders of magnitude greater than what was used in the original material announced in the September 14, 1994, notice. _Revised risk estimates for 14 sites for which we did not have constituent concentrations. In the original document, risk estimates assumed 95th percentile concentrations for metals. In the revised tables, if risk at the sites could not be determined as negligible using the 95th percentile, then risk at the sites are listed as ``unknown'' rather than estimating the risk using the 95th percentile assumption. _Add the results of the aquatic pathway exceedances of constituent concentrations as defined in the Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC). These were calculated but inadvertently left out of the previous document. They represent a risk element not included in the previous edition. The AWQC exceedance results is a new subsection inserted at the end of the revised results subsection. DATES: Because of these corrections, the Agency is extending the comment period pertaining to Section 1 and Attachments to Section 1 of the Technical Background Document on Human Health and Environmental Risk Assessment, only, until November 10, 1994. The Agency is not reopening the comment period on the Report to Congress on Cement Kiln Dust, nor is it extending the comment period on any other sections of the Technical Background Document on Human Health and Environmental Risk Assessment or any other materials noticed for comment in 59 FR 47133&hyph;35 as contained in RCRA Docket No. F&hyph;94&hyph;RC2A&hyph;FFFFF. As indicated in the previous notice, because of the Agency's commitment to make a regulatory determination by January 31, 1995, no extensions will be granted except as described in this notice.
