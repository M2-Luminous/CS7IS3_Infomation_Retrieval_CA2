FR941110-0-00198 FR941110-0-00016 Response: We do not accept the comment. First, a civil money penalty is not collectible until, as explained in a previous comment, a final administrative decision is made that supports the imposition of the penalty. Second, a facility's financial condition is one of the many factors considered in determining the amount of the penalty. It is not our intent to cause a facility undue hardship; however, if the penalty imposed is in the upper limit of the immediate jeopardy range, we believe it is justified, because residents are in life threatening situations and we want to motivate the facility to immediately correct deficiencies. Finally, the Act permits that civil money penalties may be deducted from any sum that HCFA or the State owes or will owe the facility, and since a provider has ample notice of the due date, the option exists to pay the civil money penalty on or before the due date as opposed to the money being deducted from sums owed or owing. Comment: Another commenter said more consistency between regulatory requirements and enforcement practice would be demonstrated by requiring the agreement of the patient and his or her attending physician with the monetary penalty to be imposed prior to the withholding of monies from the patient's funding source. Response: To solicit the agreement of each and every resident and his or her attending physician before the imposition of a civil money penalty would unnecessarily delay the imposition of the civil money penalty. Also, if a facility is not motivated to promptly correct noncompliance, due to the lengthy delay created by seeking resident and physician approval, the health and safety of residents could be compromised for an even longer period of time. Furthermore, when a provider enters into an agreement with HCFA or the State, or both, to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs, it is responsible for providing the agreed upon level of care to the residents. There is no justification for asking each resident and his or her attending physician for permission to impose a civil money penalty since the resident is the recipient and/or the beneficiary of the program and not a party to the agreement. Comment: Many commenters suggested that the rate of interest not be negotiable as stated in the proposed rule's preamble. The commenters said this can promote inconsistency, is unworkable and inequitable. Commenters wanted to know how the rate will be negotiated (as stated in the proposed preamble) and who will determine this rate. Many commenters offered alternative language for this regulatory provision which included the following: •Interest accrues at the credit card rate from the date of citation on all penalties not paid prior to a request for a hearing; •Interest is assessed at an annual rate which is 2 percent above the prime rate on the unpaid balance of the civil money penalty beginning on the due date; •Interest accrues from the date of the violation at the highest rate permitted by State usury laws; •Interest is based on a national index (for example, 6-month Treasury bills); and •The interest rate must be placed in regulation. Response: We agree that the interest rate should not be negotiable and we are revising redesignated §488.442(c) to specify the interest rate applicable to the collection of civil money penalties. For Medicare, the interest rate is the rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury and used by the Department of Health and Human Services. The rule now states that the interest rate is the higher of either_(1) the rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking into consideration private consumer rates of interest prevailing on the date of the notice of the penalty amount due (this rate is published quarterly in the Federal Register by the Department under 45 CFR 30.13(a)); or (2) the current value of funds rate (this rate is published annually in the Federal Register by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to quarterly revisions). For Medicaid, the interest rate is determined by the State. Comment: We received many comments on the collection of civil money penalties from dually participating facilities. A few commenters were confused and asked for clarification of this regulatory provision. Commenters suggested amending the language of the proposed rule, which says, ``the relative proportions of Medicare and Medicaid beds at the facility actually in use'' by adding ``by residents covered by the respective programs *␣*␣*'' to this sentence. Another commenter recommended the regulation say, ``the relative proportions of Medicare and Medicaid residents in the facility at the time the facility receives notice of the imposition of the civil money penalty.''
