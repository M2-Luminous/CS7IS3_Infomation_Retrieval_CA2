FR940419-1-00027 FR940419-1-00006 The 25 jurisdictions with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans will be required to adopt a regulation on abatement verification that is at least as effective as this Federal regulation within six months of the publication date of this Federal regulation (i.e. six months after the final rule is published). Current State abatement verification-procedures are described in State field operation manuals and/or directives. Although these State procedures may differ from the Federal procedures, the State-plan states, like OSHA, generally lack regulations or statutory provisions specifically addressing this issue, with the exception of Wyoming which does have a regulation requiring abatement verification. Current State abatement verification procedures are identical to the Federal except as described below: (1) Nine States have abatement verification forms: Alaska, California, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, and Wyoming. On these forms, the employers describe the specific measures taken to correct each alleged violation. Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Michigan, and Kentucky also ask for documentary evidence. Alaska requests employers to certify under penalty of perjury that the violations were abated by the dates specified. (2) California and Minnesota ask employers to submit progress reports. California requests monthly progress reports for all long-term abatements, while Minnesota requests a progress report for all serious and most other violations of the State's general industry and construction standards. (3) For long-term abatements, California requests employers to submit an abatement plan which outlines their procedures for abatement, such as plans for controls to be installed, and schedules for engineering, purchasing, and installation. Washington schedules follow-up inspections every six months to check progress made on long-term or multi-step abatement plans. (4) Some States (e.g., South Carolina and California) send a reminder letter to the employer just before the abatement verification form is due. Washington reminds employers by letter or telephone. Kentucky and California also send follow-up letters if the form is overdue. (5) Maryland tracks informal conference settlements to determine if abatement documentation is adequate. (6) Wyoming has an enforcement regulation requiring the submission of written documents saying when abatement has been accomplished. Failure to do so can result in a civil penalty. Wyoming can also take legal action to enforce submission of a letter of abatement. (7) New York, which covers only state and local government employees, conducts follow-up inspections to verify abatement for every violation; employers are not asked to send in any abatement verification information. XI. Public Participation Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, data, views, and arguments on any issue raised by this proposed regulation. These comments must be postmarked by July 18, 1994, and submitted in quadruplicate to the OSHA Docket Officer, Docket No. C&hyph;03, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, room N2625, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. Written submissions must clearly identify the issues or specific provisions of the proposal which are being addressed, and the position taken with respect to these issues or provisions. Comments will be available for public inspection and copying at the above address between the hours of 8:15 a.m. and 4:45 p.m., Monday through Friday (except Federal holidays). All timely submissions will additionally, be made part of the public record for this regulation, and will be available for inspection. The preliminary regulatory impact assessment and the exhibits cited in this document will be available for public inspection and copying at the above address. All comments will be carefully evaluated and considered by OSHA in developing the final regulation. XII. OMB Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act
