FBIS3-57851 "drweu002_e_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-002 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Jan 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Sudanese Ambassador Given 14 Days To Leave LD0401133694 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 1318 GMT 4 Jan 93 LD0401133694 London PRESS ASSOCIATION Language: English Article Type:BFN [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] [Excerpts] Britain today gave the Sudanese ambassador 14 days to leave the country in response to Sudan's refusal to reconsider its decision to expel Britain's man in Khartoum. The Foreign Office said its order for ambassador Muhammad 'Uthman Yasin to go was the "inevitable consequence" of Sudan's sticking by its expulsion of British envoy Peter Streams. Britain would not agree to the appointment of a successor to Mr Yasin and there were no plans to choose a replacement for Mr Streams. Sudan's decision to expel Mr Streams was sparked by the Archbishop of Canterbury's visit to mainly Christian areas in the rebel-controlled south of the country. Today's response by the British Government followed a meeting between junior Foreign Office Minister Mark Lennox-Boyd and the Sudanese Charge d'Affaires Abdurrahman Bakhit who was summoned this morning. In a 15-minute showdown, Mr Lennox-Boyd asked the Sudanese to reconsider their decision to expel Mr Streams, but Mr Bakhit said his government had not altered its position. A Foreign Office spokesman said: "Mr Lennox-Boyd said this was a matter of considerable regret and disappointment. Under the circumstances and in light of the wholly inadequate explanation which the Sudanese had given for Mr Streams's expulsion we decided to request the withdrawal of the Sudanese ambassador, Mr Muhammad 'Uthman Yasin. Mr Yasin has 14 days within which to leave the country." Mr Lennox-Boyd had concluded that the expulsion of Mr Yasin was the "inevitable consequence of the Sudanese government's action," said the spokesman. But he added: "The British Government did not want, however, to see the situation deteriorate further." [passage omitted] Britain had given Sudan until today to reverse its decision to expel Mr Streams. But Abdullahi al-Azret, of Sudan's embassy in Kenya, said today that the ambassador's expulsion "will not be reconsidered by Khartoum as the presence of such a man in Khartoum cannot help our bilateral relations." Khartoum's move had followed Dr Carey's refusal to go to the east African state as a guest of its government, saying it would have restricted his freedom of movement. [passage omitted]
