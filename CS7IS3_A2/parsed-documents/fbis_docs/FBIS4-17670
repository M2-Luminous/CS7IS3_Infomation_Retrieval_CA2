The meeting focused on a draft agreement on civil accord. The new document which is in essence a reviewed variant of the draft was discussed the day earlier by the State Duma. The opinions of the leaders of the factions differed. Leaders of agrarians, communists, liberal democrats stated their negative attitude to the draft. These factions control more than one third of deputy mandates. The document was also criticized by representatives of the factions Yabloko, New Regional Policy and Russian Democratic Party. However, they noted that the final position on this issue will be determined by the factions later. The draft agreement on civil accord was unconditionally supported by representatives of the factions Russia's Choice, the Russian Unity and Accord Party and Russia's Women. Summarizing the results of hearings, speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin stated that "he was absolutely not disappointed" with the discussion. Speaking to journalists he pointed out that deputies' speeches were "adequate to what is happening in the country." Rybkin considers that it is far from certain that political parties at their conferences, plenums and congresses scheduled for this weekend would support positions of their parliamentary factions which spoke against signing the civil accord agreement. IF Note: According to the presidential plan, the original formula for signing the document on April 28 is as follows: the agreement should be signed by the president, chairmen of the parliament's chambers, prime minister, heads of the federation's subjects, and plenipotentiary representatives of political parties represented in the State Duma, the Public Chamber of the president, trade unions, "and after that the agreement should be opened for the signing by other sides." In this connection, experts indicate a considerable probability that next Thursday the signing ceremony will be held without representatives of most major parties represented in the Duma. Some experts do not rule out that among participants in this solemn ceremony there will be no the speaker of the lower chamber. According to their forecasts, that may happen if deputies, in response to the LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, refuse to authorize the speaker with signing the agreement.
