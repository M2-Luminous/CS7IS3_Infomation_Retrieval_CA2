The issue was discussed on 23 June by PRC Health Minister Chen Minzhang and Brasilia Health Ministry representatives. The Chinese assert that the medicines will reach Brazil at prices much lower than those on the local market. According to Minister Chen Minzhang, the PRC produces medicines at a lower cost because the country manufactures them in huge quantities and has high technology for obtaining raw material.
