Speaking to a luncheon of business executives at a Tokyo hotel, Mori also said passage of the fiscal 1994 budget, which includes public works spending and a tax reduction to stimulate the economy, could be delayed until July. The business community has expressed concern that squabbling over finding a replacement for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa could further postpone the budget, and put a damper on an emerging economic recovery. The opposition leader said the LDP does not want to see two of its members vie for the premiership, and party consensus is a prerequisite if the LDP is to back Watanabe instead of LDP President Yohei Kono. Kono said Tuesday he plans to run in the Diet race, and there apparently is only minor opposition within the LDP to his candidacy, Mori said. On Thursday, however, Watanabe collected some 50 signatures from LDP legislators in the House of Representatives supporting his bid. Mori voiced strong displeasure that Watanabe may be in communication with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the buddhist-backed Komeito over forming a new conservative grouping. He said the LDP could not cooperate with a Watanabe administration supported by such a coalition because of objections from religious groups that support the LDP. Mori suggested that Kono and Watanabe meet to agree on a single LDP candidate.
