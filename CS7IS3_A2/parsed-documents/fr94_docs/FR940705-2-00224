FR940705-2-00224 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;C. Oral Responses to the RAC Principal Investigators shall limit their oral responses to the RAC only to those questions that are raised during the meeting. Oral presentations of previously submitted material and/or critical data that was not submitted > 2 weeks prior to the RAC meeting are prohibited. Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D. Primary Reviewers' Responses Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D&hyph;1. Primary Reviewers' Written Comments. The primary reviewers' written comments on a proposal should include the following: Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a. Emphasize the issues related to gene marking, gene transfer, or gene therapy. Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b. State explicitly whether the Points to Consider have been addressed satisfactorily. Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;c. Examine the scientific rationale, scientific context (relative to other proposals reviewed by the RAC), whether the preliminary in vitro and in vivo data were obtained in appropriate models and are sufficient, and whether questions related to safety, efficacy, and social/ethical context have been resolved. Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;d. Whenever possible, criticisms of Informed Consent documents should include written alternatives for suggested revisions for the RAC to consider. Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;e. Primary reviews should state whether the proposal is: (i) acceptable as written, (ii) expected to be acceptable with specific revisions or after satisfactory responses to specific questions raised on review, or (iii) unacceptable in its present form. Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D&hyph;2. Oral Discussions by Primary Reviewers at the RAC Meeting. Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a. It should be possible for most primary reviewers to present their oral reviews in > 5 minutes. Appendix M&hyph;IV. Reporting Requirements Appendix M&hyph;IV&hyph;A. Serious adverse effects of treatment should be reported immediately to the local Institutional Review Board, the NIH Office for Protection from Research Risks, and NIH/ORDA followed by the submission of a written report filed with each group. Reports submitted to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Appendix M&hyph;IV&hyph;B. Reports regarding the general progress of patients should be filed with both the local Institutional Review Board and NIH/ORDA within six months of the commencement of the experiment and at six-month intervals thereafter. These twice-yearly reports should continue for a sufficient period of time to allow observation of all major effects. In the event of a patient's death, a summary of the special post-mortem studies and statement of the cause of death should be submitted to the Institutional Review Board and NIH/ORDA, if available. Appendix M&hyph;V. Procedures to the Followed for Accelerated Review of Human Gene Transfer Experiments by NIH/ORDA under Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2 Requests for Accelerated Review should be submitted to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Appendix M&hyph;V&hyph;A. Human gene transfer experiments in this category must be in accordance with the provisions of Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2. If the human gene transfer protocol does not qualify for Accelerated Review (see Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2) as determined by NIH/ORDA, then the Principal Investigator must submit the experiment for full RAC review and NIH approval in accordance with Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2. Appendix M&hyph;V&hyph;B. No protocol shall be considered without Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board approval. Appendix M&hyph;V&hyph;C. At this time, all gene transfer protocols must be considered experimental. Appendix M&hyph;V&hyph;D. Principal Investigators requesting Accelerated Review (see Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2), must submit the relevant documentation in accordance with Appendix M&hyph;III. NIH/ORDA will notify the Principal Investigator whether the proposed study qualifies for the Accelerated Review process. If NIH/ORDA determines that an experiment does not qualify for Accelerated Review process, the Principal Investigator must submit the proposal for full RAC review > 8 weeks prior to the next scheduled RAC meeting. Appendix M&hyph;V&hyph;E. It is expected that NIH/ORDA will consult with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, when considering Accelerated Review human gene transfer protocols (see Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2).
