According to Seoul radio reports, today, approximately 150 members of the National Federation of General Student Councils broke into the building of the puppet Defense Ministry where the U.S. defense secretary and the puppet defense minister were hatching a war plot. Following this, the students waged a protest demonstration, chanting slogans opposing Defense Secretary Perry's visit. In groups, the students demonstrators broke through a guard post at the front gate of the building around 11:30 AM and stormed into it. The students staged a demonstration, lying on the ground with placards reading "We oppose the United States and Perry's visit!" "We do not want a war!" and "Yankee, Go Home!" The students lifted up the placards protesting the U.S. demand on the opening of South Korea's rice market and the purchase of U.S. weapons. The puppet clique, dismayed by the students' breaking into the Defense Ministry building, mobilized some 300 armed policemen into the spot and committed fascist suppression by taking all the student protesters to the police station.
