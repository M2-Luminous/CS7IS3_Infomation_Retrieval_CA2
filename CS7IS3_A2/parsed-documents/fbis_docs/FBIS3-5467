(Posco), the world's No. 2 steel maker, Tuesday's selection of an outsider as chairman marked a first in its 20-odd-year history and came as a great surprise. Because of a conflict of interest between Chairman Chong Myong-sik and President Cho Mal-su that surfaced in January as well as the company's expansion into the cellular phone industry as the largest shareholder of the new Mobile Telecommunications Co., a top management reshuffle had long been expected. Nevertheless, the selection of an outsider as top manager caught nearly everyone off guard. The outsider is former Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Planning Minister Kim Man-chae. A company boasting 12 trillion won (15 billion U.S. dollars) in assets, 7 trillion won in sales and 2.5 billion dollars in exports is now under his leadership. Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su, who represents the government as the controlling shareholder of Posco, said he believes the new chairman is the right man to reform Posco's management in line with the Kim Yong-sam government's economic and industrial policy because he knows the policy better than anybody. Indeed, Posco Chairman Kim headed a team of economic advisers to President Kim during his presidential campaign. Minister Kim thus suggested that Kim was selected as Posco's new chairman at the recommendation of Chongwadae [presidential office]. In other words, he became the steel maker's top manager due to the strong confidence Chongwadae places in him. Asked about the new chairman's lack of experience in company management, Minister Kim pointed to his chairmanship of Samsung Life Insurance Co., adding there is no firm rule that a steel man must become the top manager of a steel firm. His broad economic knowledge and sharp insight into international affairs will make him a good company manager. Moreover, his drive and experience as the government's chief economic policy-maker make him the most qualified man for Posco's top post, Minister Kim said. After losing in a previous parliamentary election, Kim has served as chief Korean delegate to the eminent persons' group of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, director of the U.S. East-West Center in Hawaii, member of the Korea-U.S. Wisemen Committee and chairman of the Korea Foundation for the handicapped.
