Katsumi Sato, director of the Modern Korea Institute, told the Foreign Correspondents Club of Tokyo that a North Korean military defector has attested to the shipments arranged by the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun). Sato said that Lim Song-son, a first lieutenant in the North Korean People's Army in charge of military construction who defected, told the institute that ``some 75 percent'' of the construction equipment, including trucks, cranes and bulldozers, are from Japan. Sato quoted Lim as saying, ``whenever something breaks, we photograph the defective part and fax the photo to the Chongryun along with the part number. In no time, the part is shipped to us on the Mangyeongbong ferry.'' The 150,000-member Chongryun functions as Pyongyang's virtual embassy in Japan. The Chongryun-operated ferry shuttles between Niigata and the North Korean port of Wonsan. Lim, 30, who defected to South Korea in August and testified to the existence of underground missile launching pads in North Korea, was interviewed by the institute, which gained permission from the South Korean Government. Sato said Japan should ``realize its duty'' to place curbs on computer chips and COCOM-regulated products, as his institute's investigation indicates North Korea is ``now trying to downsize a missile warhead, so that the Nodong-1 missile could deliver a nuclear bomb to Japan.'' Sato, 64, charged Chongryun has exported ``key high-tech components North Korea needs for its war machine.'' Song Yong-bok, an official of Chongryun's Scientist and Engineer Association of Korean Residents in Japan (SEA), denied Chongryun violated COCOM (Coordinating Committee for Export Controls) regulations. SEA is a group of about 170 Korean researchers working in Japanese universities and business companies. ``All the large cargo and luggage we have sent to North Korea from Niigata has cleared inspections at customs,'' he said. But Ikuo Misumi, senior inspector at the security export control division of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE, ``our ministry has not issued any instructions to Niigata customs to inspect the contents of each piece of luggage of passengers going to North Korea.'' Sato also urged the government to halt the annual flow of an estimated 60 billion yen in Chongryun's banking remittances and cash gifts from Korean residents in Japan to their relatives in North Korea, saying the money eclipsed the entire 1990 North Korean budget of 35 billion won. Tsutomu Nishioka, editor-in-chief of the institute's monthly news magazine, also said, ``although a ban on cash gifts to North Korean relatives may raise humanitarian problems, to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear missile should take precedence, as a nuclear attack would snuff out so many people.'' ``Many people are being forced to take along or send money as their relatives are taken hostage, whom Pyongyang has threatened to put into concentration camps or keep in detention, unless they handed over money,'' Nishioka said.
