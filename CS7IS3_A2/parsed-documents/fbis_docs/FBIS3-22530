The dreaded mosquito that plays hostess to the malaria parasite has left behind a toll of over 20,000 cases in Bombay this year. But city doctors are particularly alarmed about the growing incidence of falciparum, commonly known as cerebral malaria, which can be fatal if not detected early enough. While the Bombay municipal corporation (BMC) claims that there have been 2,400 cases and 14 deaths, doctors point out that many more deaths remain unreported. "Ten years ago malaria hardly ever necessitated a hospital admission," says Dr. Zarir Udwadia, who is affiliated to the Hinduja and Parsi General Hospitals. "Today I get one to two cases of falciparum in a week." Over the last few years, two things have happened. First, the mosquito of this particular strain has grown resistant to insecticides like DDT. Second, the parasite has developed an immunity to chloroquine, which is the most widely-prescribed and cheapest drug used to cure malaria. [Passage omitted]
