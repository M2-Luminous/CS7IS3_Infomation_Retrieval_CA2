The board member of the IG Metall Metalworkers' Trade Union was the only candidate to succeed former DGB Chairman Meyer, who died in May. Of the 565 delegates, 437 voted for Schulte. That is 75.7 percent. [passage omitted] In his inaugural speech, Schulte promised the trade unions that he wants to "lead and bring together." He said the major task of trade unions is to fight unemployment. They must manage to strengthen the DGB's ability to mobilize its members, while concurrently maintaining the ability to achieve compromises. [passage omitted] Klaus Kinkel, chairman of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], also considered the employment situation the most important issue of European policy. The Liberals know what unemployment is, Kinkel said, even if they are frequently denied that knowledge by the trade unions. Jobs cannot be created by decree. That is why the FDP advocates a labor policy oriented toward a market economy. Kinkel also spoke of "deregulation, privatization, and cutting bureaucracy," which met with much disapproval from the delegates. The FDP chairman praised the trade unions for moderate wage agreements concluded this year. He said he hopes this standard will also be applied in the talks on privatizing the German Post Office. New, future-oriented technologies play a large role in creating new jobs, Kinkel said. He once more called for a simplification of the social system. It is a matter of restructuring, not abolishing, the welfare state. Regular jobs must be given precedence. The FDP will not accept blame for being "socially insensitive," Kinkel said. A number of trade union chairmen contributed to the debate on the DGB's annual report. IG Metall Chairman Zwickel criticized the DGB for not having a clear social concept. Zwickel said this is no criticism of Engelen-Kefer, DGB's social politician, but trade unions should increasingly agree on common policies that are then to be made binding for all. "We will remain the haunted ones if we do not comment on major topics," Zwickel said. Media Trade Union Chairman Hensche also made the criticism that the trade unions are just drifting along, without developing their own political alternatives. "We are not exactly going from strength to strength," Hensche said. Hensche very fiercely criticized the policy of the Federal Government. Constantly blaming the trade unions of fighting for possession means accusing "the possessions of those who do not have any." "This country is not heading toward a crisis because the poor have become too rich," Hensche sneered. Modifying [Immanuel Kant's] categoric imperative, Hensche coined a "social imperative." It should read: "Do not demand any sacrifices from others that you are not prepared to make yourself." Sarcastically, Hensche recommended that the chancellor should work in public service at 80 percent of the pay earned by the lower wage classes in western Germany. Postal Trade Union Chairman van Haaren repeated his rejection of the second postal reform. Contrary to the "privatization ideologists," he fears that the privatization of the post office will destroy jobs instead of creating them. The Federal Government must keep the majority of share capital in the post office; the public tasks of the Federal Post Office have to be maintained, irrespective of its legal form; and the postal holding must maintain a clear responsibility for control and coordination. The conference adopted a motion calling on Bundestag deputies not to agree to the postal reform unless these conditions have been met.
