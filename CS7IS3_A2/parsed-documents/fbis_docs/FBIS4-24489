Lien made the remarks when meeting Nikolai I. Ryzkov, former prime minister of the Soviet Union, who arrived in Taipei Friday for a week-long visit. As the ROC and CIS economies are of a complementary nature, more cooperative ventures between the two sides should further benefit both, Lien said, adding that the CIS' high technologies and abundant natural resources would be a boon to the ROC, whose experience in economic development could be helpful as a model for the CIS as it charts a course toward a more open economy. Ryzkov, who hopes to establish communication channels between the CIS and the ROC during this trip, agreed with Lien, saying there is still ample room for growth in all fields between the two sides, and that Taipei and Moscow should immediately begin trade and economic cooperation as a first step to establishing a full-range of cooperative ties.
