This is a period where the CPP and the various political forces pledge jointly and resolutely to defend their independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and rebuild Cambodia toward a glorious future. At the same time, the Cambodian people nationwide and the international community have paid and are paying keen attention to the efforts of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, as it braves all big and small obstacles in all areas, political, military, public order, economic, and social affairs, to rebuild Cambodia. On this excellent occasion, on behalf of the CPP, I would like to extend best wishes to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman. May His Majesty recover from illness quickly so as to speedily return to the motherland and may he enjoy a long life of over 100 years so as to continue being the cool shade for his children, grand children, and great-grandchildren. May Her Majesty Queen Norodom Monineat Sihanouk enjoy the five blessings of Lord Buddha on her 58th birthday. Also from this podium, I would like to most sincerely thank all venerable monks, CPP members, and beloved compatriots for all their sacrifices for the cause of the nation and people. At the same time, I bow my head in homage to the souls of millions of our people who lost their lives in a most pitiful manner under the genocidal regime and to the souls of those killed in preventing the return of this regime. May all those souls rest in peace. I also beg those souls to help the Cambodian people in their efforts for peace and survival. Beloved samdechs, princes, excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen, in the past 43 years, the CPP has valiantly gone through historic stages of struggle and a thousand and one difficulties and achieved many big victories in Cambodian history. Looking back on CPP's record, all of us will never forget that from the day it was born to the present, the CPP has always adhered firmly to its ideals of standing with the people, sharing their weal and woe, and maintaining close links with them in all circumstances in order to serve the supreme interest of the people and nation, and defend national independence, territorial integrity, and culture. For example, for three years, eight months, and 20 days the country was plunged in the peril caused by the Pol Pot genocidal regime -- the most cruel and barbarous in the history of Cambodia and mankind. During this time, the CPP was the only party that dared to rise up and struggle and make lofty sacrifices against this wicked regime by leading the great united movement of the entire national forces in the rank of the Kampuchean National United Front for National Salvation, and to topple it on 7 January 1979m, ushering in a new era of independence, freedom, and democracy. In the past 14 years, 1979-93, the CPP has continued to lead the movement to defend and build the country bare-handedly. While preventing the return of the genocidal regime, our party has proceeded with the restoration of the country from the heaps of ashes left by the genocidal regime, and thus enabling our country to revive gradually. The history of our Cambodian nation has recorded the big achievements of our CPP of the past over a decade, that is: 1. It has rescued our motherland and people from the genocidal peril and prevented the return of this wicked regime. 2. It has enabled our national society to revive and develop in all fields with national independence and sovereignty. 3. It has brought back and enhanced the people's democratic rights and freedoms and the nation's honor, pride, and prestige lost during the Pol Pot regime. 4. It is the decisive factor bringing about national reunification and peace to the motherland and people. For example, since 1987, while inciting the movement for national defense and construction, the CPP has actively implemented, through several negotiating forums, its national reunification policy with the sincere assistance of the international community and the contribution of various Cambodian parties, particularly its successive concessions, until the Paris Agreements were signed on 23 October 1991. In implementing the Paris accords, our CPP braved many tense and complex situations and closely cooperated with the United Nations and the various political parties to enable the process to succeed. After the elections, the CPP continued to implement everything strictly by putting aside some of the problems that arose out of the elections. This was in cooperation with the political parties which won seats in the National Assembly, until a democratic constitution was drafted as the foundation for national reunification, democracy, and national development in the future. Now, our country has a coalition government formed between our CPP and the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP]. This is the legal and internationally recognized Royal Government that responds to the sacred interest of the nation and people. All in all, in its historic mission, the CPP has learned from its valuable experiences. The CPP has a correct leadership line which is neither left or right, but which is mainly in keeping with the realities of the country, the people's aspiration, and the world trend of each period. The CPP always has close links with the people and shares their weal and woe for the supreme interest of the nation and people. The CPP forever upholds the front's banner to rally the national union and all patriotic forces, regardless of their past, to jointly build the country. The CPP firmly adheres to the genuine patriotism, maintains close links with the broad international solidarity, and wishes to have good ties with all countries for the cause of peace, stability, and cooperation on the basis of peaceful coexistence. The CPP always remembers and inscribes in history the support and assistance given by the fraternal parties and peoples and friends near and far to the Cambodian people in their just and correct struggle. Beloved samdech, princes, excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen, the present mission of the CPP is to join various political forces in Cambodia to bring about national reconciliation, to consolidate political stability, and build a liberal democracy in line with the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC], which will serve as a firm foundation for national reconstruction and development. In this connection, the CPP continues to maintain and expand its alliance with the FUNCINPEC headed by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, that serves as the core of national unity and social stability to mobilize the combined forces of the entire nation against all complex problems, to move toward successfully implementing the Royal Government's political program. But the threat of the genocidal regime's return still exists. The Khmer Rouge, which has refused to implement the Paris Agreement and rejected the present legal Royal Government is continuing with its destructive activities against the innocent, harming them and their property and wrecking national property. Recently, the Royal Government had displayed its goodwill by taking part in the roundtable negotiations with the Khmer Rouge held under the king's advice and the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia, to urgently seek an unconditional and permanent cease-fire in the land of the Kingdom of Cambodia. But the two roundtable negotiations have failed due to the preconditions set by the Khmer Rouge. At the same time, there has been news and the exploitation of this news by a group of individuals. This has been done with the aim of (?misleading) public opinion, upsetting political stability, sabotaging the achievements and success made so far in seeking a solution to the Cambodian problem, and particularly destroying the KoC Constitution, -- the excellent achievement made through the efforts of the entire nation and international community. All this news might cause some misunderstanding concerning the CPP and its leaders. The CPP has emphasized its stand to the national and international opinion through its 23 June 1994 statement. It says the CPP regards the KoC Constitution as the excellent achievement of the entire Cambodian nation and the international community, which has given immense and sincere assistance to our nation. Truly, this excellent achievement could be realized because of the excellent leadership of the esteemed His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, under whose leadership our nation has already achieved success [words indistinct]. This is reflected, for example, by the activities of the present three-party Royal Government. The parties are cooperating more closely each passing day in managing national affairs. For this reason, the CPP pledges to resolutely oppose all Khmer Rouge attempts to sabotage the KoC Constitution by demanding the dismantling of the National Assembly and the Royal Government born of the elections and the formation of a new government that includes the Khmer Rouge. If we yield to such a demand by the genocidal elements who sabotaged the Paris Agreements, who boycotted and vandalized the elections, and who are continuing to destroy the nation, it would be tantamount showing serious contempt of the Cambodian people nationwide and a heavy blow to the outcome of the UN operations in Cambodia. In this connection, the CPP would like to stress that as in the past, its present and future stand is to always to respect the KoC Constitution, which the Cambodian people of all generations to come are duty-bound to strengthen and expand on all its achievements in order to lead the country toward prosperity. Therefore, the solution to all the present problems, including the problems arising from misleading news, must be in line with the KoC Constitution. The CPP would like to express its active support for the prominent initiative of the U.S. Government and other governments and circles across the world in deciding to set up an office to study and compile data on the genocidal crimes of the Khmer Rouge against the Cambodian people and other nationalities in order to bring them to trial. The CPP regards this decision as a most valuable search for justice for the Cambodian nation and all mankind. Availing myself of this auspicious occasion, I would like to express, on behalf of the CPP, My deepest thanks to all countries near and far and the international community for supporting the Cambodian people's just cause. On the CPP's 43d founding anniversary, from 28 June 1951 to 28 June 1994, I would like to appeal to all members and compatriots to continue striving to successfully fulfill all tasks assigned by the people and motherland, in particular, to contribute actively to implementing the Royal Government's political program; to effectively solve the people's requests and grievances; to mobilize forces to firmly defend localities, villages, and communes; and vigorously stimulate the rainy-season production drive in a timely manner. As for the party members who are officials in all state institutions, mass organizations, and non-government organizations, you must closely cooperate with the officials of the other parties, and surmount inertia by upholding creative ingenuity and setting good examples on work and lifestyles for the people. Also on this occasion, I would like to appeal to the officers and men in the ranks of the Khmer Rouge to think of the interest of the nation and people because the policy of the Khmer Rouge leaders only bring tragedy to the people, religion, and nation. Therefore, you should quickly return to the national society and to your families. The quicker the better, so as to jointly build and make our beloved motherland prosperous as quickly as possible. In conclusion, I would like to extend my best wishes to samdechs, princes, Supreme Patriarchs, all venerable monks, excellencies, ladies, gentlemen, and all international guests. May you enjoy the five blessings of Lord Buddha for longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. Thank you. [applause]
