The letter reads: Esteemed Mr. Akashi, the behavior of Russian soldiers on their arrival in Sarajevo caused dissatisfaction among the citizens, and -- I believe -- damaged the reputation of the UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On their arrival they demonstrated support for the aggressor and behaved in a way which reminded us of some earlier ugly periods. Our people took all this as a provocation which could have turned into an incident. Bearing this in mind, it is my duty to inform you that we do not agree to the arrival of more Russian troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that decisions to this effect should be postponed. We ask you to inform the competent UN officials about our position on this issue, Alija Izetbegovic says in his letter.
