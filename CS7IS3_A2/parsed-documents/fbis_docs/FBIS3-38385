Knowing that they have little chance of receiving asylum here in Sweden, these refugees have been trying to find asylum elsewhere before being sent back home. Radio Sweden's Christopher Folick reports from the Danish capital: [Folick] In the past few months, some 500 Kosovo Albanians from Sweden have been turned back from Denmark's borders with Germany, mainly from Danish ferries arriving in north German ports and the Germans last week began gradually imposing a system of fines of up to 5,000 marks on transport companies caught carrying illegal refugees into Germany from Denmark on trains, ferries, and buses. The new reinforced checks will mainly focus on ferries from Sweden and to Germany, as the refugees tend to mainly use them to get to Denmark en route for Germany. [passage omitted] The tidying up of Danish controls stems from Germany's recent restriction and means that extra Danish border police have been put in mainly at the ports of Helsingor, Copenhagen, and Frederikshavn, the main entry points into Denmark for ferry traffic from neighboring Sweden and Norway, as well as at exit ports to neighboring Germany. The Danish move means primarily an intensification of spot checks on all incoming travelers from Sweden and Norway and will last for an initial three-months period whereupon further consultations with Germany will be carried out and the situation reviewed. Christopher Folick for Radio Sweden in Copenhagen.
