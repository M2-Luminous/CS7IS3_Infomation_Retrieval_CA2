XXXX Type of valve (check)? 8.4.2.1␣manual XXXX 8.4.2.2␣Check valve XXXX 8.4.2.3␣RCV XXXX 8.4.2.4␣ACV XXXX 8.5␣Were these valves installed to comply with 49 CFR 195.260 (e) or (f) 10 (Y/N)? XXXX 10 49 CFR 195.260 (e) requires valves to be installed on each side of a water crossing that is more than 100 feet wide from high-water mark to high-water mark. 49 CFR 195.260 (f) requires valves to be installed on each side of a reservoir holding water for human consumption. 8.6␣Were these valves EFRDs (RCVs or check valves)(Y/N)? XXXX 8.7␣Was there a leak detection system or systems operating on the pipeline which experienced the release␣␣ (Y/N)? XXXX (specify each type): 8.7.1␣Pressure wave front monitoring? XXXX 8.7.2␣Volume monitoring? XXXX 8.7.3␣Other (specify)? XXXX 8.8␣Indicate for each activity the time to shut down the pipeline 8.8.1␣Detection time (mins.)? XXXX 8.8.2␣Shutdown time including shutdown of pumping stations and isolation of the pipeline section (mins)? XXXX 8.8.3␣Time to drain the pipeline section (mins.)? XXXX 8.8.4␣Total time to shut down pipeline from the time release was detected to completion of drainage from the section involved (mins.)? XXXX 8.9␣If the pipeline section did not contain EFRDs, would the installation of EFRDs have reduced the shutdown time and/or amount of the release (Y/N)? XXXX 8.9.1␣If ``yes'', by how much for each (estimate)? 8.9.1.1␣The total shutdown time of 8.8.4␣(mins.)? XXXX 8.9.1.2␣Amount of the release (bbls.)? XXXX 8.9.2␣If ``no'', why not? XXXX XXXX XXXX 8.10␣What was the total estimated cost of the release including_ 8.10.1␣Cost of repair or replacement of pipeline facility? $ XXXX 8.10.2␣Cost of product lost? $ XXXX 8.10.3␣Cost attributed to loss of use of the pipeline? $ XXXX 8.10.4␣Cost of damage to property other than the pipeline? $ XXXX 8.10.5␣Cost of bodily harm and/or loss of life (For analytical purposes, loss of life is valued at $2,500,000 and significant bodily harm reported per Section 195.50(e) is valued at $450,000)? $ XXXX 8.10.6␣Cost of environmental clean-up (whether or not paid by the operator)? $ XXXX 8.10.7␣Estimated cost of damage to the environment, i.e., natural resource damage, assessed by a court or State agency (exclusive of clean-up cost)? $ XXXX 8.10.8␣Cost of litigation? $ XXXX 8.10.9␣Other costs? (specify) $ XXXX 8.10.10␣Total cost? $ XXXX 8.11␣How far from the release did the commodity enter a body of water (miles)? XXXX 8.12␣Were there other areas of risk, other than a body of water, affected by the release (Y/N): 8.12.1␣Urban area? XXXX If yes, distance from release (miles) XXXX 8.12.2␣Rural area in proximity to population? XXXX If yes, distance from release (miles) XXXX 8.12.3␣Other (specify) XXXX Distance from release (miles) XXXX 8.13␣Were there one or more public water intakes affected by the release (Y/N)? XXXX 8.13.1␣If the answer to question 8.13␣was ``yes'', how many? XXXX 8.13.2␣For each response to 8.13.1, approximately how far was the public water intake downstream from where the release entered the body of water (miles)? XXXX 8.13.3␣Did high river flow due to flooding affect the release reaching the water intake(s)(Y/N)? XXXX Valves Installed Per 49 CFR 195.260 (e) & (f) As stated previously, 49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f) require valves to be placed on hazardous liquid pipelines in order to protect water. 11 The March 1991 EFRD study proposed that the RSPA obtain public comment on whether the valves at these locations should be EFRDs. The next series of questions are posed to obtain data to make that decision. 11 See footnote #10.
