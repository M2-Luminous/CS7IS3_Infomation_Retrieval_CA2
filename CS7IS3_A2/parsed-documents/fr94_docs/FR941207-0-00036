FR941207-0-00036 FR941207-0-00003 Attachment IV_Credit Conversion Factors for Off-Balance-Sheet Items for Bank Holding Companies * * * * * Credit Conversion for Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Contracts 1. The credit equivalent amount of a rate contract is the sum of the current credit exposure of the contract and an estimate of potential future increases in credit exposure. The current exposure is the positive mark-to-market value of the contract (or zero if the mark-to-market value is zero or negative). For rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract the current exposure is the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of the contracts included in the netting contract (or zero if the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative). The potential future exposure is calculated by multiplying the effective notional amount of a contract by one of the following credit conversion factors, as appropriate: ␣ 1Remaining maturity 1Interest rate contracts (percent) 1Exchange rate contracts (percent) One year or less 0 1.0 Over one year 0.5 5.0 2. No potential future exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two floating indices, that is, so called floating/floating or basis swaps. The credit exposure on these contracts is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen days or less are excluded. Instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin are also excluded.
