The actual scope of the environmental problem is now becoming clear. A company located at the wild coasts of northern Scotland is offering a solution. "After World War II alone, 65,000 tons of chemical weapons from German, British, American, Italian, Hungarian, and Russian origin were dumped into the Baltic Sea," says Bill Batey from the heavily protected nuclear facility of the British Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) at Dounreay, a privatized nuclear technology company. "Ammunitions were dumped also in the waters surrounding the UK and the Bay of Biscay. Now, after nearly 50 years, the shells start decaying and the release of highly toxic materials into the atmosphere is becoming a real threat." Electrolysis Batey's team of scientists have filed an international patent application for an environment-friendly chemical degradation process that can be applied to all explosives and chemical weapons such as mustard and nerve gases. They claim that the process destroys these substances without having to incinerate or detonate them. Incineration and detonation are unacceptable methods for environmental and cost reasons. Batey is heading a division responsible for decommissioning nuclear reactors and managing radioactive wastes. Initially, the process was developed as an environment-friendly way to degrade low-level liquid radioactive waste. It is based on electrolysis and decomposes hazardous materials into the harmless substances CO2, water, NOx, and a small amount of acids, without any side effects. Batey: "We use silver as catalyzer for degrading organic phosphor compounds, which are found in explosives as well as in the nerve gases VX, Tabun, Sarin, and Soman. These are the gases mostly used by the United States, Russia, and the UK. To destroy chlorine compounds used in mustard gases, we use ruthenium as catalyzer." The AEA entered into a joint venture with the Aberdeen-based company SubSea Offshore, which will implement its experience and specialist techniques to track and haul up the dumped ammunition and degrade it on board of a special vessel using the Dounreay method. According to Mark Vorenkamp, an American of Netherlands origin and director of the subsidiary SubSea Survey, "the AEA process is still in the laboratory stage, but plans are to integrate the electrolysis unit into mobile equipment which can be taken to the site of operations. It will be called `Electrochemical Oxidation System,' abbreviated ECOS." Billion-Dollar Market In the meantime, SubSea has already acquired an advanced sea-bed research ship from the British Navy. The disposal of the gigantic military "inheritance" from the past century constitutes an $8-billion market over the next 10 years. This market is more or less evenly divided between Europe, North America, and the former USSR. Not only old ammunition will have to be destroyed. According to the Chemical Weapons Convention, all chemical weapons will have to disappear worldwide. This will be done under the auspices of a UN organization to be established in The Hague. Together with SubSea, AEA has contacted the Chemical Warfare Center of the British Ministry of Defense in Porton Down, which will conduct further tests with the ECOS installation. Another British military center had already proved its efficiency with explosives. Conferences The large number of conferences and symposiums on the disposal of ammunition organized primarily in Germany indicates that it is becoming a pressing problem. This week, for instance, the northern German city of Muenster held a seminar on "Crossborder Environmental Problems Caused by Military Activities" of NATO and former Warsaw-Pact countries. Last month, the same city of Muenster hosted another conference on old chemical ammunition organized by the German Army and the Swedish SIPRI [Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]. In Munich, Deutsche Aerospace and an American interest group [not further identified] sponsored a conference on the removal of military pollution.
