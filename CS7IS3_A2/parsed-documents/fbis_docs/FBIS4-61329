Slezevicius: 'We Will Stand the Test of Power'"] [Excerpt] As we have already reported, Adolfas Slezevicius, the country's prime minister and chairman of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], paid a visit to the TIESA editorial office. Today, we are publishing his replies to the questions from TIESA reporters. [TIESA] The public is currently being incited by the possible interpellation to the government. The document was signed by representatives of an interesting coalition -- the Social Democrats, the Nationalists, the Democrats, and even two members of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction. How could you explain the activeness of the Social Democrats, although the programs of the two parties are similar, and particularly the move of K. Jaskelevicius and A. Ivaskevicius [LDDP members]? [Slezevicius] I have said and can repeat that an interpellation is a constitutional right. Not being numerous and having few representatives in the Seimas [parliament], the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party sometimes wants to attract the attention of others. This may be correct from the viewpoint of the party. However, the frequent change of governments -- ours is the sixth one -- is damaging to the country's stability and economic reform. I have read the Social Democrats' documents and I know who drafted them -- I have not found any original proposals as to how to improve the situation. The Social Democrats are extremely envious of LDDP efforts to become a member of the Socialist International. This may imply the desire to prove that there can be no close cooperation between the two parties. This may also mean a hint at a coalition. The fact that the chairman of the LDDP, which won the elections, is the head of the government means the first attempt to follow the course of Western democratic tradition. According to this model, party members in the Seimas faction should observe discipline because otherwise they could be recalled. Unfortunately, Lithuania is still a "unique" country or, in other words, the "land of wonders." Therefore, even an LDDP Council Presidium member can sign an interpellation to the government headed by the party leader. There are some LDDP members who do not fit in the faction, while the procedure of recalling is not defined. We will, probably, begin to implement the latter only after the elections to local governments. At the same time, I would like to admit that the advocates of the interpellation also voice justified criticism. The government's work has shortcomings, and we see them. Not everything is done by fixed deadlines. However, we do have a program and preserve the key trends in our work. Thus, in my opinion, it is beneficial to the country that the activities of the government are corrected and that governments are not changed. [TIESA] Many people notice that while in power, the LDDP is beginning to follow the policy of Sajudis in the former Supreme Council, when internal strife turned it into a minority. Might it happen that early elections will be inspired by the majority itself rather than the opposition? [Slezevicius] I am far from such pessimism. We have diverse and smart people in the Seimas. We do not need an amorphous monolith. On the other hand, it is regrettable that sometimes the actions of LDDP representatives cause much joy to the opposition and its press. A split in the LDDP ranks has been predicted and expected for a long time. I suppose, however, that we will stand the test of power. [TIESA] Hardly anyone can tell today, approximately what part of the necessary taxes is collected by the government -- maybe, one-fourth or 60 percent. This must be the most pressing problem of the day. Failure to resolve it will increase the disproportion between the rich and the poor, and will continue to harm the least protected social groups. What does the government intend to do to collect at least the major part of taxes? [Slezevicius] I would not like to use the term "to collect taxes." State-conscious citizens should pay taxes themselves. Unfortunately, this problem is really pressing. Illegal trade in smuggled alcohol and tobacco has reached dangerous proportions in all aspects. It demoralizes society and encourages chaos on the market. Local producers cannot compete, while smugglers, certainly, do not pay taxes. However, we will not eradicate this problem by one resolution or another. We require an entire set of coordinated measures. Throughout the civilized world, 90 percent of tax money comprises four taxes -- the value added tax, the taxes on incomes of physical and juridical persons, and excise duties. The creation of a similar system is nearing completion in Lithuania. Subsequent moves that we will have to make are to enhance the responsibility for the non-payment of taxes and strengthen the operation of inspection offices. We are already demanding great responsibility for contraband. It will be necessary to reinforce the economic police which will have to cooperate with the tax inspection. Therefore, the economic police will receive additional staff in the near future. Privileges which we have granted to insolvent enterprises by canceling the deadline for paying taxes pursue one goal -- to retrieve taxes owed to the state, even though later. We intend to impose order in the register of enterprises in the immediate future. Currently, we have 110,000 economic entities registered, while taxes are paid by a considerably smaller number of enterprises. Entrusting the register to the Finance Ministry, it would be much easier to control the payment of taxes. We are also considering the possibility of assigning this task to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. However, we doubt whether social organizations will manage to fulfill those functions efficiently. [TIESA] We will have to apply the bankruptcy law sooner or later. It is this measure that will allow us to replace an inefficient manager of an enterprise with an efficient person, restructure the economy, and make production more effective. The government's hesitation is understandable, because the announcement of the bankruptcies of all insolvent entities would mean mass unemployment. However, we will have to bring ourselves to do this at some time. When will this moment come? [Slezevicius] We have already announced bankruptcies of 10 enterprises. Certainly, this, as well as the unemployment rate, does not reflect the actual situation. However, the initiative for bankruptcies should come from creditors. The government's task is to facilitate this procedure. We have already accomplished this in principle. [TIESA] However, it is the government who is this creditor most often. Before 1 March, the debt of economic entities for unpaid taxes to the budget was about 0.5 billion litai. Who should begin the bankruptcy procedure for such enterprises? [Slezevicius] The current debt to the budget has really exceeded 0.5 billion litai. Moreover, the "Sodra" [state insurance company] budget did not receive another 130 million litai. However, formulating the problem in this way, we should state our goal: Do we want those 200 insolvent enterprises to go broke, although many of them are already getting back on their feet, have found their place in the market, and have chances for repaying the debt in the near future, or do we want to cancel the deadline for their debt and wait until the money returns to the budget, albeit later? The government has chosen the second way. One must bear in mind that half of all unpaid revenues accounts for interest. Thus, we have proposed to enterprises to reach agreements with tax inspections so that the latter cancel the payment of taxes and do not charge any interest during that time. Having done this, we should receive about 170 million litai in budget revenues this year alone, which we would otherwise have to write off. The budget deficit is estimated at exactly this sum. Furthermore, this will help enterprises overcome the shortage of working capital which is the outcome of hyperinflation. [TIESA] Will not the tying of the litas to the U.S. dollar impair Lithuanian exports? [Slezevicius] I think that such fears are totally unfounded. On the contrary, a stable currency will promote investments in production, enhance the latter, as well as the possibilities of exports. [TIESA] Agriculture will not survive without support. Who and how much will you support? [Slezevicius] We cannot say today what farms and of what size will be effective in Lithuania. Farmers themselves and the market must reply to this question. The government must create conditions for the emergence of genuine owners and a real market. I believe that the president was right in returning the land law to the Seimas, one clause of which envisions the nationalization of land that has no owner. This law is the last one among those on land reform and it must be precise. The issue of support is even more complicated. It is all very well to subsidize farmers for the governments of those countries where their produce accounts for some 5 percent of the GNP, and a large part of it is sold on the domestic market. Our agriculture produces almost half of the GNP, and about two-thirds of this produce is exported. Thus, we have no resources for subsidies. Even if we had, are prices for exports worth reducing and consumers of other countries worth supporting? We are not the United States which can afford this. We understand perfectly well that Lithuania was, is, and will be an agricultural country. Farmers will not manage without government support. We will do this in two ways. First of all, we will protect our market from imported produce with customs duties. For example, Estonia is following another course, it has opened all borders to imported farm products. We will not leave our farmers, who have not yet reached the level of effective production of developed countries, to such a fate. The other way is to extend preferential credits. The government's task is to find and give them to the most promising producers. [TIESA] Rumors are again spreading about the reorganization of ministries. Some of them are to be merged, while others -- divided. Is this a principle, or do such decisions depend on personalities? [Slezevicius] Talk is usually more interesting and richer in imagination than in reality. We have adopted a decision concerning the division of the Ministry of Culture and that of Education and Science. The Environmental Protection Department, which was subordinate to the Seimas, will become a ministry. The Constitution does not envision deputy prime ministers, while reform issues are complicated. We propose two offices of state ministers. One of them would handle economic reform, and the other -- issues of local governments. I would like to reassure the tax payers that these changes will not increase the number of officials, and we will use only the money allocated from the budget. Certainly, I wish this reorganization sped up educational reform, improved the work of self-governments, upgraded privatization, and so on. [TIESA] The trial of the former Lithuanian Bank manager has just ended. Mr. Romualdas Visokavicius has been acquitted. LIETUVOS RYTAS commentator Rimvydas Valatka -- and the newspaper vouches for this respectable banker -- stated that these proceedings struck a crushing blow to your reputation. [Slezevicius] Mr. Valatka is particularly attentive to my person, and I am grateful for this. I do not know in what terms he measured this crushing blow, but I did not feel it. It is regrettable that all cases in our country acquire political clothing, and Mr. Visokavicius called himself even the cannon fodder of political games. The question of a LIETUVOS RYTAS reporter whether Mr. Visokavicius will apply for his restoration to work is strange. So is the banker's reply: "I do not know." The Seimas dismissed the manager not for the loan to the "Litimpex" bank but for the monetary policy that inflicted great losses on the country's economy. [TIESA] The political treaty on good-neighborly relations with Poland should be signed shortly. It should begin a new and mutually beneficial stage in cooperation between both countries. What are the relations with Russia and Belarus? [Slezevicius] Dialogue is under way, but it is not as fruitful as we would like. It is regretful that Russia is trying to restrict some agreements with new conditions. For example, the most favored nation status is still frozen. Russia wants to link it with the Kaliningrad Oblast issue. Mr. Yuriy Matochkin, leader of the Oblast Administration, has been authorized by the Russian prime minister to conduct negotiations with Lithuania. A meeting with him should take place in the near future. Cooperation with Belarus is impaired by the complicated political situation in that country. Quite a number of agreements have been submitted for signing. [TIESA] How often do you read TIESA? How do you assess it? Why does a newspaper which actually supports the current government have the most modest material conditions? [Slezevicius] Of course, I read it every day, and I find many interesting publications and readers' comments. I agree that TIESA today is more modest than other newspapers. There are several reasons. One of them is that the LDDP did not reward the paper as rapidly as did our opponents with the "state newspaper" [reference to LIETUVOS AIDAS]. [passage omitted]
