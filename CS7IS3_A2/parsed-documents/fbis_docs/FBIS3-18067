FBIS3-18067 "drweu039__a94058" FBIS-WEU-94-039-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 February 1994 ANNEX Spain Suggested Amendments to Labor Reform Outlined Parties Provide Proposals 94ES0259A Madrid EL PAIS in Spanish 17 Feb 94 p 15--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94ES0259A Madrid EL PAIS Language: Spanish Article Type:CSO [Article by correspondents Carmen Parra and Javier Rivas] [Text] Parliamentarians in People's Party [PP] and Convergence and Union [CiU] have divided up the task of promoting, albeit in softened form, some of the main CEOE [Spanish Employers Association] proposals on labor reform. The PP has tabled an amendment that would open the way to eliminating prior administrative authorization for dismissals. The Catalonian group, meanwhile, may introduce in the Senate a new intermediate category--"technically wrongful dismissal"--coinciding with a proposal from the employers' confederation. This measure is intended to lower employer costs associated with individual dismissals. The various parliamentary groups have presented a total of more than 500 amendments to the three legislative bills comprising the labor reform. Of the hundred or so amendments whose passage the PP group will advocate, the one with the greatest impact on flexibility in dismissals is embodied in a proposed change to the Statute on Workers. The PP wants all provisions pertaining to collective dismissals, temporary contract suspensions, and workweek reductions to be taken out of that statute and regulated instead by interconfederal accords--of all economic sectors--between management and labor. The amendment provides for "said accords to be adapted to community norms," which would in fact imply elimination of prior administrative authorization. The PP also wants--and in this it agrees with CiU--to eliminate automatic renewal of labor-management agreements, though it would leave in its place an eight-month extension to allow time for employers and workers to negotiate a new pact. CEOE opposes automatic renewal on grounds it produces "hyperemployment." Regarding dismissals, the PP group came up with a whole series of alternative amendments based on their own ideas and the employers' proposals. The initiatives ranged from minor to radical. It was Jose Maria Aznar himself, leader of the PP, who on bringing to a close the period for introducing amendments Tuesday afternoon [15 February] opted for a middle-of-the-road position, according to PP sources. CiU is going to wait for the Senate debate before deciding whether to present an amendment to create a new category of individual dismissal: "technically wrongful." Employees whose dismissal falls into this category, which covers layoffs of between one and nine workers, would be given less severance than the 45 days' pay for each year on the job that is currently paid in "wrongful dismissal" cases. The same category is also proposed in a thick CEOE document titled "Amendments to the Reform of the Statute on Workers," a collection of initiatives which employers have submitted to several Congressional groups. Miquel Roca, spokesman for the Catalonian group, alluded to this dismissal category last Tuesday, but his group decided to postpone its possible introduction until negotiations in the Senate are under way because, as CiU deputy Rafael Hinojosa said yesterday, "it's a controversial measure and needs more time to ripen." Parliamentary sources note that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and IU [United Left] together have enough votes to defeat the amendment in the Congress, though not in the upper house. Carlos Solchaga, head of the Socialist group, said on Tuesday that "in principle" the PSOE does not support the Convergence amendment. For the most part IU, the group that tabled the largest number of amendments--210--defended the proposals of organized labor. The group has asked that the leaders of the two largest labor centrals--Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez--and the secretaries general of the European Trade Union Confederation and the CIOSL [expansion unknown]--Emilio Gabaglio and Enzo Friso respectively--be asked to testify before Congress prior to committee deliberations on the bill. IU-IC [United Left-Catalonian Initiative] deputy Ricardo Peralta publicly offered to engage the socialists in a dialogue on the amendments of both groups, so that the reform will enjoy the "consensus support of labor's representatives who will have to administer it." The IU has justified almost all its amendments on grounds they represent "technical improvements," a formal bow to the PSOE, since the socialists have said they would consider only "technical" changes to their labor reform legislation.
