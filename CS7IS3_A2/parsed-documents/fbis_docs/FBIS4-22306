Nevzorov, the Deputy"] [Text] It has been said so many times--that combating crime is the No. 1 task. M. Gorbachev, B. Yeltsin, R. Khasbulatov, A. Rutskoy, and V. Chernomyrdin all said it. A. Nevzorov, "600 Seconds" anchor, has also devoted a considerable part of his life to combating crime--through television. Today he is a Duma deputy from St. Petersburg and member of its Committee on Security. [Nevzorov] The recipe for combating crime is extremely concise and sounds, shall we say, unacceptable to your democratic ears. It is called "Comrade Stalin." It is the only possible, 100 percent option for defeating crime. [Uglanov] Can you be more specific? Zhirinovskiy, for instance, believes it necessary to introduce courts martial. [Nevzorov] This is good when you have qualified executioners. They, unfortunately, also are in great shortage, because the executioners of the hated 1934 were guided by high ideological motives. Which are absent now. That society was healthy in comparison with ours. It was ugly, lopsided, but healthy. Now that all this social pus is oozing from every hole... [Uglanov] This is a general condition. I am interested in concrete steps. Would perhaps tightening the Criminal Code help? [Nevzorov] In the Committee on Security I oversee foreign intelligence. My task is to let it work unimpeded. As to Criminal Code articles and tightening them, it is not all straight and clear. S. Stepashin, for instance, came up with a proposal to make mercenarism a crime. But I will do everything I can to keep this article from getting into the Criminal Code in its current form. Can you, for instance, to draw a clear line between the notions of "mercenary" and "volunteer"? [Uglanov] It is probably a question of money, is it not? [Nevzorov] No. You arrive at the designated place. You are given a pea-jacket. It now costs 100,000. You eat a bowl of porridge. How much does this cost? If you add it all up, it comes to no less that the cost of having a Russian boy fighting in Karabakh. Therefore, even such attempts to tighten the Criminal Code are very imperfect. As to the recipe for combating crime, it does not and cannot exist. We are a criminal state. A state that entered a new level with the shelling of the parliament on 4 October. [Uglanov] In the past you were a television program anchor; now you are a lawmaker. Now your task is to prevent violations of the law rather than register them. [Nevzorov] I am at a loss here because, first, I cannot answer for the entire Committee on Security. Second, I deliberately agreed to be thrown into this line--intelligence--rather than combating crime. Because I am convinced that in this fight we are doomed to fail. Sooner or later we will still have to capitulate to them. And live through a situation where legitimized criminals will take power anyway. We cannot stop now. Do you see a way to stop, to win? I do not. [Uglanov] Regarding foreign intelligence. It has been headed for some time now by Ye. Primakov. Is it your goal to replace this man? [Nevzorov] No. Frankly, this is an area of activity, an area of applying one's abilities in which politics should have no place. Sympathies and antipathies are inappropriate here. Because the agency lives. It may be one-hundredth of the old strength, but it is still the successor to greatest intelligence service in the world. Primakov is far from the saboteur my "friends" in the opposition camp want to see him as. He is a very complex man. As I understand it, he is not an enemy of this country. [Uglanov] Regarding the Ames case. Could the disclosure of this Russian agent in the United States be the result of one of Ye. Primakov's deputies reporting it to the other side? [Nevzorov] Do you really think I will tell you anything? On top of everything else, I have signed an official nondisclosure pledge. [Uglanov] Where is your journalistic destiny heading now? [Nevzorov] I am lucky. I have an opportunity to "shed my skin." This is rare for a journalist. I have the opportunity now to look into things in depth and seriously, to build some new bridges. [Uglanov] What will happen to "600 Seconds"? [Nevzorov] I do not think that the program could be resurrected now in its old form. For the reason that I spend most of my time in Moscow now. [Uglanov] But do you have such plans? [Nevzorov] I think so. We have to sort out the story regarding bribes on Petersburg television. Unfortunately, I will not be doing it myself. And anyway, it would be strange for me, a State Duma deputy, to devote my time to petty bureaucrat B. Kurkova. To find out whether she stole anything or not. I think the proper organs will sort this out.
