"I am afraid they will shoot my husband," she told RAPPORT yesterday. While right-wing anger has been boiling over this week over Gen. Viljoen's decision to participate in the coming election, Mrs. Viljoen lifted the veil on warnings last Sunday that an assassination plot on her husband was being planned. Two telephone calls, in which Gen. Viljoen was told that an attempt could be made to assassinate him, led to the forming of a thick security cordon around the Viljoen couple while they relaxed on their farm near Ohrigstad. They were warned in two telephone calls shortly after their return from an excursion on the farm to inspect Dr. Viljoen's cattle. Soon thereafter, Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, who probably knew about the threats, phoned Gen. Viljoen. Almost immediately after the warnings a large number of men clad in "brown uniforms" and armed with rifles were employed on the farm to protect Gen. Viljoen. Mrs. Viljoen says she was unnerved by a foreign television crew which lingered unusually long on their farm and even hung around the farm dwelling. She was concerned that they too had heard about the threat and wanted to be on the scene -- should something happen. Gen. Viljoen, who is known for his bravery as a soldier, did not sleep at his usual place that night, but rather spent the night elsewhere. "I am afraid they will shoot my husband, but the Lord has a purpose for everything," a visibly concerned Mrs. Viljoen told RAPPORT yesterday. "It would be terrible if he had to go in this way, especially since the far right wingers are the people that he always wanted to protect." She is worried that there is not sufficient control over some right-wing elements. "Yesterday in Mmabatho they threw military discipline overboard and refused to accept his instructions." However, she finds solace in the new political direction her husband is heading in after his decision to take part in the election. Her husband -- "he is the most loyal man possible" -- has done all he could to bring about right-wing unity, but it has just not been possible.
