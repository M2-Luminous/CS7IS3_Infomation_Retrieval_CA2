Referring to press reports that Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi (of the Centrist Union, a close Berlusconi ally) is looking at an extension of plea bargaining and other measures, Justice Undersecretary Gian Franco Anedda said he was "absolutely against any reform of the penal code that will have the effect, or may be interpreted as having the effect, of easing the position of defendants being tried for crimes against public administration. All the more so if, in order to save them from jail once their guilt has been proven, an attempt is made to frame legislation that is preferential to all." "I clearly manifested my opposition, in harmony with the National Alliance line, when the Minister tasked the ministerial offices with drafting an organic proposal on the subject, which must still be examined and discussed. I therefore deem absolutely immature the possibility of a bill being presented to cabinet. Unless Minister Biondi means to take the initiative upon himself alone, something which I rule out." L'INDIPENDENTE, a paper normally seen as sympathetic to the government, featured most prominently this morning the latest alleged version of a "judicial solution" for the nationwide kickbacks scandal that has shaken the political and business establishments. "Biondi's Solution for Bribesville" was its main headline, over a summary of "a bill on extending plea bargaining, to be put to the cabinet shortly." Among the measures listed were: "plea bargaining extended to crimes carrying sentences up to three and a half years; defendants have six months to confess their guilt; kickback offenders are barred from public office for five years and forced to pay back their ill-gotten gains." "These norms will be valid for those who have already been sentenced under existing laws," it also highlighted. A collection of law adjustments seen by opponents as letting offenders off too lightly, by proponents as offering a much-needed "political solution" to Bribesville, was slapped down by a national "whitewash" outcry and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's refusal to endorse it at the height of the scandals about 15 months ago. Roughly 1,000 people, mostly politicians and businessmen, have been caught up in the Bribesville probes. The vast majority of the cases have yet to come to court, and magistrates are themselves in favour of streamlining procedures to avert what many fear will be serious system overload.
