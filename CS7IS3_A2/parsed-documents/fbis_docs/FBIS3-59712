In addition to the current situation concerning all-important epoxy resins, from the standpoint of recycling, the future possibility of thermoplastic engineering plastics will be covered. The survey consists of those on ``situations in raw materials,'' ``recycling,'' ``packaging and its technology,'' and ``trends in device and material makers.'' Demand and supply of raw materials, compounds, and package, as well as technical trends, of all-important epoxy resins and fine ceramics will be surveyed, and, at the same time, the potentials and future of thermoplastic engineering plastic and liquid cryustal polymer (LCP) will be explored. According to Kawasaki Research, the majority of semicondoctor sealing materials is made of high-purity novolak type epoxy resins, and, the annual world-wide consumption is said to range from 60,000 to 70,000 tons. Moreover, recently, underwater R&D activities, dealing with environmental problems and recycling, have been gathering momentum. Especially, ``thermoplastic engineering plastic whose properties are good enough to replace epoxy resins and whose effective utilization is feasible, has begun to attract attention,'' according to the Kawasaki representative. The survey will be put together as a report (A4, 200-250 pages) and issued on 25 November 1993. The number of members invited to participate on the multi-client method basis is 10 companies. The participation fee is Â¥500,000. Application for membership must be submitted by 10 October. After the number has reached 10, the company will stop receiving applications.
