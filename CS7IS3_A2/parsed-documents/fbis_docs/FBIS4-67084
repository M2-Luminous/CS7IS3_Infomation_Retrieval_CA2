He is gathering evidence to clarify the issue with all parties concerned: [Begin recording] [Thanong] I consulted with the people in Nakhon Phanom and the Chat Thai Party about resigning as an MP as soon as I heard the news reports. They told me there was no need to resign. I deny the charges; I insist that I am innocent of all charges. As soon as I learned of the news, I contacted my lawyer to fight the charges. I learned about the charges from newspaper, radio, and television reports. The house and the assets are not in my name. I am checking on what I am being charged with--maybe it has to do with failing to pay the house mortgage. I am gathering evidence. I still do not know what I am being charged with. [Question indistinct] [Thanong] I will clear the parliamentary issue. I will not allow the image of the House of Representatives, the Chat Thai Party, or the people of Nakhon Phanom to be damaged.
