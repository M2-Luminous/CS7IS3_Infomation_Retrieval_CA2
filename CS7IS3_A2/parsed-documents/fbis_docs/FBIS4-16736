The meeting was held behind closed doors, but some sources told Interfax it had focused on the finalization of a draft for a civic accord, a proposed agreement between reformists and hardliners to prevent violence. The same subject was discussed at a meeting of a working group including the leaders of all eight parliamentary groups, also held on Monday. Alevtina Fedulova, deputy chairwoman of the lower house of the legislature, said Yeltsin and the parliamentary group leaders were to consider the finalized draft of the accord at a meeting tentatively scheduled for April 22. But she said the meeting might be postponed if a draft taking account of all the suggestions and objections that had been made was not ready by that date. IF Note: Some sources told Interfax some of the objections were very serious. For instance, the Communist group, headed by Gennadiy Zyuganov, protests against one of the fundamental points in the draft, a clause in which the signatories would pledge not to make any amendments to the Constitution that might destabilize the political situation in the country. Extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said on Saturday that his Liberal Democratic Party would not sign the accord unless Yeltsin dismissed Anatoliy Chubays as deputy prime minister and chairman of the State Property Committee, Andrey Kozyrev as foreign minister and Viktor Yerin as interior minister.
