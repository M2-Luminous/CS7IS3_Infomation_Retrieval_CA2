FBIS3-5533 "dreas046__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo Seeks Petrochemical Plant Export to PRC OW0903063094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0903063094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will begin negotiations with China on exporting the Japanese petrochemical industry's substantial excess facilities to that country as a way of helping it develop its heavy chemical industry. The negotiations will mostly concern exporting plants for producing general-purpose plastic resins as well as ethylene, which is the basic material for making resins with. The negotiations are discussing plants for producing about 1 million tons converted into ethylene. A joint government-industry feasibility study mission will present a specific concept to the Chinese Government on 7 March. The MITI plans to back up the export of the petrochemical plants by making available credits from the Japan Export and Import Bank and by providing technological assistance through official development assistance (ODA) programs. The ministry wants to make this project a new theme in Japan's assistance to China, while hoping that this will help the Japanese petrochemical industry facilitate its lagging rationalization programs and reorganize itself. There have been instances of U.S. steel manufacturers exporting their steel production plants to China, but these deals have been made at the private-sector level, and this will be the first such example of government-to-government industrial cooperation. Many Asian nations are now hurrying to expand their steel and chemical industries, and it is likely that this will be a model case for production bases being moved out of Japan. The MITI sent a joint government-industry mission to China on 3 March. The industry is represented by seven major chemical companies including Showa Denko, Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, and the Sumitomo Chemical Company, plus several major trading companies. The mission will present on 7 March Japan's concept to officials of such Chinese Government offices concerned as the State Planning Commission and the China National Petrochemical Corporation. In China, in step with its growing economy, the demand for petrochemical products such as plastics and packing materials is growing fast, but China's annual domestic ethylene production capacity is now only 2.27 million tons. While annual imports of petrochemical products run to 1.7 million tons converted into ethylene, the shortages of facilities are only worsening. On the other hand, Japan, which has an annual ethylene production capacity of 7 million tons, has the problem of excess supply. As a result of decreased demand from the auto industry and the home electric-appliance industry caused by the economic recession, the total domestic demand has fallen to about 5 million tons, thus creating an excess capacity of nearly 2 million tons. As such, the MITI has come to believe that the excess capacity should be reduced by exporting some facilities to China. According to the concept of the MITI, plants for producing a total of 1 million tons -- translated into that amount of ethylene -- will eventually be exported to China. Specifically, plants owned by some Japanese chemical companies will be dismantled and then will be exported -- for reassembly in China -- at low prices as part of economic cooperation programs. Low-interest loans from the Japan Export and Import Bank will be made available as funds for purchasing the plants. The plants transferred will receive the benefit of technological cooperation under ODA programs, and technicians will be sent to China to train Chinese technicians in plant operations and maintenance. The mission will also propose to make the business of producing ethylene using the transferred plants a joint venture project between Japan and China. The idea is to turn the business into a government-industry joint project by using funds from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund as well as investment by private Japanese companies. The ministry wants to export several sets of plants -- most of them for producing ethylene. The MITI has already sounded out Japan's major manufacturers on this concept, and the manufacturers are taking the position of accepting it. The export deal is expected to be finalized within this year. The plants under consideration for export are those at the Chiba industrial complex, where Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, the Maruzen Petrochemical Company, and the Sumitomo Chemical Company have their production operations; in the Mizushima industrial complex (in Kurashiki city), which is operated by the Asahi Chemical Industry Company and Mitsubishi Petrochemicals; and in the Kawazaki industrial complex operated by the Tonen Chemical Company and the Japan Petrochemical Company.
