France also said it was examining the possibility of a UN Security Council resolution on the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde providing for an immediate ceasefire and deployment of UN peacekeepers, accompanied by a Serbian pullback "without delay and without conditions." Opening a National Assembly debate on Bosnia, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France would propose to its EU partners that Russia and the U.S. share the co-chairmanship of the Yugoslavia conference. "Each of the three main partners, the United States, Europe and Russia, must recognise that it cannot resolve the problem alone," Juppe said. The foreign minister also said the the Security Council resolution should call for an immediate ceasefire and "deployment on the ground of UN Protection Forces to separate the two communities." [passage omitted] "We must fix precise political aims for our action in Gorazde as was the case in Sarajevo," where the threat of NATO attacks forced back Serbian forces and lifted their siege, Juppe said.
