Lopez Alba report: "Polls Used by Government Show People's Party Two to Five Points Ahead of Spanish Socialist Workers' Party"] [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party [PP] currently has a 2-5 percent lead over the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in voting intentions, according to the polls used by the government. This lead is cut for predictions for the European elections, although polls carried out by the PP give it a lead in this case of between five and seven points. Elements in the PSOE believe that, after the European elections, [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez will have to change the composition of his government. Before it was the economic crisis, now it is corruption. According to all the opinion polls -- those used by the government and those commissioned by Jose Maria Aznar's PP -- while voting intentions for the PSOE continue to follow a downward trend, those for the PP continue to rise. The opinion polls the government is working with give the PP a two to five point lead in voting intentions if a general election were to be held now. However, government sources state that voting intentions were "somewhat better" when the people polled were asked how they would vote in the upcoming European elections on 12 June. This evaluation, however, contradicts the polls used by the PP. PP sources put its lead for the European elections at around five or six points, which would give it a cushion of 20 to 28 seats. It is clear from the government polls that the main cause of the Socialists' electoral decline is their loss of credibility resulting from the corruption scandals. In this respect, our sources indicate that, although the people polled can still not clearly see the signs of economic recovery, they are beginning to "feel" it. With regard to corruption, government sources admit that "at times we have reacted too slowly" in the face of corruption allegations. Despite the fact that the results of the polls are not very promising, the Socialists are confident that they can avoid the European elections being an electoral catastrophe with wider implications for the national political situation. Elements in the PSOE believe that, after these elections Felipe Gonzalez will have to reshuffle his cabinet to give fresh impetus to government action -- something that the Guerristas [Alfonso Guerra supporters] demanded after the federal congress. Representatives of the group headed by PSOE Deputy General Secretary Alfonso Guerra still believe that the inclusion of a Guerrista in the government would contribute to a faster healing of the party's open wounds. Certain Socialist leaders also believe that this government reshuffle should be followed by the decision to hold a vote of confidence in parliament, although this would mean forcing the Catalan Convergence and Union [CiU] party to again demonstrate its support for the Socialist government.
