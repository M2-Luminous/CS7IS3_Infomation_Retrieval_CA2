At a luncheon meeting at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Watanabe described customs inspections in this area as "lax." "Regarding the inspection of the carry-on baggage of Korean residents going to North Korea from the port of Niigata, inspections have been loose," said Watanabe, head of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party's No. 3 faction. "Bulldozers, for example, have been claimed as carry-on baggage on the vessels and have been brought back to North Korea." He maintained that such goods should be subject to more stringent inspections. Watanabe, concurrently deputy prime minister and foreign minister under former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, said that some Korean residents might have hidden high-technology products among cargo and luggage brought back to North Korea aboard a ferry from Niigata. His remarks followed raids by Japanese police in January on some trading houses and makers of high-technology products, accused of exporting to North Korea "spectrum analyzers" for radio waves that are included on the Cocom list of restricted technology. Cocom refers to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls. Press reports said North Korea might have used the equipment to upgrade the accuracy of the guidance system of its "Nodong" missiles. Watanabe said, "because Japan has laws to prohibit the outflow of high-technology products to North Korea, it should invoke the laws strictly." Watanabe urged Pyongyang to accept international inspection of two undeclared nuclear sites, on top of the seven declared nuclear facilities whose checkups it said it will accept. "Unless North Korea accepts inspections of the undeclared sites, it will never be able to clear up suspicions," about its alleged nuclear arms manufacturing program, he warned. "It is quite insufficient to allow the inspection only of the (seven) nuclear facilities it had earlier declared" to the IAEA, he said. Watanabe also urged the governing coalition not to take retaliatory measures against the United States, even if the administration of President Bill Clinton imposes the "Super 301" punitive trade rule. "Japan should not react emotionally," he said. "I can understand the U.S. frustration well, as Japan has run a chronic 50 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States."
