Laar emphasized that the talks between the two countries "have come to a deadlock" and "an impetus on a higher level than that of experts" is needed to break the deadlock. "Lately Russia has shown no wish to withdraw its troops from our country," the Estonian premier said. "We confront a political problem which will have to be solved by the top leaders of both countries." Laar voiced his hope that a meeting between the premiers or foreign ministers of the two countries will eventually take place, but he didn't consider it likely that the Estonian and the Russian presidents would meet any time soon. The Estonian-Russian negotiations reached an impasse after Russia announced at the 17th round of talks at the beginning of March that it may reconsider the final deadline for the troop withdrawal and linked the pullout to the signing of an agreement on "social guarantees" for retired Russian military and a number of other issues. Estonia then declared it may break off the talks. The parties did not set the date for the next round of negotiations. The Estonian Government proposed on March 4 that consultations on a higher level be held. Laar stressed in the interview to BNS that "the ball is now in Russia's court" and that "Russia must show how serious its intentions are." Meanwhile, Aleksandr Udaltsov, a high-ranking official at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in an interview to BNS on Wednesday [9 March] expressed doubt about the need to raise the level of negotiations, saying the government delegations of the two countries "haven't yet exhausted their potential." Udaltsov proceeded to say that the two parties "don't see eye to eye in questions of principle, and consultations would only make sense if there were a sign of some give and take, but Russia has seen no such signs so far." The Russian diplomat voiced his opinion that "there's no point in meeting for the sake of meeting." Laar regarded Udaltsov's statements as an indication that Russia's approach to talks with Estonia "isn't serious enough."
