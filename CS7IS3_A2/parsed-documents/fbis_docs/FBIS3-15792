Saburov, who had accepted Meshkov's offer to lead the Crimean government, made this statement in an interview with Interfax upon his return to Moscow from the Crimea, where he had stayed from February 22 through March 5. In his words, astounded by Meshkov's election to the presidency, Crimea's ex-premier and his deputies "have deliberately wrapped up all their affairs despite the need to organize the spring sowing campaign, prepare for the summer holiday season and resolve many urgent problems." "Thus, displeased with the popular vote in Meshkov's favour, the former Crimean leadership was ready to doom the Crimeans to hunger and cold which is nothing but political wickedness," Saburov declared. At the same time, he pointed to Meshkov's growing popularity among Crimean industrialists, "whose initial reaction to his election was cautious." Saburov underscored the danger of trying to make the Crimea submit to Ukraine by force. In his words, demands to resume ties with Russia are not nationalist by nature, yet they are essential since "Crimea's economy is oriented towards Russia rather than Ukraine," and the rupture of ties with Russia would be a disaster for Crimea. In Saburov's opinion, "with all the contradiction" in the law on the delimitation of powers between Ukraine and Crimea, "it is lucrative to Kiev, Simferopol, and Moscow alike." "If Kiev refrains from mounting barriers deliberately, he remarked, the Crimea could play the role of a bridge between Ukraine, Russia, and other former USSR republics." He gave assurance that in forming a Crimean cabinet he would rely on knowledgeable economists and responsible executives. "The selection process will be tough," he declared. Saburov noted that "a good understanding and interaction" had emerged between him and Meshkov. Speaking about the current situation in the Crimea, he said that the democrats there were trying to build a smooth democratic market economy." "Inside the Crimea, there are tough problems, but the problem of the Crimea is nonexistent," Saburov declared. In his view, the Crimea is a trump card for outside politicians. "I least of all mean Kiev," he added. According to the Crimean Constitution, the president is simultaneously the head of the republic's cabinet, and his deputy and other cabinet members are appointed by parliament, So far there has been no official decree on the appointment of Saburov to the post of deputy premier.
