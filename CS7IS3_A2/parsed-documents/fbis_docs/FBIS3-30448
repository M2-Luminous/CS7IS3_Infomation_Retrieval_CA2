Having signed the protocol, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and Dr. Velayati expressed their satisfaction with the talks held in Bulgaria which the head of Iranian diplomacy described as constructive. "There are good signs about the future development of Bulgarian-Iranian relations. They appear to have entered upon a new stage," said Dr. Velayati. Yesterday he was received by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. Under the agreement on trade and economic cooperation between the Governments of Bulgaria and Iran signed by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev and Iranian Deputy Minister of Trade Hoseyn Noqrehkar Shirazi, the two countries grant each other most favoured nation status. It is agreed to settle payments in convertible currency, to use some other forms established in trading and to set up a special joint commission on the problems of trade. The two foreign ministers said that the next session of the Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation which is due early in April in Sofia would be a major step forward in the development of relations between the two countries. "We hope the trade agreement will give an impetus to the promotion of Bulgarian-Iranian economic relations which have been on the decline over the last few years," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov told reporters after Dr. Velayati's visit ended. In addition to the issues concerning bilateral relations, Mr. Daskalov and Dr. Velayati discussed international problems, the situation in the Balkans and the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "It was a most useful exchange of opinions," Bulgaria's chief diplomat said. Answering a question if Dr. Velayati had assumed a commitment to support Bulgaria's request to the Islamic Conference Organization to take the issue of Bulgarian Muslims off its agenda, Mr. Daskalov said that the Iranian foreign minister was willing to do so. "Of course, this does not depend on Iran only but on all other members of the Islamic Conference Organization, however, Dr. Velayati hopes this would be possible," Mr. Daskalov said. According to the Bulgarian foreign minister, the incident, in which four Iranian citizens were shot dead last December while resisting arrest and two Bulgarian policemen were killed, was mentioned cursorily. "Both sides expressed their hope that the case will soon be clarified. The investigation has not been completed yet," Mr. Daskalov said. Invited to comment on a Tehran press publication alleging that Bulgaria has busted the embargo against ex-Yugoslavia and asked if it had been discussed with Dr. Velayati, Mr. Stanislav Daskalov stressed Bulgaria observes the embargo. "Indeed, there are attempted violations, which is understandable for a country neighbouring on the former Yugoslavia. But the issue was not discussed," the head of Bulgarian diplomacy said. Commenting on Iran's suggestion to build a transport route across Caucasus, Mr. Stanislav Daskalov said that it had already been discussed and that the two countries were ready to continue the talks. "Building the route, however, would largely depend on the situation in Georgia and Azerbaijan. The prerequisites for such a route are good transport conditions and peace," Mr. Daskalov said.
