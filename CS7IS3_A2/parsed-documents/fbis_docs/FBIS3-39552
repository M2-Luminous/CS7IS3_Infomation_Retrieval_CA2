EC Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the Community did not support the U.S. strategy to negotiate sectoral market shares with Japan because "there seems to be an element of managed trade in it." He was speaking at a press conference to launch a major export promotion campaign aimed at helping small and medium-sized European firms get a foothold on the Japanese market. The United States and Japan have been brought to the brink of a trade war because of Japanese refusal to accept numerical targets for increasing imports of American products. Brittan said the EC was nervous about the U.S. "numerical target" approach because American gains in Japanese market share could be at European expense. The EC, by contrast, is trying to make European goods more attractive to Japanese consumers, while at the same time trying to make Japan dismantle general barriers to foreign imports such as tax laws and cartels. Brittan suggested that the EC and the U.S. might work together in a "trilateral approach" with Tokyo to push exports to Japan and at the same time create an economic environment which would encourage Japanese consumer demand. But he stressed that the idea was still in its infancy, and not yet a firm proposal. Announcing the "Gateway to Japan" initiative, Brittan said: "We are pushing open the door to Japan.... We look to European businessmen to march through that gateway into the Japanese market." Penetrating the Japanese market might be difficult, he said, but was possible if the Europeans produced quality, properly-promoted products at the right price. The Commission said the "Gateway to Japan" programme would include workshops throughout the EC for medium-sized companies interested in testing the Japanese market, plus trade missions and displays in Japan. It is to concentrate during a kick-off 1994-95 phase on support for companies in the medical equipment and handling, mechanical handling, machine tools and furniture sectors. The programme is to be extended in 1995-96 to other fields, possibly including such sectors as marine equipment, construction materials and equipment, waste management technologies and packaging machinery. The Commission said these were sectors where European firms were particularly competitive, although underrepresented on the Japanese market. Brittan said the European Commission would finance the three-year campaign to the tune of ECU7.1 million (7.8 million dollars). It will be run by the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Euro-Chamber). The EC's trade deficit with Japan was 31 billion dollars in 1992 and 26 billion dollars in 1993. Brittan said EC sales to Japan between 1986 and 1992 had increased 78 percent faster than its world-wide exports, but that this trade had fallen off over the last two years. Euro-Chamber president Thomas MacPherson said: "This is a very major project. The message is that selling in Japan is not impossible. It can be profitable." The Commission also announced it was extending another annual scheme to boost EC-Japan trade -- by teaching Japanese to about 50 young European executives, then placing them in Japanese firms for six months.
