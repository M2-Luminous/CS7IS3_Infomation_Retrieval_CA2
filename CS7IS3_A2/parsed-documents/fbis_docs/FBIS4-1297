Mr Mandela said he had also talked to Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee and Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe. "I was convinced they want to put an end to the violence." Speaking at Hillbrow Hospital after visiting some of the victims of Sunday's Johannesburg blast, Mr Mandela said the proof of this would be in the implementation. "I am convinced tough measures if applied can bring these people to book. I hope what we discussed will be implemented firmly. I hope the government acts in a way to remove the impression it's a government of weaklings." Nine people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Sunday's car bomb explosion in Johannesburg. Twelve explosions in all have occurred since Saturday, including another massive blast at a Germiston black taxi rank on Monday morning which killed 10 people and injured 36. The ANC president said the security forces were doing the best they could in difficult circumstances and he hoped their response following his latest talks with the government "will raise the confidence of the public". The forces of peace were far stronger than those who wished to cause violence, he said. "We are one country and one people... I want you to look to the future with hope and confidence." People should turn up in large numbers to vote to show their defiance to those who did not want the elections. The country's first all-race election begins on Tuesday. Inside the hospital, Mr Mandela spoke to some of the victims of the Johannesburg blast including 29-year-old David Maimela, who told SAPA he was visiting his girlfriend when it occured. "I think it's very bad. It's not right to try to stop the elections. This is the first time we are going to vote." Mr Maimela's one ankle was fractured and his forehead was lacerated by shrapnel. Thirty-three-year-old Eric Ngxalose, short-order cook at a Midtown fast food outlet, was coming to work when the bomb, estimated to have comprised 70-90kg of explosives, went off. Mr Ngxalose's leg was injured. Mr Levy Khumalo, 51, was also hit by shrapnel. A resident of Jeppe Hostel, he was in town on Sunday morning to visit his children, who sell clothes in the city centre. Speaking through a Zulu interpreter, Mr Khumalo told SAPA he was shocked by the explosion. "I was not expecting that." He told nurses he did not want to see Mr Mandela, and his bed was curtained off when the ANC leader arrived.
