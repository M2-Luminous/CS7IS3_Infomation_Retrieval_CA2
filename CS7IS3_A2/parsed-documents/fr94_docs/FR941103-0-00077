There is an increase in VOC emissions in the Edmonson County nonattainment area. However, the emissions increase of 0.04 tpd is not expected to affect maintenance of the O 3 NAAQS in this rural area. EPA believes that these emissions projections demonstrate that the nonattainment areas will continue to maintain the O 3 NAAQS.

Verification of Continued Attainment Continued attainment of the O 3 NAAQS in the marginal nonattainment areas depend, in part, on the Commonwealth of Kentucky's efforts toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The Commonwealth of Kentucky's contingency plan is triggered by two indicators, the emissions inventory for interim years exceeding the baseline emission inventory by more than 10% or an air quality violation. As stated in the maintenance plan, the Cabinet will be developing these emissions inventories every three years beginning in 1996. These periodic inventories will help to verify continued attainment. Refer to the TSD for a more complete discussion of the indicators the Commonwealth is tracking and the contingency measures.
