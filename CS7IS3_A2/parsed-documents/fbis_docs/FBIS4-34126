The Labor Directorate of the city of Havana stated several of the categories included in Decree Law 141 approved in September 1993 are currently frozen in the capital. The directorate stated the rejections registered until the end of May were basically issued because the requests did not fulfill the requirements established by the Provincial Administration Council, which is in charge of this activity, and due to the bad social conduct of those making the requests. Driver for hire, preparer of light foods, gatherer-seller of agricultural products, and video operator are among the positions for which no new permits are being granted, although those who initially obtained licenses maintain permits to offer those services. The license for producer-sellers of flowers was withdrawn. According to the explanations by Provincial Labor Director Manuel Fernandez, in all cases the decision was made in order to preserve the state's interests and avoid harming the national economy.
