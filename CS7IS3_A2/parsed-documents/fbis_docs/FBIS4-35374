But there have been no indications that any of the factions with which he met in Amman has agreed to do so, despite the "tempting offer" he is carrying. Palestinian sources have told AL-HAYAH that the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has turned down "Fatah's tempting offer during Zaki's meeting with its leaders in Amman." And that it reemphasized its refusal to participate in the administrative self-rule authority. The sources added that the Fatah Central Committee member moved to Damascus yesterday, where he met with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], and Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He briefed them on Fatah's position on the Cairo accord and asked them to participate in the self-rule authority on the basis of shares equal to Fatah's in order to rebuild the negotiation process in accordance with international legitimacy. The DFLP secretary general emphasized that the weapons of the national forces opposed to the Oslo accord "will remain their hands and will never be subject to any bargaining as long as there is occupation and settlers." Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas representative in Jordan, said that the movement has turned down "an official offer" from the PLO to participate in the self-rule authority on an equal footing with Fatah. Nazzal said that the offer was presented during his meeting in Amman with Zaki, "who told me that he had been sent by the Palestinian leadership and Yasir 'Arafat personally. He offered us participation in the authority on the basis of seats equal in number to those of Fatah." He added that Hamas' reply to the offer after consideration was "the complete refusal to participate in this authority, because the movement is against the (self-rule)" accord. It also considers the Palestinian authority a tool in the hands of the occupation, not a real authority."
