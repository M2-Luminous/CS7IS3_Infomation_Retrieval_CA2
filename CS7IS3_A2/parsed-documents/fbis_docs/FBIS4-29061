"Assessing the most recent statistics, possibility is strong that the economy has moved one step forward toward a recovery from my recent assessment that it is showing signs of bottoming out," Mieno told a regular press meeting in repeating his earlier comments. "But we must carefully watch the sustainability and tempo of the recovery," he noted, refusing to say the 37-month recession has hit a bottom. Indicating uncertainty over the strength of the recovery, Mieno stressed that bottom implies a strong V-shaped pickup. Pressed by reporters to comment on downside risks, Mieno said he could not ignore them, but "I feel the economy is moving in a good direction." "That's why I said at the Diet (earlier this week) that a further careful watch is needed to judge whether the economy has moved two or three steps forward," Mieno said. In his comments on Monday at the House of Councilors Budget Committee, the central bank chief described the economy with the word "recovery" for the first time since Japan suffered a double-dip recession just a year ago after showing signs of recovery. The rosier assessment came after his bank's quarterly "Tankan" business report for May released Friday with improvements on a broad front for the first time in five years. As positive factors indicated by the Tankan, Mieno cited improvements in personal consumption, recovery of exports, and optimistic projections in industrial output and corporate earnings. These bright spots stemmed from progress in inventory adjustments and corporate restructuring efforts, and the spreading effects of the latest macroeconomic measures, Mieno noted. But negative factors also prevail, he said, pointing in particular to uncertain currency rates, the still-tough labor and capital investment conditions, and increased competition with other Asian nations. Mieno declined to comment directly on recent market views that the central bank has changed its monetary stance from loose to neutral stance in the short-term money market. "Our stance to decide on monetary policy based on the state of the economy remains unchanged...And it now is to check carefully the tempo and sustainability of the recovery." On the recent rise in long-term market rates, he said fluctuations are natural for market rates, and they will return to levels reflecting the economic state in the longer run. Considering recent global moves to regulate financial derivatives, Mieno said financial authorities should pave the way for the private sector to set up its own rules and enhance the use of such "effective" risk-hedging tools. The measures include improving statistics and disclosure to grasp transactions, he said. Central bankers from major nations shared this view when they gathered in London last week. Concerns led by the United States are increasing over financial derivatives, such as options and swaps, that their off-balance transactions may cause unnecessary volatility. In Japan, however, tough regulations exist over such advanced products, and financial authorities are instead worried about losing international position.
