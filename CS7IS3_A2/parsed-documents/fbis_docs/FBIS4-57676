These problems in no way mean there is a crisis, General Mauricio Vargas (retired) said yesterday, who used the term "imperial arrogance" to describe the remarks by UN officials on the peace process in El Salvador. Creating a crisis is an FMLN [Faranbudo Marti National Liberation Front] obsession, because "they are the ones who announce them and create them," indicated Vargas, who served as member of the government commission that negotiated the peace accords with the former rebels. During a visit to the Legislative Assembly, where he went to discuss with some deputies the spirit of land transfers (one of the pending points of the peace accords), the officer denied the National Civilian Police [PNC] has been militarized. The problem of the PNC deployment and the demobilization of the National Police is that there cannot be a security vacuum, and the government cannot stop fulfilling its obligations, he added. In making an assessment of the peace process, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that although it is irreversible some noncompliance still persists and that requires a commitment from all sides. In his report to the Security Council, Ghali indicated that ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador] will reduce its personnel as the pending agreements are implemented and he noted the Electoral Division was dissolved, while the Military Division, which had 368 soldiers verifying the cease-fire, consists now of only 12 soldiers. Gen. Vargas stressed that one of the issues not yet resolved is the issue land transfers, but he said that issue will be resolved with a law the Assembly is currently reviewing. The purpose of the law is to meet the need for legal security and to erase the uncertainty that there is no land for those who need it, noted Gen. Vargas. According to official sources, the extension of ONUSAL'S presence in the country should not exceed three months because there is little verification work to do. "It is not proper to maintain UN intervention much longer," the sources said. ONUSAL Mission Chief Enrique Ter Horst said today "much remains to be done" regarding compliance with the agreements. Meanwhile, President Alfredo Cristiani described as "logical" the expansion of the ONUSAL mandate, since some peace accords are pending. Vice President Francisco Merino does not believe extending the ONUSAL mandate is necessary "for internal purposes." He said, however, "to a large degree, the foreign presence can serve to make the international community respond to our financial needs so the agreements can be implemented without traumatic economic results."
