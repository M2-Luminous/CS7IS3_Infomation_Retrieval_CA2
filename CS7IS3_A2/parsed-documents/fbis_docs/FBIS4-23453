First, it is a way out of the enclave of the North Kivu province, Zaire's own veritable vegetable garden. Then, because of the cargoes of manioc, yam, and beans, but also because of its passenger traffic, it maintains the national unity of a country-continent whose road and rail networks exists only on a map. At the end of the runway, between two planes, the youngsters have a soccer field which, despite the torrential rain, manages to remain unflooded for three-quarters of the year. Lastly, since the start of the Rwandan crisis, Goma airport has been the rear base of the government of neighboring Rwanda. It was from here that the leaders of the genocide were, until 10 days ago, kept supplied, notably with weapons. Since the defeat of the Rwandan Armed Forces in Kigali on Sunday, 22 May, the "special flights" to Goma have stopped. Previously, a Boeing 707 with the registration number carefully wiped out would land at the airport five times daily, three times by day and twice at night. Its cargo each time was 18 tonnes of weapons and munitions -- "from Serbia," some people said, while others claimed the cargo was shipped in crates stamped "Bulgaria." At least once witnesses claim to have seen South African pilots. Despite the abundance of details and sometimes contradictory versions, all the sources on the ground, including well-placed French expatriates, say that they are "certain" that these arms deliveries had been "paid for by France." However, no one is able to provide any evidence to back up this conviction. When he recently received in Paris Faustin Twagiramungu, the prime minister-designate of a future Rwandan "government of national union," French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin came out against such accusations. He challenged his accuser to come up with proof. The defense attache of a French Embassy in the region also explained: "After having categorically turned down a request for military aid in mid-April, I cannot see the Balladur government sending weapons to Goma where, moreover, everything ends up being common knowledge." He added: "However, secret aid, by parallel circuits, is always possible. You know, I could tell you about arms agencies in Paris..." Official France? Parallel France? Whether or not there has been French-Zairian collaboration in the Rwandan crisis, the fact remains that, thanks to the murderous conflagration in the neighboring country, Marshal-President Mobutu is remembered fondly in Paris. A French official said: "If Mobutu had been in the same plane as Juvenal Habyarimana," the Rwandan president killed in the attack on his plane on 6 April, "the whole of Africa would be ablaze and awash with blood." Apart from his "stabilizing role in the region," Paris has rediscovered the "French-speaking fidelity" of the Zairian leader, who nevertheless is still denied a visa for France and who has recently been threatened with the seizure of "all his ill-gotten gains acquired" abroad. "There is no longer any question of that," they say today. "We need Mobutu to keep Zaire steady and to confront Yoweri Museveni," the Ugandan president. Museveni is perceived as the Trojan Horse of "Anglo-Saxon interests in the region." One measure of the reconciliation is Francois Mitterrand's personal invitation to Mobutu to attend the next French-African summit in November in Biarritz, which has already been sent to the French Embassy in Kinshasa. "As soon as Mobutu forms a government and agrees to a few concessions, such as relinquishing control of the Bank of Zaire, it will be forwarded to him as a demonstration of gratitude."
