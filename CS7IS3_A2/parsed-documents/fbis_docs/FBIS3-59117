The Commission proposal will allow a total of ECU1.1 billion in EURATOM loans to be earmarked for this project. The vice president stressed that the text adopted by the (European) Parliament confirms that the Parliament as well as the Commission deem improving nuclear safety a priority. According to Mr. Christophersen, a political consensus has already been reached within the Council. Quick approval of the decision, which will make the program operational, is expected, and the efforts already made within the framework of the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] and TACIS [CIS Technical Assistance] programs thus will be enhanced. The proposal is in line with the conclusions of the European Council of Lisbon in June 1992. The decision will be implemented in cooperation with the European Bank for Investment, which will assess the projects in economic and financial terms. According to the vice president, this decision will make it possible for the Commission to initiate an important program in line with its priorities in the field of security, environmental protection, and foreign relations.
