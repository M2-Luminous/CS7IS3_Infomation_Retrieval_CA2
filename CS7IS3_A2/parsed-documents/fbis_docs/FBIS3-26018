The circular said: Recently, some publication units and individuals have published compilations of taxation laws and regulations in violation of the State Council's regulations on the publication of compilations of laws and regulations; or have published videotapes and books on taxation in the name of publicizing the new taxation law and with the purpose of seeking exorbitant profits; or even have held training classes on taxation issues using the name of the State General Administration of Taxation. These classes asked for a large fee and provided low-quality lectures, causing very bad influences. In response to the aforementioned situations, the State General Administration of Taxation recently issued a circular stressing: The right to construe taxation laws belongs to the Finance Ministry, the State General Administration of Taxation, or other authorized departments. Without the permission of the State General Administration of Taxation or other authorized departments, no publication units are allowed to publish any compilations of taxation laws. The State General Administration of Taxation will hand over cases of violation to a publication administration department or a industry and commerce administration department for legal action. Taxation organs and personnel are not allowed to take part in profit-seeking publication of any kind of videotape or book on taxation, or take part in any profit-seeking training activities concerning taxation law. If necessary, taxation organs and personnel may join concerned departments in banning such publication and training activities.
