In connection with the envisaged delay, the timetable for the work was on the agenda of yesterday's supervisory meeting held to discuss the Temelin nuclear power station project, which was attended by Minister Dlouhy. Engineer Petr Karas, chairman of the Czech Energy Enterprises board, told LIDOVE NOVINY that one of the reasons for postponing the date for bringing in the nuclear fuel is the change in the technology, and processing the documentation associated with it. "Of course, there are other reasons. For example, the government's talks on whether to say yes or no to Temelin lasted almost two years, which, naturally, had an influence on commencing certain activities," added Eng. Karas.
