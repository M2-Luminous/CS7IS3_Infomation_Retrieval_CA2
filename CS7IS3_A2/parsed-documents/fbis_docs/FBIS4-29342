The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) announced the move after issuing a statement showing some 120 discriminatory cases reported since April. The cases include verbal abuse and physical harassment such as knifing of clothing worn by Korean students. Female students of schools run by Chongnyon wear traditional Korean clothes for uniforms, which could make them a target. Chongnyon called the situation "vicious violence," comparing it to the aftermath of the 1923 great Kanto earthquake, in which many Koreans were killed. Chongnyon officials told a news conference that discriminatory actions have noticeably increased since March in line with the international focus on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. The number of such actions reported to Chongnyon's Tokyo headquarters totaled about 25 in April, but jumped to about 45 in May and some 50 for the first half of June, the officials said.
