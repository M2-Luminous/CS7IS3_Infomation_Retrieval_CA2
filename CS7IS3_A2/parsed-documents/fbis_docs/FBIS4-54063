The officials said Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told cabinet ministers after a regular cabinet meeting, "from now on, we want to make lowering prices an aim. For example, we will cut (prices) by a certain percent, or something such as that." "Just like a government project in the past to double the people's income, this time we want to draw up a plan to double real income," Hata was quoted as saying. Cabinet ministers agreed to set up a project team to review the method of public service rates, the officials said. The group is expected to propose a plan on how to review the rates, they said. The move follows a chorus of calls from the ministers for efforts to lower public service rates instead of simply freezing their hikes, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. At the day's regular cabinet meeting, Hata spoke of the need to boost the nation's real income while guiding consumer prices down, Kumagai said. Last week, the government announced a freeze until the end of the year on planned increases in public service charges, including domestic telephones charges, public housing rent, taxi fares and expressway tolls. It is the first freeze on public charges since 1974, and the first such sweeping freeze since 1964.
