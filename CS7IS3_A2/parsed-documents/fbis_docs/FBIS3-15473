What did these words imply? Was he totally dissociating himself from those reponsible for the "shock therapy" or just gently criticizing them? Although appearing radical, Chernomyrdin's speech only went halfway. On the one hand, there was the apparent intention to strengthen Russian statehood and create conditions for economic, political, and social stability in society. On the other hand, the premier does not see any grounds or any potential "for radically changing the course" mapped out last August. But what about the fact that the people voted against the former policy of reforms, which led to impoverishment and the collapse of the economy? There was no clear answer to this question in Chernomyrdin's report. The government head is trying to justify his moderately tough financial policy in 1993, although he is perfectly well aware that the temporary slowing of the inflation rate was artificial and was due not to production growth but to the delayed payment of workers' and employees' wages, reduced credit opportunities for enterprises, and artificial unemployment. January showed that inflation is rising rather than falling. Viktor Chernomyrdin, while criticizing the monetarists, is nonetheless not seeking a solution via the proven models of economic development in China., Japan, South Korea, and so on. He is trying to find a happy medium between Gaydar's monetarist experiments and the former party apparatchiks' administrative methods of management. Hence the desire to combine liberalization of prices and foreign trade with stronger state power and the establishment of order and discipline. Of course, the government's desire to orient the reforms toward the people and eliminate the main sources of their discontent can only be welcomed. But how is all this to be done? That is the question. But the measures proposed by the prime minister will not be welcomed by the critically minded reader. It is still totally unclear why, for example, agricultural subsidies, which are granted in all developed countries, "will pose a threat to other sectors of the economy" here, according to Chernomyrdin. Similar contradictions are to be encountered throughout the prime minister's report. For example, how can you reduce the budget deficit and at the same time increase investments in industry, combat mass unemployment, and close industrial enterprises that have not performed from the monetarist viewpoint? Of course, it is a good thing that war and labor veterans' pensions are to be increased. But what about current science and culture, education, and medicine? Judging by the report, the government will not get round to them. The premier gave assurances that there will be no economic and social catastrophe this year, that stabilizaiton is in the offing. We would like to believe it, but, unfortunately, the report provided no substantial evidence of this. The one thing the report did make clear was that our president is alive and well and neither the former laboratory head nor the current prime minister should aim to supplant him. You will agree that this is not enough for the country's future, for general accord, or for democracy.
