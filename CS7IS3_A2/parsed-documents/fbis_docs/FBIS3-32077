The URNG General Command, based in Mexico City, said in a communique that the large abstentionism of 84 percent proves the lack of credibility and legitimacy "of the counterinsurgency model" implemented with the "self-coup" of former President Jorge Serrano Elias. The unprecedented abstentionism in the country reflects the rejection of the constitutional reforms, which were faulty in origin. The reforms are the expression of deals reached between corrupt politicians and show the extent of a regime devoid of political support, the URNG communique states. "The government's attempt to present as a triumph the scant yes garnered at the polls constitutes one more imposition on the Guatemalan people," it states. The result of the referendum to reform the Constitution and to purge the Congress does not resolve the crisis. On the contrary, it prolongs and heightens it, the URNG states. The URNG says that this situation will permit the sectors opposed to a political solution of the crisis and which support armed conflict to harden their positions and seriously endanger efforts to build democracy in Guatemala. "The constitutional and institutional reforms and socioeconomic transformations the country needs, that society demands and wants, can only be achieved by a government of unity and national salvation, which is the democratic expression of the country's majority," the URNG communique concluded.
