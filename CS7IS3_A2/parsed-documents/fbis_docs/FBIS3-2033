"The talks will aim at a thorough and broad resolution of the nuclear and other issues that separate the DPRK from the U.S. And the rest of international community," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said in a statement. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci will head the U.S. delegation to the third round negotiation. The announcement came after a team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began their work at the DPRK's nuclear sites and representatives of the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the DPRK resumed discussion at Panmunjom earlier today. The department spokesman also announced that the United States agreed to suspend the combined military exercise, Team Spirit in 1994, with the ROK. However, McCurry said that "the long-standing security relationship between the ROK and the U.S. remains strong, and the suspension of Team Spirit '94 will not weaken our joint defensive capabilities." McCurry stressed, "the undertakings of the U.S. regarding Team Spirit '94 and a third round of U.S.-DPRK talks are based on the premise that the IAEA inspections will be fully implemented and the South-North nuclear dialogue will continue through the exchange of special envoys."
