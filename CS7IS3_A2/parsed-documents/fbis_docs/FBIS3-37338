According to Interfax's sources, Hryb emphasized that the Supreme Soviet, which is to be convened one of these days, would discuss a new Constitution, in particular the state structure. He promised the delegation that the petition he had from them would be discussed at the next Thursday's meeting of the Supreme Soviet presidium. People's Deputy Sergey Antonchik, a strike committee member, said that the indefinite strike in the republic was continuing. The next rally will be held on Independence Square in Minsk on February 22, when parliament is scheduled to be reconvened. Our correspondent in Minsk reports that the rally, attended by a crowd of about 6000, has moved from Independence Square to outside the parliament building. Now the rally demands that the national strike committee be given 15 minutes on the television immediately after the evening news program, reinstatement Vladimir Yegorov as interior minister as well as resignation of the cabinet and dissolution of parliament. Yegorov had been dismissed for allowing the arrest and removal to Vilnius of Lithuanian communist leaders Mikolas Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius. Belarusian Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin Platonov told Interfax that no trouble had erupted during the rally or march towards the parliament building. He did not rule out the possibility, however, that "measures will be taken" against strike committee activists. For one thing, they had staged a rally on Independence Square where no public events other than national holidays can be held. What is more, the rally had not been authorized. Platonov also said that the activities of the committees were illegal because it had not been officially registered.
