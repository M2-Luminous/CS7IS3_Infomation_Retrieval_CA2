Tormented by excessive prices and mass unemployment in Lipetsk (perhaps not a single enterprise is working at full capacity) and by notorious privatization as a result of which some have become multimillionaires but most have become impoverished, at the elections people voted "with their feet." The elections were not valid at one of the oblast center's 15 electoral districts. And that despite the fact that the "pass level" was lowered to 25 percent. For the same reason the elections to the city assembly were also invalid. Yet here it was the "city fathers," the head of the administration and his deputies, the leaders of industrial enterprises, and new capitalist gentlemen who were running for the majority of districts. The same attitude toward the new organ of oblast power was displayed in Yelets, where not a single candidate got through either, because voters failed to turn out. Thus elections were valid in only 19 out of 38 districts. But even in those districts, mainly rural ones, where the elections were successful, the turnout was scarcely more than 50 percent. On behalf of whom will the victorious candidates resolve legislative questions if most often only 15-20 percent of the population voted for them?
