Castro was distressed by the uncomfortable situation caused by the Collor couple's visit to Cuba. Sen. Lando returned on 31 January from Cuba, where here attended the Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity and Peace. Pleased with the simplicity and sincerity demonstrated by Fidel, Lando comforted Fidel: "Collor has always been a good actor. He made that same good impression in Brazil, deceiving 35 million people." The incident ended by being a long subject during their conversation, which was about the two countries' economic situation and political and trade relations between Cuba and Brazil. Worried about the bad impression Collor's visit might have made on the former rapporteur for the CPI on PC [Paulo Cesar Farias], Fidel stressed to Lando that the former Brazilian president did not come to Cuba as an official guest nor did he receive him in an audience. During the conversation, Fidel told the Brazilian senator that Collor had expressed his interest in visiting the island when he was still president of the Republic. Now, after the impeachment, Fidel says his reasoning was simple: Given that he is a common citizen, there is no reason to receive him with any special honors; this also does not justify any persecution by Cuba by prohibiting his visit.
