The shift was prompted by changing international politics and the volatile military situation surrounding the Korean peninsula, said the PLA organ. It predicted that Seoul would achieve military self-reliance by focusing on developing state-of-the-art weapons, specializing and systematizing its defense industry and training elite troops. Such efforts will be pursued in line with Seoul's policy of "all-direction" military and diplomatic cooperation, said the PLA daily. It added that despite this policy shift, military cooperation between Seoul and Washington will remain the core of South Korea's defense relations with other countries. The policy shift, drawn up by the South Korean Defense Ministry, has already been reported to President Kim Yong-sam and will likely be approved by President Kim in the near future, said the PLA organ.
