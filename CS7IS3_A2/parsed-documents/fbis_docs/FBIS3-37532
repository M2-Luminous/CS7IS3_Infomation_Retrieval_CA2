Butrus-Ghali. Their appeal reminds the international community and all well-disposed people of the need to expedite the withdrawal of Armenian troops from inhabited localities they seized earlier to a point beyond the sovereign state's borders. This step, in their opinion, could halt the six-year bloody conflict, save thousands of lives, and facilitate the start of peace talks. The immediate reason for sending the message is the upcoming second anniversary of the Khodzhaly tragedy, a tragedy in which hundreds of peaceful inhabitants -- the children, women, and old men of this Azerbaijani village in Nagorno-Karabakh -- became victims of a barbaric act. Subsequently, again outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, another seven Azerbaijani rayons which are not disputed by the two sides were seized. Consequently, over one million people have become refugees on their own land. Their situation during these snowy winter days has deteriorated even further: Many are seeking shelter in cities of tents where cold and hunger are taking their toll. Their cry for help, the authors of the message to the UN secretary general believe, should also be heeded by world public opinion.
