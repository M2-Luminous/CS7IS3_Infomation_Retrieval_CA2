FR940105-0-00009 FR940105-0-00002 In response to the comments regarding the study of the detection effectiveness of nine random testing rates published in NUREG/CR&hyph;5784, the Commission notes that the study explicitly dealt with only the hypothetical detection effectiveness of those alternatives. It did not address their relative deterrence effectiveness. While it may be that the effectiveness of a 100-percent random testing rate for deterring occasional drug users could be slightly higher than that of a 50-percent rate, the Commission nonetheless believes that a 50-percent random testing rate will provide sufficient deterrence to drug and alcohol abuse by contractor and vendor employees. With respect to commenters' concerns about unnecessary inconsistencies in random testing rates between Federal agencies, the Commission continues to believe that the random test rate for employees in the nuclear power industry need not be similar to the rates applied to employees in all, or even most, other Federal agencies or Federally mandated programs. Not all Federal agencies have identical safety concerns or responsibilities. 5. Comment. There should be no difference in the random testing rate for certain positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant. Seventeen commenters responded to the Commission's question as to whether certain positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant, such as licensed reactor operators, should be excluded from any reduction of the random testing rate. All these commenters recommended against such differentiation. Two licensees stated that treating people in positions critical to safety differently from other employees could have a negative effect on the morale, self-image, and motivation of this group of highly trained and dedicated specialists. Another stated that all plant employees are critical to safe operation. Therefore, a reduction in the random testing rate should apply to all employees. The potential for added record-keeping requirements creating unnecessary burdens for the industry was another reason for not making this distinction. In the opinion of one commenter, the 1990&hyph;1992 industry-wide program performance data do not support testing people in positions critical to safety at a different rate than that applied to other licensee employees. Finally, one licensee cited potential problems getting union agreement to testing this classification of employees at a higher rate than other licensee personnel subject to the FFD rule. NRC Response The essence and unanimity of these comments_that licensed operators and other employees in positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant should not be excluded from a reduction of the random testing rate_is not surprising. These particular members of the nuclear power industry's workforce have collectively demonstrated their dedication to safe and efficient plant operations. As at least one commenter noted, the industry's program performance data for the first three years of operation do not support differentiating between people in safety-critical positions and other licensee employees insofar as the random testing rate is concerned. The 1992 program performance data, for example, show that eighteen of the industry's approximately 5,000 licensed operators tested positive for drugs or alcohol or otherwise violated the licensee's FFD policy; twelve of these were a result of random testing. When comparing these results to the 461 positive results out of 156,730 random tests administered to the industry workforce, the difference in proportion between the licensed operators and the industry workforce is within statistical fluctuations and the difference in the positive rates is not statistically significant. While the NRC expects licensees to continue to take action to drive this number of positives down even further, this record does not merit testing people in these positions at a rate different from that applied to other licensee employees. The Commission, therefore, concurs with the commenters' recommendation that certain positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant, such as licensed reactor operators, should not be excluded from a reduction of the random testing rate. 6. Comment. Random testing is expensive and produces false positives. Furthermore, chronic users are able to avoid detection. Two commenters, a power plant worker and a union, argued against the usefulness of continued random testing. One of these commenters stated that random testing produces false positives. These cost the industry large amounts of money in settlements and damage the public's perception of licensees' fairness. As additional support for this position, this commenter warned that chronic drug abusers are particularly adept at escaping detection from random testing by subverting the testing process. The other commenter recommended that random testing be eliminated because it is not effective in identifying workers who are impaired at the time urine samples are collected. For-cause testing, in this commenter's opinion, is more effective because it more accurately reflects a worker's present ability to perform his/her job at the time he/she is tested. This commenter also stated that random testing appears to be a means of having the NRC enforce the Controlled Substances Act which is not the NRC's responsibility. NRC Response The Commission has long been well aware of the types of FFD program-related concerns as addressed by these commenters. During the promulgation of 10 CFR part 26 in 1989, the Commission fully addressed these and many other such concerns. (See NUREG&hyph;1354, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Responses to Public Comments.'') At that time the NRC concluded, for example, that licensee FFD programs should be concerned not only with impairment, but also with worker reliability and trustworthiness. The NRC believes that any illegal drug use or alcohol abuse by a worker reflects upon his or her trustworthiness and reliability. Likewise, random testing is not intended, nor has it ever functioned, as a means to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. Section 26.29(b) provides that licensees, contractors, and vendors shall not disclose test results to law enforcement officials unless those officials request such information under court order. It also is noted that there is no requirement to routinely provide such officials with testing results. The Commission is well aware that there is a potential for false positive results and, therefore, has required numerous quality control measures and safeguards to prevent such occurrences. In Appendix D to NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Volume 3, the testing process errors that were reported by licensees during the first three years under the FFD rule were analyzed. Of over 800,000 specimens tested, there were two false positives of personnel specimens reported by the laboratories, both due to administrative errors. In both cases, the quality assurance programs detected and corrected the problem. Because of the NRC's particular concern with the degree to which the testing process can be subverted, the Commission staff has continued to track the ways in which workers have subverted testing processes in industries across the country. These efforts have resulted in staff recommendations for amending 10 CFR part 26 to introduce various means for combatting subversion. Lastly, the Commission believes that the added protection of public health and safety that the FFD program provides is well worth the industry's costs of administering this program. 7. Comment. Maintaining two separate populations of workers for random testing is an unnecessary and expensive burden. Some of the commenters stated that requiring two random testing rates would force licensees to develop two separate testing programs. The resulting additional administrative and financial burdens would cancel out any savings resulting from reducing the licensee employee rate to 50 percent. NUMARC stated that the industry would save approximately $4.1 million if the number of tests of contractor and vendor employees was cut in half. NRC Response
