The Organization of African Unity announced yesterday that it did not support French intervention in Rwanda. In a communique, the OAU--which groups together 53 member countries--says that the way this operation is being prepared, including the fact that all the belligerents have not agreed to it, is extremely risky. Ghislaine Dupont asked Ngayama why the OAU rejected French intervention, although it accepted that of UN soldiers: [Begin recording] [Ngayama] What is still rather curious--or rather sad, if you like, in that kind of situation--is that individual states always find the means to act, but they never find any means in a concerted fashion. This is what is happening, in a way. We would like more consultations. [Dupont] Do you mean that France has acted alone in this venture? [Ngayama] In a way, because one resolution has been adopted by the United Nations, and another will most probably have to be adopted in order to give the go ahead to the action begun by France. However, we would have liked to have as much cooperation from the sides as possible. It would, of course, be deplorable if one side did not cooperate, because it would have been necessary for this side--the Rwandan Patriotic Front, in particular--to really cooperate. Having said that, it goes without saying that this does not mean that the OAU is discouraged or does not wish the [word indistinct] to succeed. It is just the opposite. We think we need to surround ourselves with the greatest possible number of precautions, to get the greatest possible agreement between all the sides, in order to ensure that the action being undertaken can find some support from everyone, in order to guarantee the desired success. [Dupont] Do you support the Senegalese decision to agree to participate in this humanitarian intervention force? [Ngayama] There is no doubt that any state, any member of the OAU or of the international community, is perfectly free to participate in this action--even if, let me say it again, this action is not, let us say, in contradiction with what has been done. [sentence as heard] The aim of the OAU and of the international community, we are sure, is to arrive at a solution in accordance with the Arusha agreements and to stop the massacres and end the hostilities. There is no doubt about this. The OAU is a bit concerned that, perhaps, by acting alone this might be a hindrance. [Dupont] In the end, however, does not this dramatic crisis in Rwanda show the impotence of the OAU, which, after all, tried to create a mechanism to prevent conflicts more than a year ago now? Is accusing France of going it alone not tantamount to saying that the continent, the organization of this continent, cannot do anything? [Ngayama] No, do not think that. The OAU is working in consultation with the United Nations, which has the main mandate for maintaining peace and security in the world. There is not one specifically African security in which only Africans are involved. There is international security for which the United Nations has a specific mandate. So we have a mechanism that complements that of the United Nations. It is not a parallel mechanism. What we have established, in agreement with the United Nations, is to supply what we were told the international community was not able to supply: troops, for example, to implement the decision of the United Nations. We are waiting for the logistical support that the African states do not have to be supplied by the international community or by the United Nations. That is really what it is. What has happened, however, is as if these efforts were viewed poorly, or did not deserve interest or consideration or to be supported. One individual state preferred to act alone. The OAU decries a situation that it would have welcomed normally, if it had been integrated into the context of the efforts that we have always made with our partners in the international community as a whole, including Africa's main partners, certain great powers: France, the United States, Germany, Belgium, and so on, as has always happened before.
