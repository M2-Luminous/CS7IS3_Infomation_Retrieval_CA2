The president pointed out that the establishment of a military wing will only serve to suppress the people, adding that he believed in dialogue to solve Africa's problems. The president said, that for a country like Kenya to have survived for 30 years without being distracted by coups, was a clear indication of the existence of democratic practices since independence. The president observed that it was unfortunate that countries like Kenya, who have all along been practicing democracy, are lumped with other countries which have just started observing democratic principles. President Moi was speaking at parliament when he officially opened the 25th conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Africa region. President Moi noted that Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, having stemmed from the roots of a long established parliamentary process, should have formed committees to look into the best ways of introducing multiparty democracy in the African continent. President Moi said such committees would have looked into the final details of how African societies were going to implement multipartyism. He said that it was unfortunate that the continent now has to deal with the devastating effects of pluralism in some countries. President Moi said Africa should endeavor to have home grown parliamentary democracy, rather than copy blindly and without judgement other people's systems of governance. The president said that he had consistently spoken against any attempt to impose systems of government that militate against the wishes and value systems of the African people. President Moi noted that anyone or group of people imposing their will on others was oppressive, and also denied others the freedom to manage their own affairs. The head of state told African leaders to strongly reject moves by the developed countries to experiment with their peoples. The president said that Kenyans were now struggling with the effects of political reforms that have led to a state of tribal loyalities and inter-tribal animosities. He noted that the reforms have widened ethnic divisions, and now threatens the cherished goals of national unity. He said that pluralism has adversely affected institutions such as the judiciary, public service commission, and the civil service, which should be rendering quality service without paying attention to political affiliations or being partisan. President Moi said that, in spite of Africa's economic potential, the continent still lags behind in development, and this has been made worse by the large concentration of refugees. President Moi told the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference that leaders must seriously start thinking how to avoid the eminent disintegration of the continent. He said good politics always results in prosperity and enjoyment of life, adding that by all means politics of bloodshed and unnecessary suffering must be avoided. He told the conference to explore to what extent parliamentary democracy as practiced in African countries may have contributed to the problems that confront the continent. The president said the most crucial task is to educate the people to appreciate the importance of the continent's age old cultural values and democratic practices. He told the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to also promote understanding and respect among the nations of the world, and especially among its membership. [passage omitted]
