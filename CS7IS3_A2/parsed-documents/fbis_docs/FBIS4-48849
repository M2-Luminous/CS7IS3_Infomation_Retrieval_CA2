A committee of experts has been appointed to assist the cabinet committee in its investigations. Prof Harriet Ngubane MP, Attorney Geoff Budlender (director of the Legal Resources Centre), Adv Pius Langa SC [Senior Counselor] (Durban Bar and president of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers) and Mr Erik Buiten (chief director of the Department of Regional and Land Affairs) are serving on the technical committee. Further assistance is being provided by the Department of Regional and Land Affairs. The cabinet committee will inform cabinet on 1 June 1994 of steps taken and the progress being made in the investigation. It is envisaged that the final report and recommendations will be presented to cabinet on 14 June 1994. In conclusion, there seems to be some confusion regarding the extent of land which may be subject to the Ingonyama Trust, in terms of the KwaZulu Ingonyama Trust Act. Approximately 3,070,000 hectares of former sa development trust land was transferred in terms of the above act, all situated within the jurisdiction of the former KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. This includes all of the land within KwaZulu, except the following: tribally owned land of some 8,000 ha; privately owned land of some 153,000 ha; the land described in Schedule 4 of Proclamation R28/1992 of 41,500 ha, and the former SA Development Trust Land situated outside KwaZulu (i.e. Makatini Flats, Goodluck Farms, Ntambanana Farms, Impendhle Farms, Platt Estates area, Highflats Farms, Gundrift Farms, Margate Corridor Farms, Meringa Flats, Gingindluvu Farms). It could be mentioned that the majority of land transferred in terms of the Ingonyama Trust Act had been occupied by tribes and communities since before 1913. This category of land consists of some 2,300,000 ha, previously referred to as the Zululand reserves. In the interest of an open and accountable process, submissions by interested parties will be welcomed. However, due to the urgency and sensitivity of the issue, submissions can only be accepted until midnight on Wednesday, 1 June 1994. Submissions on the Ingonyama Trust Act and its implications can be faxed to the Ministry of Land Affairs at (012) 211-244.
