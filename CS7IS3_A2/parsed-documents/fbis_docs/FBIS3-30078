NODONG SINMUN in an editorial headlined "30 Hears of Victory and Change Along the Road Indicated by Great Rural Theses" says that the publication of the socialist rural theses 30 years ago was a historical event which is of weighty significance in the revolutionary struggle of our people for a victory of the socialist cause of chuche. Noting that a national agricultural conference was grandly opened in Pyongyang on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses, the paper says: The conference will be a rally of victors powerfully demonstrating the greatness and invincible vitality of our party's programme of socialist rural construction and a new milestone in developing our socialist rural economy onto a higher stage. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historical letter "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses" to the national agricultural conference. The great leader in his letter proudly reviewed the victory of our party and people in the struggle to implement the rural theses and put forward the militant tasks to effect a new upswing in the rural construction. The letter is a fighting banner to win a historical victory in finally solving the rural question, the most difficult one in the socialist construction. The period since the publication of the theses was 30 years of victory in which a most brilliant example was set in the solution of the socialist rural question, the paper notes. It refers in detail to the achievements in the final solution of the rural question. It stresses that the great victory and achievements in the struggle to implement the rural theses in the past were entirely a brilliant fruition of the wise guidance of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Noting that we are now faced with the honorable tasks to further consolidate and develop the socialist rural economic system in our country and effect a new upswing in the agricultural production on the basis of the great victory achieved in the socialist rural construction, the paper outlines these tasks. An editorial of MINJU CHOSON stresses that our socialist countryside which is advancing along the road indicated by the rural theses, holding the illustrious leader in high esteem, will boundlessly prosper and the socialist cause of chuche will make a long drive forever.
