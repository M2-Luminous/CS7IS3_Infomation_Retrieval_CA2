While he said that without the approval of this law it would be "impossible" for Argentina to join the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), he at the same time played down the idea that the delay in approving the law would dramatically influence things, considering that all the pressures so far received are but "warnings." The contradictory concepts became apparent during a news conference given by Menem at Government House a few moments before receiving in his office U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who arrived in Argentina to speak precisely about the need for Argentina to have a law on pharmaceutical patents rights acknowledging the rights of foreign inventions, as well as about the dangers of corruption and drug trafficking. During the news conference President Menem gave his opinion that approval of a law on pharmaceutical patents rights "does not represent an absolute condition" by the United States for Argentina to access NAFTA, while a little after he added that "in principle there is no possibility that Argentina could join NAFTA if the pharmaceutical patents rights law is not approved first." Afterward Menem said that the claims and connections between the approval of the law and joining NAFTA "are simply a kind of warning about our relations," noting that "the Argentine Government is doing the same with the U.S. Government regarding agricultural subsidies." Instead of clarifying the Argentine position regarding this controversial subject, Menem's statements really contributed to generating greater confusion among those who, soon after he made his statements, began to closely read and analyze them. The president said that the draft law on pharmaceutical patents rights "is one of the promises we made to the U.S. Government two and a half years ago, when Carla Hills was U.S. trade representative," adding that "since then we have been making efforts to get Congress to approve the law." On another subject, Menem again denied the possibility that the opening up of labor laws will be imposed by decree, and said that the government expects the bill "to be approved by consensus in Congress." The Argentine president also noted statements by Eduardo Bauza, secretary general of the presidency, that the candidates for Menem's vice president are Vicente Joga, Ruben Marin, and Eduardo Duhalde. Menem said: "In a party like the Justicialist Party, and in a full democracy, those who decide on the presidential ticket are not the leaders but the party members." Further on, Menem spoke about former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, saying that "she was too outspoken when she said that Argentina's return to democracy is partly due to her." He described her statements as "absurd and aggressive," considering them "things one has to listen to and then be silent about, as they make no sense." "Here we live in democracy and freedom thanks to the Argentine people, and in no way thanks to Mrs. Thatcher," he stated. Menem said that the Malvinas war "was not the unleashing factor that made Argentina return to democracy and freedom. It was the people's permanent and constant struggle that made tyrannies lose their validity, here as in any part of the world." Asked whether Thatcher's presence in Chile would affect relations between Chile and Argentina, Menem said that relations "have never been as good as they are now," adding that relations "at the Armed Forces level are really spectacular." On another subject, Menem said he does not share the belief of Radical Civic Union leader Leopoldo Moreau, who said that the Constituent Assembly should place all judges on availability status [en comision]. "This is an entirely unwise statement which is not in keeping with the current terms referred to in the Constitution," he said. As for the medical checkup he will undergo tomorrow at the Buenos Aires Cardiovascular Institute, Menem said it was "routine," adding that "I have had them ever since I came to the presidency." "The thing is that they are now more significant, following the carotid surgery I underwent last October," Menem stated. He also said on that on 1 May he will announce during his message to Congress the implementation of a three-year plan that will extend through 1996. "All the conditions are ready to announce something of this kind through 1996 or perhaps 2000," he said, adding that "we have had a zero inflation rate since last year." Menem then said that he was aware of the charges by nun Martha Pelloni regarding the alleged sale of babies in Corrientes Province. He said that "a charge of this kind, in which several organizations are mentioned, is worrisome" adding that "the subject is being investigated."
