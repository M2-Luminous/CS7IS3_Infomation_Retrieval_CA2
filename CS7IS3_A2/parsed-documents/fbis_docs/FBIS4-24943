The incident began in early April. Cadres of the party committees of the institutions directly subordinate to the regional government, the civil affairs department, the transportation department, and the cultural department of the regional government jointly signed a petition which demanded: 1) immediate measures to curb inflation; 2) a stop to purchasing cars and distributing luxurious houses; 3) immediate increases in allowances to grass-roots cadres and retired cadres in order to guarantee their living standards; 4) making public the investigation and handling of the corrupt officials and abusers of power in the party and government leading bodies of the autonomous region in order to redress the grievances of the general public. The regional party committee and the regional government held nine rounds of talks with the representatives of the cadres, but the talks achieved no result. On 26 April, the regional government issued a three-point statement: 1) The petitioning cadres and workers were instigated by some evildoers among their representatives to challenge the authority of the party committee and the regional government. 2) Some people with ulterior motives were trying to create a disturbance in order to disrupt the party's central work and harm social stability and unity. 3) The autonomous regional government would take necessary administrative measures to deal with the incident, and might take legal action if necessary. On 27 April, the representatives of cadres and workers from a number of regional departments met with some leaders of the regional government. Then, the general office of the regional government issued an ultimatum, demanding that all personnel immediately return to their work posts in various departments and fulfill their own duties; otherwise, disciplinary action would be taken against them. On 28 April, cadres in 23 departments and commissions resisted the order by means of asking for sick leave and making business trips to other places. Nearly 800 cadres participated in the petition action in the form of a go-slow. Then, cadres in the governments of Baotou City, Jining City, and Hailar City also became involved in the action. The CPC Central Secretariat and the State Council sent Wei Jianxing and Luo Gan to handle the incident in Hohhot on behalf of the central authorities. In view of the seriousness of the incident, the central authorities and the regional authorities organized 15 work teams to go to various regional departments, Baotou City, Jining City, and Hailar City. On the evening of 30 April, Li Peng attended a meeting of party and government cadres in the autonomous region, and gave a five-point instruction: 1. The members of the standing committee of the regional party committee, the members of the regional party committee, and the responsible officials of the regional government should go down deeply into various localities and departments to solve the urgent problems without delay and explain the government's measures. They must overcome the bureaucratic style of work and should not coerce their subordinates into submission. 2. It is necessary to increase communications between the upper authorities and subordinates, between various party and government institutions, and between cadres and the masses in order to create a relaxed and harmonious atmosphere that is beneficial to the party's central work and to the consolidation and development of the stable political situation and social environment. 3. It is necessary to rectify the party organizations in order to bring their leading and exemplary role into better play and to arouse their initiative in fully implementing the party's policies and measures. 4. It is necessary to care about the working, living, and welfare conditions of cadres. Leading officials and leading bodies must not become privileged, and they should always subject themselves to supervision by the discipline inspection commission, the supervision department, and the people's congress at the same level. They must not retaliate against other people who criticize them. Subordinates and the masses have the right to make complaints, file appeals, lodge petitions, and propose the dismissal of incompetent leaders. 5. Resolute action should be taken to ban and crack down on illegal underground organizations and hostile organizations supported by external forces. On 2 and 3 May, Li Peng met with cadres and mass representatives from some regional departments. The cadres demanded that the leading bodies of the regional party committee and the regional government be reorganized, and the secretary of the regional party committee be dismissed from office. Reportedly, the central authorities instructed the regional authorities of Inner Mongolia to mitigate their contradictions with the departmental cadres in order to prevent the infiltration of external hostile forces. The incident was characterized by the involvement of cadres in various party and government departments at the regional and city levels, and such institutions involved in the incident numbered more than 120. Over 4,000 cadres participated in the petitioning action, more than 3,700 of them being CPC members, including some departmental chiefs. This was the first event of this nature since the CPC regime was set up. This was also the first protest action to take place in the "backyard" of a provincial government. There was a certain degree of inevitability. The July issue of TUNG HSIANG [TRENDS] in 1992 carried a report about the undercurrents in Inner Mongolia. If CPC rule is a combination of Stalin-style fascist dictatorship and traditional feudal autocracy, then its rule in Inner Mongolia bears a stronger color of Oriental feudal autocracy. In the past, Inner Mongolia was always ruled by a number of feudal lords, and the Mongolian people never ceased their resistance against the rule of the feudal lords. In the 1920's, Mongolian hero Gadameilin led a popular uprising, and his deeds were always on everybody's lips in Inner Mongolia. Uranfu, the representative of CPC rule in Inner Mongolia, was in fact the greatest feudal lord in the territory; and the people there called him a "fiend in human form." He led an extravagant and dissipated life, like Kim Il-song in North Korea. In Inner Mongolia, Uranfu also pursued the hereditary system. In the 1950's, he appointed his son, Buhe, director of the regional cultural department and appointed his daughter-in-law, Zhulan Qiqi, who played the main part in a film in the 1950's, leader of the broadcast, television, and film department. The young lord Buhe long since succeeded his father as the supreme feudal ruler in Inner Mongolia (he was once concurrently secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the regional government). The privileges he enjoyed in Inner Mongolia were greater than those of principal leaders in any other province. He was greedier and more cruel than any lord in history, and was an out-and-out local tyrant. Of the four demands of the petitioners, two were related to their economic interests (curbing inflation and increasing allowances), and the other two were aimed at the privileges of local leaders. The targets of the struggle were quite similar to those of the 1989 pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. For example, the petitioners called for stopping the purchase of cars and the distribution of luxurious houses, and investigating and punishing corrupt officials and power abusers. In particular, as the petitioners included a number of department chiefs, their struggle was obvious spearheaded against leaders at the higher level. They even required Li Peng to reorganize the leading bodies of the regional party committee and the regional government and to dismiss the secretary of the regional party committee. This showed that the flames of fury among the people in Inner Mongolia, like their ancestors led by Gadameilin, have been burning up to the heads of local tyrant Buhe and his clan.
