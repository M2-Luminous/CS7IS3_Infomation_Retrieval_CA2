FR940112-0-00087 FR940112-0-00021 Provision C_Permit States To Exclude From Incurred Medical Expenses Those Bills for Services Furnished More Than Three Months Before a Medicaid Application Comment: Several commenters noted that the Act does not place a limit on the age of bills for medical expenses to be deducted from income in the spenddown process, nor does it authorize us to place limits on the age of bills. Response: We agree with the commenters with respect to States that elect to use the eligibility criteria prescribed in section 1902(f) of the Act. Under that provision, States are required to deduct incurred expenses without regard to when the expenses were incurred. However, as noted in the NPRM, section 1902(a)(17) of the Act gives us the authority to prescribe the extent to which costs of medical care may be deducted from income when determining Medicaid eligibility. We believe this authority permits us to place limits on the age of medical bills to be applied to the spenddown process in States that do not elect to use the more restrictive eligibility criteria permitted under section 1902(f) of the Act. We have decided to use the authority to set limits on the bills which must be taken into account by authorizing States to adopt certain limits on which bills will be taken into account. Comment: A few commenters opposed this provision because it appears to penalize individuals when providers do not promptly furnish bills. These commenters suggested that expenses cannot be deducted from income until the provider's bill is received. One commenter suggested that we revise the regulations to specify that the age of the expense is measured by the billing date rather than the date the service was furnished. Response: We believe that it would be reasonable for States to use the date the service was furnished if the individual incurred (that is, became liable for) the expense at that time. We do not believe that individuals will be penalized for delays in billing by providers because other documentation could be furnished to verify that expenses were incurred. For example, a State could verify an expense by telephoning the provider. A State may presume that liability arises when services are rendered unless evidence is presented to the contrary. In such a case, the State should determine when the liability arose and use the resulting date. We are persuaded, however, by numerous comments on this issue that a rigid 3-month limit on deductible medical bills would restrict rather than enhance State flexibility. Note that the existing regulations and interpretations specify that States must deduct all medical expenses incurred before application, no matter how far back in time the expenses are incurred if they have not already been used in another budget period, if the individual is still liable for them, or if the individual has paid for them in the current budget period. We are modifying §§435.831(d)(5) and 436.831(d)(5) of the proposed regulations, redesignated in these final regulations as §§435.831(g)(2) and 436.831(g)(2), to specify that in determining deductible incurred medical expenses, States have the option to include (or exclude) expenses incurred earlier than the third month before the month of application. The period chosen by the State must be specified in the State plan. We are also clarifying in new §§435.831 (f)(2) and (f)(4) and 436.831 (f)(2) and (f)(4) that expenses must be deducted in any spenddown calculation for the retroactive eligibility period if the expenses were incurred in the retroactive period, were a current liability of the individual in the period for which the spenddown calculation is made, and had not been previously deducted from income in establishing Medicaid eligibility. Comment: Some commenters objected to this provision on the basis that it is not any easier for States to administer than the existing provisions. Under the proposal, States must continue to assure that bills are applied no more than once in meeting the spenddown liability, and that a bill remains the current liability of an individual. Response: As we mentioned before, since this revision is optional, States may choose either to use it or retain the existing method. There are certain advantages, however, to applying a limit to the age of medical bills. Limiting bills to expenses incurred no more than 3 months before the month of application (or the age established by the State, as discussed earlier) reduces the burden on the State of proving that a bill is no longer an individual's current liability. Bills older than the State set age limit would not generally be applied in spenddown whether or not an individual remains liable for the bill.
