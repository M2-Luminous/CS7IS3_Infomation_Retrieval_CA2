Such an anti-Serbian attitude displayed by the Albanian president raises the issue of responsibility borne by the hosts for this verbal assault on the FRY in the highest institution of Bulgarian democracy, the protest underlines. We express our deepest regret at the fact that such a possibility was granted to a man well known for his advocacy of the war option in the Balkans, a man who is voluntarily offering everybody -- primarily Turkey -- bases and strongholds for military operations against the FRY, it is said in the protest. The Albanian president is disseminating lies about the creation of a Greater Serbia in order to conceal his own program for the creation of a Greater Albania, which, besides Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija], would include western Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and parts of Montenegro. According to the protest, the most glaring untruths in Berisha's speech in the Bulgarian Assembly related to Kosmet, because, it is said, the Albanian population there neither numbers two million nor has their autonomy been abolished.
