Following the relatively sharp price rises generated by grain price fluctuations last year, plus the influence of the "carry-on [qiao wei 5062 1442]" effect, Guangdong Province's commodity prices kept on climbing up in the first quarter of this year. Compared with the same period last year, the commodity retail price index in this period increased by 20.5 percent or 0.4 percentage point higher than the country's average level. Therefore, there was still a considerable gap between this figure and the goal set last year by the provincial government to keep price rises at about 12 percent. In the first of quarter of this year, Guangdong devoted efforts to strengthening the construction of the "shopping basket" and "rice bag" projects to ensure production and supply of the residents' basic daily necessities. In terms of the "rice bag" program, while stabilizing the area of land sown to grain crops, provincial financial departments allocated 150 million yuan to build 50 grain-producing-base counties within three years starting from the beginning of this year, a grain reserve system and a 250-million-yuan system of risk funds for grain were set up, and the system of purchasing grain at the protective prices was further implemented. In the "shopping basket" program, continued efforts were made to stabilize and expand the "shopping basket" bases; Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Shaoguan, and seven other cities established 500-million-yuan-or-so funds for regulating and controlling prices of non-staple foods; and active efforts were made to open wholesale markets for agricultural and sideline products and market fairs, thus unclogging commodity channels. At present, with the weakening of the "carry-on" effect and the strengthening of regulation and control, Guangdong's consumer goods prices, service charges, and capital goods prices have dropped considerably. In the capital goods market, supply has exceeded demand. The prices of daily-use consumer goods are staying at the late-1993 levels and the prices of some of them have steadied or gone down. Vegetable prices are relatively stable. According to a survey conducted by the Guangzhou City Statistics Bureau, compared with the previous month, the commodity price index in March dropped by 1.8 percentage point. Today most fellow countrymen have some understanding of the "twin" relationship between economic growth rate and price rises. Perhaps it is easier for Guangdong people, who are market conscious, to comprehend the relationship. Nevertheless, in terms of the overall picture of Guangdong's market prices in the first quarter of this year, as the factors generating price rises continue to expand in number, relevant departments dare not lower their guard. Guangdong's price rises in the first quarter of this year were characterized by a high starting point and an overall rise with the prices of the residents' daily necessities and service charges staying high. During this period, the prices of food, books, and magazines and the charges for communications and medical and health-care services rose by over 20 percent, and recently they registered another rise of 5.4 percent. The general price rise in various cities of the province was universally quite high. Yangjiang, Heyuan, Qingyuan, and Zhanjiang Cities were among the cities with the highest price-rise levels. According to relevant statistics, compared with the corresponding period last year, in the first quarter of this year, investments by state-owned units increased by 43.3 percent, and total volume of consumer goods retail sales rose by 33 percent. This helped push market prices up. At the same time, during the same period many major reform projects were carried out. This also served as an important reason behind price rises in Guangdong. According to calculations, the adoption of a new taxation system, the unification of foreign exchange rates, and the introduction of price reform alone have driven up the province's commodity prices by about four percentage points. In addition, man-made factors causing inflation, such as wanton raising of prices and wanton collection of fees, should not be ignored because they can make a stormy sea stormier. Jiang Shanli, director of the Guangdong Provincial Commodity Price Bureau, summarized the province's market price situation into 15 characters reading: The situation is quite grim. Though facing great difficulties in regulating and controlling market prices, we have confidence in doing so. It has been learned that relevant departments in the province are taking corresponding measures, such as increasing effective supplies, putting the scale of investment and credit under control, strengthening the monitoring of prices of the residents' daily necessities and service charges, and expediting the pace of pricing legislation, to achieve the government-set goal of price control for this year. In the first quarter of this year, although Guangdong ranked ninth in the country from its previous middle and lower level in terms of price rises, people here believe that this does not mean that the province's commodity price situation will further deteriorate. On the contrary, although some hinterland provinces and cities may achieve marked results in the short term in their efforts to control prices by relying on administrative measures and financial subsidies, this practice can be called "drinking poisoned wine to quench the thirst." In relying on the superiority of its relatively high marketization level, Guangdong has upheld the dominant position of regulation by market mechanisms and placed great stress on developing production and invigorating circulation. From a long-term point of view, this way of doing things is undoubtedly a wise move.
