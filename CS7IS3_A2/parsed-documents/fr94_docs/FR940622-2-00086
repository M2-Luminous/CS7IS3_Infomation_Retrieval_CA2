FR940622-2-00086 FR940622-2-00065 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34218; File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;07] June 15, 1994. Self-Regulatory Organizations; the Depository Trust Company; Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Establishment if the Stock Loan Income-Tracking System Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on May 6, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by DTC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change will establish the stock loan income-tracking system that will eliminate the need for participants to track income distributions on their securities that are the subject of outstanding stock loans. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections, A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Participants have informed DTC that pursuant to the terms of stock loan agreements, the borrower must promptly pass to the lender distributions received on the borrowed securities during the period that the loan is outstanding. Stock loan activity among participants is a high-volume business, and there usually are many outstanding loans in DTC's system at any one time. Because the underlying collateral involved in these loans constantly changes, careful record keeping of loan activity for the purpose of determining the proper allocation of income distributions is important. While existing DTC procedures enable participants to identify stock loan-related deliver orders (``DOs'') through the use of reason codes, proper allocation of income payments arising from these loans currently rests entirely with the lending and borrowing participants because DTC currently allocates such income to participants to whom the securities are credited on the relevant date ( i.e., generally the record date). Lending participants recover income that DTC has allocated to borrowers of securities either through DTC's securities payment order (``SPO'') service or through some other mechanism upon which the participants mutually agree. The proposed stock loan income-tracking system will facilitate participants' processing of income attributable to securities that are the subject of outstanding stock loans. 2 The proposed system will track and monitor participants' stock loan-related DOs; will net the share amounts by participant, CUSIP, and transaction type; and will automatically credit income distributions to the proper participant on income payment date. To accomplish this, DTC will create a special stock loan memo account, which will maintain a daily net balance of loan obligations for each stock loan counterparty of each participant. 2 The term stock loan is used in the securities industry to describe loans of both debt and equity securities. DTC's proposed system will track income attributable to both debt and equity securities. Should a stock loan memo position not balance with a participant's records ( e.g., because of a DO processed with an incorrect reason code), either the lending or borrowing participant can adjust the stock loan memo account position through the participant terminal system (``PTS''). Any such adjustments will be subject to affirmation by the counterparty participant. In addition, the proposed rule change will provide that a party from whom distributions are due to be transferred may unilaterally halt all future distribution transfers by giving a letter of instructions to DTC two or more business days in advance and by giving a copy to the counterparty. DTC will notify the counterparty participant of any action DTC takes based on the instructions. DTC will implement the directions contained in the letter of instructions without making any determination about the parties' legal obligations to each other. If the participant submitting the letter of instructions is in fact still legally obligated, the noninstructing counterparty may seek to enforce its right to receive future distributions outside of DTC. If by reason of merger, acquisition, or the like, one participant's accounts are being transferred to another participant, DTC also will transfer the transferring participant's open stock loan positions to the transferee participant. Before permitting a participant to retire, DTC will verify that the participant has closed out all its entitlements and obligations for future distributions created by stock loans. If DTC ceases to act for a participant, DTC will determine which other DTC participants are stock loan counterparties and will adjust those participants' stock loan memo account positions in order to balance the elimination of DTC's obligations and rights to or from the terminated participant. The counterparties' legal obligations or rights with respect to the terminated participant will not be changed DTC's action. However, because DTC will cease allocating distributions attributable to the terminated participant's transactions, remaining counterparty participants will have to make arrangements outside DTC to receive or pay future distributions on any stock loans with the terminated participant that remains open after DTC has ceased to act. Before the stock loan income-tracking system is implemented, DTC will provide a means for participants to load DTC's stock loan data base with information about currently outstanding stock loans. Deliveries made after implementation with a stock loan reason code will automatically be added to this data base.
