"It's a classic technique, to weaken the opponent psychologically and physically, to keep him awake," he told AFP. The spokesman was speaking at the Meridien Hotel in the capital, situated on the front line in the northeast of the capital, which is disputed by government and rebel forces. Intermittent bursts of gunfire rang out during the night from the surrounding hills. [passage omitted] Rwandan state radio said late Sunday [17 April] that government forces had responded to a set of RPF preconditions for talks issued by the Tutsi-dominated movement on Saturday, but failed to indicate the tenor of the response. Abdul Kabia of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda told AFP Sunday the Armed Forces had accepted a rebel demand for joint patrols by security forces and its guerrillas to restore order. They also agreed to the principle of a judicial inquiry into the bloodshed in Kigali. But it was unclear how they had responded to the rebels' insistence that the government and the presidential guard -- accused of horrific atrocities -- be disbanded. Many of the RPF conditions are thought unacceptable to the new Armed Forces Chief Augustin Bizimungu -- branded a "Hutu hardliner" by the RPF -- appointed Saturday to replace General Deogratias Nasabimana, killed with the president.
