They have taken a firm and clear stand and acted promptly to deal with such problems with good initial results. Through the investigation of indiscriminate fee collecting and other problems, it was learned that there are 177 kinds of fee at the regional level and 1,337 rules governing their collection. Various units have discovered a number of cases of indiscriminate collection of fees, fines, retention of fees, and misappropriation of public funds involving a total of 1.761 million yuan. All of this has now been delivered to the state treasury. As of end of 1993, the autonomous region announced the cancellation of 20 kinds of unreasonable fee, and various prefectures and cities announced the cancellation of 216 kinds of unreasonable fees. Most departments and units in the autonomous region also checked on the matter in a serious manner. The Regional Education Commission checked on 13 kinds of fees and has now canceled six kinds of unreasonable fee. The Regional Foreign Affairs Office has stopped seven kinds of fee which were collected in addition to the standard fee for issuing passports to people wanting to go abroad. The Regional Agricultural Commission checked on 13 kinds of fee which add a burden to peasants and herdsmen. The Lhasa City Public Security Bureau checked on 118 kinds of fee and canceled seven and temporarily stopped 25 others with the approval of the Lhasa City party committee and the city government. The city public security bureau also checked on fines, household fees and car deregistration fees. It discovered 300,000 yuan in fees which should not be collected. This has now been handed to the city financial authority. Meanwhile, some units have corrected the situation in which supporting fees [zan zhu fei] were collected from enterprises and institutions by staff members and workers of those units.
