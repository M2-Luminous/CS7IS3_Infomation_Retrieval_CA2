Abandoning all hope of an agreement with Beijing Chris Patten has invited the Legislative Council (LegCo) to decide Hong Kong's own political future. In publishing his second-stage bill today on democratic reform, Mr Patten signals his reasonable conclusion that negotiations with Beijing in the past year have achieved very little and that the timetable for the 1995 elections can no longer be delayed. His action will be viewed by the Chinese government as a hostile act which finally demolishes the spirit of Anglo-Chinese cooperation in which the 1984 Joint Declaration was agreed. The hope must be that Beijing will show restraint and take a cool look at what has emerged by 1997, not before. But imperial pride has been wounded and China may well be tempted -- in the familiar phrase -- not to "stand idly by." There is a sense in which the Chinese government can fairly say that it has been misled by Britain over a number of years. The British white paper claims that democracy was not introduced earlier to Hong Kong because "the community had other priorities." Certainly the Beijing massacre stimulated a much more passionate pro-democracy demand. But the Hong Kong government had already shrugged off mounting local pressure from 1984 onwards for electoral reform, leaving too much to be done too late and too provocatively. Even after Tiananmen Square, Sir Percy Cradock's secret mission to Beijing on behalf of Mrs Thatcher encouraged China to believe that further political change would continue to be based upon clear "understandings." Chris Patten then shattered the familiar rules of the game like a typhoon from nowhere. He was certainly right to do so. A large section of Hong Kong opinion would have been demoralised if a new governor had continued to defer to Beijing. Today Hong Kong opinion remains remarkably solid: the decision to go ahead arouses more relief -- that the uncertainty is over -- than alarm at what China may do. But beyond the principle, Mr Patten's tactical judgment on how to deal with Beijing has not always been so sound. Diplomats may say too little: politicians tend to the opposite. Voicing opinions about the future of the Chinese Communist Party is not the most tactful activity for the last governor of Hong Kong. The LegCo now has the task of debating Mr Patten's original 1992 proposals. It may end up by incorporating some of the concessions offered by Britain to China in last year's long negotiations. Perhaps there is a feeling in some diplomatic quarters that this might be a better idea. But those concessions only made sense as long as China agreed to a "through train" formula which would guarantee that the legislators chosen in 1995 could "ride through." Beijing objected to this more than anything. A watered down package will please no one. Hong Kong has already endured a rough ride with impressive calm: it should hang on now to the end.
