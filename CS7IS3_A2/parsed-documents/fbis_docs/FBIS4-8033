They discussed, among other things, our efforts to join the European Union and Polish-Czech economic relations. The venue and the date of the meeting were agreed upon by the heads of both governments in Prague in January at the Visegrad Group summit in which President Bill Clinton took part. Pawlak and Klaus decided then that they would hold meetings at least once a year. [Begin Pawlak recording] The number of direct meetings between representatives of the Polish and the Czech side manifests clearly that we attach great significance to our mutual relations. [end recording] [Correspondent] The talks concerned, among other things, efforts that are being made by both states to enter the European Union. Poland has already submitted its application for membership in the union. The Czech Republic has so far refrained from making this decision. [Begin Klaus recording, in Czech with superimposed Polish translation] I wish Poland to be ready as soon as possible to become a full member of the European Union. We have no intention of competing with you in this respect. The Czech Republic has also been doing everything to enter the union. [end recording] [Correspondent] The prime ministers have also talked about large investment projects for the power and fuel industries. The Czech Republic is interested in using Polish ports and pipelines leading through our country. The prime ministers also discussed the situation of the Polish minority in the Czech Republic and the Czech minority in Poland.
