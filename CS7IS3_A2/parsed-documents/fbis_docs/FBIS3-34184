In today's Tehran Friday prayer sermons President Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani gave an analysis of the trend of the revolution as a crucial historical happening. He said: The causes and instruments of that most important happening -- which requires a most scholarly analysis from various global, regional, Islamic, ideological, and political dimensions -- must be looked for in three important factors: the vigilance and awareness of the people and their presence in the arena, the role of the leadership and guidance, and the creation of trust between the people and their leaders. Tehran's ad hoc Friday imam considered the people's vigilance and awareness to be the most powerful factor in the victory of the Islamic revolution. He said: The vigilance and presence of the people in the arena are not only factors in the victory of the revolution but also its safeguard in the face of all events, such as the war and the conspiracies, and give continuation to the revolution during the period of construction, planning, and implementation of important and infrastructural tasks. Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani described the human forming ideology of Islam as the most important factor in the awareness of the people, and he referred to the role of the pioneer clerics and religious scholars -- especially the most crucial role played by His Eminence Imam Khomeyni, the departed imam, may God Almighty be satisfied with him -- in making people aware during the 20 years of struggle before the revolution and the human forming role of that worthy source of emulation. He said: If a leader -- or a party -- with an objective wishes to succeed he must nurture vigilant and knowledgeable people. And in Iran, under the auspices of the wise leadership of the imam, may his soul be sanctified, such a thing came to pass. The president called the existence of trust between the people and their leaders as the basis of movement and progress and as the instrument of eliminating problems and struggle against sabotage. He considered it as one of the most important factors of concern for the enemies. In this regard he said: The enemies of the revolution, who had discovered this secret of success, embarked on an extensive effort, from the first days of the Islamic revolution, to create a rift between the people and the leadership and the authorities. The imperialist propaganda in this regard never ceased and their satanic move still continues. But what has broken the back of the enemy is the existence of the popular sentiment and the wholesale and constant presence of the arena. Referring to the assassination attempt on his life and the aims of the enemies of the revolution, the president said: [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] This incident to which your attention has now been drawn -- the assassination attempt -- to my mind this is a very minor issue which can always happen. A few people can always give rise to a small incident. However, these things are no longer of any importance to the revolution. You should feel quite reassured about that. The revolution has now become quite separated from individuals. I said that the revolution has reached the stage of maturity; it is no longer a child which needs suckling. It provides its own sustenance. A lofty figure like the imam of the ummah departed from among these people. At that time we shuddered to think about what would happen when the imam would no longer be among us. Then we witnessed this calm movement of an ocean of people, and this Islamic revolution continues forever on its path. Through divine guidance, this ship correctly continues its voyage toward its destination in this tumultuous ocean. How effective can individuals be any longer in this revolution that others should put themselves in trouble, should put themselves in danger so that a certain individial may or may not be there; and that a person like me who is one of the most minor soldiers of this revolution! I say that world arrogance, America, and others should really know that in Iran they should give up the hope that by the physical or psychological elimination of individuals they can overcome the revolution. May God protect you, your revolution and the leader of the revolution. We are very weak soldiers. There are many people like me who can be in the service of the people. [end recording] Describing the assassination attempt on his life, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: The plotters thought that by carrying out such a plot on the first day of the ceremonies marking the Ten Days of Dawn at a gathering which was attended by all foreign guests and reporters, they could disrupt the ceremonies marking the anniversary of the revolution, through a move which was minor in itself but which would have caused a great deal of publicity. By doing that, they wished to show to the world that the Islamic revolution has lost its luster [kamrang shodeh ast] in Iran. But, fortunately, they did not achieve any of their goals. The president sincerely thanked the people for all their good wishes and sentiments in expressing their anxiety about the assassination attempt on his life. Thanking all the political and religious figures, various strata of the people and departments and organizations, the president asked that all the messages in this connection should come to an end. Continuing his remarks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the inauguration of a number of very important projects during the Ten Days of Dawn, noting the inauguration of the Arak petrochemical complex and thousands of urban and rural projects. He said: The people are very well aware of the realities and enemy propaganda which says that the revolution has lost its glamor has no effect on them. Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed: After the passing of 15 years, the Islamic revolution is now, more than ever, blooming and very well supported and we see its roots solid, its sacred offshoots healthy and the people most aware and in line with the revolution. The conspiracies hatched traditionally by the enemies aimed at the destruction of the revolution no longer have any effect. The 22 Bahman [11 February] marches will be a strong response to those who design such plots to weaken the revolution and the presence of the people on the scenes. The president stressed: The people today find that what they staged the revolution for remains as strong as ever. Magnifying the problems and belittling the services, a ploy always used by arrogance, no longer undermines their resolve. In the second sermon, the president referred to the fourth day of the Ten Days of Dawn, the day of prayers, jihad, and propagation of virtue and prohibition of vice. He described the role of such issues in the continuation of the Islamic revolution as fundamental.
