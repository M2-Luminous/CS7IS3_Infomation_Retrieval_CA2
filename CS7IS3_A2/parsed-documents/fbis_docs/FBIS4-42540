[Passage omitted] Thierry Jean-Pierre's report develops several proposals for effectively combatting the mafia organizations that have moved into France from all over the world. Existing agencies are plagued by a number of problems, including lack of information and coordination among investigatory and preventative agencies, the slowness of proceedings and international rogatory commissions, and poor cooperation from banks. This inadequate organization has severely hampered their efforts. Moreover, no fewer than six separate bodies, with little or no liaison between them, have been expected to fight crime that has become increasingly organized. How can investigators flush out a front company hidden in one of the world's 20 tax havens, or expose a customer who is laundering several hundreds of thousands of dollars through the foreign subsidiary of a French bank, when the laws of that country do not require the bank to report suspicious deposits? Not to mention the fact that Italian, Russian, Asian, and now East European mafias have established a foothold in France. Judge Jean-Pierre's proposals, which today's interministerial meeting is expected to ratify, attack just such problems. They are part of a sweeping plan to revamp the judiciary that calls for creating specialized economic and financial jurisdictions in each big region of France by the end of the year. Right now, makeshift versions of such units exist only in Paris, Marseilles, and Lyon. The judges who will preside over these jurisdictions will receive specific training and will be backed by intervention forces composed of police officers, gendarmes (police militia), and tax and customs agents. They will also have access to a central documentation agency--called DESC, for Specialized Crime Research Department--that will serve as a national clearinghouse for all information on dubious financial channels, phony bankruptcies, and individuals to monitor. This new organization to combat organized financial crime is actually the first step toward the medium-term goal of creating a European agency. Already, occasional operations involving European collaboration have paid off. The Russian Interior Ministry has just forwarded the first official request for judicial cooperation to the Chancellery via Interpol and French diplomatic agencies. The request concerns a Russian businessman living in the 17th District of Paris and suspected of receiving sizable sums from Russia via the English-Norman islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Man, for transfer to Switzerland and Monaco. Some of the money was reportedly used to purchase a restaurant in Lille Street.
