This decision was made after a serious and profound evaluation of the disadvantages national exporters are facing in introducing their products in the Chilean market. The most difficult problems to overcome are the price list brackets established by Chile that restrict the access of exportable Bolivian products to the Chilean market. On 13 May, National Industrial Association President Gary Lacunza said the talks held with Chilean businesses in an environment of agreement established that it is impossible to join a free trade zone. The results of the third meeting of the Economic Complementation Agreement's Business Advisory Committee (Case), held in Santiago, Chile, on 9 and 10 May indicate that despite the growth of bilateral trade between Bolivia and Chile, the Bolivian trade deficit tends to grow. The issues discussed in the meeting included the low exploitation of the Chilean market due to the reduced number of exportable Bolivian products, the lack of potentially exportable Bolivian products on the agreement list, and the lack of road infrastructure, which increases the cost of exportable Bolivian products. The main point of discussion was centered, however, on the Bolivian proposal to suspend the price list bracket imposed by Chile on Bolivian products, which is the biggest restriction on Bolivia's access to that market. There was no answer from Chile on that proposal. In its final conclusion, the Case recognized that the lack of adequate trade channels and the tax policy that distorts formal trade are the main reasons why little advantage is taken of the ACE tariff preferences. The Case made a series of recommendations to balance the Chilean-Bolivian trade balance. The recommendations include the improvement of the procedures for issuing certificates of origin in order to unify the criteria to have the certificates issued under the terms of a single regulation. This measure also will prevent tariff preferences from benefiting countries that are not members of the agreement. Regarding the Draft Agreement on Reciprocal Protection and Promotion, the agreement recommends that the draft be signed as soon as possible. Regarding double taxation in the two countries on exportable products, a decision was made to sign an agreement similar to other agreements. For this purpose, the Chilean side presented the agreement signed with Argentina on this issue. A recommendation also was made that the Animal and Plant Health Cooperation Agreement be signed as soon as possible. Regarding the difference between the amount of Chilean exports and the amount of Bolivian imports, which shows a trade of $70 million through smuggling, the Case recommended the signing of a cooperation agreement between customs agencies in the two countries. The evaluation made by the Case also refers to collateral issues to the agreement's development such as the case of pharmaceutical products, which must not be included in the ACE list. The Case also calls for the elimination of consular visas in order to make bilateral relations easier and more flexible, and for the incorporation of air transportation in the agreement. The Case also noted the need for the Management Commission to answer the proposals made in the third meeting within 30 days, starting on the day the recommendations were made. Lacunza also reported that in the next few days a study will begin on the proposals the private sector will submit to the government to get the government to meet the conditions demanded for the growth of the productive sector with the resulting benefit for the country's general economic activity.
