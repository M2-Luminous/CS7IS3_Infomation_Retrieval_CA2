Now recovered from surgery to repair a hernia, Britto is relaxing at the beach resort of Atlantida and using the time to receive an average of 50 people a day, mostly delegates from the state branch of the PMDB. Walks along the beach are gradually being replaced by long phone conversations in which he tries to round up support for the party's nomination. "The only reason I would not run for governor is if the party denies me the nomination," he said. The decision to run in a regional election, in his opinion, puts him in an especially good position to discuss the future of his party, now weakened by charges of corruption against quite a few of its stalwarts. Britto's prescription is simple: "The PMDB candidate must be a familiar face. It must be a clean face." To the former minister, politicians today can no longer equivocate when it comes to ethical and moral issues. These subtle criticisms are aimed at a specific target: former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia. In an interview with O GLOBO, Quercia had made a rather unflattering assessment of Antonio Britto the politician, accusing him of being too inexperienced to run for the presidency. The response came in the form of cruel irony: "I do not want to write any page today that I would have to explain tomorrow," Britto said, emphatically, after begging "Dr. Quercia's" pardon for having too short a resume for his 41 years. In informal conversations with friends and advisors, Antonio Britto gives other reasons for turning down the nomination to run for president under the PMDB banner. He would not feel comfortable working the crowds in the company of colleagues whose images are tarnished--some by charges of corruption, others by woeful performances in regional posts. Britto thinks this would jeopardize the good ratings he has achieved in the polls. That is why he urges a far-reaching purge in the PMDB, with the proviso that the accused be guaranteed every opportunity to defend themselves. "The way it is on the campaign trail today, the PMDB has to stop at every corner to give explanations," he lamented. Although he turned down the invitation to serve as the government's new leader in the Chamber, the former minister vigorously defends his friend Itamar Franco. Orestes Quercia's harsh criticisms of the government and the president do not please Britto. He credits the Itamar government with reinstating ethics and dignity in the federal public administration of this country. The former minister's isolation in the southern coastal resort is only relative. Early in the morning Britto receives telephoned reports from his advisors about stories in the day's newspapers in central Brazil. Starting last Thursday, he began a program of visits to nearby towns, as part of his campaign for governor of the state. [Pereira] A survey taken in the PMDB indicates that you are preferred by 35 percent of respondents, compared with 10 percent for Orestes Quercia. Does that encourage you to run for president? [Antonio Britto] Obviously, I am flattered by the results of those polls. However, they cannot make me change a decision that is irreversible: my decision to run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul. [Pereira] Deputy, you have not only the PMDB survey in your favor. You are also well situated in the public opinion polls. Wouldn't that make you change course and run for Planalto Palace? [Antonio Britto] I have been interpreting those opinion polls primarily as a judgment of my accomplishments at the Ministry of Social Security. So I am happy when I see those figures, but a candidate for the presidency--and it seems to me Dr. Collor taught us that--is not viable unless there is a lot of solidity in his platform and among his supporters. [Pereira] What kind of problems would prevent an agreement prior to October's presidential election? [Antonio Britto] The parties are looking at the national picture through the lens of parochial interests. So the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] looks at the polls, sees that it is strong in Sao Paulo, and bases its approach on that. The PMDB does the same thing, and so on. [Pereira] But isn't there a contradiction there? By opting to run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul, aren't you showing greater concern for regional matters than the problems of this country? [Antonio Britto] It is not a matter of putting either one first. It is a matter of having a concern that, naturally, is national--to win a more appropriate role for Rio Grande do Sul. [Pereira] Do you think the atmosphere is favorable to the emergence of an alliance at the center to oppose Lula and Maluf? [Antonio Britto] I think it is only a matter of time before we see an understanding between the labor-oriented and social democratic sectors. It could happen today, if people would take the larger view. But if it does not happen today, it will happen tomorrow out of necessity. God willing, the necessity will not be too great and the price paid for the delay not too high. I do not know whether the country can stand yet another process that is formally legitimized by democracy but made illegitimate by administrative failure. What we do not know is whether the country will continue to put up with a situation where people are told to renew their hopes through the ballot box, but later their frustration is renewed because of the administrative actions they witness. [Pereira] In light of this danger of a repeat of frustration, don't you think this is a good time for politicians to put aside their personal interests? [Antonio Britto] What scares me is realizing that someone is going to be elected president. He will bear an extraordinary burden of hope, but also a dose of voter impatience that was not present in the wake of previous elections. [Pereira] Former PMDB president Orestes Quercia said the country is leaderless. Would you agree? [Antonio Britto] Obviously not. President Itamar inherited the worst situation in the history of the Republic: empty coffers, a disbelieving public, and a wrecked state. Despite all those difficulties, his performance will be measured by the fact that the next president will find the country in better shape than Itamar found it. Furthermore, we must credit him for reimposing ethics and dignity in the federal administration. So the presidential hopefuls should be the first to support Itamar. [Pereira] What would you say is the purpose of those criticisms? [Antonio Britto] I do not have to judge Dr. Quercia's intentions. I judge the effect of what he said, and the effect is not positive for this country. It is very easy today to take positions based on "I have nothing to do with that." [Pereira] In the case of the PMDB, is this happening because of internal disputes? [Antonio Britto] In the past, the PMDB's prestige was the result of a common position taken by the majority. Now we have neither the personal prestige represented by [the late] Tancredo [Neves] and Ulysses [Guimaraes], nor the programmatic prestige. The PMDB today is a confederation whose components talk to each other through the newspapers. What motivates people to stay in the PMDB is the belief that in political party life, you don't solve the problem by changing the name of the shop or its window display. [Pereira] Former Governor Orestes Quercia said you have neither the background nor the experience to run for the presidency. What is your reaction? [Antonio Britto] I should beg Dr. Quercia's pardon because, at 41, I have only able to become a federal deputy, a minister, and--above all--to earn a degree of respect that touches me greatly, that inspires me, i.e., the respect of my fellow citizens. Perhaps my delay in building a longer resume is due to the fact that I am very careful. I do not want to write any page today that I would have to explain, or regret, tomorrow. [Pereira] You and Senator Pedro Simon head the so-called "authentic" group within the PMDB. Is that group disposed to face up to the fight and compete against Quercia at the party convention? [Antonio Britto] There is no fight at all. What Senator Simon, I, and the majority of the party members have said is something extremely simple. This country has improved a lot in these past months because two principles without which there can be no nation have been rediscovered in Brazil: solidarity, and dignity. You can choose to be a parliamentarist, presidentialist, republican, monarchist, social democrat, socialist, or capitalist, but you cannot choose a country where there is no dignity or solidarity. What we have been saying is that in this improved country, neither the PMDB nor any other party can even begin to present itself to society if it does not offer alternatives that are characterized from the outset by dignity. The face of the PMDB candidate must be a clean face. [Pereira] Does this mean the PMDB will have trouble during the presidential campaign because it harbors some of the so-called "dwarfs" from the Budget Committee and people accused of corruption, as is the case with former Governor Orestes Quercia? [Antonio Britto] I do not think people can equivocate any longer on issues involving the ethical conduct of public figures. As for the colleagues who have been touched by the charges, the correct road would seem to me to be assuring ample opportunity for defense and total support so they can defend themselves. If it is proven that they are involved, the party can no longer live with them. [Pereira] But how can you patch together a unity that involves leaders who have been tarnished by accusations of corruption or poor administration? [Antonio Britto] Brazil is nostalgic for the old MDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement] and we in the PMDB miss it, too. Particularly since during the MDB era, the party's strength was that it could work the crowds and be considered by the man-in-the street as an instrument of Brazilian society that could bring about a sensible change in the social democratic line. Dr. Ulysses used to say--and he repeated it in that historical speech of his when he resigned as president of the PMDB--that "politics is either practiced in the streets, or not practiced at all." Going out into the streets will become possible for the PMDB if it understands some of the requisites put there by society as, for example, the need for dignity. This means the PMDB must undertake a renewal of its cadres. [Pereira] So you do not think the PMDB is ready for the campaign trail today? [Antonio Britto] Right now the PMDB in many states is uncomfortable about going into the streets and having to stop at every corner to give explanations. That is why we urge that Pedro Simon be named party president, since he has the best resume within the PMDB. He would be able to lead the process of renovation and purge. But I think that even if Simon is not party president, the future of the PMDB will continue to depend greatly on him. The party has a preliminary question to answer within the next few weeks: whether it wants to be a participant or just a spectator in the election process. If it is content to be a spectator, fine, then it has nothing to worry about. It can just keep doing what it is doing. If it wants to compete, then it has to change. [Pereira] In light of this confused party situation, do you think Lula would be elected if the voting took place today? [Antonio Britto] No. If Lula could be considered today as president-elect, he would not be stuck down there at 28 or 29 percent. I think Lula has a biography that must be respected, but he has not yet faced the realities of the campaign. The campaign has not begun yet. Actually, so far the PT [Workers Party] is the only party that has not been of help to Lula. The rest seem--because of omission, confusion, or division--to have been working for Lula. [Pereira] Were Lula to win the election, do you think he could forge the agreements that would guarantee his ability to govern? [Antonio Britto] The biggest problem Lula faces is that fact that many people in the PT go to bed dreaming of Felipe Gonzalez but wake up next to Fidel Castro. The PT seems to me to be suffering from very serious doubts about the role it should play--a modern and progressive role that seeks alliances with social democratic sectors to build a majority, or the opposite. That can work only if the platform is a minority plan imposed on a majority. Both the future of the PT as a party and that of Lula depend on the answer to that question. [Pereira] Might the indecisiveness of that parties give rise to another savior of the Fernando Collor type? [Antonio Britto] I think that despite the suffering, the Collor era did us some favors. One is that it put an end to these candidates who come out of nowhere and, worse, whom no one knows where they are going. I do not think there will be anything new in the election context in terms of names. Novelties, if any, will be found in formulas, agreements, and coalitions. [Pereira] If it turns out that the parties cannot agree on a candidate through a so-called "third route" and if former Governor Orestes Quercia wins at the PMDB convention, would you stand on the same platform with him? [Antonio Britto] In the first place, I would be afraid of spoiling Dr. Quercia's platform appearances because of my lack of experience (chuckles). But obviously, I do not think there is any way for Dr. Quercia to become a candidate until the explanations he was asked to provide become a solid reality. I think he himself is acting correctly by beginning to take steps, that certainly have not been completed, in terms of providing the explanations that the public is demanding. [Pereira] You were defeated in the mayoral election by Olivio Dutra, of the PT. Isn't there a risk that this will happen again, in the race for governor? [Antonio Britto] Dutra is the one who should be worried, since he once ran for governor and lost. In politics, no one wins every time. [Pereira] Deputy, it seems you are a little pessimistic as regards this country's future, given the indecisiveness that you yourself mentioned. [Antonio Britto] I am not pessimistic. What I am is perturbed because what I see is a country that is poised on the brink of growth, a country that has already identified and located its problems. And yet, strangely, things are not moving forward. There is just one reason for this: we have not yet been able to build the kind of political will that can support a plan for change.
