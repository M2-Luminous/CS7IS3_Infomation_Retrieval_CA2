The news outraged Ulster Unionist politicians, who accused President Clinton of an about-turn on his administration's previous demand that Mr Adams should publicly renounce violence and back the Anglo-Irish peace declaration before being admitted. But a statement from the White House said: "The President supports this difficult decision and believes it will help advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland." Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48 hours, will be barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New York and from engaging in "direct or indirect fund raising" during his visit for Tuesday's [1 February] conference, the White House said. For the past 20 years the Sinn Fein president has been barred from entering America despite numerous efforts to gain a visa. He applied at the American embassy in Dublin on January 14 for the visa to attend the conference organised by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy. The honorary chairman of the committee is former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and all sides have been invited to attend the one-day conference. But Unionist politicians have declined the invitation, and tonight Ulster Unionist MP John D Taylor condemned the U.S. decision as "despicable," saying the Clinton administration had "given in" to pressure from the Irish lobby in Washington. "The White House now wishes to facilitate the apologists for the IRA murder campaign in Ireland," the MP for Strangford declared. "The people of Northern Ireland say to Clinton: `You should be ashamed of yourself -- no longer can you condemn terrorism elsewhere in the free world.'" Mr Adams told reporters tonight that the object of his visit was not merely to brief Irish supporters on the status of current peace moves but to collect the views of Irish expatriates. The U.S. administration admitted it consulted the British and Irish Governments while considering the application. London, which has an exclusion order preventing Mr Adams from entering mainland Britain, argued the ban should remain. The Irish government made no public comment but is understood to have urged in private that the visa be granted. The Dublin view prevailed. [passage omitted] Mr Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said tonight it appeared the U.S. Government had "watered down considerably" its requirement for the Sinn Fein president to renounce violence. "I think it is disappointing that the Americans have capitulated on something which for them should have been a matter of principle," he said, adding: "I think it diminishes Mr Clinton." Mr Maginnis also said the conference would be undermined if it was felt more important to have the presence of "an advocate of terrorism" rather than representatives of the greater number of people in Northern Ireland. [passage omitted] Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I think it's obscene. I think the White House has lost all moral authority and cannot condemn terrorism elsewhere in the world while they facilitate someone like Gerry Adams." Mr Alderdice [Alliance Party leader] told the programme: "Clearly I am disappointed. There has been an enormous amount of Republican and Irish nationalist pressure on Mr Clinton to make this decision." Mr Alderdice, who is in the U.S., added: "I'm going to put forward the views of the majority of the people in Northern Ireland who don't want to see the violence and regard the whole position of Mr Adams as highly repugnant." Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for Belfast East, said: "Now the people of Northern Ireland will see that democracy counts for nothing. "If you are a gunman then there are people who want to hear you. There are people who will roll out the carpet for you. But if you are a simple democrat who abides by the ballot box then nobody wants to hear you." Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, told the programme he was surprised the U.S. had granted Mr Adams a visa in advance of reaching agreement over the joint declaration. "It is exactly what Adams wants. He wants to go on being able to procrastinate in order to put pressure on both governments to make some more concessions before the killing stops," he said. Joe Hendron, SDLP MP for West Belfast, told the programme Mr Adams was having problems getting agreement to the declaration among the republican movement. "If getting a visa to participate in this so-called high-powered discussion in the U.S., if this helps Mr Adams in terms of his credibility amongst his own peers, his own followers, then that can only be a good thing," he said. Democratic Unionist Party leader the Rev Ian Paisley accused the U.S. administration of "kowtowing" to the Boston Irish Lobby and going back on previous decisions. He said of Gerry Adams: "He might declare a very short ceasefire which will be hailed as a tremendous breakthrough. "This is a propaganda exercise. It is telling against the British Government because the British Government are losing every round of the battle." President Clinton had no authority in Northern Ireland, Mr Paisley told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, adding: "He should clean up the mess in his own back yard without interfering in Northern Ireland."
