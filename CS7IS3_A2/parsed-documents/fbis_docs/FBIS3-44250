[Begin recording] [Ajello] Well, the first time I received the news about this allegation was from Save the Children Norway in December. I asked immediately the forward commander to make an investigation, and I asked Save the Children Norway to provide additional information because what they gave us was very little. They just said that they had news and information about some UN soldiers sexually abusing children. Unfortunately, Save the Children Norway was not in position to give us any additional information. The forward commander has started an investigation, and I don't think that he has got very, very serious results. There was subsequently another allegation, always from Save the Children Norway, and I insisted once again with the forward commander that he had to make a more serious and detailed investigation. And once again he came up with no evidence of this allegation. Finally, we had this third round now. And now I decided to put in charge of an inquiry board my deputy, Mr. (Sadre), and he has already built up the body and he is looking at that very carefully and very seriously. [Ecott] What do you make of the allegations yourself, Mr. Ajello? [Ajello] Well, it is very difficult to say. The juvenile prostitution in this country is at an incredible level, but I hope that UN troops are not involved in this. We are ready to clarify this question, to make a very serious investigation. And if anybody has been responsible for that, he will be immediately repatriated. [Ecott] You say that juvenile prostitution, as you call it, is at a high level. Does that mean you think it is likely this sort of thing could have gone on? [Ajello] No, obviously not. But, unfortunately, it is going on. [Ecott] What about the effects of these allegations on the United Nations' reputation in Mozambique? Are you worried about that? [Ajello] If this should be proved, I think that the effect will not be certainly positive. But I think it would have a very positive effect if we take immediate measures to stop it and to punish who has been responsible for that, which I have all the intentions to do. [Ecott] The allegations, you say, were fairly vague originally from Norway, but now there does seem to be evidence of troops of girls being supplied on one particular occasion at an official function. Can you comment on that? [Ajello] Well, this is exactly what my deputy is looking at, and he is making a very serious investigation. I don't want to interfere with his work at this stage. [Ecott] How long do you think that investigation will take? [Ajello] I think that must be very short, and he has been instructed to do that very quickly in the most flexible [way] he can. He is quite a skilled person. I am very confident that he will be able to provide me with a very convincing report about that. [end recording]
