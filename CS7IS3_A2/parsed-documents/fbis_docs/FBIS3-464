Sources feared it might have been an inside job by rightwingers. The military and not police were carrying out initial investigations. Though SAAF [South African Air Force] spokesmen were unable to quantify the extent of the haul from 10 Air Force Depot in Voortrekkerhoogte, sources said the raid entailed "more weapons than rightwinger Piet `Skiet' Rudolph's arms haul from SAAF headquarters". Senior air force personnel will be briefed on the investigation on Tuesday before a media statement is released. SAAF spokesman Colonel Tommy Michell confirmed the military was investigating the crime.
