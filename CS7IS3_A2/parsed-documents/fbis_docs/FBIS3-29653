This visit attracts people's attention because it is to be made before the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks, which are expected to be held around mid-March. A diplomatic source in Washington on 19 February said that Assistant Secretary Galluci, senior delegate to the high-level talks; and Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard, delegate to the New York working-level contact, revealed their plan to visit the ROK to ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu when Minister Han visited Washington on 17 February. The source noted that the third round of talks will include important negotiations in which pending issues such as: special inspection, improvement of relations and establishment of diplomatic relations, and economic assistance. They will be comprehensively discussed and a package settlement will be sought. Therefore, the United States seems to believe that a prior grasp and understanding of the atmosphere and position of the ROK and final-stage discussions with the ROK Government are necessary.
