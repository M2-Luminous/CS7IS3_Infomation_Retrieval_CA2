They reported that in a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, both sides agreed that: 1) even though the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have resumed, it will be impossible to resolve everything by the time of the industrial nations' summit (Naples summit) in July, and 2) the two countries must turn the Japan-U.S. top leaders' meeting at the Naples summit into a success by making progress in the framework talks, and it is necessary to make preparations for that. In his report to Hata, Matsunaga said: "The United States has become realistic." The prime minister responded: "That is good." In regards to the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear arms program, Matsunaga reported he told Secretary Christopher: "The ultimate target common to Japan and the United States is to have North Korea come to a table of dialogue and to have that country observe international rules. Our task is to make efforts toward peace." He also reported he told Christopher: "Japan will render its maximum possible cooperation, but if we have too high expectations on the effectiveness of sanctions, we can be disappointed."
