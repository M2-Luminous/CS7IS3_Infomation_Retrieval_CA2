The deputies are still debating the agenda. Throughout the session the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] club of deputies explicitly demanded that all issues on the agenda be dropped except for the one relating to a proposal to recall House of Counties Speaker Josip Manolic. The opposition representatives held a different view. They insisted on the original agenda, including the current affairs hour during which government representatives were to answer questions raised by deputies. The vice president confirmed that the government was in agreement with the demand of the HDZ club of deputies and that it had withdrawn all parts of the draft legislation included in the agenda. During the debate the president of the House of Counties called on Vice President Damir Zoric to preside over the rest of the session. In conclusion, 12 assembly committees are preparing tomorrow's session of the Croatian Assembly Chamber of Representatives.
