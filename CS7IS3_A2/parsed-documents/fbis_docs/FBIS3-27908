The pledge was contained in a joint statement adopted by representatives of the two congresses in their meeting in Seoul Thursday afternoon. The statement said that the two sides decided to promote bilateral relations through a basic treaty on economic cooperation and a joint manifesto for close political consultations. The two parliaments decided to establish their consultative organization soon after general elections of the EU Parliament were held in June this year. The statement also said the two sides would support the creation of an experts club to study ways to promote bilateral relations and would strive to ensure stepped-up cooperation between the EU and APEC (Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation). The meeting was attended by about 20 parliamentary delegates from the two sides. South Korean legislators were led by Yi Han-tong of the Democratic Liberal Party and the head of the EU delegation was G. Rinsche.
