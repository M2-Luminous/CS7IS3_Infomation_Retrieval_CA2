V. Yefimov and A. V. Prusov, Sea Hydrophysical Institute, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences; UDC 551.526:551.513 (261.1)] [Abstract] Sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic, the severity of winters in the northern hemisphere, and the position of the intertropical convergence zone were analyzed to reveal trends. It was found, for example, that anomalously large shifts in the zone preceded anomalously warm winters in the U.S., and anomalously small shifts preceded cold winters. Low-frequency variability of sea surface temperature was determined from 34 years of data. Data filtering and normalization procedures are described. Low-frequency variability of the surface temperature of the North Atlantic demonstrates a significant spatial variability (up to 2ï¿½C) which is probably linked with the variability of ocean circulation. Two types of remote links between the sea surface temperature and meridional motion of the intertropical convergence zone on interannual scales are found, and these appear to be related to quasi-stable atmospheric anomalies. The local interaction of ocean and atmosphere is probably dominant in the generation of quasi-stable sea surface temperature anomalies (as opposed to horizontal advective heat transfer by ocean currents), but this conclusion requires further confirmation.
