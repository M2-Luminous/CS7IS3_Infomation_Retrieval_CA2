A source said the two sides also discussed relations between the Armed Forces and society -- relations "that the law does not cover." Arce did not elaborate on these relations. Arce explained: During the meeting "we expressed the National Directorate's concern and reported its unanimous opinion on the reforms the Military Code requires." He reported that on Tuesday the Sandinist Directorate will assess the arguments and explanations presented by the military High Command in response to questions posed by the FSLN, adding that in the afternoon the directorate will issue a communique to make public its official position on the code. The Sandinist leader said: "Our legislative wing is awaiting this position to open debates on the code in the National Assembly." According to Arce, his party's position is not a product of the opinion of the 15 members of the directorate. He affirmed that the FSLN sought the opinion of various sectors of society, including that of businessmen, retired EPS members, and the party's rank and file. Arce described the meeting as "fruitful, positive, and constructive." Military spokesmen preferred not to comment on the working session with the FSLN. The National Directorate, which has been holding a special session since last week, will continue the session Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. On Thursday, it will hold a meeting with the Board of Directors of the Higher Council of Private Enterprise.
