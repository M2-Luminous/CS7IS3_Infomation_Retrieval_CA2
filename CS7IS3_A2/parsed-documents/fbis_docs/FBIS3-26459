The move is aimed at simplifying and standardizing the taxation system. The five cancelled taxes are those previously levied on trade fairs, livestock trading, bonuses and salary adjustments, and oil burning. Meanwhile, the power to levy two other taxes -- on animal slaughter and banquets -- will be turned over to provincial, autonomous regional and municipal governments.
