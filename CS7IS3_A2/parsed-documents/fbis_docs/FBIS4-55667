Caktas had big plans and announced a sensational purchase of Split firms undergoing transformation, but his arrest has halted him in creating his business empire. He was at the center of a conflict between the Fund for Privatization and the commercial courts on additional capitalization, which is what got Caktas into trouble, an unconstitutional act in the transformation process, although the Croatian Parliament has passed a law allowing it. The Constitutional Court will decide the fate of the 120 firms which have been sold under arrangements for additional capitalization and in which a great deal of money has been invested, with certain foreign firms among the investors. This has even been debated by the Fund's board of directors, and it seems that yet another farce in the transformation process is on the horizon. At the center of it is a man who announced the purchase of "half of Split," a man who could have become the employer of one-fourth of Split's employed labor force. [passages omitted] Caktas' Plans Caktas came into prominence when he bought or announced the purchase of certain firms in Split that were being transformed. Nova first bought a complex of commercial space for 2 million German marks [DM] on Gunduliceva Street in Split. Then it purchased the firm Transsped and Adria Color by paying the workers cash for the shares of that firm, so that it became its 100-percent owner. All those transactions, if we ignore rumors in the city, were regarded as ordinary transactions in the transformation until Caktas and his firm aroused public interest by offering to build a pontoon bridge over the Novska Gorge, seeking concessions for operation of the bridge in return. Aside from the pontoon bridge, the offer also called for building a new bridge above the Novska Gorge. Sensational announcements followed on the economic environment of Split in which Nova would buy shares to round out its business empire. Caktas announced that he was going to buy from the Fund for Privatization shares in Pomgrad, Dalmacijavino, the construction firm Lavcevic, the fishing firm Jadran, Neptun, and Auto-Dijelovi, with the Dairy at the end of the list. The value of those transactions was greater than DM150 million, and Caktas would have become employer of one-fourth of the employed labor force of Split. This of course aroused great interest in Caktas, and it is only logical that resistance and enemies should have emerged. Those familiar questions began to be asked: Who is Caktas? Who is he working for? Whose money is it? Soon Caktas himself, in a statement for the media, revealed some of his business plans and announced that he would be buying all the industrial plants around the Municipal Port and moving them elsewhere to build a commercial center on the quay. This was one of the key statements that set in motion resistance to Caktas' business. Caktas confidently presented his plans for all these firms, and it is interesting that no one contested those plans with arguments, but there was constant speculation that Caktas would buy all those firms to grab up the attractive commercial space and construction sites in the center of the city and make money by doing so. Incidentally, he said that himself. However, no one explained what would be wrong with moving the factories from the center of the city to the outskirts and building commercial centers in the center according to urban planning and architectural designs prescribed by the city executive authority. It seems the only thing in dispute was the possibility of someone making money with a good idea and money invested. That was a bad thing in the former system as well. [passage omitted] Additional Capitalization Contested This is only one of the drastic conflicts between government agencies and the courts, which are sometimes waged over the backs of the businessmen and small shareholders. This time the dispute is over additional capitalization of the firms, an issue on which the courts and the Fund cannot agree. The Fund feels that additional capitalization is acceptable and indeed desirable, since it stimulates investment in the firms. The buyers can in this way enlarge their capital holding and gain the controlling block of stock, but the firm also gets equipment and money to facilitate its operation. The small shareholders and the trade unions in particular consider this form of purchase thievery and a threat to the rights of the small stockholders. The presiding judges of the commercial courts have met to debate this problem, since some courts have refused to enter such firms in the court register. That is what happened to Caktas in connection with the purchase of the Dairy. In short, the courts judged that this was unconstitutional and a flagrant violation of the rights of the other shareholders. The Fund of course defended the entire idea, and the decision on all this is to be made by the Constitutional Court. This has also been debated by the Government, and after that session the Supreme Commercial Court ordered the lower courts to resume entering those firms in the court register, and if the Constitutional Court proclaims this unconstitutional, the firms will be deleted from the register. But the Commercial Court in Split did not want to enter the Dairy in the court register even after that intervention. So far there have been about 120 cases of additional capitalization. The Parliament has in fact allowed this in amendments to the Law on Transformation, but now this privatization procedure, which involves the investment of a great deal of domestic and foreign capital, is in jeopardy. If the Constitutional Court says that additional capitalization is unconstitutional, 120 various investors will be in a fix. How is the money invested to be returned and interest paid on it, and, especially, how are they to collect for the time and work invested in the firm's business operation? Or, if the court decides otherwise, who is going to compensate Caktas, and how? The sale of firms is debatable anyway, since this right has been left to the "magnificent 13" on the Fund's board of directors, who can sell or preserve for the state the shares of the great majority of Croatian firms as they see fit, with no accountability and without any clear strategy for development of the Croatian economy. The case of additional capitalization calls into question once again the way in which Croatian firms are being transformed, and it could greatly diminish the interest of domestic businessmen in making an investment. Not to mention foreign investors.
