FR940920-1-00064 FR940920-1-00007 (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the EPA considers the proposed NSPS not to be a ``significant'' rule because the annual effect on the economy is expected not to exceed $43 million over the cost of the existing subpart Ea NSPS. However, the EPA considers this proposed NSPS to be ``significant'' because of its relationship to the emission guidelines for MWC's that are being proposed under a separate notice in today's Federal Register . The proposed emission guidelines would cost about $450 million/year. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public docket for this rulemaking. 3. Executive Order 12875 Under Executive Order 12875, the EPA is required to consult with representatives of affected State, local, and tribal governments, and keep these affected parties informed about the content and effect of the proposed standards. The following discussion provides a brief summary of the content, need for, and cost of the proposal, as well as the actions that the EPA has taken to communicate and consult with the affected parties. a. Summary of the Proposed Standards. The proposed NSPS would establish emission limitations for new MWC units located at MWC plants with plant capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW. The proposed standards do not specify which type of air pollution control equipment must be used at MWC's to meet the proposed emission limitations. The EPA expects, however, that, as a result of the proposal, most large MWC plants (plants with greater than 225 Mg/day capacity) would use scrubbing systems (SD/FF) for dioxins/furans, metals, and acid gas control and SNCR for NO X control. Small MWC plants (plants with 35 to 225 Mg/day capacity) would be expected to install scrubbing systems (SD/FF), but SNCR technology would not be necessary. Refer to section II of this preamble for a more detailed discussion of the proposed standards. b. Need for the Proposed Standards. Under the Act Amendments of 1990, section 129 includes a schedule that requires the EPA to adopt the standards for large and small MWC plants by the end of 1991 and 1992, respectively. The EPA did not comply with that schedule and is now under court order to propose the standards by September 1, 1994 and promulgate the standards by September 1, 1995. As required by section 129, the proposed standards would establish emission limits for MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, PM, and opacity), MWC acid gases (HCl and SO 2 ), and NO X . See section I of this preamble for further discussion of the regulatory history and general goals of the proposed standards. c. Cost of the Proposal. The national cost of the proposed NSPS would be about $43 million per year. The subpart Ea NSPS promulgated in 1991 already requires the installation of acid gas/PM control systems; therefore, the cost of installing acid gas/PM control systems is not included in the $43 million per year national cost of the proposal (see section III.B of this preamble for a discussion of national costs based on a pre-1989 baseline.) However, for perspective, the cost of the entire air pollution control system (including acid gas/PM control systems) is provided here. For an individual combustor subject to the proposed standards, the cost of the air pollution control system will vary depending on the plant size. The average annualized cost of control required by the proposed standards for a typical large MWC plant would be about $3.8 million per year. The average annualized cost of control of the proposed standards for a typical small MWC plant would be about $0.84 million per year. Tipping fees at combustors currently average about $57/Mg of MSW combusted. As a result of the air pollution control required by the proposal, the tipping fees for new MWC plants would typically increase by $13 to $18/Mg, with the lower cost being for large MWC plants and the higher cost being for small MWC plants. Regarding the impact of the proposed standards directly or indirectly on households, the EPA projects an increase in the household cost of waste disposal of about $17 to $29 per year or about $2 per month for communities that have MWC's. Refer to section III of this preamble for a more complete summary of the cost and economic impacts of the proposed NSPS, on both national and plant-specific bases. d. Communication with Affected Parties. As previously mentioned, Executive Order 12875 requires the EPA to consult with representatives of affected State, local, and tribal governments, and prior to promulgation of final standards, summarize concerns of the governmental entities and respond to their comments. The EPA has already initiated consultations with numerous governmental entities including, but not limited to, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, the Municipal Waste Management Association, and the Solid Waste Association of North America. These groups have been informed of the content of the proposal and the estimated impacts. In drafting the proposal, the EPA has considered the concerns expressed by these groups, and discussions with these groups will continue following proposal. Following proposal, the EPA will mail a copy of this proposal to all owners/operators of MWC's and their associated local governmental official. The EPA awaits their comments on the proposal and will respond to their comments.
