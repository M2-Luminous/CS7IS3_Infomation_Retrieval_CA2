The comments by General Jovan Divjak, second in command of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, came as UN officials said significant amounts of artillery remain despite the expiration Monday of NATO's ultimatum to pull out heavy weapons or face air strikes. "UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) played a trick on the Bosnian government and Bosnian army," Divjak told AFP. UNPROFOR troops monitoring the situation say Serbs besieging Sarajevo have honored the ultimatum. "Even at this moment the Bosnian Serbs have not withdrawn all their weaponry," he said. He estimated the amount left at from 30 to 35 percent of what was aimed at Sarajevo before the ultimatum. Divjak charged that half of the guns deployed were simply taken to other fronts, namely battlegrounds in Olovo, 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Sarajevo, and Bihac in northwest Bosnia. Serb soldiers in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza were "begging our soldiers to open fire on them so that they could return fire and not be withdrawn from Sarajevo front lines and sent to Olovo," Divjak said. He stressed that Sarajevo was "still besieged" by 12,000 well-armed Serb soldiers. Moslem defenders number 45,000. Only 12,000 of these are armed but still less well than the Serbs, Divjak added. UNPROFOR spokesman Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman presented reporters Wednesday with a long list of weapons sites still being investigated. Aikman said there was a "surprising" amount of Serb heavy weaponry left in "every location imaginable" around Sarajevo. The problem was that "a lot of these positions are in deep snow, ice, in rugged terrain," he said. He said some artillery was literally "frozen in position" and could not be pulled out until there was a thaw. But he said this did not mean Serb troops were not complying with the ultimatum since Sarajevo was no longer being shelled. UNPROFOR has said the Serbs have handed in over 260 weapons while the number for the Moslems is over 45.
