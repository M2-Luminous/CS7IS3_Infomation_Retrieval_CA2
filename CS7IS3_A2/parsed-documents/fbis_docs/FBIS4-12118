In a letter sent to the minister early March, the agents said the Iraqi Ministry of Transport had canceled all land transport contracts with Jordanian companies as of the beginning of January, once these contracts expired. The agents said while this measure was not officially announced, it was effectively enforced. The measure, the agents said, is aimed at limiting all land transport contract rights, from Jordan to Iraq, to one Jordanian-registered company, the Iraq-Jordan Land Transport Co. (IJLTC) The agents said they were informed of the new policy when they attempted to renew their bank gurantees with the Iraqi government one month before their expiration. Under the new measure IJLTC, a private shareholding company, will be the sole party authorized to issue Iraqi manifests in accordance with Iraqi laws. That authority had until last year rested with the Iraqi Ministry of Transport. "IJLTC is thus given total authority as a legal department representing Iraqi government interests in Jordan," Mr. Uthman 'Azir, of the Orient Maritime Services (OMS), told THE STAR. Another regulation names the State Enterprise of Land Transport in al-'Aqabah as the sole agent for Iraqi imports through Jordan. It will be responsible for securing clearances and transport of cargo to Iraq.
