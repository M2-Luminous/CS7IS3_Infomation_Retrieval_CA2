Although the governments at various levels and the departments concerned have transferred and organized a large number of personnel to deal special blows to the women abductors and traders on several occasions, to investigate and arrest human traders, and to rescue the abducted women, the number of abducted women is still on a rise. Through investigations in Qingshuihe County of Ulanqab League, we discovered that there are deep social backgrounds for the emergence and development of the criminal activities of abducting and trafficking in women. 1. Abducting and trafficking in women is a strange embryo produced by the gigantic transformation of society. Since the implementation of the production responsibility system in rural areas, movement in population flow has become more lively. Particularly, most of the areas with the outflow of population are mountain areas where economic development is rather backward, the living environment is very bad, people live a hard life, and there is a relative surplus in the population. While these women lack the know-how to enter society, they have the desire and courage to do so, and have become the main baggage of human traders. For instance, women from Sichuan comprise the majority of the women abducted and marketed in Qingshuihe County, and women from Mianyang area account for two-thirds of the total from Sichuan. Most of these women were abducted and sold to Qingshuihe County by swallowing the bait of job, business, and trip offers. 2. Men in areas where there is an influx of abducted women have strong desires for marriage. This has weakened society's attention to the women abduction and marketing activities. Most areas with the inflow of abducted women are economically backward areas, with a sparse population, and a wide discrepancy in the ratio of men and women. For instance, the ratio of men and women in Qingshuihe County is 115 to 100, with 8,716 more men than women. Some male adults in this county only rely on females from other places to resolve their marriage problems. So, the people maintain that an abducted woman can help offset the number of bachelors. This kind of normal marriage desire weakens the people's understanding about and attention to the criminal activities of abducting and trafficking in women. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to form a social foundation under which all the people deal blows to women abductors and traders. 3. The extremely complicated situation enhances the difficulties in dealing blows to human abductors and traders. By the end of 1992, 1,880 women from other parts of the country flowed into Qingshuihe County. Of them, 1,107 women were volunteers, 756 were abducted and trafficked in, and 17 ganged up with the swindlers to engage in women abduction and trading activities. Besides, there are a countless number of women who have escaped after being abducted and trafficked in. It is thus clear that of the incoming population from another places, there are both lawful marriage partners and women that have been abducted and trafficked in. Simultaneously, there are swindling activities. Such circumstances have objectively brought difficulties to the law enforcement departments in fixing the nature of the cases. Particularly, it is more difficult to punish the human traders who have escaped with unlawful gains before the women abduction and trading cases are exposed. 4. Buying and marketing marriage partners becomes the hotbed of abduction and trading of women. The buying and marketing of marriage partners is extremely popular in areas where there is an influx of abducted women. Money becomes the basic condition for marriage. A man in the rural areas of Qingshuihe County needs to spend over 10,000 yuan in cash gifts to marry a woman. Therefore, it is very attractive in some poverty-stricken areas to buy an abducted woman with four to five thousand yuan. Some people are even willing to run the risk of losing both women and money, of being punished by laws, to buy abducted women. High incomes also encourage human traders to defy laws and ceaselessly engage themselves in criminal activities. Therefore, we maintain that dealing blows to the criminal activities of abducting and trading in women requires systematic engineering. We should mobilize all social forces to deal blows to these activities. 1. We should be determined to resolutely uproot the soil of abducting and trading in women and buying and marketing marriage partners. The party committees and governments at various levels should put the elimination of the remnants of feudalism, such as in the buying and marketing marriage partners, onto their work agenda, regard it as an important content of the spiritual civilization of rural areas, and conscientiously attend to the basic work relating to attacking women abductors and traders. Simultaneously, we should upgrade the quality of the young people in rural areas in line with the rural areas' education on culture, sciences, technologies, and laws. We should not only have the people in rural areas understand that purchasing abducted women is a criminal activity, but also make them respect the personal rights and interests of the women and to seek a lofty, civilized family life. 2. We should further draw a clear line of demarcation between guilt and nonguilt to enhance the effectiveness of the attack against criminals. Specifically speaking, we should draw a clear line of demarcation between normal marriage with nonnatives and crimes of human abduction and trade, between marriages of normal matchmaking and crimes of human abduction and trade, between abduction and trading and swindling in partnership, and between women who are willing to stay and those who are being forced to stay and dare not ask for rescue. In line with the trend of an increasing number of nonnative women in areas where there is an influx in population, we should adopt the principle of coordinating persuasion with punishment to deal blows to the criminal activities of abducting and trading in women. The matchmakers who act as go-betweens in introducing marriage partners, either on a voluntary basis or through complete formalities, are allowed to ask for appropriate amounts of service charges. However, those who abduct and trade in women, gang up with one another to engage in swindling activities, and force women to engage in criminal activities, must not be tolerated but should resolutely be attacked. 3. We should develop the economy and strengthen the setup of democracy and legal system. This is the final way for solving the problems of abducting and trading in women.
