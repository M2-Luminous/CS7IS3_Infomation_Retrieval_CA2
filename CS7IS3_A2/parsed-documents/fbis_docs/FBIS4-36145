Monjo, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, has played an important role in the change of government in North-West Frontier Province [NWFP] and the appointment of Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao as chief minister. He also facilitated Sherpao's appointment by persuading Mir Afzal Khan and three other provincial assembly members to support Sherpao. The haste and bad taste displayed by the federal government in replacing the Muslim League government in NWFP and the maneuvers it adopted to tame Mir Afzal Khan indicate that something must have been wrong there. But no one could guess that the U.S. ambassador, who has long been like a viceroy in Pakistan, was also involved. Reports kept circulating in the past that the U.S. Government and its ambassador played a very important role in the transfer of power in 1988. The country was suffering political instability then. It was suspected that (?messages) were being sought from Washington. Nevertheless, the U.S. interest was then believed to have been confined to major issues and federal government affairs only. The latest report, however, indicates that the provincial governments also are now at the mercy of the U.S. ambassador. A question may be asked about the way the U.S. ambassador established contacts with Mir Afzal Khan via Manzur Wattoo and convinced him to support Sherpao? How can we complain about the U.S. ambassador or any other person if our politicians are dependent on the advice of others on issues relating to national politics and the country's democracy, and are devoid of the capacity to decide themselves? In view of the U.S. attempt to shape Afghan affairs according to its own perception, the government should clarify whether it wants to push the U.S. policy through the NWFP government or it intends to promote and protect national policies and interests. The federal government should also explain what price it has paid or will pay in the future for the political benefit it is accruing through the U.S. ambassador. The ambassador himself should also clarify whether he interfered in the affairs of NWFP, and if he did then in what capacity.
