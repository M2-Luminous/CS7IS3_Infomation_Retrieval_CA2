This is probably going to be a final showdown negotiation. Because the United States suddenly announced 10 days before the talks that as of 17 January the United States will unilaterally cut quotas for 88 kinds of textiles and garments imported from China by 25 to 35 percent (worth about $1.2 billion to 2 billion) and China also announced that it would take retaliatory action accordingly, if these negotiations fall through, a trade war may break out immediately. The chance of success of these negotiations is fifty-fifty, because the United States, in breach of the international practice, brandished the big stick of hegemonism and used the so-called "anti-malpractice sections" in its domestic law to try to deal a head-on blow at China from the very beginning and overpower China even before the talks begin. But China is not a weakling and is unlikely to give in to U.S. pressure. If the United States unilaterally cuts import quotas for China's textiles, China will retaliate by stopping or reducing the purchase of U.S. agricultural and industrial products. The previous textiles agreement with China expired at the end of last year. In order to reach a new agreement, the two sides talked three times, in September, November, and December last year, all of which came to nothing. During the talks, the U.S. side kept accusing the Chinese side of "deliberately" selling textiles and garments to the United States by "illegal transshipment" via third countries or regions and, in the meantime, using others' import quotas, which took up approximately one third of the total value. But China kept denying these groundless accusations. In its opinion, Chinese-made textiles transported o the United States via Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Honduras were nothing but transit goods of those regions or export goods that had been processed in those regions. They were not directly connected with China, nor were they exported by China through "illegal transshipment." China also demanded the United States produce evidence of "illegal transshipment." In answer to this demand, U.S. personnel spot-checked Chinese agency companies to the United States in New York, only to find no evidence. Later, the United States even demanded that China allow U.S. Customs to send personnel to the relevant factories in China for "spot investigation." This unjustifiable infringement of sovereignty was, of course, flatly refused by China. After all that, in order to please its own textile and garment manufacturers, the U.S. Government still ignored international practice and announced unilateral reduction of import quotas for Chinese textiles. An official of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation pointed out: The United States' unilaterally slashing quotas for China's textiles imported to America is in violation of international and bilateral agreements. According to the new agreement concluded at the Uruguay round of talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the textile import quota system of relevant countries will be removed by stages within 10 years to make free trade possible. But the United States is now using quotas to pressure other countries with double strength. Obviously, by so doing the United States ignores the spirit of the international agreement, violates the provision of the "Multifiber Agreement" that the importer concerned can increase its import volume by 6 percent each year, and does not comply with the principle that any dispute between importer and exporter shall be brought to the "Textiles Supervision Institution" for arbitration. According to a commentary in "Wall Street Journal" of the United States, this textile trade conflict between China and the United States "is obviously largely caused by the protectionist fever of the U.S. bureaucracy, rather than any wrong doing on the part of the Chinese Government." According to analysis, the United States is pressuring China on the issue of textiles not only to obtain the privilege for sending a "spot-check team" to China, but also to launch a skirmish to aid the decision on the extension, or otherwise, of most-favored-nation status for China in June this year to put additional pressure on China to open its market to the United States. China, on the other hand, is prepared for two situations. First, it expressed willingness to cooperate with the United States in preventing the problem of "illegal transshipments." It also agreed to the United States sending a representative to Beijing to help China investigate the exportation of textiles to the United States by nongovernmental trading companies. But under the principle of safeguarding state sovereignty, China categorically refused to let the United States send a spot-check team to China. In the meantime, China is also prepared for the worst. Once the talks break down and the United States cuts import quotas, it will announce specific retaliatory measures. If a trade war breaks out between China and the United States, Hong Kong will bear the brunt. According to an estimate by a Hong Kong businessman, a large portion of the textiles and garments exported by China to the United States last year, worth a total of $4.7 billion, went through Hong Kong, while Hong Kong manufacturers produce or process garments on the mainland and export them via Hong Kong. Once the Sino-U.S. talks break down, Hong Kong businessmen will suffer a lot. Similarly, U.S. importers and retailers will also suffer major losses and consumer interests will also be impaired.
