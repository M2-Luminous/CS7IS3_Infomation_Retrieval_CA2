FR940603-2-00147 FR940603-2-00088 Where an approved state program has a greater scope of coverage than required by federal law, the additional coverage is not part of the federally-approved program. See also PD&hyph;1, 57 FR 58848, 58855 (Dec. 11, 1992) (ruling similarly on nearly identical language in RCRA Subtitle C, 42 U.S.C. 6929). In summary, the Maryland oil cargo tank operator certification requirement is not ``otherwise authorized by Federal law'' within the meaning of 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). VI. Ruling For the reasons set forth above, RSPA finds that 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(2) preempts Maryland regulations COMAR 26.10.01.16.D and COMAR 26.13.04.01.F, requiring certification of operators of motor vehicles loading or unloading hazardous materials in Maryland, as they apply to vehicle operators not domiciled in Maryland. Specifically, these requirements are stricter than Federal operator training requirements and therefore are obstacles to accomplishing the full purposes and objectives of the HMTA. As applied to vehicle operators domiciled in Maryland, the requirements are not preempted. VII. Petition for Reconsideration/Judicial Review In accordance with 49 CFR 107.211(a), ``[a]ny person aggrieved'' by RSPA's decision on the NTTC/CWTI application may file a petition for reconsideration within 20 days of service of the decision. Any party to this proceeding may seek review of RSPA's decision ``by the appropriate district court of the United States * * * within 60 days after such decision becomes final.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(e). This decision will become RSPA's final decision 20 days after service if no petition for reconsideration is filed within that time. The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of this decision under 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(e). If a petition for reconsideration is filed within 20 days of service, the action by RSPA's Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety on the petition for reconsideration will constitute final agency action. 49 CFR 107.211(d). Issued in Washington, DC on May 24, 1994. Alan I. Roberts, Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety.
