An hour later a Greek warship approached the fishing ship apprehended by our forces. The Albanian torpedo-boat notified the Greek warship of having entered Albanian waters and urged it to leave. The Greek warship left only after one hour. Concerning this provocation by the Greek side, the Embassy of the Republic of Albania in Athens sent a note, in the name of the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania, to the Foreign Ministry of Greece, asking the Greek Government to put an end to such actions, which impair the relations between the two countries and increase tension, by designating them as a continuation of previous Greek provocative actions and of the criminal event in Peshkepi in Gjirokaster village on 10 April 1994. The provocation in our territorial waters does not help but prevents the creation of the minimal necessary conditions and runs counter to the proposal by the Greek side itself to hold a meeting with the working groups of the Public Order Ministries of the two countries, the Albanian note ends.
