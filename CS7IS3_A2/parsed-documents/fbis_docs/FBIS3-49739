Here are they in their full length version. [Begin recording] [Meciar] The meeting between the delegations of the Slovak and Czech Governments have just finished. The delegations were led by us, the two prime ministers. During this meeting, we told the Czech Government our stance on the cooperation within Visegrad Four, as well as on some other critical statements made recently, especially in Poland. I would like to stress that the Government of the Slovak Republic considers all the steps taken by the Czech Republic in order to protect its political and security interests to be fully legitimate. The criticism was one-sided, and simplified matters, and we do not identify ourselves with this criticism. In this respect, we express our full support for the steps taken by the Government of the Czech Republic to defend its own interests. We have analyzed issues related to the Partnership for Peace. We agreed that (?our) stance is approximately identical. The Slovak side accepts this initiative without any reservations. We have also dealt with issues concerning the agreements we had concluded in years 1992 and 1993 and the fulfillment of the obligations ensuing from them. By coincidence, in two weeks, it will be one year ago that, in the very same room, we were working on the currency division. It seems that the system which was set up is [word indistinct]. A meeting of the representatives of the customs union will take place this week, the interior ministers will meet to discuss borders. We have also debated the improvement of economic cooperation. In this area, the interest of both sides on the priorities we have is fully legitimate. In 1994 we shall continue to support the economic cooperation in 1994 as well as in the next period. These, approximately, were the main topics that we dwelt on during our talks. [Klaus] Thank you very much. I really agree with this information on our meeting. I would like to underline three issues. First, I expressed to the Slovak side and the Slovak Government an appreciation for a hundred-percent observation of the agreements that we had concluded between the Czech and Slovak Republics, especially for the immediate settlement of the debt on the clearing account. We consider this to be a very good signal and a sign that the pessimists who foresaw a deterioration in cooperation in all the areas between our countries are wrong. We are very pleased that this happened the way it did, and I would like to underline it here. Second, we talked about the Partnership for Peace, to be more exact, about our very, very close if not identical views. Third, we talked about the very close views on the cooperation between the countries of the so-called Visegrad Four. I think that both sides are well aware that we are painstakingly seeking to find the highest common denominator in the views of these four countries. The fact that we are not able to do everything as a foursome is in no way caused by any individuals on this or the other side but by the real interests of these countries. [end recording]
