Angelov is visiting Energy & Environment Netherlands (E&EN) in Zoetermeer, the organization set up two years ago to help Netherlands companies secure contracts within the context of aid for Central and Eastern Europe. Over the past few days, he has established contacts for projects concerned with the improvement of gas supplies, the generation of electricity, coal vaporization, the cleaner combustion of lignite, and technological training in his country. Bulgaria relies heavily on Russian supplies of natural gas, nuclear energy, and lignite for its energy requirements. Lignite is the only energy source that is amply available in Bulgaria, but the processing and combustion thereof cause tremendous environmental pollution, forming dust and emitting sulfur into the atmosphere. Consequently, Deputy Minister Angelov is enthusiastic about the new technology that the Rotterdam-based company Ecofire is implementing at a lignite mine to the northwest of Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, following arbitration by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and E&EN. ``The pilot project that Ecofire is putting into practice in conjunction with us is working superbly. I hope that it will rapidly be extended on a commercial scale, because we want to comply with Western environmental standards as soon as possible.'' [passage omitted] Over the past few days, Angelov has also signed a contract with several Netherlands companies covering technological training for Bulgarians who are going to set up a gas distribution system in his country. A next step, which could also mean orders for the Netherlands, will involve the construction of pipelines, control equipment, pumps, and compressors. The engineer Hans de Ruiter, the CEO of E&EN, believes that Netherlands energy companies like Gasunie, and the major distribution companies in this sector can do far more to conquer a share of the East European market. ``Look at what British Gas, Gaz de France, and German companies are doing in Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. They pay for the first feasibility studies and then receive contracts as a matter of course.'' De Ruiter believes that the shareholders of Gasunie -- Shell and Esso -- are clinging to the brakes. As a result, the ideal envisioned by Prime Minister Lubbers, who saw a leading role being set aside for Netherlands companies with his energy plan for Eastern Europe, is only materializing slowly. Probably together with the Delft-based company Hagoort, Gasunie will advise Bulgaria on the storage of natural gas in an empty gas field to the north of Sofia. Bulgaria urgently needs a buffer of this kind, because the supply of Russian gas is being interrupted due to technical or political problems. [passage omitted]
