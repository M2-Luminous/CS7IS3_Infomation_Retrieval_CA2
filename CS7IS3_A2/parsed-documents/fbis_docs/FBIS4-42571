FBIS4-42571 "drweu108_p_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-108 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 GREECE Prime Minister Interviewed on Foreign Relations Prime Minister Interviewed on Foreign Relations NC0406100894 Athens ET-1 Television Network in Greek 1830 GMT 3 Jun 94 NC0406100894 Athens ET-1 Television Network Greek BFN [Interview with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou by correspondents Kiki Angelopoulou, Roula Kambouryianni, and an unidentified correspondent at the prime minister's office in Athens; date not given--recorded] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Will there be any progress at the Corfu Summit for the European Union [EU] membership applications from Cyprus and Malta? [Papandreou] Look, this is our national position. These are two countries that must surely join the EU. We want to settle the issue of beginning negotiations for Cyprus' accession, something that will certainly be raised in Corfu. [Correspondent] What are the prospects and the climate? [Papandreou] The climate is not very positive, because accession is linked to the solution of the political problem in Cyprus -- that is, to speak bluntly, with the occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkish troops. This is presented as an obstacle to Cyprus' accession. Turkey is utilizing it, and even threatening that if something like this happens then northern Cyprus will merge with Turkey. [Correspondent] Would you comment on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report on the Cyprus issue? What are the current prospects for our national issue? [Papandreou] I can honestly say that this is the first time I have been happy with a statement by the UN secretary general. He actually lays the blame where it belongs, on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas and Turkey. It is the first time that something like this has been stated so clearly. This means we are at a turning point. Right now we are in a deadlock, and we must wait to see what the next step will be. [Correspondent] It appears that there is a second report by the UN secretary general on the issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Is the Greek Government officially aware of it? [Papandreou] I know about the basic points of Butrus-Ghali's report. I have not seen the text. What is important is that the tripartite dialogue continue, in the sense that there are two bilateral talks -- with international mediator Cyrus Vance and U.S. presidential envoy Matthew Nimetz -- not direct talks with Skopje. I hope and pray that we will have some sort of a solution before long. [Correspondent] Nimetz is expected in Athens next week, amid rumors about a double or triple name. [Papandreou] Various scenarios. [Correspondent] Right. Do you believe that the road to a permanent settlement of this national issue will be open after the European Parliament elections, or will we have to wait for the Skopjean elections in November? [Papandreou] I have hopes that the issue will be concluded. About the scenario where there would be two names, I want to remind you that we have two basic positions: First, that we will not recognize any state if it includes the term Macedonia or any of its derivatives in its name; second, that we will lift the embargo the minute Skopje removes the star of Veryina from its flag and changes the articles of its Constitution that affect our country's territorial integrity. These are our two conditions and we will not deviate from them. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, Hellenism feels that it is being attacked from everywhere. There are sources of tension and provocations from Albania, Skopje, and Turkey. Do you believe that these are isolated incidents unlinked to one another? What is your evaluation? [Papandreou] I cannot speak about an organized plan by these three. I cannot say that Turkey, Albania, and Skopje systematically cause problems for our country according to a plan. They do create problems though; and they have a climate of cooperation and mutual understanding, and there is a possibility that something like this will happen. What is happening in Albania may be explained better within the framework of Ankara's policy. I do not rule it out. I must say that before the wall of the Cold War fell, we did not have such problems. We are one of the few European countries that the fall of that wall treated unjustly. We are the only ones who did not benefit. Our position on Albania is known. We follow an open door policy. We want peace, but on condition that Greek Albanians have all the rights that citizens enjoy anywhere else in the world today: human rights, the freedoms of religion, education, language, and culture. Albanian President Sali Berisha is clearly provoking Greece, a power that is much stronger than Albania. We have said that we are observing the situation. We have both diplomatic and political means that could make any decision of ours be felt heavily in Albania. Let us hope that things will cool off. It appears that for the time being they are. [Correspondent] There is a climate of fabricated tension, particularly on Turkey's part. For example, Turkey is accusing us of training Kurdish guerrillas. There is some information that the United States is pressing for the Greek-Turkish dialogue to resume. What should our country's position toward Ankara be? [Papandreou] First of all, I must stress that a big issue for Greece is relations with Turkey. Skopje is also important, but it is another type of issue. Skopje does not threaten us militarily. The same is true for Albania. Turkey is a great military power, so we must be careful. What does starting a dialogue with Turkey mean? If this dialogue focuses on cooperation on some points--positive actions--then we must examine it. There are possibilities. However, when Turkey speaks about a dialogue, it means a dialogue that would resolve the so-called Greek-Turkish differences, in the Aegean for example. Let us not speak about Cyprus, which is a tremendous issue. What the Turks refer to as differences that must be resolved through a dialogue are things against our national sovereignty. So, when someone says that we must talk, I tell him to write down the issues. If the issues concern Turkish ambitions, why should I sit down and discuss them? If someone comes and tells you that your property is his, would you sit down to discuss with him whether it is his or how much of it is his? This is the Aegean problem. [passage omitted]
