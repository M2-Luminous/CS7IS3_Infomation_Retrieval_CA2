FR941202-2-00196 FR941202-2-00098 Any cleaning and storage procedures that are not specified by the method shall be documented in laboratory records and SOPs. (k) Internal Audits _The laboratory shall have a system in place for conducting internal audits of the methods, data, and staff employed at the lab. The audits shall be conducted at least twice annually and the results shall be documented. 5.3.2‚ê£Bioassays (a) Dilution Water Control _Every toxicity test or range-finding test shall include a dilution water control treatment consisting of the same dilution water, conditions, procedures, types and number of organisms as used in the effluent treatments, except that none of the effluent being tested shall be added to the dilution water. Whenever artificial sea salts are used in the salinity adjustment of either the dilution water sample or effluent sample, an additional control treatment shall be included. This additional control treatment shall consist of replicate chambers containing only artificial saltwater made with the same artificial sea salts used to adjust the samples. The artificial saltwater shall be made to the same standardized salinity and Ph as the other test treatments. (b) Distribution of Test Organisms _Test organisms must be randomly distributed to the test chambers either by: i. Adding to each chamber no more than 20% of the total number to be assigned to each chamber, then repeating the process until each test chamber contains the total number of test organisms desired; or ii. Randomly assigning one test organism to each test chamber, then randomly assigning a second test organism to each test chamber, etc., continuing the random assignments until the total number of test organisms desired has been distributed to each test chamber. (c) Dissolved Oxygen Requirement _The DO in the test chambers shall be maintained at greater than 40% of saturation but less than 100% when testing chronic toxicity for all species except Ceriodaphnia which must be adjusted only prior to test initiation or sample renewal. Acute tests shall assure that a minimum level of 4.0 mg/L DO is maintained. (d) Duplicate Requirements _When the purpose of a definitive acute toxicity test is to determine compliance with an LC50, or EC50 permit limitation, the test shall consist of one or more control treatments and a series of at least five effluent concentrations, in duplicate. i. If the toxicity of the effluent to the test organism is not known, then the concentration of effluent in each treatment, except for the highest concentration and the control(s) shall be at least 50% of the next higher one. The concentrations selected shall be evenly spaced on either a logarithmic or geometric scale. ii. Definitive test concentration series must, at a minimum, be conducted in duplicate. Additional replicate series may be necessary in order to achieve required test precision. Only true replicates, with no water connections between test chambers shall be used. iii. A minimum of twenty test organisms shall be exposed to each effluent concentration and each control treatment; this means, when conducting the test in duplicate, at least ten organisms per test chamber. The number of organisms used in each effluent concentration shall be equal to the number used in other effluent concentrations and to the number used in the control. Organism loading limits shall be observed. (e) No Measurable Acute Toxicity _When the purpose of ``no measurable acute toxicity (N.M.A.T.) is to determine compliance with a N.M.A.T. permit limitation, the effluent must be known to generally have an LC50 of greater than or equal to 100%, and the toxicity test design must comply with the following: i. The test series shall consist of one or more control treatments, a 100% effluent-by-volume concentration and a 50% effluent-by-volume concentration. The test shall be conducted with at least four replicates, and at least ten organisms per chamber. Additional duplicate series may be necessary in order to achieve required test precision. Only true duplicates, with no water connections between test chambers, shall be used.
