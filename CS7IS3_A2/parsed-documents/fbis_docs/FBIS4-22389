The word "myself" here has significance--for Pasha, a young miner from Sverdlovsk in Lugansk Oblast, did not bring Ukrainian sausage to Russia, but his own hands... Foreign workers and migrant workers, just like the problems associated with them, have existed for a long time and continue to exist. For us, both more or less free movement and the "fresh" state borders are a new phenomenon. I was interested in this firsthand information. After all, it is not a question of a single incident but of a system. Miners from Ukrainian border towns are applying as whole crews to work in Russia's mines. No, there are no recruiters coming here (in any case, not widely), and they are not spending time on persuasion. The ruble is sufficient agitation; that is, its real purchasing power in Russia and the appreciable difference in the rate of exchange, which in Ukraine makes it possible for owners of rubles to feel more like a white person. And in the meantime our economy will remain a pathetic cripple--we will serve on a level with third world countries as a source of cheap manpower. Why cheap? No, it has not yet reached the point of paying Ukrainian miners lower rates. The advantage is in something else. The more Ukrainian crews there are in Russian mines, the more stability there is, according to the employers. Since the ruble is worth more for us, less rubles are required: Ukrainian crews do not intend to strike, and do not demand wage increases, in contrast to their Russian colleagues. The presence of strike-breakers (it is called precisely that), naturally, assuages the appetites of the locals. But the strike-breakers, as is known, are not liked... Pasha agrees with this claim. There have been no disputes yet at the mine where he worked. But neighboring Ukrainians are beginning to be persecuted a little; for example, time after time their clothes are cut up when they leave them in the changing room. From the standpoint of civilized state concepts, Pasha and his comrades live a strange life at the coal face. Twice a day, before the start and at the end of a shift, they cross the state border. And, therefore, is it possible, strictly speaking, to apply the term "migrant worker" to them? A migrant worker, after all, is a temporary or a permanent emigrant. That is, by transporting his manpower across the border, he is also transporting the problems associated with the establishment of an infrastructure that is necessary for his residency, medical treatment, cultural relaxation, and education and preschool instruction for his children. In our case, Ukraine is being transformed into a weekend bedroom area. But the taxes, which are obliged to go to maintain and develop the infrastructure, remain in Russia. It is a strange life. Not only with regard to these global and state problems, which Pasha came to generate without realizing it. This is his daily life. After all, a person, no matter what level of social consciousness he finds himself, is a political subject of his own country. Pasha has no country. In no case professing deliberate anti-Ukrainian attitudes, when talking about prices or the possibility of buying one or another commodity he absolutely sincerely says about Russia "in our country," and about Ukraine--"in your country." After all, when you calculate it, he spends a large part of his time abroad. Pasha could not answer when the next elections will be held in Ukraine. In addition, as you know, he has not been deprived of his right to vote. Some homebred migrant workers skip voting, thereby helping "the party in power" to wreck the elections. But some... (For whom will those of them who come to the ballot box nevertheless vote?) It also should not be claimed that, in the person of Pasha's colleagues, Russia has acquired conscientious supporters with some kind of political course of their own. Except... "Everyone in our mine is for Zhirinovskiy," Pasha told me, without explaining very distinctly precisely why. He considers Yeltsin to be a Mason. Pasha does not know just what a "Mason" is, and he does not use this term beratingly, but simply thinks it is a sign of some kind of force. He has an even more original opinion about all the rest of the Russian authorities. Blushing in a youthful way, Pasha put it this way: "You understand, they all love men more." He reports all these "secrets" with good-natured indifference. Neither Yeltsin nor any other Russian powers that be prevent Pasha from earning the rubles that are so necessary. He heard that starting this year the Russian Government is imposing some kind of additional tax on mines that employ foreign manpower. (This is quite logical; after all, emigrants take jobs from Russian citizens.) Pasha feels the same indifference toward the president of his own country--he does not want to either support or reelect him. He also does not associate his daily problems with him and with possible changes in Ukrainian policy: "Kravchuk generally remains silent about us." The buses sent by Russian mines go through two customs points each shift (a deduction is made from the Ukrainian miners' wages for this service, but the work is profitable, nonetheless). Customs officials are convinced that they are not dealing with profiteers or shifty traders: "What do we take with us--a miner's lunch box and a washcloth and soap?" Well, and just like real proletariat, the main wealth that they take away from our country is their manpower. I do not blame their owners for quite understandable reasons. On top of all of this, Pasha is earning his rubles the hard way. It does not have to be explained to anyone who knows the labor of an "underground hostage"--the miner. Anyone who has not tried it personally has read government condolences to the families of those who perished at a mine face, and is familiar with statistics on illnesses. The working conditions and level of safety of our native Pasha, alas, have nothing good to distinguish them either in Ukraine or Russia. The buses roll along. Such is the reality today, and if anyone reading this thinks that the whole point is the absence of barbed wire on the border, he is mistaken. For seven decades attempts were made to cure us of the desire to live like human beings with barbed wire and a short leash. If our money becomes money, if our mines will become less like graves than the Russian ones, and if in the end another dozen urgent "if's" are realized that are possible only given radical reformation of the economy (and this means that people come to power who are capable of this), Pasha will gladly forego the long trip with all its attendant consequences: material, civic, and patriotic. There is also something to think about in light of today's situation. How to regulate the piratical "semi-export" of our manpower? How to arrive at a point where the Russian side does not just skim off the cream but also frees something for the miserable budget of the miners' settlements where the workers live and pay taxes to it? In addition, how to function so that Pasha knows that his native state is "concerned" about him? I have no answers to these questions--the statesmen should have the professional answers. If, of course, not all of them feel like absolute favorites in a country under whose flag they like to show off at official receptions.
