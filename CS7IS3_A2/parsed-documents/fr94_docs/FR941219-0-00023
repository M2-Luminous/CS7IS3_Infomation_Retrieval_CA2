FR941219-0-00023 FR941219-0-00013 In light of comments from the Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants (``SCLAID'') of the American Bar Association, the Board chose not to adopt the provision authorizing a recipient to veto an appointee. SCLAID opposed the provision because it could cause unnecessary controversy and has the potential to be misread or misunderstood. SCLAID suggested that the consultation provision would obviate most problems at the outset and that local recipient bylaw provisions or state laws would adequately resolve any problems that might arise. Although other bar associations approved the concept of the veto provision, they advised building more specific checks and balances into the provision, for safeguards. The Board agreed that there were problems with the veto provision and decided to incorporate the consideration of individual or institutional conflict into the consultation provision. In addition, the Board noted that applicable state law that deals with conflict issues of nonprofit boards and recipient bylaws should be consulted to determine what mechanisms are available to deal with situations that cannot be resolved through the consultation process. Accordingly, recipients could amend their bylaws to add provisions that deal with board membership conflicts as long as the bylaws do not conflict with any requirements of the LSC Act or regulations. Then, when making recommendations to appointing organizations, recipients may refer to their bylaws as part of the standards by which board members should be appointed. It is recommended that such bylaws deal with situations where conflict issues are not resolved by the consultation process and also make it clear that it should be the governing body rather than the recipient's staff that determines whether there is a conflict. Section 1607.4␣Functions of a Governing Body Section 1607.4(a) This rule deletes the requirement for ``effective'' prior public notice, which has proven to be a difficult concept to enforce and may be very fact-specific. The Board felt that truly effective public notice is virtually impossible to achieve, even if a recipient spent huge amounts of money on advertising. The Corporation does not wish to promote such wasteful expenditures or assume that the efforts were not ``effective'' simply because few members of the public showed up at a board meeting. Instead, the standard should be that of ``reasonable'' prior public notice, so that recipients would be required to do only what is reasonable under the specific local circumstances. The Board also considered whether it should include within the regulation specific guidance as to what kinds of matters were properly discussed in executive session. In response to comments that some boards do not give appropriate notice of meetings, the Board revised the proposed language of §1607.4(a) to require recipients to have written policies that are adopted by their governing bodies, so that arbitrary or ad hoc decisions would not be made regarding these matters. It also decided to recommend that recipients look to the kinds of matters described in the LSC bylaws and Sunshine Act regulation (45 CFR part 1622), state Sunshine Act provisions, or other provisions in state nonprofit corporation law for guidance as to the kinds of matters that might appropriately be discussed out of the public eye. Section 1607.4(b) New language is added to the rule to clarify that recipient governing bodies have, in addition to the specific functions described in the regulation, the authority and responsibility inherent in their status as boards of nonprofit corporations. The Board felt that the current regulatory language does not recognize that general authority, and the Board determined that it should do so. In addition, the Board added language to make the section consistent with ABA opinions on the role of governing bodies of legal assistance programs under the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, especially with respect to the governing bodies' interference with an attorney's representation of a client or with the conduct of any ongoing representation. The Board wished to make clear that while recipient board members were prohibited from such interference, the board as a whole should be encouraged to adopt policies to guide the executive director's actions when he or she discovers that the recipient has undertaken representation in a case that is inappropriate under the restrictions of the LSC Act or regulations. Section 1607.4(c) This new provision is intended to make it clear that it is up to recipients to design their own bylaws and that LSC approval is no longer required. The Corporation would, of course, have authority to review a program's bylaws, as well as any revisions that are made to them, to insure that they comply with the LSC Act and regulations. Several comments suggested that the proposed language did not make it clear whether a recipient must submit its bylaws to the Corporation for approval. Thus, paragraph (c) of the proposed rule was revised to clarify that LSC approval of original or amended bylaws is no longer required. Recipients need only send the Corporation a copy of any changes to their bylaws within a reasonable time after the bylaws are revised. Although the Board did not adopt a specific deadline, it noted that a reasonable time would be approximately 30 days. Section 1607.5␣Compensation Section 1607.5(a) The revisions to this section clarify an interpretation of the current rule and make two significant changes dealing with recipient board member compensation. First, this section has been revised so that the compensation restriction applies only to attorney board members. Since the provision of the LSC Act that prohibits compensation applies only to attorney board members, it is consistent with the Act to permit a recipient to pay compensation to a client or other non-attorney board member for board service or other service to the recipient. Comments were mixed on this provision. Some wanted to preserve the current rule because it relieves individual programs of the necessity to engage in debate on the subject. Several comments, on the other hand, suggested that client board members should always be compensated, and another stated that small stipends for client board members should be made in recognition of the effort that they make in fulfilling their board responsibilities. The Board adopted the proposed revision, since the statutory language is limited to the compensation of attorneys. The decision of whether to apply it to client members is purely a local policy decision to be made by recipients.
