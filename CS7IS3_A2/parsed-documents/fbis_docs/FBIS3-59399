In December last year, after a Beijing newspaper revealed that several thousand teachers in Yilong County in Sichuan had not been paid for seven months and were forced to subsist on credit, the news poured in of many other places where rural teachers were suffering due to varying degrees of defaulted wages. The descriptions of their desperate situations proved without doubt that this late news story was not just a fable of one winter. The problem of defaulted teachers' salaries did not just begin recently. During all of the 1980's, many locally hired teachers dependent on wages paid by local villagers in large, still poverty-stricken areas at times experienced the anxiety of not receiving compensation. Because this occured in impoverished areas where all the people lived in difficulty and because the extent of the problem was limited, it did not attract appropriate attention. As of approximately last year, defaults on salaries for government-hired teachers occured in some counties. The salaries of government-hired teachers are allocated in the government budget. The salaries were allocated, so why were they not received by the teachers? Unfortunately, the relevant agencies did not pay attention to this strange phenomenon and thus, this type of default was not curtailed in the early stages but allowed to spread to all the provinces and autonomous regions. Due to technical reasons (only counting recorded salaries without all the supplements) and a lack of understanding (fear of affecting one's career), the amounts of salaries in default reported by each locality were clearly far lower than the actual amounts in default. Even so, the figures collected by the State Education Commission indicate that as of the end of May of this year, the total amount of rural teachers' salaries in default had already reached the magnitude of 1.43 billion yuan. This large-scale default in teachers' salaries has become a social problem which cannot be ignored. In addition to Beijing, Ningxia and Tibet, the areas affected by this default include all the provinces and autonomous regions. In Sichuan, Guangxi, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, and Liaoning, teachers salaries are in default in over half of the counties and, in some cases, over 70 percent of the counties. In duration, the defaults are as short as a few months and as long as three years. Under the repeated exhortations by the central government to settle these debts, many areas first pay up and then default again or pay and default at the same time. For example, before Spring Festival this year Liaoning Province settled debts and reduced the total of defaulted salaries from 79.81 million yuan to 50.88 million yuan but by the middle of May, the amount had risen again to 78.51 million yuan. Only a few provinces such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Qinghai are in default for only several hundred thousand yuan. Over ten provinces and autonomous regions, including Liaoning, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi, are in default for 60 to 80 million yuan and those with the greatest debt are Henan, Hubei, Sichuan and Heilongjiang, which all owe over 100 million in arrears. There is a wide variety of forms of default in teachers' salaries, including total default, partial default and other forms. Long-term total default is common in most areas with default. At a teachers' forum held in Dunhua city, Jilin Province, in November last year,the entire audience sobbed as a middle-aged husband and wife, both elementary school teachers, described how they had not been paid for four months and, with no food to cook, their children suffered from hunger. There is no lack of examples in some areas of default on supplements mandated by the central government or by local governments. The long-term default of nine counties in Hainan of teachers' locality supplements, inflation supplements, and homeroom teacher incentive pay currently totals over three million yuan. Some areas even took it upon themselves to eliminate wages for teachers during winter and summer vacations, saying "They don't teach during vacations, so what wages are there to pay? If they want wages they should go find some themselves." Some vilages and townships dictated strict income generation targets for schools and those schools which did not meet the targets received no wages at all. All of the teachers of a central elementary school in a certain township in Gansu told news reporters in the early summer of this year that the township wanted to build a factory but was denied a loan from the bank due to the lack of a feasibility study. The local government then collected 1,000 yuan from each teacher and issued a regulation that those who did not contribute funds would not receive any more wages so that the teachers suffered in silence. One can say that during the 1980s, some teachers did not receive prompt compensation for their labor but this occured mainly in impoverished areas. Thus, in the 1990s, the extent of default in teachers' salaries is not necessarily linked to the level of economic development. In Henan, which is relatively less well off financially, 16 out of 17 prefectures and municipalities are in default for a total of 150 million yuan. Six places, including Xinyang, Zhumadian, Zhoukou, Nanyang, Pingdingshan, and Kaifeng, owe over 10 million yuan. In even more financially strapped Guizhou Province, however, even though their total revenue to date has only met half of the plan, the entire province only owes 4 million yuan in partial defaults on teachers' salaries. In economically developed Guangdong and Zhejiang Provinces, only a few prefectures owe 500,000 or 700,000 in teacher supplements. But in Liaoning, which takes in over 15 billion yuan in annual revenue, the default has impacted nearly 80,000 teachers in 465 villages and townships located in over 55 percent of the counties. In Sichuan Province, the "land of plenty," the situation is severe, with over 70 percent of the counties in complete default to teachers for over 100 million yuan. Some education specialists believe that those provinces and autonomous regions in default reflect a serious neglect of duty on the part of all levels of government in those places. Seventy percent of the 8.5 million elementary and secondary school teachers in China are in the villages. One investigation indicated that among the salaried classes in society, rural school teachers have the weakest economic endurance. Currently, the general living standard of this group is at best right at the poverty line, with quite a few people very impoverished. For example, 52.5 percent of rural school teachers in Rongcheng and two other counties in Hebei live below the average local living standard. With salaries which are already so meager that after supporting a low-standard of consumption there is seldom any left for savings, as soon as they lose that minimal material guarantee, it is even more difficult for them to maintain normal life. When the teachers in Baimiao Village of Bazhong County, Sichuan, were not able to draw their salaries, they were forced to go from place to place to find meals on credit, to the extent that one after the other of the village's canteens and restaurants were eaten into bankruptcy. Therefore, as an ever increasing number of the several million rural teachers with defaulted salaries became indebted and impoverished households, the foundation of rural education was severely shaken. The default in salaries has been emotionally damaging to the teachers. The daily life hardships created by the defaulted salaries has caused teachers to lose emotional stability. Many types of social facts entered their field of vision and served to make them even more uneasy. Some provinces and autonomous regions invest in real estate, buy imported sedans, and construct world class hotels, spending hundreds of thousands of yuan at every turn, but they still cannot resolve the problem of default in rural teachers' salaries. According to the "China Youth" newspaper, the amount of funds approved during the first half of this year for the purchase of cars by government administrative units at the county level or above nationwide reached 14.5 billion yuan. In Sichuan, it was possible to give a villa worth a million yuan to a movie actor while more than 100 million yuan was still owed in defaulted teachers' salaries. Liaoning Province spent as much as 1.3 billion yuan to purchase automobiles last year but paid off teachers' salaries only to go into default again. Several townships and counties which have defaulted on teachers' salaries were quite extravagant in the purchase of cars. The teachers have quite normally asked for explanations of this. Exactly what happened to the money allocated by the government for teachers' salaries? Will the government pursue the individuals who diverted those funds? Who will handle this? The default in salaries has exacerbated attrition among the ranks of teachers. Any place which has defaulted on teachers' salaries has teachers who are forced to give up teaching to stay alive. Among those are many who deeply love the teaching profession and are reluctant to leave it but ultimately change professions just to be able to eat. According to statistics of relevant agencies, those prefectures with teacher attrition rates above the national average last year were concentrated in provinces and autonomous regions with severe defaults in teachers' salaries. Fengbei village of Xiong county in Hebei lost 42 out of 153 teachers. One hundred-eighteen teachers retired early in Lezhi County in Sichuan. In Cangwu and two other counties in Guangxi, over 150 teachers "jumped into the sea" [left their jobs]. Four hundred teachers in Huaihua prefecture in Hunan changed professions, twice as many as the previous year. The number of class-one teachers and senior teachers among rural teachers between 26 and 45 years old in Hebei was reduced by 4,878 (16.7 percent). When a district education office in Tianjin municipality conducted a questionnaire survey of 1,000 elementary and secondary school teachers this year, 70 percent of the teachers indicated "if there were an opportunity to choose a profession over again, I would not be a teacher." Defaulting on teachers' salaries has scared away teachers already working and has scared away future teachers. In Sichuan's Yilong county, with its severe default on teachers' salaries, teaching college students view the teaching profession with trepidation. Out of 151 graduates sent to the villages last year only seven reported for duty. Even in the Beijing area, which has not defaulted on teachers' salaries, only one student listed a teaching university as first choice on the college preference section of the college entrance exam. The default in teachers' salaries has increased the resurgence in the school drop out rate. In 1988, after 850 teachers in Ningde prefecture in Fujian Province gave up teaching, 148 schools were closed for a time. Since last year, this type of situation has not been uncommon in provinces and autonomous regions with severe defaults in teachers' salaries. Frequently, teachers who have not given up teaching adopt the desperate approach of taking leave in turns to work elsewhere and scrape together some money. Many teachers, exhausted from working desperately to stay alive, have no time to prepare their lessons and no time to grade papers after class. Quite a few schools have had to turn class time into study hall or simply end school early due to a lack of teachers to hold classes. There are many instances of classes put on hold because teachers were unable to return to school after school started. Particularly in remote areas where each school has only one teacher, a teacher's departure means the loss of a school. In this situation, an increase in the dropout rate is unavoidable. Hebei Province predicts that the number of junior high school dropouts this year will increase by 55,000 and the drop out rate will increase by three percentage points to 8.72 percent. The large-scale attrition from junior high schools will not only seriously prevent the implementation of nine years' compulsory education in rural areas but will also increase the shrinkage of ordinary high schools and vocational high schools in rural areas. As one education specialist said, defaulting on teachers' salaries is no different from killing a chicken to get the eggs. In setting their sights on the economic arena, some local government officials have demonstrated zeal for quick success and instant benefit, not only proving their own ignorance but even depriving their descendents of the right to those benefits. In a place with a low quality of education, modernization is an empty phrase. In many places, however, defaulting on teachers' salaries is ruining education, creating new illiterates and holding back the next generation. [passage omitted] Why did this strange phenomenon of default on teachers' salaries occur? Why would this strange phenomenon spread so quickly? All levels of education offices and education labor unions are searching for answers. Based on the aspects understood thus far, primarily the following factors created this situation. Ever since the establishment of the new country, the policy followed on the payment of rural teachers' salaries has been unified payment by county finance departments. Impoverished counties which could not pay government-hired teachers out of their own finances (nearly 1,000 in the entire country) received assistance from the prefectural or provincial finance departments. This guaranteed that salaries for government-hired teachers reached the teachers. Around 1991, finance system reform allocating finance responsibility to all levels of government in the entire country (with responsibility down to the village and township level) combined with education management responsibility divided among different levels of government brought change. On the one hand, county level governments delegated too many of the rights and responsibility for education to the village and township level. Villages became responsible for managing and supervising elementary schools. Townships managed and supervised junior high schools. Some government-managed junior high schools were even placed under the supervision and management of townships. On the other hand, as finance systems were established at the township level, the province, prefecture and county level finance offices gradually relinquished the planning and regulation of educational funding in their areas. As the townships implemented the finance responsibility system on their own, many could not handle the township educational expenditure. Some used educational funding to supplement gaps in township finances or diverted the funds to other uses. Some counties even tied township education funds to the submission of township revenue contributions. If the township did not submit the complete required revenue contribution, the education funds were to be held and not disbursed and used to compensate for the required revenue contribution. The counties thus guaranteed that each township would make its required revenue quota and the townships were pleased to have compensation funds which saved them part of their revenue obligation. What about salaries for teachers? One approach is default, bringing misfortune for the teachers; another approach is to apportion out the obligation in the name of education, thus increasing the burden of the peasants. In both cases, the people lose out. After Comrade Deng Xioapeng made a speaking tour of the South in 1992, the economic pace in the entire country clearly increased. All levels of government jumped to increase economic investment. Some places were not realistic in their approach, blindly setting up businesses, and taking over educational funds when funds were very tight. When educational funds were taken to do other things, educational funds of course could no longer be disbursed monthly. The supplement base set for impoverished areas (unchanged for many years) became lower than the ever increasing demand. Three prefectures in the eastern foothills of the Taihang mountains, Lingshou, Fuping, and Tangxian, for a period this year owed an accumulated debt of over 10 million yuan in teachers' salaries. This was because government allocated educational funds were not disbursed on time for quite a long period. Funds for supplements to locally hired teachers are partly from supplemental educational funds. Since 1986, it has been a special funding item with revenue collected locally by townships. But because on the one hand, collection was slack and on the other hand it was not well managed, these funds have often not been collected, or if collected, were diverted to other uses. After the State Council asked that the people's burdens be decreased, some provinces and autonomous regions even deemed this an excessive burden on the peasants and issued decrees temporarily ceasing this collection. For example, in Baoding prefecture in Hebei, the 20 counties there should collect 73.8 million yuan but as of now have only collected 20 percent. Without these funds, where will the supplement for locally hired teachers come from? The faulty work, bureaucratism, and even violation of laws and discipline of some local governments are also factors which have contributed to creating or exacerbating the default and cannot be ignored. In terms of faulty work, some counties with good revenues decreased educational funds to start economic projects, creating a major policy deviation. Revenues for 1992 in Jing County in Hebei were 11 percent greater than those from the previous year but educational expenditures decreased by 18.5 percent. This was in violation of the central government's regulation on educational funds that "both will increase." Some counties have left the position of vice county head in charge of culture and education vacant for a long time, thus losing an opportunity to resolve the default problem. Some county leaders lack a sense of urgency and responsibility towards clearing the debts, making outstanding defaults worsen daily. In terms of violating laws and and discipline, some counties have taken revenge on those who have honestly reported on the default situation. Some townships have diverted educational funds and educational supplements allocated by the government to setting up factories. Some townships have taken advantage of the time lag after educational funds have been disbursed from higher levels to loan out the money and reap large profits. The government of one county in Sichuan even issued a `red-topped document' stipulating that each teacher must donate 300 yuan to revive the local tobacco factory. The method used was to "chop" it all at once directly out of a teacher salary disbursement from the finance department. Based on information from teachers in many places, at the same time that local governments were defaulting on teachers' salaries, they were constructing many buildings of all types, buying many fancy cars, and spending money with abandon on travel in China and abroad. If part of that money had been used on education, the problem of defaults on teachers' salaries would never have developed to this point. [passage omitted]
