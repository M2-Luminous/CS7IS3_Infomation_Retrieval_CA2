The first planes will arrive in Israel in a short time. Today it is official and final. The agonizing decision has been made and the F-15I will be the IAF's next fighter jet. Each plane costs approximately $100 million and the Defense Ministry's budget permits the purchase of 20 such planes. There was a lot of hesitation and qualms by IAF officers. They found it hard to choose between 20 F-15's or 50 F-16's at the same price. However, the General Staff ultimately opted for the F-15. The long range threats facing Israel weighed the decision in its favor, and the offices of McDonnell Douglas in Israel and abroad are celebrating a huge victory. The United States is not only supplying Israel with the most advanced plane of its kind; it is no less importantly supplying the accompanying technology and this already constitutes a qualitative leap. It will be possible to install Israeli systems in this model aircraft and it will take time until the IAF can paint its insignia on their wings. Former senior IAF officers this evening criticized the decision to purchase the F-15I.
