What is the latest situation in NATO regarding Gorazde and Bosnia-Herzegovina in general? [Cetin] As you know the attacks on Gorazde, which started at the end of March, have gradually been directed against the civilian population despite all efforts to put an end to the aggression. I had a conversation with the Bosnian prime minister today. It is reported that over 90 persons, including women and children, were killed yesterday. Naturally, we, from the very beginning have taken initiatives involving the UN Security Council and NATO. At long last a few days ago, on 18 April, the UN secretary general asked NATO to take action just as had been the case regarding Sarajevo. The meetings have been continuing for the last few days. The issue was again discussed in Brussels today. We have stressed that the issue of Gorazde is most urgent. There are four other safe havens. We thought that it was necessary to take an urgent decision concerning Gorazde. A decision was reached earlier this evening regarding Gorazde. Since all other efforts have not yielded any results it has become necessary to use force again. NATO is issuing an ultimatum regarding Gorazde. The ultimatum is as follows: All Serbian weapons and forces in Gorazde will be withdrawn three kilometers by tomorrow midnight, that is 0300 Turkish time. All humanitarian aid will be able to get into the city easily. The NATO decision also specified the borders of the Gorazde safe haven in order to avoid any confusion. The region within a 20 kilometer radius from the city center is defined as the Gorazde safe haven. Heavy weapons or military positions within this 20 kilometer radius will be bombed through coordination to be established between the UN forces and NATO. This is an important decision. A new phase has thus been reached in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I hope that the Serbian officials will realize the significance of this decision and abide by the ultimatum without further fighting. Otherwise, it is clear that NATO will carry out its ultimatum because Gorazde is being attacked for the last 20-25 days. These attacks are directed against the civilian population. This decision also constitutes a significant step towards a lasting peace and cooperation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN secretary general was informed of this decision and it has gone into effect. If any shots are fired within the next 24 hours in specified regions, if the civilian population of Gorazde is attacked within that 20 kilometer radius then NATO forces will be to take action. The NATO meeting will resume in a while to discuss the remaining four safe havens. A decision will be reached regarding those regions as well. In other words, there is a draft decision concerning Zepa, Srebrenica, Tuzla and Bihac. NATO will discuss that tonight and a decision is expected. [Kiraz] We sincerely share your wishes. As you have stressed, NATO is, this time, decided and serious about its ultimatum. There is no turning back. [Cetin] This decision was adopted unanimously by 16 countries. Among them the United States, Turkey and other significant European countries. This is a serious decision. NATO has a credibility and a prestige to maintain. NATO has been patient. The United Nations has been patient. The Serbs have tried to gain time. They used this time not to attain peace but to move into Gorazde and to increase their attacks against the civilian population. I hope that they will abide by this serious and significant NATO decision without any further bloodshed. [Kiraz] We also share you hope.
