How To Develop a Formula To Make It Possible To Move Muscovites Out of `Khrushchev Slums'"] [Text] Another major problem has hit Moscow: many of the "Khrushchev slums" have long exceeded their designated lifetime and living in them is getting not only uncomfortable, but simply dangerous. They should be torn down, but that is easier said than done: where to get the trillions of rubles needed to tear down old houses and build new ones to move people into? The capital's lean treasury has no money for such a major undertaking, and no help from the federal government is forthcoming. Is there no way out? "There is," says A. Bryachikhin, prefect of the Western Administrative District. [Andreyev] What are your plans on this score, Aleksey Mikheyevich? [Bryachikhin] Why just plans? We try not to talk, but to do at least something for real. We have already begun to move people out of "Khrushchev slums." Their first occupants will celebrate housewarmings in the first half of this year. [Andreyev] Where will they celebrate their housewarmings when, as I know, the district receives very little free municipal housing, while the waiting list is huge? [Bryachikhin] We are already building new apartment houses to resettle people from old houses on a commercial basis in the Matveyevskoye, Mosfilmovskiy, Solntsevo, and several other municipal districts. Twenty thousand square meters of housing were built last year, and 200,000 are nearing completion this year. I anticipate your next question: "Where do you get the money?" We have only one solution: attract investors. Here is one example of business cooperation. Construction of new housing in a neighborhood in the Fili-Davydkovo municipal district, where seventeen 22-story buildings will go up, will be financed by the Russian company KONTI, the design was produced by Mosproyekt-1 workshop No. 14, and the main subcontractor is the Sokoliniye Gory Construction House joint-stock company. We are carrying out reconstruction jobs in batches, block by block. [Andreyev] On what terms did you contract the investors? [Bryachikhin] Fair and square: fifty-fifty. The authorities contribute land, the investors all the rest: financing, design, construction, and ownership. For that the contract assigns them half the property--apartments in the new houses, with the other half going to us to resettle people from the "Khrushchev slums." [Andreyev] Isn't the cost pretty steep? [Bryachikhin] What can one do if there is no other way out? Waiting for the old houses to start collapsing, and, God forbid, with human casualties, is simply criminal. [Andreyev] What do you plan to do with the old buildings: tear them down or reconstruct or reinforce them? [Bryachikhin] We will only tear them down, because many of the buildings of that series simply cannot be reconstructed. As for those houses where it might be possible, the cost would be higher than new construction. And one more question: who would undertake the reconstruction, and how? Builders would not come, because new construction is continuous, with high productivity, so they earn fairly well. It would hardly be possible to earn as much in reconstruction. [Andreyev] So you will just tear down the houses and dump the rubble? [Bryachikhin] Not at all. We already have the experience of the former Sevastopol rayon, where they had begun to tear down old buildings. The bathroom fixtures were removed, the panels were crushed into gravel, which can be used to build good roads or cottages on garden plots. We will do likewise. [Andreyev] I heard of your prefecture's conflict with the municipal housing department regarding a new house on Michurinskiy Prospekt avenue. Can you explain this? [Bryachikhin] Indeed, our prefecture has filed a suit against the municipal housing department with the arbitration court. Here is the issue: Jointly with the Sovtels firm we built an apartment house in the 38th block of the avenue on the following conditions: 45 percent of the apartments go to the company, 25 percent to the subcontractor, and 35 percent to us and the district police. We worked together, built the house, and then what? The municipal housing department, which had virtually nothing to do with the house, took it over and began distributing housing as it saw fit. Many want a share... [Andreyev] But that is daytime robbery... [Bryachikhin] There is nothing I can say. I appealed to Yuriy Mikhaylovich Luzhkov, he instructed the department to return the housing. They returned the company's share, but the prefecture has still received nothing. Many investors got concerned, and one can understand them: is it worth risking, investing huge sums, which then may go to the wind? Because of the municipal housing department we could not only lose investors, but a vital important undertaking may grind to a halt. [Andreyev] Aleksey Mikheyevich, not long ago our paper published an item that the mayor had dispatched some kind of special commission to your prefecture to check abuses by heads of municipal districts and services of the district. Is the commission already "digging"? [Bryachikhin] It is quite different. There is indeed a commission from the mayor's office in the district, but it is here on a regular basis. The government decided to have district heads report on the resolution of strategic and current issues of servicing the population. They began with us. As for the arrest of three district executives, which did take place, only the court can decide what violations they committed. The investigation is continuing.
