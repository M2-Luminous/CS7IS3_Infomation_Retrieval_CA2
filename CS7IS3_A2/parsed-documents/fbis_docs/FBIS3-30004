Hata told Vice Premier Zhu Rongji that although Sino-U.S. ties seem to have improved recently, he thinks there are still some problems concerning renewal of the MFN status. As one of the "tangible measures" to be taken to ensure renewal of the MFN status, Hata implied that Beijing should improve its human rights record, the officials said. China's MFN status, which must be extended every year under U.S. law, ends in June. Washington has linked further extension this year to a "significant overall improvement" in China's human rights record. Zhu told Hata that relations between Beijing and Washington have made progress since U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin met in Seattle in November, the officials said. The meeting between Hata and Zhu lasted about 50 minutes and was followed by a dinner, they said. Also during the meeting, Hata urged China to submit as early as possible official lists of projects to be covered by Japan's yen loans so that Tokyo and Beijing could determine the projects, the officials said. He was quoted as saying Japan places importance on protecting the environment when extending loans. When Hata visited China in early January, Japan and China agreed to divide Japan's loan periods from five years to three-year and two-year periods beginning with fiscal 1996 starting April that year. Beijing has sent unofficial lists to the Japanese Government of the projects to be handled under the yen loans but has yet to submit official lists, the officials said.
