And I would like to take this opportunity to express my Lunar New Year greetings to people from all walks of life in Eastern District present here. I wish you all a happy Lunar New Year, good health, and smoothness in everything! In the past year, with the common efforts of Hong Kong compatriots and citizens and under the direct influence of the mainland's prosperous economic development and a fine social situation, Hong Kong has maintained its economic development vitality after overcoming all kinds of negative factors. In the political field, the past year has not been tranquil. In October the year before last, Mr. Chris Patten unilaterally dished out a so-called constitutional reform package regardless of the Chinese side's advice and objection, thus causing an open dispute. Last year, China and Britain held 17 rounds of talks on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements. In the process of the talks, despite the greatest efforts, much flexibility, and accommodations on many issues on our part, the British side still obstinately insisted on its "three violations" program regardless of the Chinese side's and Hong Kong citizens' strong opposition and the severe criticism by farsighted personalities within and outside the British Government. It constantly obstructed and undermined the talks and announced the suspension of the talks when there was no agreement between the two sides. It unilaterally submitted part of the constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council, thus causing the talks to break down. Everyone is aware of these facts. But to deceive the public and mislead public opinion, a British Cabinet meeting held not long ago and a recent speech by Mr. Chris Patten still indicated their wish to reopen the talks. This method of deception is unwise and will only enable people to see through their hypocrisy. The British side's unilateral publication of the details of the talks, which have been sorted out by itself, is aimed at deceiving the citizens, misleading public opinion, and covering up and shifting its responsibility for undermining the talks and Sino-British cooperation. But all this has come to naught. The Chinese side has never objected to publishing the details of the talks. We said long ago that the publication of the details of the talks and the British side's act of undermining the talks will not bring any glory to Mr. Chris Patten; it will only enable citizens to understand clearly how they obstinately persist in the stand of "three violations" and how they obstructed and undermined the talks. But the Chinese Government has always acted in good faith in diplomacy. The Chinese and British Governments sent representatives to the talks, there were agreements between China and Britain, and the details of the talks remained secret; if the details of the talks were to be published, the two governments should reach an agreement. Now the Hong Kong governor, who was sent by the British Government to exercise colonial rule in Hong Kong, has commanded the British Foreign Office to unilaterally take action which involves diplomatic affairs between the two countries. This is something we cannot make head or tail of. After being ridiculed by public opinion, the British side said that the details of the talks would be jointly published by the British and Hong Kong Governments, to redeem their face a little. We will certainly respond to the British side's move. To maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during its transitional period and ensure a smooth transition in 1997, the Chinese side hopes for good cooperation between the two sides. This is explicitly set down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and the Chinese side has made positive efforts toward this end. But cooperation is not unilateral. Now the British side wants to be antagonistic in addition to not being cooperative. This is nothing terrifying. Because the constitutional structure cannot converge, the British side's three-tier councils will terminate on 30 June 1997, and at that time the Chinese side will reorganize the structure of the three-tier councils according to the provisions of the Basic Law. Officials from the British side have repeatedly said that this will not happen. That is only their wishful thinking. The future Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional Government will be a special administrative regional government directly under the jurisdiction of the central people's government after China recovers Hong Kong and resumes the exercise of sovereignty over it; this government will not be a continuation of the British Hong Kong Government. It is legitimate and rational to dissolve and reorganize the political structure of a government currently under British colonial rule. Now Hong Kong's return to the motherland in 1997 is less than three and a half years away. There is a great deal of preparatory work to do for the transfer of power. Hong Kong citizens are generally concerned about whether or not Hong Kong's steady transition can be ensured at a time when the Sino-British talks have broken down and the British side is not being cooperative. The Chinese Government has stated time and again that under any circumstances, China has full confidence and the ability to ensure Hong Kong's steady transition together with the Hong Kong citizens and to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled. This judgment is based on a coolheaded analysis of various objective factors. First, China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong is a just cause which corresponds with the trend and popular feeling, is rational and legitimate, and enjoys wide-ranging support from the descendants of Emperor Huangdi, including Hong Kong compatriots. For more than 100 years after the opium war, the Chinese nation experienced plunder and disasters and was subjected to humiliation. The founding of New China enabled the Chinese nation to stand tall among the nations of the world; reform and opening up have all the more brought about a new look in China; and its politics have remained stable, its society is harmonious, its comprehensive national strength keeps increasing, its people's lives are improving markedly, and its international position is being enhanced. Against this major historical background, China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong will help rehabilitate the nation after more than 100 years of humiliation; and this is an event affording general satisfaction. No force can obstruct the Chinese nation's wish for reunification and prosperity. Second, the series of principles and policies for Hong Kong announced by the Chinese Government are entirely correct and have won enthusiastic support from the Chinese people, including the citizens of Hong Kong, and have received extensive recognition from around the world. The basic point of these policies is to achieve Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems," after sovereignty over Hong Kong is recovered in 1997. These basic principles and policies were laid down in legal form by way of the formulation and promulgation of the Basic Law. Over the past 10 years or so, the Chinese Government has consistently and steadfastly abided by these policies, without being shaken by all the domestic and external factors or making any change because of the British side's breach of faith, which has greatly boosted the confidence of Hong Kong's general public in staying in the territory to assist in the territory's future development. It is because of the Chinese Government's consistency in adhering to this policy that Hong Kong has basically maintained social stability and economic growth up to now in the transitional period, as a result of which the public feel reassured and large numbers of emigrants are returning to the territory. The overwhelming majority of the people in Hong Kong and investors in the territory from elsewhere are full of confidence in Hong Kong's sustained prosperity and stability. Third, Hong Kong is an economic center. Its advantage lies in its economy and steady economic growth is the basis of Hong Kong's smooth transition. As the reform and opening up in the mainland are continuously deepening and expanding, the mainland and Hong Kong are coming closer and closer together in their economic ties and Hong Kong's role as a bridge and link between the mainland and the international market is also being ever more fully brought into play. As of April 1993, the Chinese mainland replaced the United States as Hong Kong's biggest source of transit goods and biggest destination of exports. The number of Chinese-funded and mainland enterprises which have their shares listed on Hong Kong's stock market has significantly increased, constituting a conspicuous force among all listed companies in Hong Kong. Facts indicate that the economy of Hong Kong and that of the mainland have fused and are inseparable. Since last year, a series of record highs has been observed on the Hong Kong stock market and large amounts of foreign investment have poured in. This is not only a result of people seeing positive trends in Hong Kong's economy, but also a sign of their optimism about the prospects for the mainland economy. As long as the mainland economy maintains a sustained, speedy, and healthy [chi xu jian kang kuai su 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] growth, Hong Kong will continue to benefit from it. Fourth, after going through the stormy past few years in this transitional period, the Hong Kong people's sense of belonging and sense of identity in connection with their motherland has been gradually enhanced. They are feeling more profoundly than ever before the connection of their vital interests with their motherland's future and interests and have come to realize that Hong Kong's stability and prosperity hinge on the steady development of the mainland and the harmony between the two places. Assuming the posture of masters of their own affairs, the people of Hong Kong are, in a manner never seen before, showing concern for and taking part in social affairs, supporting smooth transition, and opposing any act to impede the return of Hong Kong's sovereignty and to sabotage smooth transition. The voice of patriotism and love for Hong Kong is getting progressively stronger, the influence of patriotic forces in Hong Kong's political life and social affairs is gradually expanding, and the stabilizing factors are strengthening by the day. The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC], as a working organ authorized by the National People's Congress [NPC] to make preliminary preparations for the setting up of the Special Administrative Regional Government, has since its founding done a great deal of work for the smooth transition and transfer of government in Hong Kong. This signals the beginning of a new phase in the preparations for the transfer of government in Hong Kong. It has been made possible to a large extent by the Hong Kong people's enthusiastic support and active participation. Mr. Chris Patten has time and again belittled and attacked the PWC and even insulted PWC members. It shows that the founding of the PWC is very necessary and all the work it does is a powerful check on the British side's attempt to sabotage the smooth transition. One may say that if some people have the audacity to risk universal condemnation and try to create great chaos in Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong will definitely not allow them to do so. Fifth, the British side's change of policy toward Hong Kong has greatly damaged the mutual trust and cooperative relationship between China and Britain, which has in turn harmed Hong Kong's and Britain's own interests. This will naturally cause discontent and opposition among more and more people of insight in Hong Kong and in Britain. Even if the British side maintains an antagonistic stance in the coming three years or so, it will only have limited power and influence. Any decisions that involve issues beyond 1997 made by the British side in the transitional period without seeking consensus through consultations between China and Hong Kong will definitely be terminated on 1 July 1997. This also applies to the three-tier councils that will have to be reorganized. The British side has repeatedly claimed that if the Chinese Government reorganizes the three-tier councils in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant provisions of China's NPC on 1 July 1997, it will meet with the objections of world opinion. But the opposite will be the truth. The side that should receive condemnation by world opinion is the British side. In short, justice is on the Chinese side, popular feeling is for the Chinese side, and the time advantage is also with the Chinese side. All kinds of positive factors contributing to the smooth transition in Hong Kong are gradually expanding and the ultimate initiative is in our hands. Hong Kong's future is full of brightness. As early as in 1984, Deng Xiaoping said: "One should believe that the Chinese in Hong Kong can run Hong Kong well. Refusing to believe that the Chinese in Hong Kong can run Hong Kong well is a mentality left behind by the old colonialism." After Hong Kong returns to China in 1997, Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy will be instituted according to the principle of "one country, two systems" and in pursuance of the provisions of the Basic Law. "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" must be exercised mainly by patriots. This is not only an important expression of China's resumption of sovereignty over the territory, but also an objective requirement for safeguarding national unity, correctly handling the relationship between the "two systems" operating in the mainland and in Hong Kong respectively, and maintaining permanent prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. The criteria for a patriot are: Respect for his nationality, sincere support for his motherland in resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, and refraining from harming Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Therefore, love for the country and love for Hong Kong should be entirely aligned. In the same speech, Deng Xiaoping also said: "The people of Hong Kong are capable of running Hong Kong well. They should have such self-confidence. The existing prosperity of Hong Kong is largely a result of the efforts made by the Chinese. Chinese are not any less intelligent than foreigners. Chinese are not imbecile. Do not always think that only foreigners can do a good job. One should believe we Chinese can also do a good job ourselves." This is a full affirmation of the important contributions that Hong Kong compatriots have made to the territory's prosperity and also an expression of the greatest trust in Hong Kong compatriots. The overwhelming majority of the Chinese in Hong Kong are patriotic. The general public are deeply conscious of the righteousness of the cause, have a strong national pride and confidence, support their motherland's peaceful reunification, support their motherland in resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, and do not wish to see anything happen that undermines Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Hong Kong compatriots have had a glorious patriotic tradition in history. During the talks between China and Britain on Hong Kong's future, after Hong Kong entered the transitional period, Hong Kong compatriots did a great deal of work with utter patriotic enthusiasm. In recent years, by supporting their motherland in its construction drive, by participating in the formulation of and propaganda on the Basic Law, by providing relief for East China when it was stricken by disastrous floods in 1991, by supporting their motherland in the 2000 Olympics bid, by providing aid for the "Hope Project," and by doing many other things, Hong Kong compatriots have shown fervent patriotism. To prepare for the territory's return to the motherland, the compatriots in various circles in Hong Kong have been taking an active part in various social affairs and doing their best to help maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. The Eastern District Association for People From All Walks of Life, as a patriotic mass organization that loves Hong Kong, has done a great deal of work in the past four years in connecting extensively with the compatriots from all walks of life in Eastern District and in helping promote Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and smooth transition. It has won praise from personalities of various circles. After Hong Kong is returned to the motherland in 1997, the patriotic enthusiasm of Hong Kong compatriots is bound to be able to find full expression in running Hong Kong and accomplish new feats. I believe our Hong Kong compatriots are now all asking themselves this question: In this important historical period when Hong Kong is about to return to the motherland, what have I done for it and what have I contributed to it? And I have even more reason to believe that everybody will give the best answer with their actions. Thank you.
