Speaking at a conference of private industrialists, the former central bank chief gave an overview of his one year in the premier's office, saying that popular consensus around his executive was obtained thanks to the "triangle" formed by government, business and unions in times of decision-making. "Governments come and go but the players in the economic scene remain to guarantee the agreements made," Ciampi said, stressing that respect of the accords is also "a guarantee of social peace, economic development and financial stability." Trade union leaders have recently expressed fears that the new right-wing government, expected to replace Ciampi after new parliamentary speakers are elected, may decide, in the name of neo-liberal free market ideology, not to comply with two accords signed in 1992 and 1993 by the government, the private employers' association Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], and the three major trade union federations. In his address, Ciampi commented that those who profess abstract free-market ideologies may see the "triangle" as a form of elitist "associationship" responsible for all of Italy's problems and that must be done away with, but he emphasized that there is a difference between this form of associationship and "consensus." The former, Ciampi said, "weakens autonomy and responsibility, damages decisions and prevents the government's work from being seen as action." The latter, he said, "is the sort of air a democratic government should always breathe in a complex and difficult democracy with an open market." Ciampi then recounted the achievements and actions of his government since he was sworn into office on April 29, 1993, stressing the issues of industrial relations, public finances and privatizations. He said his economic policies focused on five topics: labor market wages and policies; monetary and exchange policies; righting public finances; privatizations and industrial relations; public administration reforms. "All of it aimed at re-launching the economy and increasing employment," he said. Ciampi claimed that the "basic conditions for a boost in production" have been created thanks to lower interest rates, lower labor costs, a more flexible job market, a "more competitive" currency, monetary stability and an influx of capital into the bond market. Commenting on recommendations by conservative economic experts (and campaign promises by right-wing parties) to slash taxes, Ciampi said it would be very difficult to reduce fiscal pressure without incisive and further spending cuts.
