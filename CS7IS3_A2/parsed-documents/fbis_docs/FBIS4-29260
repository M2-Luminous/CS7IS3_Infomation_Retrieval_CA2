This decision was made at a meeting of the unification and security-related ministers after they were informed by the United States yesterday of the draft resolution on sanctions against the North. In this connection, a responsible Foreign Ministry official said that ample discussion was held with our government prior to the U.S. draft of the resolution calling for sanctions against the North which stipulates an arms embargo and a one-month grace period and that it thus well reflects our government's position. The Foreign Ministry official said that because former U.S. President Carter made clear in his remarks that North Korean nuclear transparency was the premise for normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations, this does not significantly deviate from the basic policy of the ROK and the United States to solve the North Korean nuclear problem thoroughly and comprehensively.
