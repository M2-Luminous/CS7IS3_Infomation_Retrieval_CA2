FR941117-2-00125 FR941117-2-00086 [Docket No. 50&hyph;445] Texas Utilities Electric Company; Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Unit 1; Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 Notice is hereby given that by a ``PETITION FOR EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNDER PROVISION OF 10 CFR 2.206 WITH REGARD TO COMANCHE PEAK UNIT 1 AND THERMOLAG 330&hyph;1 FIRE BARRIERS,'' dated September 26, 1994, Citizens for Fair Utility Regulation and Nuclear Information and Resource Service (Petitioners) request that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission take action with regard to Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES) Unit 1 of Texas Utilities Electric Company (TU Electric). The Petition requests that (1) the licensee perform additional destructive analysis for Thermo-Lag configurations in proportion to the total installed amount to determine the degree of ``dry joint'' occurrence; (2) the licensee perform fire tests on up-graded ``dry joint'' Thermo-Lag configurations for conduit and cable trays to rate the barrier as a tested configuration in compliance with fire protection regulations; and (3) the NRC immediately suspend the Comanche Peak Unit 1 license until the above corrective actions are taken. As the bases for their requests concerning Thermo_Lag 330&hyph;1 Fire Barrier upgrades, Petitioners state that: (1) The licensee's records on the original installation of Thermo-Lag fire barriers on conduits and cable trays indicate that its contractor followed specifications for pre-buttering all joints; (2) NRC Inspection Report No. 50&hyph;455/93&hyph;42; 50&hyph;446/93&hyph;42 found, based on destructive analysis documents, that a concern did exist where Thermo-Lag conduit joints fell apart easily and did not appear to have any residual material of a buttered surface, indicative of a joint that had not been pre-buttered; (3) the ``dry joint'' deficiency appeared in Room 115A and other areas of the unit; (4) the licensee directly contradicts a NRC inspector's findings that were determined in part by destructive analysis; (5) the ``dry joint'' or absence of pre-buttering of Thermo-Lag panels can be determined only by destructive analysis and cannot be determined by a walk down visual inspection; (6) the findings reported in the Comanche Peak Unit 1 Region IV inspection report 50&hyph;445/93&hyph;42 and 50&hyph;446/93&hyph;42, based on the limited amount of destructive analysis conducted at the unit, constitutes a substantial documentation of installation deficiencies found in Thermo-Lag fire barriers as documented in NRC Information Notice 91&hyph;79 and IN 91&hyph;79 Supplement 1; (7) neither the NRC nor the industry, by its agent Nuclear Energy Institute, nor a utility, have conducted fire tests on dry fitted or ``dry joint'' upgraded configurations of Thermo-Lag 330&hyph;1; and (8) the presence of ``dry joint'' upgraded configurations in Comanche Peak Unit 1 constitutes an untested application of Thermo-Lag fire barriers. The Petition is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The Petition has been referred to the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this Petition within a reasonable time. By letter of November 7, 1994, the Director denied Petitioners' request for an immediate suspension of the operating license. A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the University of Texas at Arlington Library, Government Publications/Maps, 702 College, P.O. Box 19497, Arlington, Texas 76019. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 7th day of November 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. William T. Russell, Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28402 Filed 11&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
