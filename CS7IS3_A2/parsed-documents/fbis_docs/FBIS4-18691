The spokesman stressed that the Greek Government's positions on the issue of Skopje, which are known and firm, will be presented to UN mediator Cyrus Vance on 11 April in Washington by Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, director general of the Foreign Ministry. Venizelos said that the EU's [European Union] decision to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice undermines Vance's initiative and encourages Gligorov's intransigence, something that does not contribute to stability and security in the region. The government spokesman repeated that the EU Commission's decision violates the Union's solidarity and shows its contradictory character, because it cannot recognize the political character of Greece's countermeasures and pursue a diplomatic initiative with Dutch Commissioner Hans van den Broek on the one hand, and decide to follow the judicial route on the other. The positive aspect that the Greek Government has recognized in yesterday's decision, Venizelos concluded, is that the European Union calls on Skopje to change its flag and amend its constitution.
