The U.S. President called on the Algerian Government to hold, what he called, a dialogue with the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. The U.S. revealed in a press conference held in Paris yesterday that there were contacts between the U.S. Government and a number of FIS elements who are described as terrorists in Algeria. This is not the first time that such statements have been issued by U.S. officials on the internal situation in Algeria in an attempt to dictate specific policies to this Arab country.
