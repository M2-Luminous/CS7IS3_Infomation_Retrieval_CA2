Nazarov, manager of the Maritime Kray department of the Pension Fund, by I. Permyakova, UTRO ROSSII correspondent; place and date not given: "Why This Pension Fund Is Necessary"] [Text] A decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation on the establishment of the Pension Fund of Russia (PFR) was adopted on 27 December 1991, and a pertinent statute was developed. The obligation of the fund is "to ensure the collection of insurance premiums necessary to finance the payment of state pensions, while fully making good use of the rights granted to it for these purposes." But it was necessary for this to organize a state data bank by the end of 1992 on the payers of insurance premiums to the PFR....to initiate preparatory work on the organization of an individual account of mandatory insurance premiums coming in from working citizens, keeping in mind in the future to increase the size of state pensions owing to the resources they contribute. By no means all of our readers understand what the basic functions of the Pension Fund include and what specifically required its creation, and therefore I. Permyakova, our correspondent, turned for an explanation to P.M. Nazarov, the manager of the Maritime Kray department of the Pension Fund. "Our fund," explained Pavel Mikhaylovich, "is federal, and therefore, we transfer a considerable part of the collected resources to Moscow. But the gist of it is in the following. According to the law, each employer must participate in the establishment of the PFR, just as every employee must who is accepted for work. In addition, the employer pays 28 percent of his income monthly, and the worker, 1 percent. This is done somewhat differently in the civilized countries of the West: When a person assumes one or another position, an account is opened in his name in an appropriate insurance company to which a certain percentage of wages is transferred and frozen there until the worker goes on pension. In Finland, for example, a person does not have to go for his social security after he becomes a pensioner: They will come to his home and process everything. If he transfers from one enterprise to another, his personal account follows him, as before remaining inviolable. It is not this way in our country: Monetary inflation does not make it possible for us to operate in the European fashion; money is being devalued. Therefore, this kind of solution was found: Collect 28 percent from any organization and 1 percent from the person who works in it. It turns out that the one who is working now provides for the old age of the generation that has left for a rest.... And our main task is to finance the payment of pensions. [Permyakova] So that it turns out: It is not enough that you work for the people of Maritime Kray--you also finance Moscow? [Nazarov] I will explain: There are 88 territorial (regional) okrugs in Russia. There are such oblasts and krays (Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays and Tambov and Kursk Oblasts, and some others) that were always subsidized, but in the Far East there are very many people who work here (especially fishermen), but who are registered in the Western part of Russia. They will not be able to make use of the resources transferred from enterprises to the local Pension Fund, owing to which a specific surplus is established that we transfer to the center for their maintenance. Actually, in [line of text missing] more than 50 billion rubles [R]. [Permyakova] Well, nonetheless, was there a need to establish your fund? [Nazarov] Judge for yourself. Previously, resources for the payment of pensions were placed in the budget. But inasmuch as the social sphere was always financed according to the residual principle--the resources set aside for its needs were spent on all kinds of things!--there was practically no money left to fortify the welfare of the indigent strata of the population. In connection with the changes in the economy of the country, the idea came up about separating the pension fund from the budget, so that no one would be able to use it for unplanned purposes. [Permyakova] Did I understand correctly that owing to the collection of resources, the Pension Fund can increase the amount of payments to groups of the population that are poorly protected against inflation? [Nazarov] Correct. But, unfortunately, we are still collecting much less than we could. After all, many enterprises are on the brink of bankruptcy. Many large enterprises are our debtors: R8 billion for the fishermen, R5 billion for enterprises of the defense complex and R4 billion for the Ministry of Defense, and R3 billion for the nonferrous metals industry--for a total of R26 billion. Under an optimal variant, we receive up to R40 billion. Our task consists precisely of collecting, controlling, and using these resources. On the whole, we transfer up to R27 billion to social protection organs. We levy fines on enterprises that hide their indebtedness, and we direct the sums received for social protection [one or two lines missing] last year we gave R1.768 billion for these purposes. In addition, R1.325 billion went for rendering material assistance; for health improvement and convalescence of participants and invalids of the Great Patriotic War--R56 million; and for boarding school houses and shelters and for their reconstruction and the construction of new buildings of this designation--R121 million. The Red Cross and the organization of medical-social assistance to solitary people and people of old age at home received R10 million. One hundred million rubles were given directly to social security departments. [Permyakova] In light of the inflation, these figures could prove to be inadequate.... [Nazarov] This year we plan to transfer R6 billion for all such needs, and a billion was already given for the first quarter by 20 February. [Permyakova] It is no secret that many enterprises are really in catastrophic condition and are increasing the percentage of so-called hidden unemployment, when people are forcefully sent on leave without maintenance. How can they settle accounts with you? [Nazarov] We take all of this into consideration. If an enterprise is trying to be honest with us and with its own workers, we give an extension. But those who have enough money both for wages and construction, but who evade payment of the pension tax--we fine these harshly, and Moscow is requiring tough measures from us. In 1993, we exacted R3.869 billion from violators. At the same time, the government decided to forgive the indebtedness of those enterprises [line missing] that cannot pay their workers even the minimum wage.... [Permyakova] Pavel Mikhaylovich, the attention of our readers was attracted by a note in one of the city newspapers, "Do not take money from grandmothers." Some people understood this to mean that the Pension Fund does not support them.... Is it possible that the notorious Pension Fund also takes from old people? [Nazarov] In no way! A pension tax is not collected on any kind of stipends, benefits, and pensions! In this case, the question exactly concerns the concealment of one's incomes and corresponding indebtedness to the Pension Fund of a large number of enterprises, owing to which pensioners also do not receive what they have coming to them. But, by the way, the Pension Fund itself does not engage either in the payment of pensions, or in rendering social assistance to the indigent strata of the population. These things, as I have already mentioned, are handled by the social protection organs, but we finance them. For the payment of pensions in the kray, R137.5 billion were expended from PFR resources, and for social protection--R1.768 billion (while the note for some reason indicates a total of R120 million, which constituted allegedly 60 percent of what was planned). It should be known that only resources collected from violators are directed to the social protection of the aged. The work will be perfected, control will be improved on the part of our employees, the sums of fines will be increased, and, consequently, more resources will be directed to social protection [line missing] Pension Fund is established in order that its resources go only for the needs of the people of scanty means. This money is kept in banks; we do not see the cash, it can be used temporarily only by the bank, and last year we received R1.560 billion from banks for the use of our resources, and we paid various taxes of R510 million into the budget. [Permyakova] Pavel Mikhaylovich, one more, indelicate question, which an American would not answer. But life is life, and as long as the majority is infringed upon in its earnings, people cannot help but be interested in what the average wage of your workers is. [Nazarov] Well, it is a good and lawful question. First, I will note that we do not set the wages for ourselves; they are established by Moscow--by the federal organs of social administration. Yes, we have a decent wage. It is R275,000, and we hope that it will grow. We take into account years of service, and we add on bonuses. For what? Workers of the Pension Fund monitor 26,000 enterprises of various types [two lines missing] 8,551, and of these, violations of established payment procedures were disclosed in 7,516 (and this is 88 percent of the number that were checked!) and about R4 million was recovered! Each worker of our fund has to make 50 checkups--almost as much as there are weeks in a year. Numerous beginning commercial structures try especially hard to evade tax payments, and we find them through the banks and tax inspectorates. It happens that they tear up our acts there, threaten and taunt us, muddle up accounts, although all that they have to do is to calculate wages, transfer 28 percent from the monthly incomes of enterprises and 1 percent from each worker. But no, almost everyone is a violator. But after all, each of us will sooner or later move into the pensioner category.... [Permyakova] Have you, Pavel Mikhaylovich, been associated with the financial structure for a long time? [Nazarov] I am a financier to the marrow of my bones. I graduated from a financial institute more than 30 years ago. I worked in a bank for 13 years as chief [line missing] of the financial administration of the kray executive committee, and from 1991 I became the manager of the Pension Fund. I was born in Amur Oblast, and I have been living in Vladivostok since 1955.
