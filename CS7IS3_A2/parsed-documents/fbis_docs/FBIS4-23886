[passage omitted] The RPF has repeated its position that it opposes French intervention in Rwanda. Paul Kagame, the RPF military leader, said this earlier this morning when he spoke to Christophe Boisbouvier: [Begin Kagame recording, in English fading into French translation] We intend to oppose the French intervention in this conflict by all means available to us because of the role played in Rwanda by the French in the past. We believe that they want to intervene for reasons other than those they claim, and we believe that UN forces on the ground can fulfill the mission the French want to carry out. I think their presence here is going to have an escalating effect on the conflict; they are claiming that militias and government forces are murdering civilians, but they supported the so-called interim government responsible for all the massacres, so they are simply coming here to protect these people.
