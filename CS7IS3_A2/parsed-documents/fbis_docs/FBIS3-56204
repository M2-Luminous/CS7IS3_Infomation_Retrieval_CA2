There were two candidates, I'd like to remind you -- Yuriy Petrovich Vlasov and Ivan Petrovich Rybkin -- and the vote went the following way: for Vlasov -- 23 deputies for and 311 against; for Rybkin -- 223 for and 101 against. So Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, representing the Agrarian Party, is elected chairman of the State Duma with one vote over the minimum. He needed 222 votes and got 223, so he has been elected. But there is some discussion at the moment about one ballot being disputed, but it's difficult to say while this discussion is going on. So far, however, the news is that Rybkin, Ivan Petrovich, representative of the Agrarian Party, has been elected chairman of the State Duma. Thank you.
