This is stated in a confidential analysis compiled by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. The Cologne newspaper SONNTAGS-EXPRESS reports that according to the analysis there are "5,600 militant right-wingers among them." The German People's Union (DVU) with "some 26,000 members" is "the largest right-wing extremist organization." The report leaves open the politically very controversial question of whether the "Republicans" are an unconstitutional party. Staff of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution working at federal and state level were able to determine that the Republicans, whose declared membership of 23,000 is questioned, show "in fact indications of right-wing extremist tendencies." It is uncertain, however, whether these will intensify or whether the party will succeed in "pushing back the right-wing extremist tendencies in its ranks," the newspaper reports.
