The guarantees obtained here in Washington should help all this to be implemented effectively and as soon as possible. Two of the six agreements signed are, so to speak, of a general nature. One of those two agreements obligates the signatories to support the formation of the federation between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the other to support the development of economic and military cooperation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Republic of Croatia. There are also four separate documents: the preliminary agreement on the confederal relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the agreement granting the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation access to the sea via the territory of the Republic of Croatia, the agreement granting the Republic of Croatia free passage through the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and finally, the agreement on the constitution of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which will be sent to the Constitutional Assembly for discussion and adoption. After the signing ceremony, President Clinton had separate talks first with President Izetbegovic, and then with President Tudjman. The Republic of Croatia and the whole of the Croatian nation highly appreciate the role of the United States and President Clinton in reaching the agreement on creating the Croat-Bosniak Federation and the confederation between the future Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Republic of Croatia. This is said in a statement by President Tudjman following his talks with President Clinton. These agreements will be important for halting the war in the former Yugoslavia and the creation of conditions for permanent peace and stability of the new world order in this part of Europe. The United States' leading role -- moral, political, and in the security sphere -- is of paramount interest for uniting efforts for preserving peace on the part of the most important world factors -- the United Nations, the CSCE, the European Union, NATO, and individual states. The role of the pope and the Vatican are of paramount importance in the ecumenical efforts to restore peace and encourage cooperation between the nations and religious communities in different crisis areas. This is also said in a statement issued after President Tudjman's talks with President Clinton. President Tudjman also held talks with European Union Foreign Ministers Van der Broek, Claes, Kinkel, and Papoulias. A luncheon offered in honor of Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, and the Croatian and Muslim delegation by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is under way.
