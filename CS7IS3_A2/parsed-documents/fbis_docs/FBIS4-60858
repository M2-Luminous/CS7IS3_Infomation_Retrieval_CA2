They agreed on the usage of a radio-transmitting station located in the Gabala region of Azerbaijan. The discussions were over the status of the station and the number of hours of broadcasting. Discussions have been ongoing since 1993. Moscow's TURAN's correspondent was told by Russian military sources that during the talks Rasul Guliyev agreed to lease the station to the Russian Defense Ministry. The Russian Defense Minister said that in the near future Azerbaijan's and Russia's governments will ratify the document concerning the functioning of the Gabala radio-transmitting station. Sources from the Russian Defense Ministry report that the station will be assigned the status equivalent of a Russian military base on the territory of Azerbaijan. The Gabala station was built in the mid-1980's within the framework of the Soviet-version of S.D.I. (Strategic Defense Initiative). The station provides for the capability to establish a fixed launching of intercontinental ballistic missiles or any other objects in the southern sector of the globe. According to Russian military experts, the Gabala station is the most needed station in anti-aircraft programmes of the former Soviet Union, and now Russia. As was learned earlier, in the past, Russian Defense Minister Grachev announced his intention to station 5 military bases in the Caucasus, three in Georgia, one in Armenia and one in Azerbaijan.
