FR940922-0-00033 FR940922-0-00015 Occupied Conveyance (24 CFR Part 203) The occupied conveyance rule at 24 CFR 203.670 and 203.671 was amended to provide that HUD may accept occupied properties to avoid the payment of excessive eviction or relocation expenses required by a local government. A technical correction was also being made to §§203.675(b)(4) and 203.676 to conform with an earlier amendment to the rule published on September 16, 1991 (56 FR 46964) regarding the conveyance of properties occupied by persons who suffer a long-term or permanent illness. III. Public Comments The Department received 40 public comments during the 60-day comment period that ended on December 20, 1993. The comments were from governmental entities, private nonprofit organizations, and three members of Congress. The comments are discussed below. Numbers in parentheses following the comment refer to the number of commenters raising the issue. Comment: HUD should continue to give a priority to purchase (and lease, in the case of homeless providers) to nonprofits and government agencies, particularly grantees under HOPE for Homeownership of Single Family Homes (HOPE 3). (36) Response: The Department agrees that changes to its procedures for offering properties to governmental entities and nonprofit organizations are appropriate. The final rule has been changed to include governmental entities and nonprofit organizations in the definition of owner-occupant purchasers, thereby giving them a simultaneous opportunity to purchase properties eligible for FHA mortgage insurance during the competitive bidding period. If a nonprofit or government agency submits the highest net offer, without any discount being considered, and that offer is otherwise acceptable, it will be accepted and a discount of 10 percent (15 percent if five or more properties are purchased and closed simultaneously), regardless of the property's location, will be applied at closing. For properties not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, nonprofits and government agencies will have first opportunity to purchase at HUD's determination of fair market value. Offers accepted will reflect the appropriate discount. For properties offered without FHA mortgage insurance, the discount will be 30 percent in revitalization areas, and 10 percent in all other areas (or 15 percent, as appropriate). Comment: In establishing revitalization areas, the number of FHA foreclosures in process should be taken into consideration rather than the number of properties currently on hand. (7) Response: Due to the several uncertainties surrounding foreclosures (payoff by mortgagor, purchase by third parties, bankruptcy, redemption periods, the varying length of time in which foreclosure occurs, etc.), the Department believes that the use of foreclosures in process is not practical in establishing revitalization areas. The Department continues to believe it is appropriate to establish revitalization areas based on experience with its property disposition program and based on areas designated by localities for expanding affordable housing opportunities. Comment: The discount in revitalization areas should be greater. (4) Response: The available discount is based on anticipated savings to the Department, both in terms of selling on a direct basis and in selling properties more quickly that may otherwise require extended periods of marketing. The amount is supported by an evaluation performed on the Single Family Property Disposition Demonstration Program conducted by the Department on sales of properties in economically distressed areas. The Department believes that the current discount level is appropriate, but retains flexibility in making future determinations based on changing housing market conditions. Comment: There should be a requirement for owner-occupant buyers to repair to code. (3) Response: The Department believes that such a requirement, and its enforcement, properly rests with the local government. Comment: The program should be monitored and reports provided to the public. (3) Response: The Department does not believe there is an urgent need to devote already scarce resources to large scale monitoring of this unsubsidized program. To the extent the Department learns of falsification of the Sales Contract, or other abuses in the program, corrective measures will be taken at that time. In this regard, steps have been taken to determine the appropriateness of having the Department's computer system perform limited checking on owner-occupants purchasing more than one principal residence. Also, the Sales Contract now includes a warning to purchasers about the possible consequences of falsifying that document. The Department has recently authorized Field Offices to include resale restrictions on certain properties to prevent windfall profits and require that the properties be used for affordable housing goals. A provision has been added to the final rule at §291.110(a)(3) to authorize the Department to request information when considered appropriate on the disposition of properties sold to governmental entities and nonprofits. Consideration is also being given to other administrative procedures to prevent abuse from all categories of buyers. Comment: Minimum residency requirements for owner-occupant buyers should be established. (2) Response: The Department does not agree that such requirements should be established. Unnecessary hardships could be placed on owner-occupants in some cases where job relocations or other circumstances may necessitate moving. As discussed above, the Department has taken some measures already, and is considering others, to prevent possible abuses.
