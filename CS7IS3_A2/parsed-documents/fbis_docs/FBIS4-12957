Do you still have that feeling or has anything emerged from the accord document? [Muhammad] Of course. The forces and elements that carried out bombings and assassinations are still free and unbridled. They are still tampering with the safety of the citizens. Our elements are being killed in Ta'izz, Sanaa, and some northern governorates. [Al-Yamani] How do the Yemeni people regard the delay in implementing the document? [Muhammad] The people are greatly worried because of the military conditions and tension and because of the security problems that have not been solved yet. The economic life has been paralyzed. Work at development projects and elsewhere is at a standstill. Frankly, the conditions are unsatisfactory to all. [Al-Yamani] What are the causes of the armed confrontation? [Muhammad] The other side's intransigence and the influential forces that do not want any satisfactory solution for Yemen. This intransigence and this mentality has harmed Yemen, the Yemeni unity, and the supreme interests of the Yemeni people. [passage omitted] [Al-Yamani] It is rumored that the Jordanian-Omani role in pursuing efforts to implement the accord document has been abandoned now that other Arab sides have entered the arena. What do you say to that? [Muhammad] The role of these countries has not been abandoned but there is an intensive Arab presence and the Arab brothers are asked to continue this effort because Yemen is part of the Arab homeland and Yemen's problems are the problems of the Arab nation. Helping us is a pan-Arab responsibility and it is the duty of all the Arab brothers to extricate Yemen from this crisis which threatens its democratic, unionist march. [Al-Yamani] Will the resignation of the president solve the Yemeni crisis? [Muhammad] The question is not under discussion now. We have not proposed the resignation yet. No political group has proposed this because we are looking for common denominators now. These things could be discussed when such thing happens. [passage omitted]
