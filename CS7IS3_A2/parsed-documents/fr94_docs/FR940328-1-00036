FR940328-1-00036 FR940328-1-00017 48 CFR Part 45 [FAR Case 91&hyph;72] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Government Property AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to alert the contracting officer that facilities contracts should be closed out when Government production and research property is no longer required for the performance of the instant Government contract or subcontracts. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;72 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Klein at (202) 501&hyph;3775 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;72. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Language has been added at FAR 45.302&hyph;1(e) stating that facilities contracts should be closed out when Government production and research property is no longer required for the performance of the instant Government contract or subcontracts. This language is important for the control and management of Government property and allows for timely reutilization of facilities accountable to Government contracts. The language was removed from the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement at 48 CFR 245.302&hyph;1(S&hyph;70) as more appropriate for inclusion in the FAR. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because few, if any, facilities contracts are with small firms. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 91&hyph;72) in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 45 Government procurement. Dated: March 18, 1994. Albert A. Vicchiolla, Director, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy. Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 45 be amended as set forth below: PART 45_GOVERNMENT PROPERTY 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 45 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c). 2. Section 45.302&hyph;1 is amended by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: 45.302&hyph;1 Policy. * * * * * (e) Agencies shall close out facilities contracts when Government production and research property is no longer required for the performance of Government contracts or subcontracts, unless closeout is not in the best interest of the Government. The contractor is not allowed to extend the time for use of property provided under the facilities contract without Government authorization.
