Around 100 Moslem civilians had crossed to the east bank of the Drina River and were preparing to march on their homes within a UN- designated three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone when 15 armed Serb civilians appeared within the zone, Commander Eric Chaperon said. A UN peacekeeping patrol intervened rapidly and sent both groups back to their respective zones, Chaperon said. The incident "was settled peacefully, but the problem remains and so could happen again," he said. Gorazde, designated a "safe area," is home to thousands of refugees who were forced out of their homes and villages in the region in the early stages of the war in 1992. The exclusion zone is off limits to Serb military forces. A truce negotiated last week in Geneva came into effect at midday Friday and is generally holding, according to UN spokesmen. The planned four-week ceasefire was violated a number of times over the weekend. The latest incident was an attack Sunday by Bosnian Serbs on a British UN patrol comprising two armoured personnel carriers on a frontline near the northern town of Maglaj. There were no casualties in the incident in which 30 machinegun bullets hit one of the the vehicles. The British troops fired back with 80 rounds before withdrawing a short distance. General Michael Rose, chief of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said meanwhile that he was generally encouraged by the decrease in fighting, since "nothing stops immediately." He said he had visited some of the most sensitive frontline areas Sunday and found that things were "fairly quiet."
