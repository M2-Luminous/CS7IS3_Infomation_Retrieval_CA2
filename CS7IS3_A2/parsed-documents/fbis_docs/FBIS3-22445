After 15 months of intensive discussions, the 71 member countries of the World Environment Fund [WEF] (representing 86 percent of the world population) have reached an agreement on its budget, which will amount to $2 billion over three years, as compared with the $800 million for the preceding pilot phase, and on its operation, which will be made more democratic. These two decisions were essential for the commitments made during the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio to retain a minimum of credibility. [passage omitted] France has committed itself to contributing 800 million French francs [Fr], i.e., one-third of the U.S. contribution, and to another Fr400 million for bilateral initiatives which meet the WEF's regulations but which will be managed by the Central Fund for Cooperation. These initiatives especially seek to assist African projects, which for the time being are enjoying little WEF support. [passage omitted]
