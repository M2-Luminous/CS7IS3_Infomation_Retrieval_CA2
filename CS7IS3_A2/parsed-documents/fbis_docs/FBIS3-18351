It was the news that NATO's headquarters in Brussels was waiting for but feared that it might not hear. For Achille Occhetto, the first PDS secretary to be invited to NATO headquarters, who happened to be in Brussels on the very day when NATO carried out the first military operation in its history, it was like scoring a goal just as the final whistle is sounding. The first news -- about the four Serbian aircraft downed by the NATO fighters -- created an anxious atmosphere around his visit, distracting people and creating a mood of expectancy. There were some certainties -- that the Serbian aircraft were flying in the no-fly zone, that they were armed with air-to-surface missiles and bombs, and that the NATO pilots issued three warnings. And there was an uncertainty: What would the political cost of this "policing" operation be? The problem was that it was Moscow that would determine this political price. Speaking with journalists after his first round of meetings, Occhetto defined his position as follows: "As far as we know, the operation was carried out in implementation of the UN decisions and is therefore entirely legitimate. I am worried about the danger that this event could disrupt the equilibrium which, by means of military pressure and political action, it has been possible to establish in Bosnia, partly by involving Russia. I hope that Moscow will not change its position following today's events." Then when, a few minutes before 1800 hours [1700 GMT], Manfred Woerner entered room 8 at NATO headquarters to meet with the PDS delegation, the report from Moscow was enough to dispel the anxiety and to break the ice at the same time. Reassured by Moscow's attitude, the PDS secretary and the NATO secretary general were able to reassure each other with a sense of relief. "Mr. Woerner was pleased to receive confirmation from Mr. Occhetto personally that even with the PDS in government Italy's membership in NATO would not be called into question," one witness said after the meeting, "and Mr. Occhetto was happy to feel that he was being examined and not to perceive any signs of doubts about the possibility of a progressive government in Italy." Achille Occhetto's visit to NATO headquarters and his meetings with the organization's most senior officials had been postponed several times in recent weeks because of Woerner's health, and by chance happened to fall at the very start of the election campaign. Occhetto took advantage of this fact in order to issue a message of reassurance for both domestic and external consumption. In the morning the PDS delegation met with Ambassador Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO's deputy secretary general; then over breakfast with the permanent representatives of the organization's various member countries and a number of military officials including Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of NATO's chiefs of staff committee, and General Dangerfield, commander of the international military staff; and at last in the afternoon with Manfred Woerner. "I reaffirmed that our position includes NATO membership for Italy." Occhetto told journalists at the press conference following his meetings. "It does not make sense to say that Italy should leave it, but neither is it enough to say that we will remain within it. We are aware that there is a problem regarding the redefinition of NATO's role; moreover, this is not an issue that we raised but one on which is already being generally discussed. The end of the bipolar system has resolved the problems of European security, and NATO, which was organized to guarantee peace within a bipolar system, must now be equipped to deal with the new and different challenges that present themselves to peace." The PDS' position sees NATO maintaining relations of close cooperation with other international organizations, especially with the United Nations, whose supranational aspect must be accentuated, according to the PDS. "Over breakfast," Occhetto said, "we discussed the UN Security Council, whose structure stems directly from the outcome of World War II. Around the table we talked about granting membership to major regional areas in the future so as to eliminate the perception by poor countries that any operations decided on by the United Nations are in the interests of individual wealthy countries or groups of wealthy countries and to avert jealousies and misunderstandings among the wealthy countries. "We intend to impart a dynamic approach to NATO's role which takes into account the new post-communist situation. I was pleased to note that Mr. Woerner welcomed this stance on our part."
