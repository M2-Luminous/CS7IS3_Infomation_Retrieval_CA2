Rivalry Between Russia's Premier and Moscow's Mayor Grows More Acute"] [Text] The rivalry between the clans of Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yuriy Luzhkov, which has until recently proceeded "under the carpet," has now, as analysts predicted, come out into the open, with appeals to the president and the enlisting of the prosecutor's office, the press, and electronic media. The rivalry has been simmering for a long time. Yuriy Luzhkov and the Moscow government, unhappy over their share of revenues from the privatization of enterprises according to federal laws and over what they see as infringement of the Moscow administration's powers, have sharply attacked "Chubays-style" privatization. Furthermore, Yuriy Luzhkov has sought and obtained from Boris Yeltsin a special status for Moscow and its government. Federal government resolutions have virtually no effect on the territory of the capital, and it has been accorded substantial tax breaks. The nature of the Moscow mayor's influence on the president is evident: Boris Yeltsin's political and power support is based mainly in the capital, and the Kremlin, as is known, is also located in Moscow. Seeing such a strengthening of his rival's positions, the government chairman, unhappy with the special status of the Moscow "baron," as a warning to other regions supported Anatoliy Chubays in his duel with Yuriy Luzhkov. In response, several Moscow papers ran publications about Viktor Chernomyrdin's close associate, Oleg Soskovets, accusing the latter of corruption in privatizing the Novosibirsk tin plant and other metallurgical enterprises. Viktor Chernomyrdin, for his part, organized an inspection of Most-bank's performance, which began in early May. The prosecutor's office has already started examination of the letter by Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays alleging gross violations of privatization laws by the mayor and the Moscow city government. Yuriy Luzhkov took countermeasures. According to information in our possession, before the premier went on a two-week vacation, Luzhkov had a "no-holds-barred" conversation with him. It is not ruled out that prior to that he had enlisted the president's support. What matters here, however, are not privatization methods. Yuriy Luzhkov, just like all representatives of regional elites, is unhappy with at least two features of the "Chubays-style" privatization. First, as a result of enterprises and factories being sold off, they lose control of a substantial part of real estate located on their territory without getting anything in exchange. Second, privatization of large enterprises will lead to a change in the traditional methods of management and possibly provoke discontent among the population which has not yet become accustomed to its fate being decided by a private owner. The Kremlin seems to be watching with satisfaction the mutual weakening of these two powerful groupings and the discrediting of their leaders. In this situation, politicians conduct themselves differently. Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, as an experienced politician, calculating various options for a long term, has recently sought not to mar relations with the Yuriy Luzhkov group in order to retain his political positions in the event of Viktor Chernomyrdin's resignation. Yuriy Skokov, Russian Commodity Producers Federation chairman, who, according to many observers, is the main candidate for the post of premier -- if it is vacated -- retaining the reputation as a man unblemished in the process popularly stigmatized as "piratization" ["prikhvatizatsiya"], is trying to avoid any intriguing either against Viktor Chernomyrdin or Yuriy Luzhkov. It is not ruled out that the first results of the "battle of giants" will not be long in coming. According to a source in the Moscow mayoral entourage, we shall learn about some serious cadre reshuffles before Viktor Chernomyrdin returns from his vacation.
