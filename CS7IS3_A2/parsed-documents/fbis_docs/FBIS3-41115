All the suspects, except one, were arrested on arrival here, said the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in the statement. Eleven out of the arrested suspects came on board Brazilian Varig Air, seven on Ethiopian Airlines and one on Egypt Air, said the text. All the suspects who came in on the Brazilian airline and Egypt Air brought in cocaine while those arrested on Ethiopian Airlines were found with heroin, said the statement. According to the NDLEA, the arrests "have confirmed an earlier observation that (...) the Brazilian carrier, Varig Air is the worst culprit in terms of bringing drug traffickers and their wares into this country." The Ethiopian company was another airline "with a bad reputation in this country" for the frequency of arrests regularly made on the airline, said the text. Out of the entire seizure, cocaine accounted for 6.6 kg and heroin 6.28 kg. Last month, Africa's biggest drug haul was recorded in Nigeria when a suspected `drug baron' imported into the country 248.3 kg (546 pounds) of high grade heroin. The suspect, Joe Brown Akubueze, who bought the drugs in Thailand, is currently standing trial on charges of drug trafficking before a special tribunal in Lagos. The NDLEA was established in 1990 to fight drug trafficking in all its ramifications.
