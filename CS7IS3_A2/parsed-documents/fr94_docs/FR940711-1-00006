FR940711-1-00006 FR940711-1-00002 Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of §21.101, General Electric Aircraft Engines must show that the GE Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B turbofan engines met the requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those Federal Aviation Regulations are §21.21, as amended through Amendment 21&hyph;68, August 10, 1990, and part 33, as amended through Amendment 33&hyph;14, August 10, 1990. The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 33, as amended, do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the GE90 series turbofan engine because of its novel or unusual design feature. Therefore, the Administrator proposes these special conditions under the provisions of §21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with §11.49 of the FAR after public notice and opportunity for comment, as required by §11.28 and §11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with §21.101 paragraph (b) subparagraph (2). Conclusion This action affects only GE Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B turbofan engines. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these engines containing this novel or unusual design feature. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 33 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, safety. The authority citation for these special conditions continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421, 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 21.16, and 14 CFR 11.28. The Proposed Special Conditions Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the type certification basis for the General Electric Aircraft Engines GE90 series turbofan engines. (a) The following must be shown by tests and analyses, or other methods acceptable to the Administrator, that, in lieu of the fan blade containment test with the fan blade failing at the point specified in §33.94 paragraph (a) subparagraph (1), a fan blade containment test with the fan blade failing at the inner flowpart diameter demonstrates: (1) That the disk and fan blade retention system can withstand without failure a centrifugal load equal to two times the maximum load which the engine could experience within approved operating limitations, and (2) That by a procedure approved by the Administrator an operating limitation must be established which specifies the maximum allowable number of start-stop stress cycles for the fan blade retention system. The fan blade retention system includes the portion of the fan blade from the inner flowpath diameter inward to the blade dovetail, the blade retention components, and the fan disk and fan blade attachment features. (b) It must be shown that the probability of fan blade retention system failure, for any cause, during the service life of the engine to be extremely improbable. (c) It must be shown by test or analysis that a lightning strike on the composite fan blade structure will not result in a hazardous condition, and that the engine will meet the requirements of §33.75. (d) The tests and analyses required by (a)(1) and (a)(2) of these special conditions must account for the effects of in-service deterioration, manufacturing and materials variations, and environmental effects.
