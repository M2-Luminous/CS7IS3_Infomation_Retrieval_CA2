The latest reports from the NKR confirm that Azerbaijan is not interested in the effort to resolve the confrontation through peaceful talks. Several observers are convinced that Azerbaijan's leaders have used the relatively peaceful situation to prepare for new and large-scale attacks. The NKR Defense Headquarters has revealed that Azerbaijan's military command is massing large units and armored vehicles in areas near the front line to reinforce its positions. Not satisfied with that, Azerbaijan's military forces have continued to systematically fire on NKR positions with various kinds of arms and to launch attacks to establish whether the Armenians have strengthened their defense lines. But they have been confronted with counterattacks and forced to retreat after suffering many casualties and losing military equipment. Azerbaijan's military forces in Fizulinskiy Rayon attacked the NKR defense positions in the east of the rayon center at 0745 yesterday. A wave of rocket and artillery fire preceded the attack. The advancing units were supported by 10 tanks and three infantry combat vehicles. There were casualties on both sides. The NKR defense forces obstructed the onslaught but also counterattacked in the afternoon. The defense forces succeeded in occupying four heights near Alkhanly in Fizulinskiy Rayon at about 1630. The fighting is continuing in that area. Azerbaijan has used its Air Force units again. The NKR Defense Army Information Service has reported that the Armenian freedom fighters recaptured two important heights in the Omar Pass last night. The heights were occupied by the enemy forces several days ago. The Armenian fighters have placed the Omar Pass under their control. No change has occurred elsewhere on the NKR's front line. The confrontation is mainly in the form of positional fighting. The Artsakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] people are trying to silence Azerbaijan's positions, which are firing on them with various types of arms. The Armenian Defense Ministry Information Service has revealed that the relatively peaceful situation on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been disrupted. One of Azerbaijan's T-72 tanks has fired on the defense positions in Tavushskiy Rayon. The Armenian border guards launched retaliatory operations. No other incident occurred anywhere else in the border area last night or this morning. But the situation is tense.
