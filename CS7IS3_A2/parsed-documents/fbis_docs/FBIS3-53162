He discussed with them a number of national issues and concerns related to democratic practices, and stressed the principle of political pluralism and respect for others' opinions. During this meeting, the brother chairman spoke about our country's current political crisis and the efforts being made to find national solutions for the crisis to maintain the homeland's unity and the people's cohesion. He hoped that this meeting will be a new start for responsible and serious political action by members of the General People's Congress [GPC] and other national political forces to close ranks and confront the forces that tirelessly try to undermine the people's gains and the homeland's unity. He said that responsible political action requires everyone to work amid the masses, adopt their concerns, contribute toward tackling their issues, and embody their aspirations for the building of the modern Yemeni state, the state of law and order. He said that everyone should work to serve the country's well-being and progress, rather than to be involved in one-upmanship and cheap gains at the expense of values, principles, and national objectives and constants. The brother chairman noted the importance of intensifying political activity and democratic practices and confronting the hostile propaganda which is aimed at breaking the social cohesion and undermining the homeland's unity. He said that unity is a great achievement for the sake of which our people have offered the dearest sacrifices. He said: We should move faster to bolster the march that we have started since the establishment of the GPC. This march is full of major achievements on all development and national levels, culminating in the great unity. Addressing attendees, the brother chairman said: We should counter the biased propaganda with objective facts and tangible achievements. You should discuss frankly and objectively all aspects of corruption and counter laxity, carelessness, and all backward practices that harm the homeland's march and progress.
