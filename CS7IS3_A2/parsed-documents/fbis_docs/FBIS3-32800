[passage omitted] Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus stressed that "without a doubt the summit will be of great importance for the future of America, but unfortunately the OAS, which is the appropriate international organization to hold such a summit, has not been taken into consideration." Niehaus held a news conference during which he added that "we consider this initiative to be very important and welcome it without reservation, but it would be important if the meeting were organized and had the logistical support of the OAS in a parallel manner and with the will of all countries that form that organization."
