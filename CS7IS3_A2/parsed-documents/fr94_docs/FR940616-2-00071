FR940616-2-00071 FR940616-2-00053 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Announcement 485] Improving Performance in Physicians' Office Laboratories Introduction The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for a cooperative agreement to improve the quality of laboratory testing in physicians' office laboratories (POLs). The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Clinical Preventive Services. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section `` Where to Obtain Additional Information .'') Authority This program is authorized under section 317(k)(2)(D) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(2)(D)], as amended. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicants Eligible applicants are limited to non-profit professional clinical or laboratory organizations whose focus is to improve the quality of laboratory testing in POLs. Applicants must be able to demonstrate that: 1. They are laboratory medicine oriented; 2. A goal of their organization is to improve the quality of laboratory testing in POLs; 3. They have a long-standing interest in improving the performance of laboratory testing; and 4. They have a strong, specific interest in providing professional information to private practitioners with laboratories, thereby striving to improve the quality of laboratory testing in POLs. Availability of Funds Approximately $100,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund one cooperative agreement. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to three years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period may be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. Purpose The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to develop and provide professional and technical information and education to private practitioners with POLs, thereby helping improve the quality of laboratory testing available to the American public. Program Requirements In conducting the activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the recipient will be responsible for those activities listed under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for those activities under B. (CDC Activities). A. Recipient Activities 1. Nationally, provide to POL physicians training that has been designed to improve laboratory performance. In the first budget year develop training modules related to the standards as set forth in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), designed to train POL staff. 2. Develop and implement mechanisms for communicating information directly to POLs relating to CLIA. These communications will provide accurate, concise, and rapid information that will give physicians access to new and/or revised CLIA regulatory provisions. In the first budget year, using the laboratory test categorization computerized database established by CDC, develop an interactive software program which is user friendly and can be queried by physicians for specific tests. B. CDC Activities 1. Provide scientific and technical expertise related to distance-based training and provide technical assistance in the development of training modules and courses related to the CLIA standards. 2. Collaborate in the development of mechanisms to communicate current and updated information relating to CLIA to POLs. 3. Provide scientific and technical assistance relating to the test categorization database and laboratory standards, and collaborate in the development of more user friendly and interactive databases for use by POLs. Evaluation Criteria The application will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria: 1. Responsiveness to the objectives of the cooperative agreement including: (a) Applicant's understanding of the objectives of the proposed cooperative agreement; and (b) the relevance of the proposal to the stated objectives. (25 points) 2. Ability to provide staff, knowledge, and other resources required to perform the applicant's responsibilities in this project. The qualifications and time allocations of key personnel to be assigned to this project and the facilities, equipment, and other resources available for performance of this project. (25 points) 3. Methods to be used in carrying out the responsibilities of this project. Steps to be taken in planning and implementation of this project. (20 points) 4. Schedule for accomplishing the activities to be carried out in this project and methods for evaluating the accomplishments. (20 points) 5. Percentage of the U.S. POL community that can be reached by the applicant organization. (10 points) 6.
