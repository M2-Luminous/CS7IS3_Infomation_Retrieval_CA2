ACTION: Notice of Record of Decision (ROD) on Non-Federal Participation Capacity Ownership Contracts and Section 9(c) Policy.

Capacity Ownership allows non-Federal utilities to purchase up to 725 megawatts (MW) of contract rights of use BPA's share of alternating current (AC) Intertie capacity, which was increased upon completion of the Third AC Intertie transmission project. The Capacity Ownership contracts establish the terms and conditions for use of the non-Federal parties' share of the Pacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest AC Intertie. The Non-Federal Participation, Northwest Power Act, Section 9(c) Policy (Non-Federal Participation Section 9(c) Policy) establishes the guidelines for BPA determinations of whether the export of a regional resources will result in an increase in the electric requirements of any of BPA's customers in the Pacific Northwest, and whether the resource could be conserved or otherwise retained in the Pacific Northwest for service to load in the Pacific Northwest. The guidelines will pertain to Non-Federal Participation determinations related to initial exports by non-Federal parties of up to 725 MW of regional resources over their Capacity Ownership share; and subsequent related determinations whenever Pacific Northwest resources are exported whether by such non-Federal parties or by third parties over a New Owner's Capacity Ownership share.
