The disturbances took place in the plaza, where police chased and beat demonstrators, including an elderly lady who fell on her back. As a consequence, four university students were arrested in the Casino de las Nubes, where they had sought refuge. The Human Rights Commission was able to get the arrested students taken to the Medical Culture House and not to a police precinct. This is yet another chapter of the very long struggle by the provincial teachers to obtain payment of money they are owed within the framework of a conflictive situation. Some 2,000 provincial teachers participated in today's demonstration. They marched along demanding salary improvements. Teachers from the provinces of Buenos Aires, Formosa, Cordoba, and Santa Fe participated in today's demonstration to show solidarity with their Salta colleagues.
