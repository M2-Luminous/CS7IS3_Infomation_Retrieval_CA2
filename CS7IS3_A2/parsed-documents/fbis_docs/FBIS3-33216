According to a UN spokesman, Butrus-Ghali informed a visiting FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] delegation yesterday in New York that he has already sent a letter to this effect to Cristiani in which he also urges the president to continue exercising his personal authority until his mandate ends with a view to fulfilling all pending points of the peace agreement. The FMLN delegation visiting the United Nations, formed by Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador Samayoa, and Rafael Moreno, expressed concern over the delays and the failure to fulfill certain agreements concerning the formation of the National Civilian Police, the dismantlement of the former police force, the return to society of former combatants, and the transfer of lands. The FMLN delegates also asked Butrus-Ghali to enforce the mandate of the UN Observers for El Salvador mission and reiterated their concern over delays in the issuance of electoral identification cards in areas of the country where the FMLN has its electoral base.
