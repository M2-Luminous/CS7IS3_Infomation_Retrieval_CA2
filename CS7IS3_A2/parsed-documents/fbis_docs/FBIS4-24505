FBIS4-24505 "drchi104_v_94018" FBIS-CHI-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 TAIWAN French Technology Exhibition Set for Taipei French Technology Exhibition Set for Taipei OW2805141694 Taipei CNA in English 1342 GMT 28 May 94 OW2805141694 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Danielle Yang] [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- A French technology exhibition will open at Taipei's World Trade Center on July 1, with more than 100 French manufacturers participating. On display will be high-tech products from the aerospace, transportation, energy, telecommunications, electronics, measuring and control equipment, environmental technology, construction, medical, and petrochemical industries. The four-day exhibition will be jointly sponsored by the French Institute in Taipei (FIT) and the French Committee for Trade Events Abroad (CFME). The show is the centerpiece of a series of "French Month" activities, which begin June 20. Noted French high-tech companies such as Dassault, [passage indistinct] the Mirage-2000 jet fighter; high-speed railway manufacturer GEC Alsthom; Nuclear Energy Company Cogema, and Fram Atome will display their latest products at the show, which is France's biggest exhibition in Asia in the past 15 years. CFME President Paul Hunsinoer said the French technology exhibition will introduce French expertise and developmental experiences in high technology to Taiwan firms, hopefully leading to bilateral cooperation. FIT Director Jean Paul Reau said the French Government unveiled a forward-looking plan in February to promote a new strategy toward Asia aiming to increase its export ratio in the Asian market from the current 7 percent to more than 10 percent of its total exports within five years. He said Taiwan was at the forefront of the plan. Reau said that because France specializes in some high-tech industries which are being developed here, it can fully supply and transfer its high-technologies to Taiwan. Taiwan is situated at the hub of Asia and is an admirable economic and trade power, Reau said. He added that there is no barrier for technology transfer to the island. Some 130 French enterprises have set up footholds in Taiwan, Reau said. He added that the French technology exhibition will allow the people of Taiwan to see a totally different view of France besides the traditionally romantic one. The second French technology exhibition is scheduled to be held in Kuala Lumpur in October this year.
