The president of Crimea is being accompanied on his trip by a very small group of his closest aides and advisers. The program for his visit includes meetings and talks with deputies in Russia's State Duma and with individual members of the Russian Government. The president of Crimea's visit to Moscow is not an official one: In the words of one of Yuriy Meshkov's closest aides, this is not really a visit, rather a trip to Moscow by the president of Crimea to build bridges toward economic cooperation between Russia and Crimea. How long Yuriy Meshkov spends in Moscow will be determined by how the talks and meetings with Russia's leaders go.
