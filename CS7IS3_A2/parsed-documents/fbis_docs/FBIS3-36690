It states, in particular: "...In the space of two years the volume of agricultural production in Russia has fallen to 65-70 percent of the average annual level during 1986-1990. Seed production and pedigree livestock breeding have been destroyed. In terms of the numbers of cattle, hogs, and sheep the Russian Federation has been `thrust back' to the level of the sixties and seventies." "...Owing to the inadequate growth in the prices of industrial and agricultural output, practically all farms have ended up insolvent. The implementation of all types of work connected with preparing for spring sowing has now been totally halted because of the financial crisis." The Federation Council deputies ask the country's leadership to "examine without delay an entire package of questions to ensure the equivalent exchange of agricultural and industrial output and a radical change in tax, credit, and investment policy with regard to the agricultural sector." "It is extremely necessary for real state assistance to be given to the agro-industrial complex in the form of credit and material-technical resources before the start of the spring field work and with due regard for the seasonal nature of this work," the appeal states.
