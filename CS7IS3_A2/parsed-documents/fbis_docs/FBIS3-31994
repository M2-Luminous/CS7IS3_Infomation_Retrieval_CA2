"Everything is a conspiracy, a preconceived plan to disrupt the peace. The idea is to mar the inauguration of the new government and the functioning of the Congress," Delgado told newsmen. He added that classes will be suspended in those schools where disturbances take place. The protests and turmoil in Caracas and major cities in the interior of the country have gone beyond student skirmishes. On Saturday, 18 January, over 100 persons were arrested in Barcelona (in the west) for setting fire and looting food trucks. The unrest extended the next day to neighboring Puerto La Cruz, Valencia (in the center), and Punto Fijo (in the northeast). This week there were transportation strikes in several cities but the disturbances were concentrated in schools in the metropolitan areas of Caracas. A 17-year-old student was killed in the bedroom community of Los Teques in the midst of a skirmish between students and police.
