However, the Russian command refuses to meet the demand, a senior spokesman for the Ukrainian naval command told INTERFAX-Ukraine. He described as provocative another refusal by the naval command to inform the Ukrainian defense ministry of the warships putting to sea. INTERFAX earlier reported that on 17 March, 25 warships, two submarines and five auxiliary ships put to sea for training purposes. The spokesman said that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry will force the command to comply with Ukrainian laws. Sources close to the Ukrainian naval staff have told INTERFAX-Ukraine that on 17 March one Ukrainian warship set out to sea. Commenting on the statement by the Ukrainian Navy senior spokesman, Andrey Grachev, the acting chief of the Fleet's press center, said that "it is not command actions but such statements that are provocative." Firstly, in line with Ukrainian and Crimean laws on troop movement "we must warn the Crimean parliament and its speaker and this we did." Secondly, the Fleet commander, Admiral Baltin, in a telegram to Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, warned him back in February that ships were planned to put to sea in March 1994, and this was done too, said Grachev. Speaking about one of the four ships of the Ukrainain Navy putting to sea, Andrey Grachev voiced the hope that it would return safely to the base.
