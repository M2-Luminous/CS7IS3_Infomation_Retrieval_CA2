Addressing more than 500 people in Diber who are members and sympathizers of this party, Arber Xhaferri stressed that the former leadership of the party, together with deputies and ministers, has done almost nothing to realize the goals defined in the party program. The influence of Albanians in the state structures in Macedonia, as well as in the political, economic, security, education, and so forth, power structures, does not exist at all. As an example of this, the PDP chairman mentioned the grave situation that exists in the educational field, stressing that whereas in 1980 there were nine gymnasiums in Macedonia and 30 professional high schools, in 1992 these figures were reduced to five, thus marking a continuous decrease. We are now in a phase of reorganizing the party and our ranks, Arber Xhaferri said later, stressing that now is the time we ask the support of Albanian intellectuals,political parties, and institutions to fulfill our demands. He stressed that Albanians in Macedonia should never cease to be state-forming elements and have their own special institutions.
