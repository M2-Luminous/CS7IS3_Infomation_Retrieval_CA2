Frei said it is important to implement educational systems that meet the needs of democracy. He said Chile is promoting an educational reform program and urged Ibero-American countries to jointly progress in this area. He urged them to make a serious and collective effort to promote scientific and technological development through the establishment of a scientific and technological development fund. The Chilean president also proposed the promotion and advancement of free trade without restrictive mechanisms. Frei told the 22 chiefs of state attending the meeting that within the framework of international trade and the opening of world markets, extra effort must be made to avoid protectionist measures or those that undermine competition among countries. Frei formally invited those present to the Sixth Ibero-American Summit, scheduled for 1996, in Chile. The Cartagena summit studied regional policies on trade, social development and integration. Colombian President Cesar Gaviria officially opened the meeting yesterday. He said the Americas are creating a new international order based on interdependence. The participants expressed support for the Chilean doctrine of "open regionalism," as reasserted by President Frei in his speech. After discussing it, the participants included this doctrine in the final document of the summit which ends today. The opening ceremony was marked by the Colombian tragedy one week ago when an earthquake and a landslide killed, according to official figures, over 1,000 people; and Fidel Castro's aggressive speech against the United States. President Frei addressed the summit at 1810 Chilean time. He was the 15th chief of state to address the summit and he did so several hours behind schedule. At about 0800 (0900 Chilean time), President Frei and his wife, Marta Larraechia, entered the Convention Center hall of flags, where the summit was held. He was greeted by President Gaviria. After the opening ceremony, in which the Brazilian and Colombian presidents delivered speeches, the first session got under way. Frei was seated next to Fidel Castro. Eduardo Frei said that although Chile has many options of joining integration organizations at the international level, it clearly upholds a Latin American integrationist tradition. He said that in the next few years, Chile will implement a regional policy of economic and physical integration and cooperation at the educational, cultural, scientific, and technological levels. He reasserted the criteria of adopting "open regionalism" on the basis of realistic, specific trade without exclusions." He said: "In the economy, as in politics, exclusions are both unfair and dangerous." Frei urged the Americas to improve their competitive level in the international market as a means to achieve an open economy. Regarding competitiveness at the international level and its improvement, Frei said governments should "abstain from using mechanisms--be they financial, tax, economic, or of any other nature--to undermine competitiveness." He said such measures distort comparative advantages and undermine the sale of more competitive Ibero-American products. Frei criticized the use of policy mechanisms, like health, fiscal or environmental measures, to implement protectionist measures. The Chilean president stressed the need to achieve national economic development on the basis of equity. He said: "The social dimension of development cannot and should not be overlooked." He said political and economic achievements only make sense if they are accompanied by a substantial improvement of the standard of living for their people. Frei stated: "Social development is the basis for democracy." He said the main objective of his administration is to eradicate extreme poverty, adding that a culture of solidarity is being promoted to this effect. He said this issue will be discussed at the Social Development Summit to be held next year in Copenhagen. He urged the chiefs of state to redouble their efforts so that Latin America may be duly represented at this meeting. Eduardo Frei included in the summit's agenda a previously unmentioned issue: It involves giving women a bigger role, not just because they represent more than half the population in the region but because they are most affected by economic conditions. Frei proposed institutionalizing a meeting of the ministers of women's affairs, or of those responsible for women's policies, to be held prior to the UN Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. He proposed Chile as the site of this first meeting. He also officially proposed that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit be held in Chile, as the foreign ministers approved on 13 June.
