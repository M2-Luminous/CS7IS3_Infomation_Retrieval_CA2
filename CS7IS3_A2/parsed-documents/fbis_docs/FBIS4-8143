The milk was found to contain radioactive cesium-137, and the degree of radioactive contamination was found to be 30 becquerels per liter. The results of measurements taken on two successive days -- 23 and 24 March -- were the same. On 30 March, the instruments established the presence of cesium in the milk with a radioactivity of 60 becquerels per liter. The source of the contamination proved to be silage pit that had been sealed off some time ago. A lack of food for the animals obliged the dairy farm workers to resort to the feed buried in the pit. On 1 April, measurements taken showed that the fodder had a radioactivity of 800 becquerels per kilogram. [passage omitted] On 4 April 1994, a commission comprised of representatives from the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, and other authorities with an interest in the problem decided on measures to render the area safe. The specialists assert that no one has consumed the contaminated milk and that it did not enter the commercial market. [passage omitted]
