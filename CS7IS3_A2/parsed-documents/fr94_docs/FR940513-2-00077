FR940513-2-00077 FR940513-2-00039 •A major public relations/publicity campaign should be conducted designed to reach the maximum number of older people and their caregivers informing them about the availability of the Locator. With the increasing number of Baby Boomers being put in the position of having to care for or find care for their aging parents, it is necessary to educate this group not only where to go to find services but what kind of services they should be looking for. One of the results of the evaluation that was conducted after the first six months of operation of the Locator indicated that use of the Locator by minority populations was limited. Special emphasis should be directed toward outreach to minority populations and increasing use of the Locator by these groups. •In its public relations and outreach activities, the grantee should encourage participation and support by private and voluntary organizations. •The Locator should consider the possibility of creating a linkage with the Department of Defense and its military family support centers. Frequently, military family support centers get inquiries from members of the military about their aging relatives and where to go to get services for them. This would be a logical area in which the grantee could promote the use of the Locator. •With the advent of elder rights systems being formalized as a result of the implementation of Title VII of the Older Americans Act, the Locator should examine the possible role of Information and Referral services as a gateway to elder rights systems. As these systems develop, the Locator and the I&R Support Center should examine the potential of structuring relationships between these services. Since the Locator depends on the maintenance of quality information and referral services at the state and local level, attention must continue to be focused on upgrading these services through training and technical assistance for state and local Information and Referral service programs. AoA proposes to continue and expand the National Information and Referral Support Center. The Support Center should provide training and technical assistance, capacity building, long range development, assistance in system upgrade, implementation of standards for I&R services, and other services related to the maintenance of high quality service among state and local information and referral services. In addition, the Support Center should, in an advisory capacity, support the operation of the Locator and help coordinate the Locator with State Aging Agency and local information and referral networks. The current Eldercare Locator project has been in operation since the summer of 1990 under the auspices of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. The National Information and Referral Support Center has been operated since the summer of 1990 by the National Association of State Units on Aging. Information regarding the Locator and the Information and Referral Support Center is available by calling the Office of Program Development, Administration on Aging at (202) 619&hyph;0441. AoA expects to fund one cooperative agreement under this priority area with a federal share of approximately $750,000 per year for a project duration of approximately three years. The deadline date for submitting applications under this priority is July 12, 1994. Eligibility is limited to public and private non-profit national organizations with experience in conducting national hotlines and dealing with the network of State and Area Agencies on Aging and State and Area Information and Referral Services. Coalitions of organizations are encouraged. (2) Older Women 2.1␣National Policy and Resource Center on Older Women Because of their longevity and lengthier retirement periods, the health, economic and social problems of the elderly are more often problems of women. As described earlier in this document under the Assistant Secretary's Initiative on Older Women, older women are clearly a population at risk. It is imperative that policy makers at all levels, aging organizations, other national organizations, and service providers begin to recognize and respond to the unique needs and concerns of older women. Under this priority area, the Administration on Aging is soliciting proposals for the establishment of a National Policy and Resource Center for Older Women. The Center is expected to assist the Administration on Aging in focusing national attention on the contributions and problems of older women, with particular emphasis on the issues of income security, caregiving, health, and housing.
