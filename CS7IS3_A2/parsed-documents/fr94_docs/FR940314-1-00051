FR940314-1-00051 FR940314-1-00012 3. Eligibility for the Small Business Exemption In proposed §§101.9 (j)(18)(i) and (j)(18)(ii) and in 101.36 (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii), FDA is incorporating into its regulations the statutory limits on the number of units sold that would qualify a food product as a low-volume food product eligible for exemption from the nutrition labeling requirements established by section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act. Proposed §§101.9 (j)(18)(i) and (j)(18)(ii) and 101.36 (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) also reflect the statutory limits on a firm's average number of full-time equivalent employees that would qualify it as a small business whose products are eligible for an exemption. The act provides for phased-in coverage of foods that were first introduced into interstate commerce before May 8, 1994. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(I) of the act, a food product is eligible for exemption from the nutrition labeling requirements from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, if fewer than 600,000 units of that product were sold in the United States between May 8, 1993, and May 7, 1994, and the person claiming the exemption for that product employed fewer than an average of 300 full-time equivalent employees during that time. The agency recognizes that there are some products that will have come onto the market before May 8, 1994, for which there will not be a full year of sales on which to determine whether they qualify for an exemption as a low-volume food. The agency is proposing that a food for which there is not 12 months of sales before May 8, 1994, will qualify as a low-volume food eligible for an exemption if the sales of the food during the period in which the exemption will apply, May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, are reasonably anticipated to be less than 600,000 units. This treatment of products sold before May 8, 1994, but without a full year of sales history before that date, is consistent with that of products not sold in the 12-month period before an exemption is claimed under section 403(q)(5)(E)(i)(IV) of the act. The agency is proposing to provide for this exemption in §101.9(j)(18)(i)(A). The agency notes that this proposed provision is not applicable to dietary supplements of herbs and other similar nutritional substances, and that FDA is not proposing to include a parallel provision in §101.36(f) for dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, because the mandatory labeling requirements do not become effective for dietary supplements until July 1, 1995. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(II) of the act, the exemption for a food first introduced into interstate commerce before May 8, 1994, narrows in the second year that section 403(q) of the act is applicable. Such a food will continue to be eligible for exemption from nutrition labeling between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996, only if there were fewer than 400,000 units of that product sold in the United States between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, and if the firm that claims an exemption for the product employed an average of fewer than 300 full-time equivalent employees during that period. The agency is proposing to reflect this provision in §§101.9(j)(18)(i)(B) and 101.36(f)(2)(i)(A) of its regulations. The exemption narrows even further in the third year. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(III) of the act, a food introduced into interstate commerce before May 8, 1994, is eligible for exemption from the requirements for nutrition labeling between May 8, 1996, and May 7, 1997, if there were fewer than 200,000 units of that food product sold in the United States, and if the firm that claims an exemption for such product employed an average of less than 200 full-time equivalent employees, between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996. The agency is proposing to reflect this provision in §§101.9(j)(18)(i)(C) and 101.36(f)(2)(i)(B) of its regulations. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(i) of the act, all other food products are eligible for exemption from the requirements for nutrition labeling in section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act for any 12-month period if there were fewer than 100,000 units of that food product sold in the United States during the preceding 12 months by the firm claiming the exemption, and if that firm employed an average of less than 100 full-time equivalent employees during that preceding 12-month period. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(i) of the act, newly marketed food is eligible for exemption if fewer than 100,000 units of that food product are reasonably anticipated to be sold, and if the firm claiming the exemption employs an average of less than 100 full-time equivalent employees, during the 12-month period for which the exemption is claimed. The agency is proposing to reflect these provisions in §§101.9(j)(18)(ii) and 101.36(f)(2)(ii) of its regulations. If adopted, the proposed regulations will operate in the following way: A person with an average of 250 full-time equivalent employees between May 8, 1993, and May 8, 1994, may file a notice with FDA claiming an exemption from the requirements of §101.9 for the period from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, for each of its products whose sales were less than 600,000 units during the period from May 8, 1993, to May 7, 1994. The filing of the notice will serve to establish the exemption for the food product (assuming no nutrition information or health or nutrient content claims are provided in the labeling of the product). If a product were not offered for sale for the entire year preceding May 8, 1994, the firm could claim a small business exemption for that food product if the number of units of that product sold in the United States during the time period from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, is reasonably anticipated to be fewer than 600,000 units.
