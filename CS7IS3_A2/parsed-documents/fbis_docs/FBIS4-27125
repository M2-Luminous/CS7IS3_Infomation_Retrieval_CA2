Security Council. They are deliberately building up at home and abroad the public opinion that Japan is possessed of all qualifications for the permanent membership and, therefore, should naturally become a permanent member. At the same time, they are feverishly lobbying to gain support from many countries. NODONG SINMUN today brands this as an expression of the arrogance of revived militarism and a mockery of the international community. The news analyst says: Japan intends to become a political power and military power and justify its military action overseas by gaining the seat of a permanent member. What is more serious is that Japan seeks to get the international community to recognise its nuclear armament. Japan, having made all material and technical preparations for becoming a nuclear power, plans to overcome the opposition of public opinion to and legal restrictions on nuclear armament by securing permanent membership. To become a permanent member is a spring-board for the Japanese ruling quarters. As seen above, the Japanese authorities' zealous effort to become a permanent member is chiefly aimed at becoming a military power and nuclear power, participating in the scrambles for world domination and opening a favorable phase for realising their dominationist ambition with strength. To allow Japan which has not parted with its militarist past to become a permanent member means to encourage it to repeat the crimes of the blood-stained past. Japan is not qualified to become a permanent member so long as it fails to sincerely repent of its past aggression and atone for it clearly. Japan must liquidate the past before it tries to become a permanent member.
