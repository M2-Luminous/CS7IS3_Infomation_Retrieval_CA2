The document supports the integration processes "in the context of open regionalism" and rejects the restrictive free trade practices implemented by several governments to the detriment of the people. The summit conclusions are recorded in a two-part document: a first section entitled "Commerce and Integration as Elements in Ibero-American Development" and a second part that includes evaluations and proposals. The text mentions that the reactivation of international commerce is basic to accessing equitable economic and social development and, for this reason, it condemns all policies for further protectionism or measures that limit freedom in international commerce. The "Recommendations" chapter calls for "the elimination of restrictive commercial practices" as well as "the abusive and distorted use of commercial protection measures and tariff barriers" that limit free commerce. It is necessary to eliminate "unilateral coercive commercial and economic measures which hinder the possibility of freely developing international commerce and which damage the living conditions of the Ibero-American people," it adds. This recommendation has been interpreted as a "clear censure of the blockade the United States has imposed on Cuba for the past 34 years" and which has been maintained after the end of the Cold War, diplomatic sources have asserted. The conclusions manifest the need to support "the gradual convergence and complementariness of the different integration projects" to overcome differences and to take advantage of the potentials afforded by the economic opening. The document also urges the defense of the environment "as an essential factor to the well-being of the population" and also calls on avoiding the use of ecological measures to further protectionism. The fourth summit supports the "promotion of environmental policies as factors that will further the development of international commerce" as it will allow access to appropriate technologies and the flow of fresh financial resources to increase job opportunities. The document proposes that the role of the state be redefined to enable governments to concentrate efforts on strategic areas for the benefit of the population. The document considers that the macroeconomic advances must be used to provide the resources for health, justice, education, infrastructure, and to "program an equitable social development." It proposes the furtherance of actions that will strengthen or foster ties between nations and integration processes with the support of "citizen participation." "Europe has become Latin America's second leading commercial partner and Latin America is the first market for EU investments" and that is why "we must strengthen relations between the two areas," it adds. The Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and government which ends this afternoon, sets new directions in regards to relations between the participant countries and the current objective is to increase commerce and consolidate the integrationist processes, the document points out.
