"I came to France and Belgium in order to express our recognition for the various forms of support those responsible for the European Union [EU] have given us, are giving us, and will give us," he emphasized at the opening of a news conference in Paris yesterday, describing the Algerian crisis as "temporary." The Algerian prime minister, who met with Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Alain Juppe, pointed out to his interlocutors that "it was in nobody's interest for Algeria to remain unstable," and that "Africa's security was inseparable from that of the Maghreb." Aware of France's refusal to attach any conditions to its aid, Mokdad Sifi took advantage of this situation to affirm that "no agreement with the IMF or with Europe contained any political conditions." A position which does not, however, appear to be that of the EU. This prime minister reaffirmed that his government had "opted for dialogue without exclusivity (i.e., including the Islamic parties) with everyone who rejects violence," but that it "would unceasingly combat those who want to destroy Algeria through terrorism." However, he was at pains to show that this was a time more of antiterrorist combat than of dialogue. "If there are moderates, let them come forward," he concluded, before recognizing that "he had no answer" to the question of why Abdel-kader Hachani, one of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders, had been detained for more than two years without trial. There remains the delicate problem of human rights violations and the repeated reprisals by the security forces against the civilian population after certain operations by the armed Islamic groups. "Human rights are our concern," Mokdad Sifi replied calmly, adding that "instructions have been given to the security forces not to take repressive measures, even if this were to lead to the failure of an operation or put their lives at risk." Affirmations which come at a time when several Algerian political parties have denounced "excesses" to international humanitarian organizations.
