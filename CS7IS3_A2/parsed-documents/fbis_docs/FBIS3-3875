In the past two years the practice of notarization of technological contracts has caught on in Wuhan. Last year there were a total of 862 science and technology trade contracts handled by notaries public, nearly 40 times more than in 1991. The volume of trade notarized has reached over 12 million yuan (about 1.3 million U.S. dollars)-worth in the city. Wuhan boasts 35 universities and colleges, and nearly 500 scientific institutes which are active in research and technological development. In order to strengthen mutual trust in the course of technology trade, notary offices first started experiments with scientific and technological trade documents in 1991. For example, in 1992 the Wuhan Jianmin Pharmaceuticals Factory spent 350,000 yuan to buy the technology for making a new medicine from an army hospital. Both sides were somewhat worried about the result of the completion of the contract. But the notarization of the contract put them at ease. The new product helped the factory achieve an output value of 3.81 million yuan (about 400,000 U.S. dollars) last year. It has already been exported to Southeast Asian countries.
