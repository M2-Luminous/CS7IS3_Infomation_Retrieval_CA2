VI. Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims Arising From Failure To Timely File Shipper's Export Declarations (15 CFR 30.24) A. Notification of liquidated damages; modified CF&hyph;5955A. Notices of liquidated damages incurred may be issued on a modified CF&hyph;5955A. The modified form shall specify two options from which the petitioner may choose to resolve the demand. 1. Option 1. He may pay a specified sum within 60 days and the case will be closed. By electing this option in lieu of petitioning, he waives his right to file a petition. He may, however, file a supplemental petition, if he does so in accordance with the Customs Regulations and has some new fact or information which merits consideration in accordance with these guidelines. 2. Option 2. Petition for relief. The bond principal or surety may file a petition for relief. By filing a petition for relief, the petitioner will no longer be afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount. The district director shall grant full relief when the petitioner demonstrates that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error. If the petitioner fails to demonstrate that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error, the district director may cancel the claim upon payment of an amount no less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount; however, in no case can the amount afforded in mitigation exceed the amount of the original claim. B. Assessment amounts. 1. $50 per day for each of first three days late. 2. $100 per day for each day late beyond three. 3. Maximum assessment is $1,000. C. Mitigation guidelines. 1. For each offense, the claim for liquidated damages may be canceled upon payment of an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the claim, but not less than $100.
