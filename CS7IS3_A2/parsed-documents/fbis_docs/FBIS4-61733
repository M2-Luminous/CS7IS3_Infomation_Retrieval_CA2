Polyayev] [Text] Russia is prepared to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests. In connection with this it is envisaged that all Russian scientists will have left the nuclear test site in Semipalatinsk by the beginning of July. Incidentally, right now only 20 percent of the original number of servicing personnel remain at the site. This is insufficient to maintain the site properly and to ensure its security. At the insistence of the Kazakhstani Air Force, helicopter flights over the nuclear facilities without a special permit are banned. The last authorized flight took place 13 February this year. Despite the high level of radioactivity at the test site, the facilities are not being guarded. Furthermore, the local authorities are seriously considering setting up a livestock farm on the territory of the site. The military also fear that abandoned equipment and cables, which could constitute a radioactive hazard, may be removed by pilferers. An unexploded nuclear charge that remains in one of the galleries also presents a threat. It cannot be defused because there are no specialists, and it cannot be detonated.
