As for the diplomatic aspect, the basic policy is for Japan, the United States, and South Korea to apply stronger pressure on North Korea to push it to change its mind through close coordination with ROK President Kim Yong-sam, who will visit Japan starting on 24 March. However, depending on what the United States, which is very much irritated by its negotiations with the DPRK, does from now on, the possibility remains that a [UNSC] resolution calling for economic sanctions -- which would be "a very serious matter for Japan" -- may come to pass. Under the circumstances, Japan must make intensive domestic coordination efforts in preparation for possible economic sanctions, and at this point, measures such as stopping remittances to the DPRK, an export-import embargo, and restrictions on shipping services are being considered. However, there are also such difficult problems as how to ensure the effectiveness of the sanctions. As for the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) decision to "refer the issue again to the UNSC," a Foreign Ministry source said that "this was an expected outcome." He admitted that from the point that the IAEA started to draft its resolution, Japan had believed that submitting the DPRK issue to the UNSC was inevitable. This source also predicted that "the UNSC will first adopt a resolution calling only for the unconditional acceptance of nuclear inspections to see North Korea's reaction." He expects that there is still some time before actual economic sanctions come to pass. Nevertheless, the United States and the ROK are taking urgent steps to deal with the DPRK, such as agreeing to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercises, and to deploy Patriot antimissile missiles in South Korea. The government's assessment of the situation is that: 1) Japan, whose security is seriously affected, needs to coordinate its actions with the United States and the ROK. 2) Through the discussions with key leaders during Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China, and the visit of Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, to Russia, it is apparent that China and Russia's sense of crisis is inadequate. During President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan, the two countries will declare to the world that Japan and the ROK share very serious concerns and that they will abide by the UNSC's decisions. If the UNSC does adopt a resolution on economic sanctions, Japan will be forced to take a tough stand. After the 1983 Rangoon incident and the bombing of the Korean Airlines plane in 1987, Japan has imposed certain sanctions, but these are limited to banning contacts between diplomats and banning the entry of North Korean chartered planes and DPRK civil servants. Within the government, an import-export embargo, stopping remittances to the DPRK, and restricting shipping services are being considered as possible sanctions. Some officials believe that because there is inadequate information on remittances to North Korea--which are said to reach 60 billion yen to 100 billion yen a year--"remittances cannot be stopped if they go through China or another third country" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). The problem will be how to ensure the effectiveness of the ban. Moreover, restricting personal travel is an issue that affects travelers' human rights. Japan will be forced to make very difficult decisions. Prime Minister Hosokawa has stated that Japan "will take responsible measures within the limits of the Constitution." Some believe that "support for naval activities by the U.S. forces in relation to the economic sanctions" may become inevitable. The Maritime Self-Defense Force's logistical support to the U.S. 7th Fleet "is still a question that needs to be considered in terms of a legal basis and a legal interpretation" (according to a senior Foreign Ministry official). Japan still has to coordinate the final details.
