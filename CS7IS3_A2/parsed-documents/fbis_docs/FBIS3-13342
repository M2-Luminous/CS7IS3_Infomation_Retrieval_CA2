He noted that there had been massacres such as those of Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Sabra, and Shatila in the past, but there was no peace process then like the process that began in Madrid in October 1990, nor were there peace negotiations. In an interview with the Egyptian weekly UKTUBAR to be published Sunday [13 March], he said that UN resolutions stipulate frankly that the settlements are illegal and that they form an obstacle to peace. He added that the settlements are not only an impediment to peace but they now pose a problem for Israel itself and that Israel now does not know what to do with the settlers. He pointed out that protection of the Palestinians has become the issue of the hour and that a solution must be found to this before the peace process resumes. He expressed hopes that the Arabs will get a permanent seat at the Security Council, but he remarked that there must be some contacts for this. He said that the issue of voting on the Arab League resolutions will be discussed at the League Council's meeting due to be held at the foreign minister level at the end of this month. The (?charter) needs (?to be amended) so that resolutions can be passed by a majority of two-thirds instead of the current system which depends on [words indistinct]. He added that he will ask the Arab countries at the next meeting to set up an Arab court of justice as stipulated in Article [word indistinct] of the Arab League Charter of 1945.
