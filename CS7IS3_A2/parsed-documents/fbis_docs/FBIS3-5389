He was speaking to 150 top Japanese businessmen at a special seminar in Nagoya, organised by the Invest in Britain Bureau of the Department of Trade and Industry, during which he also announced the future opening of a British Government Office there. He Said: [subhead] "I would like to reaffirm that the British Government extends a positively unambiguous welcome to investment from Japan. Our approach is that all companies based in Britain are treated as UK enterprises whose interests within the EC we seek to promote and develop. "I am particularly proud that over 40 per cent of all Japanese investment in the EC has come to the UK." Lord Strathclyde added that it was not just investment in manufacturing which Britain welcomed, but investment in research, development and design as well. "We are confident that our scientific skills and facilities for scientific research offer Japanese companies the best possible European base for research, development and design activities. "I believe that Britain is the most positive and forward-looking of all Japan's trading partners. "We each have something to give the other. We continue to learn from you about management efficiency and technological achievement. We appreciate and value the cultural, as well as the economic, contribution to British life made by Japanese companies investing in Britain. "We offer in return a country firmly committed to remaining at the heart of Europe; we offer political stability; and a highly skilled and adaptable labour force ready and willing to learn new skills." The new British Government office will open in Nagoya to promote trade and investment between the Chubu region of Japan and the UK. During his trip to Japan Lord Strathclyde also visited several Japanese companies including the Toyota Motor Corporation, Matsushita Electric Works Ltd, and Koyo Seiko Co. He will also spend three days in Taiwan where he will meet the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance and speak at other investment seminars.
