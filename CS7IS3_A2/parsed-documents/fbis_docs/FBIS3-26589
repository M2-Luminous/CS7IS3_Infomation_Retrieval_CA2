According to reports from the Xian Satellite Monitoring and Control Center and the "Yuan Wang," a ship engaged in astronautics surveying on the Pacific Ocean, the two satellites have reached their synchronous orbits and the launch was a success. The carrier rocket, "Long March IIIA," is a new type which the National Astronautics Industrial Company developed and built for launching China's new satellites for telecommunications and broadcasting services. The rocket, which is based on the "Long March III," has incorporated many advanced technologies and its carrying capacity has increased from its previous 1.4 tonnes to the present 2.5 tonnes. This was the first time the new rocket was used. Experts say that the "Long March IIIA's" successful launch shows that the family of Chinese carrier rockets now has a new member, and that China's capacity for astronautical launching has reached a new level. The Chinese Academy of Sciences Space Center uses the "Practice IV" satellite to survey space. The satellite's six probes are primarily used to survey the space environment and test environmental effects.
