The reality is that different views exist on the criminality of the buyers and sellers and on whether the offense is a felony or a misdemeanor. In certain aspects, the difference in opinion is rather wide. This is a question worth studying by the judicial department. Meanwhile, investigations reveal that the public security department can act strictly and promptly to crack down on abductors, and once an abductor is caught, a case is set up for open trial. Such action is to the immense satisfaction of the public. As to those buying abducted people, however, no prompt action is taken to put them on trial. Some people even express sympathy with the buyers, thinking that they, too, are victims, who were cheated by human mongers to buy abducted people with their hard-earn money. In the opinion of these people, when the public security department has rescued the abducted people, the buyers have "lost both the people and money," so they should be excused from legal liability if at all possible. This kind of thinking has misled a number of people, giving them the erroneous idea that because money is spent, buying humans does not offend the law. Such a state of affairs has fueled, to a certain extent, the rampancy of abduction. It has convinced human mongers that if they can abduct people, there is a big "market" to sell their preys. The writer deems it necessary to strike hard at human mongers. This will give everyone a lift of heart. At the same time, the writer also holds that it is imperative to deal hard blows to human buyers, punish them promptly, harshly, and strictly, and make them aware that using money to buy humans is an offense against law. Another question to think about is that the two "five-year plans to spread legal knowledge," though both have its dead angle, have produced remarkable results. This is a matter worthy of deep thought. Since 1985, our country has formulated two educational plans aimed at spreading legal knowledge among all its people. In general, the plans have been well carried out with remarkable results. The results are especially noticeable in certain areas, big and medium cities in particular. This can be seen from the fact that the masses in these areas are better aware than before of the need to use law to protect themselves. With regard to disgusting phenomena in society and relations between people, they no longer have a simple idea and viewpoint, but can deeply ponder over and analyze the questions. Moreover, they have enhanced their consciousness of self-protection by means of law. Some have imbued their minds with the idea that "all men are equal before the law" and displayed the spirit of equality contained in the "law" in dealing with everything. Now, the fact is that there are far less instances of abduction in cities than in the countryside, and the situation is better in well-off rural areas than in remote villages and mountain areas. In view of this, the writer believes that an important task to radically eliminate abduction is to educate the citizens to protect and guard themselves. All other measures can only solve the symptoms on the surface. They can only reduce, to a certain degree, the instances of abduction, but cannot thoroughly eradicate the problem. The third question is that provisions should be established for the administration of both permanent residents and floating population. The resident registration system formed after the founding of the People's Republic has been improved from time to time during the past decades. We should say that resident registration has been normalized and widely accepted by the broad masses as a common practice. However, with the deepening of the reform and open drive, especially the development of rural reform, a large number of surplus laborers have emerged from the countryside and become jobless vagrants. To earn a living, make a good income, and become better off at an early date, these people have rushed to more economically developed areas to do business, work as laborers, engage in contract work, or conduct other economic activities. This has increased remarkably the floating population in these areas. Unfortunately, our population administration regulations and procedures have not been revised in time to catch up with such a situation. As a result, in some localities no control can be exercised over the floating population. Taking advantage of this loophole, lawless elements have come up to commit abduction and selling of people. In view of this, it is necessary to strengthen the administration of resident registration for floating as well as permanent residents. Those who temporarily reside in a locality should be required to register as temporary residents. This way, we will be able to exercise unified administration of floating residents and to prevent or alleviate the problem of lack of macro-control over the population. In this regard, some localities have made successful exploration and trials. They require those who have come from outside to register as temporary residents. Based on the information provided, they check the newcomers' original places of domicile and send out letters to the departments concerned to find out the real situation, thus exercising effective macroeconomic control over the floating population. In addition, some localities have set up computerized floating-population files. All related information is recorded in the computer and put into a control network. This method has long been used in foreign countries. In our country, however, its application is relatively limited because computers have not been so widely popularized. As far as the present situation is concerned, establishing a normal, rational population-flow mechanism and forming a floating-population administration system based on the law should be one of the major tasks in building China's legal system--a task we should carry out step by step and continue to improve.
