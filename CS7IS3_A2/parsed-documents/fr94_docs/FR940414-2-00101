The reasons alleged for striking this security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Exchange, Article XXVIII, Rule 7, states that, an issue will be considered for delisting when the volume of trading declines to a level which will not support a listed market in the judgment of the Exchange and its Committee on Floor Procedure. According to the Exchange, there has been no trading volume since 1990 for the Circle Fine Art Corporation on the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''). According to the Exchange, Article XXVIII, Rule 7 Paragraph 1 states, that the applicant shall agree to notify the Exchange promptly of any changes in the general character or nature of its business. According to the Exchange, the Company did not send a 10&hyph;K to the Exchange until it responded to a third request from the Exchange. The Company had been delinquent in sending current filings to the Exchange. In the interim, there were changes in the nature of the Company's general structure. The Commission, having considered the facts stated in the application and having due regard for the public interest and protection of investors, orders that said application be, and it hereby is, granted, effective at the opening of business on April 11, 1994. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
