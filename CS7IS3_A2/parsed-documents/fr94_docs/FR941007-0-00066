FR941007-0-00066 FR941007-0-00016 (c) Calculation of variable portion of the grant. (1) HCFA bases the variable portion of the grant on_ (i) The amount of available funds, and (ii) A comparison of each State with the average of all of the States (except the State being compared) with respect to three factors that relate to the size of the State's Medicare population and where that population resides. (2) The factors HCFA uses to compare States' Medicare populations comprise separate components of the variable amount. These factors, and the extent to which they each contribute to the variable amount, are as follows: (i) Approximately 75 percent of the variable amount is based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries living in the State as a percentage of all Medicare beneficiaries nationwide. (ii) Approximately 10 percent of the variable amount is based on the percentage of the State's total population who are Medicare beneficiaries. (iii) Approximately 15 percent of the variable amount is based on the percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiaries that reside in rural areas (``rural areas'' are defined as all areas not included within a Metropolitan Statistical Area). (3) Based on the foregoing four factors (that is, the amount of available funds and the three comparative factors), HCFA determines a variable rate for each participating State for each grant period. (d) Submission of revised budget . A State that receives an amount of grant funds under this subpart that differs from the amount requested in the budget submitted with its application must submit a revised budget to HCFA, along with its acceptance of the grant award, that reflects the amount awarded. §403.506 [Removed] 6. Section 403.506 is removed. 7. Section 403.508 is revised to read as follows: §403.508 Limitations. (a) Use of grants. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a State that receives a grant under this subpart may use the grant for any reasonable expenses incurred in planning, developing, implementing, and/or operating the program for which the grant is made. (b) Maintenance of effort. A State that receives a grant to supplement an existing program (that is, an existing program enhancement grant)_ (1) Must not use the grant to supplant funds for activities that were conducted immediately preceding the date of the initial award of a grant made under this subpart and funded through other sources (including in-kind contributions). (2) Must maintain the activities of the program at least at the level that those activities were conducted immediately preceding the initial award of a grant made under this subpart. 8. Sections 403.510 and 403.512 are added to read as follows: §403.510 Reporting requirements. A State that receives a grant under this subpart must submit at least one annual report to HCFA and any additional reports as HCFA may prescribe in the notice of grant award. HCFA advises the State of the requirements concerning the frequency, timing, and contents of reports in the notice of grant award that it sends to the State. §403.512 Administration. (a) General.
