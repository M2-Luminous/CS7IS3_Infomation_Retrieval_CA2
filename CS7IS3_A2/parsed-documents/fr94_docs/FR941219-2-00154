FR941219-2-00154 FR941219-2-00080 As noted above, the number of shares of each component security in the Index portfolio remains fixed between quarterly reviews except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary cash dividend, a stock distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar event with respect to the component securities. In a merger or consolidation of an issuer of a component security, if the stock or ADR remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security in the portfolio may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the component's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. In the event of a stock or ADR replacement, the average dollar value of the remaining portfolio components will be calculated and that amount invested in the security of the new component, to the nearest whole share. In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure Index continuity. The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index, and pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b) may at any time or from time to time substitute securities, or adjust the number of securities included in the Index based on changing conditions in the airline industry. In the event, however, that the Exchange determines to increase the number of Index components to greater than thirteen or to reduce the number of components to fewer than nine, the Exchange will submit a 19b&hyph;4 filing to the Commission. In selecting securities to be included in the Index, the Exchange will be guided by a number of factors including market value of outstanding shares, trading activity, and adherence to Rule 901C, Commentary .02. Similar to other stock index values published by the Exchange, the value of the Index will be calculated continuously and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape Association's Network B. Expiration and Settlement The proposed options on the Index are European-style, 5 and cash-settled. The Exchange's standard option trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) will apply to Index options. The options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an Index option series will normally be the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following Expiration Friday (normally a Thursday). Trading in expiring Index options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day. 5 European-style options may only be exercised during a specified time period immediately prior to expiration. The Exchange plans to list Index options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the two additional calendar months in the January cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options based on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange may instead list long-term, reduced-value put and call options based on one tenth (1/10th) of the Index's full value. In either event, the interval between expiration months for either a full-value of reduced-value long-term Index option will not be less than six months. The trading of any long-term Index options would be subject to the same rules which govern the trading of all the Exchange's index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements, and floor trading procedures. Position limits on reduced-value long-term Index options will be equivalent to the position limits for regular (full-value) Index options and would be aggregated with such options. For example, if the position limit for the full-value options on the Index is 10,500 contracts on the same side of the market, then the position limit for the reduced-value options will be 105,000 contracts on the same side of the market and positions in reduced-value Index options will be aggregated with positions in full-value Index options. The exercise settlement value for all of the expiring Index options will be calculated based upon the primary exchange regular way opening sale prices for the component securities. In the case of Nasdaq/NMS securities, the first reported sale price will be used. If any component security does not open for trading on its primary market on the last day before expiration, then the prior day's last sale price will be used in the exercise settlement value calculation. Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of option contracts based on the Index. These rules cover issues such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. The Index is deemed to be a Stock Index Option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Industry Group under Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money ( i.e., strike prices within ten points above or below the current Index value) option series on the Index at 21/2 intervals only when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange expects that the review required by Rule 904C(c) will result in a position limit of 10,500 contracts with respect to options on this Index. The Amex represents that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) 6 in particular in that it will permit trading in options based on the Amex Airline Index pursuant to rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. 6 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b)(5) (1988).
