Reacting to reports that police had warned him of an ultra-rightwing plot to assassinate him, Gen Viljoen said he had not been given any specific information about such a threat. He conceded though, that times were becoming dangerous, and that some sources said there was a threat from the African National Congress [ANC] side, others said from ultra-rightwingers, while others said it was government information which should be treated with circumspection. He knew of no specific threat against him, and his security arrangements remained on a normal level. Turning to suggestions of rightwing disenchantment with his leadership, and talk that he was a government agent to moderate the rightwing, Gen Viljoen said he had long been aware of such talk, and saw it as part of a campaign to discredit him. "They will do anything to alienate me." Gen Viljoen also dismissed suggestions that he may be on the verge of stepping down from his AVF position, saying he was committed to establishing a volkstaat [nation state] for his people. He said he had become disenchanted with the political vacillations of the National Party and the ANC, which made about- turns during negotiations for a volkstaat. Gen Viljoen said he had never been expected to provide political leadership for the AVF, but strategic guidance. If the government decided not to accommodate the Freedom Alliance [FA], the FA should discuss its future options. Asked what these options would be, he said: "Your guess is as good as mine."
