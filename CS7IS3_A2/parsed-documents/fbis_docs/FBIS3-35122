According to reports received from news agencies, Geydar Aliyev made that request at the end of his 4-day visit to Turkey. Political circles in the region are not inclined to grant much weight to that statement by Geydar Aliyev who has a special reputation for being a very complex personality. Since he assumed power on June 30, Aliyev has been playing in various ways with the regional powers - with Moscow and Tehran and now with Ankara. Aliyev's courtship of Ankara started quite recently, for bilateral ties between Baku and Ankara had not been very warm after the downfall of Abulfaz Elchibey who depended greatly on the Turkish support. Some of the well-informed political observers in the region evaluate Geydar Aliyev's recent statement only as a means of provoking the other regional countries specially Russia. Surprisingly it seems that Russia has been pursing the affairs of the new independent states quite closely in spite of the chaotic social and economic situation in that country. It is true of course that the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis still goes on, but it seems that the recent victories gained by the Azeris in battle fronts could serve to deflate somewhat the Armenian military pride and make them settle for more realistic peace talks. The Armenians military victories of the previous months had encouraged them to adopt a very demanding position. At the same time the economic situation in Yerevan is reportedly much more chaotic then it is in Baku. In the opinion of political observers, after the recent trip to Moscow by Morteza Banki, the director of the Central Asia Department of the Iranian Foreign Ministry and his negotiations with some of the Russian authorities, and the consequent expression of willingness on the part of Moscow to seek a political settlement for the crisis in the Caucasus in collaboration with Iran presents new hopeful prospects. It has been clearly demonstrated in the course of the futile military encounters of the past few years that the Caucasian issue could not be resolved with the aid of powers that are at a geographical distance from the nucleus of the conflict. The crisis could only be resolved by the regional powers with the collaboration of the two warring countries. There remains, however, one source of worry. In the process of action Russia had already blocked the efforts of the Minsk group to reach a political settlement. Is Russia going to perform that role again in connection with the new peace initiative that is being undertaken by Iran, Turkey and Russia?
