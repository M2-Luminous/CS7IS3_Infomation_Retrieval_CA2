As we announced earlier, our guest this evening is Mate Granic, vice prime minister and minister of foreign affairs. Good evening, and welcome back from your successful diplomatic tour. [Granic] Good evening. [Merlic] [passage omitted] Mr. Granic, I am under the impression that the vast majority of reactions to the preliminary agreement signed in Washington are extremely favorable, except for a few unfavorable or restrained reactions from Serbia. What is the true situation on the ground, and do you have any information from Herceg-Bosna? I hear that politicians and people in Herceg-Bosna are finding it difficult to accept this agreement. It seems that the wounds sustained in this serious Muslim-Croat conflict have not yet healed. [Granic] There are fears, and one should be understanding and make explanations patiently. I think this is our reality. I believe that people will accept the agreement, but we must be patient in explaining all the advantages the Croatian people will gain by this agreement in both Herceg-Bosna and in Croatia. [Merlic] What was particularly well stressed in President Tudjman's speech, I think, was that this proposal--this agreement-- would not be accepted only by narrow-minded nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists. How realistic is this, given the situation on the ground? [Granic] The president gave his assessment of the agreement today. You said that 60 countries requested permission to broadcast his speech immediately. It is quite certain that many other countries will make such a request. This has been a number one topic in the world and on all TV stations over the past three days. I believe there will be a lack of understanding initially. I believe there will be fear, but I also believe that once it is all over, and when not just a preliminary but also a final agreement are signed, the people will accept it. [Merlic] In the past few days politicians from Herceg-Bosna expressed their views and sharp criticism, saying that they could not accept an agreement which contains no guarantees of territories, of the territorial integrity of this Croatian part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Are these fears justified? [Granic] We have received guarantees at different levels with this agreement. On the one side, from the geopolitical, geostrategic, and economic point of view, Croatia has every interest in a confederation based on a modern union: a customs, monetary, and economic union and a defense alliance, with a shared command, confederal council. On the other--as far as Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina are concerned--all Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be included in this agreement. [passage omitted] [Merlic] Talking about the cantons--or as they will be called in Croatian, grand counties [velezupa]... [Granic, interrupting] President Tudjman said that today, and we will probably propose that name.... [Merlic, interrupting] You said that the cantons will be sovereign. What duties will lie with the cantons? Will the cantons have armies and police? [Granic] You see, it says here that the cantons will have jurisdiction over police, education, culture, housing issues.... [Merlic, interrupting] Talking about the police, will they have different uniforms in different cantons, or will they be the same? [Granic] The uniforms will be the same, but the insignia will differ from canton to canton. That has been agreed upon. Therefore, certain tasks will be carried out at the level of the federation, there will be joint tasks, and some tasks will be exclusively under the jurisdiction of the cantons. The basic aim was to set up a federation that can function on the one hand, and on the other hand, to secure a high level of decentralization in the form of cantons which are inherently sovereign, and which are federal units. [Merlic] The army will be at the level of the federation. [Granic] There is a final solution and a solution for the interim period. Nothing will change in the interim period; things will only be coordinated. The final solution envisages the army to be at the level of the federation. I will read it out: joint command, joint military system within the confederation and the protection of borders. That will be at the level of the federation, at the level of the cantons. [sentence as heard] [Merlic] It could be irresponsible to mention this now, but a prominent leader of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA - Stranka demokratske akcije] of Croatia spoke on the TV Parliament program last week about the navy in Neum. Is that irresponsible, or is he well informed? [Granic] I think that is irresponsible. As I said, we will have coordination at the level of the confederation [as heard]. Therefore, this has never been mentioned. We do want coordination because we have the same strategic interests in having a defense alliance and coordination at the level of the confederation. But of course such ideas were not discussed. [Merlic] Let us go back to the Croat-Bosniak federation briefly. What seems to me the greatest problem that needs to be dealt with in the future is the territorial division. It is not mentioned anywhere how many and which cantons there will be and which territory they will cover. [Granic] There are proposals, but there have been no official talks on that issue yet. [Merlic] Do we know how many cantons there will be? [Granic] It is certain that Hercegovina will be a separate canton, as well as western Bosnia and Posavina. There are various possibilities for central Bosnia. [Merlic] Will central Bosnia perhaps be a mixed canton? [Granic] There have been proposals to make central Bosnia one big mixed canton with two sub-cantons, one of which would be Croat and one Bosniak, or perhaps to have two separate cantons. No agreement has been reached on that. The exact number of cantons will be discussed over the next 10 days. No agreement has been reached so far. [passage omitted reiterates Serbs should give up 20 percent of their territory through negotiations; summary of Russia's involvement in solving the Bosnian crisis over the past 10 days] I was invited to go to Moscow today, but that was not possible because of my visit to Paris. I will go to Moscow next week. [Merlic] There are several options for the Bosnian Serbs. They can say no, they can yield territory, or they can join in and remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina in one way or another. What seems the most likely possibility to you? [Granic] As it has been said, they will be invited to join in under the same conditions. [Merlic] On the federal principle? [Granic] Yes, that is right. They will be invited to join in on the federal principle--after the principles are agreed upon, of course. That is the first option. The second option is for them to remain in some kind of relationship with the federation, as the European Union has suggested--the (?division between) the federation and the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is one of the possibilities. In any case, they would not be allowed to leave now. [passage omitted] [Merlic] If the Bosnian Serbs decide to remain in Bosnia- Herzegovina, either on this federal principle, or on some kind of confederal principle, does that mean that Croatia would still form a confederation with that kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Granic] Croatia has political, strategic, and economic interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is perfectly clear today that this is also the West's strategic interest. This has never been defined more clearly than now. I believe that Croatia has firmly decided to take that step -- both by signing and by today's statement by President Tudjman, which has been well received throughout the world. I can say that in the United States the news about the signing [the agreement on confederation] met with almost unanimous approval -- among diplomats, in the Security Council, and in the United Nations. We will continue along this path. It will not be easy. As you can see, there are a lot of obstacles that need to be overcome successfully, and this is why we said that this was the first -- important and historic -- but only the first step. [Merlic] To end this interview, I have a question about the guarantees and promises that the United States and the international community have made to Croatia. Primarily, the most interesting one is a certain guarantee that the occupied areas of Croatia will be returned under Croatia's sovereignty. There is also financial assistance and the cooperation in military issues, namely, membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace. Have any of these guarantees been put down on paper? [Granic] The guarantees have not been put down on paper, but they are being discussed. In the talks I have had with Vice President Gore, General Shalikashvili, Defense Secretary Perry, and State Secretary Christopher, we discussed all this in more detail than you mentioned here. This is not all. Access to financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF, will be opened up to us. The public knows that some loans have been blocked for political reasons. That is one group of offers. The other one is the European Union. Talks on this are under way; very intensive talks. [passage omitted: EU to discuss Bosnia on Monday] [Granic] What is the most interesting for us, of course, is the reintegration of the UN protected areas into Croatia's state and legal system. I discussed this with the UN secretary general. We will put our proposal in writing by mid-March, and demand guarantees and support from the United States and EU, from all important international factors. [passage omitted]
