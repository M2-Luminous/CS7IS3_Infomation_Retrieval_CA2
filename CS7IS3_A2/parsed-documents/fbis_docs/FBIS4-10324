This is the subject Eloy Concepcion of TRABAJADORES and I, Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE, will discuss today. Eloy, I want to invite you to meditate a little on how the lack of control of state institutions is fostering more criminal acts. I think the most harmful criminal activity today is the theft of the goods basic to survival that we have in minimal amounts. [Concepcion] The visible face of criminality is often that of the petty thief who steals a bicycle, breaks open a door in an establishment to steal a few things, enters a home and steals, etc. This is the classical thief who exists in all societies, everywhere in the world. I have meditated several times -- and at times when we held a roundtable meeting to discuss this subject and have listened to the experts -- and I ask myself why there was an increase in the crime rate last year, and why this problem has not yet been definitively eradicated. Without trying to be absolutist and without dreaming of being the only perfect society in the world -- which is almost impossible because human beings react differently under often incredible circumstances -- I keep asking: Why does this theft or misappropriation exist in our society? I want to add here the word missing inventory [faltante] in four categories: theft, misappropriation, embezzlement, and missing inventory. The day before yesterday I brought up this subject for discussion, because talking on the street -- we reporters must converse a lot on the streets and listen to what people have to say, especially those in lines, etc. -- I listened to two people talking. A man was asking a woman how to get a pound of powdered milk. The woman answered: Well, you know that the boat has not arrived yet. I began to think: Well, the boat has not yet arrived... and where are that man and woman going to buy the powdered milk if she is not entitled to receive it as a special food quota or because she has a child? But later, watching Havana television and after reading the newspaper TRIBUNA DE LA HABANA, I realized that the boat with powdered milk indeed has not arrived. I ask myself: Where does this milk come from? Milk that often sells for dollars or for 100 or 200 pesos? I cannot understand the astronomical prices that they charge for a pound or a kilogram of powdered milk. I am not talking about the milk that is bought at the hard currency stores, but the milk taken from what is distributed to children and sick and elderly people. [Rodriguez] And the milk used to make pasteurized milk. [Concepcion] Yes. I would like to point out one thing: All this demonstrates that we have very inefficient control mechanisms. I do not want to mention the port because it has been mentioned several times. I do not want to take it off the list or add it to the list. I do not want to mention the dairy complex, where that milk is produced, or the different plants where the it is processed. I do not want to offend anyone, so I am not naming anyone. But I do want to mention all those who have to do with the powdered milk distribution network, because it is painful. It cannot be allowed, in this society of justice, that the state spend money to import milk later sold on the black market. [Rodriguez] We are talking about the lack of control by the state establishments, which, in my opinion, is the origin of the great black market that we are suffering today. We must say that the great majority of the Cuban people are suffering, because we must all go to that market to try to complement our diets -- even though it is a mirage, because no hard worker can purchase these products at those prices. I believe these are products that we could be receiving through normal means, through our quota, our norm; yet they remain in those hands that, as you said, are the hands of people who are uncontrolled, on the one hand, and corrupt, on the other. [Concepcion] Yes, because we spoke of an basic product like powdered milk. We can mention other basic products, where the state....[pauses] As reporters we know; we have the information. This is a country that is facing a serious and difficult financial situation. We understand that the government and the leadership of the country, those comrades who are in charge of administering the little hard currency we have, work miracles to maintain and guarantee those products to the people who need them. Sometimes, because of the blockade, we must go around the world to purchase those products on credit, credit that many times is not granted. We must obtain hard currency, one way or another. As a reporter, as a Cuban, and as a patriot, I am hurt by these things, especially when one sees these products being sold on the black market. Now, I ask the comrades, officials, administrators, workers who have to do with this: Does it hurt you that these products, which are brought into Cuba to cover specific needs, fall into the hands of the black market? What control is there at the port? What control exists in the dairy complexes and the processing plants? What control is there in the business system and in the distribution network? What control is there over the truck driver who distributes the product to the marketplaces and stores? What control is there over the administrators of those stores to keep those products from reaching the black market? [Rodriguez] I believe that in the last few days, the Cuban people have had the opportunity to see action by the police and are getting upset with the attitude of certain administrations. I have in mind one administrator who did not regard the 200 tons of sugar stolen from his enterprise a considerable amount. At that moment, Havana City was going through a sugar crisis. It was the middle of the month and sugar still had not been distributed to Havana City. I believe there are many administrators who do not care. But I also believe that some of these administrators are consciously linked to this type of illegal activity. I am not saying that they always participate in the distribution or theft network; but they embezzle some for their home, some for their friends, and some to solve the problems for John Doe at X enterprise because, at the same time, he is solving X or Y problem for him. I believe this to be a key element. It is something that used to be criticized in the enterprise assemblies which were held at provincial levels, and it is something that continues today. It is something that is unimaginable. Just recently, I wrote an article in JUVENTUD REBELDE on just such an incident. It was about a person who used fake checks to steal from several enterprises in the capital. Those enterprises, in an attempt to solve the problem of another supposed enterprise, would sell him their products. That individual would simply sell those products on the black market and thereby solve a number of problems far removed from the purpose for which the goods had been produced. [Rodriguez] Concepcion and I are talking here about the damage caused by the lack of controls in state institutions. [Concepcion] I think we cannot generalize the idea that all comrades in state institutions are involved; the state institutions have an organization of their own and comrades work in various areas -- commerce, gastronomy, industry, and construction. That is, there are comrades working at the provincial level, at the state institution level, and at the municipal level, who must oversee and check these institutions in addition to what is done by the state administrative apparatus, by the company, or by the ministry. Now I ask: What do these comrades do? Why, if this is well known -- because if I am aware, all people are aware of this problem -- why are not the officials, administrators, and leaders of the people's government in charge of that area not doing anything? But even more serious is the fact that most workers from the labor centers are aware of the problem. I think there is also the other problem you mentioned: I think there is a false concept of cronyism, of comradeship, of the idea that I see you and I let you do it, because this follows the saying that a shrimp that jumps into the water will splash. [Rodriguez] No, it is not a shrimp, it is a shark. A shark swims and splashes. [Concepcion] Yes, something along that line. The truth is that there is a moral lack. In my opinion, there is a lack of morality in the administration and in the labor centers where there are no requirements and where there is no moral authority who can point a finger, because he himself is afraid of being pointed at. He is not saying anything because he is afraid that others will say: What can you say, since I saw you doing this? [Rodriguez] And what about those who justify theft because of the current scarcity in the country? This subject will surely demand another "Straight Talk" discussion, because lately people would agree in saying: Well, what can we do about it if this is the way things are? But I have not seen anyone stealing in order to eat. This case I have not yet seen, although it might happen. Everyone steals goods to sell on the black market. [Concepcion] Theft has nothing to do with people's needs. I was raised under capitalism, and my father taught me not to steal. I think our people are sound and honest. Our workers are honest and most of our officials are honest, I am convinced. What happens is what you recently talked about: something called bureaucracy, something called scheming or mechanization. We have discussed these ideas at length. For instance, this morning I used the term, missing inventory [faltante]. I think all these things have created a negligence, a lack of requirements, and a lack of aggressiveness. I would also say, as Luis Sexto once said on this program that there is a passivism. I do not know where the dividing line is between passivism and negligence, but both are damaging to the Revolution. I think there must be some elements behind this who either wittingly or unwittingly are damaging the Revolution. When I was in the black market, I realized that selling one kg of powdered milk brought for children and the elderly is much more harmful than any direct counterrevolutionary action. [Rodriguez] I believe that many of these administrators do not even know what is being stolen from them, because they do not have the slightest controls over the products. [Concepcion] If they do not have any controls, and if they do not know what is being stolen, they should not be administrators. So, in addition to a raid against thieves, there must also be a raid against the administrators who allow themselves to be robbed. [Rodriguez] Lack of controls and criminality unquestionably go hand in hand. I think we have to cut off the hand of criminality and the hand of lack of controls.
