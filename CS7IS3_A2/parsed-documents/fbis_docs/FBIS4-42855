Since then, we have begun to see signs of a recovery, strengthening in the first months of 1994. In the fourth quarter of 1993, GDP rose. Since December, household confidence has improved uninterruptedly and employment expectations have reversed. Again, since the fourth quarter of 1993, industry's confidence, recorded by the ISCO [National Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation]- MONDO ECONOMICO surveys, has improved. The balance on short-term order and production trends has turned positive and is increasing. Industrial sales and the retail sales index are rising. Capacity utilization levels remain low but are improving. Since February, on the other hand, the downward trend in medium- and long-term interest rates has first stopped and then reversed. In 1993 this trend permitted a 4.7 percent reduction in the yield-to-maturity of 10-year treasury bonds and a halving of the yield differential with corresponding German paper. Foreign holders have sold, at times substantially, prices have fallen, and yields have risen. Obviously it would be out of place to establish any connection between the observed events, whether favorable, such as the end of the recession, or unfavorable, such as the rise in interest rates, and the arrival of a new government. There is no need for "sensations" or for "surveys not covering the whole country" in order to obtain "signs of a recovery which has already begun." An ample mass of data and commentaries from official and private sources demonstrate that the turning point, as we have seen, lay between the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, well before "confidence and enthusiasm" had any opportunity (or reason) to show themselves. As for interest rates, the increase has come since March, in other major countries just as in Italy. The "good fortune of having inherited an economy which was strongly improving" (according to the Goldman Sachs analysts), on the one hand, and the reversal of the downward trend in interest rates, on the other, compose a framework which both offers opportunities and presents problems. In the Bank of Italy report we find that, in 1993, "the Italian economy has achieved results, not only in reducing the government deficit, but also in rebalancing its foreign accounts, starting a restructuring of the services sector, recovering profit margins, and containing inflation which are unprecedented taking into account the unfavorable economic climate." Certain of these results are solid; others need to be consolidated or improved. Last year, the process of bringing public financing back into balance was hindered by the recession and facilitated by the reduction in interest rates. The structural adjustments achieved by the 1992 and 1993 budgets, leaving aside interest charges, were imposing (as can be seen by comparing the trend forecasts calculated by the Treasury Ministry for the coming years before and after the interventions), but fell short of the objectives, despite the supplementary measures adopted during 1993. The recession's effects, in terms of lower income and higher expenditures, have been felt and continue into 1994. On the other hand, thanks to the reduction in interest rates (promoted by a shrewd debt management policy), interest expenditure was some 20 trillion lire lower than forecast in 1993 and will be some 30 trillion lower in 1994. More precisely, the average cost of state indebtedness, which went above 11 percent in 1992 and was a little lower in 1993, should be scarcely more than 9 percent in 1994. Adding to this an excess of tax income over expenditure, apart from interests, a reduction in the average cost of indebtedness represents an essential ingredient in restoring the financial situation. It serves to reduce the current deficit. In particular it alleviates the budget correction (on expenditure and/or income) necessary to stop the growth in the debt to national product ratio. The "cost" of attaining this objective by 1996, in terms of cuts in expenditure or increased income, diminishes by some 22 trillion lire for every one percentage point reduction in the average cost of the debt. But can we be certain that the reduction in the cost of the debt will continue? Unfortunately not, because the achievable level for the year will turn out roughly equal to today's cost of medium- and long-term borrowing. Let us say straightaway that monetary policy is unable to influence long-term interest rates, as international experience has taught us. Or rather, a lax monetary policy, which arouses expectations of inflation, far from reducing them, will run the risk of increasing them. Should we therefore resign ourselves, and place our confidence solely in the development of external rates on the international markets, which is not favorable today? Not necessarily, because Italian yields still have some way to go on their own. The yield differential between long-term Italian securities and similar German or French paper, even if it has halved compared with the beginning of 1993, still remains three points or a little less. This is due in small part to the "country risk," due in part to expectations regarding inflation, and in particular to the size of the debt and the continuing uncertainty on the budget adjustment. This is a differential which can be reduced, if the adjustment policy is incisive and is perceived as such by the markets. But it can also increase the other way, and even more if the purse strings are opened wider, with the idea of financing lower income today with the hope of higher income tomorrow. In the first case, the course of Italian rates could become in part untied from that of international rates, making use of a margin for further descent; in the second case, a reduction in international rates would not provide us with any relief, and the negative effect of their increase would be heightened. There are good reasons which should induce us to continue, unhesitatingly, on the first path. An economy which is out of recession, in which the impetus of exports promoted by the undervalued exchange rate is now consolidated by the European recovery, not only has no need of fiscal incentives, but makes a further decisive step toward budget adjustment easier and more bearable. Today, the average cost of the debt is still lower than that forecast last July in the economic and financial programming document. As a result, the necessary 1995 and 1996 correction has decreased compared with what was then estimated. Decisive intervention in 1995 could further reduce it, permitting and supporting a reduction in rates. In the final years of the past decade, we had ideal conditions for arresting the growth of the debt in terms of the domestic product. This chance was squandered, and the cost of adjustment rose, leaving it to begin in much more difficult years. Another opportunity, even if less favorable than the previous one, appears to be on the horizon today. We need to seize it. It could be the last one.
