Yesterday afternoon, Rose said that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] inquiry could not determine from where the mortar shell originated. According to Minister Claes, that is not really relevant. "Obviously I have nothing against an extra inquiry into who was responsible. But to my mind it no longer has anything to do with Saturday's incident. Last Friday 10 people died in a mortar attack for which the Serbs were clearly responsible. This is a matter of principle: The strangulation of Sarajevo must be brought to an end. The Serbs must disappear from the hills around Sarajevo." Foreign Minister Claes's plea for air strikes against Serbian positions was by far the most resolute of those heard yesterday. American Defense Secretary William Perry, who after two days in his new job has already been forced to make statements about the thorny Bosnia issue, recalled a few of America's earlier positions. "Air strikes will certainly be considered," said Perry in Munich, where he attended a two-day conference on security in Europe. "President Clinton said that we should not allow Sarajevo to be strangled. If Saturday's action were to be considered as the strangulation of Sarajevo, and if we could not do anything about it, then we would certainly consider firm action, including air strikes." Claes no longer believes in U.S. declarations. "This is no longer a purely political problem, but an ethical and moral problem. The mass murder must stop. Either the Serbs adopt another attitude, or air forces will have to be sent in. This is a question of making those guys disappear from the hills. If they do not want to hear that, then they should feel it. Then the people in Belgrade might think twice." According to Claes, the criticism that air strikes will endanger UN troops on the ground is no reason not to make plans for air strikes. "Naturally, at the same time measures will have to be taken to guarantee the safety of UN troops." Military plans have been drawn up to this effect." Claes stressed that his viewpoint is nothing new, and the Belgian Government had already pleaded, before the start of the NATO summit on 10 January, for air strikes if the warring factions could not reach a settlement. "I myself have always belonged to a moderate wing," said Claes. "I am one of those who can be extremely patient. However, in history there are times when moral values take priority. There are limits below which people must not drop, and over the past week we have dropped below these limits." When the foreign ministers of the Twelve meet today in Brussels, Sarajevo will undoubtedly be on the agenda. Minister Claes will not fail to advocate a strong European position on air strikes. "Following numerous contacts, I am hopeful that the European Union (EU) will take a vigorous position," said Claes. "Hopefully it will be of such a nature to make our NATO partners and the United Nations see the light. In the meantime, I will support my decision where I can." In this connection, Claes wanted to urge those EU member states that are also members of the Security Council to take a European initiative. "Today again I will try to contact my counterparts Alain Juppe, Douglas Hurd, and Javier Solana and urge them to take initiatives in New York in order to convince Butrus Butrus-Ghali that there is no time left to lose."
