The session started with quorum problems. Parliamentary Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze proposed to broaden the powers of the speaker's office, enabling it to apply effective sanctions [against deputies who fail to attend]. The head of state said that parliament should consider this proposal if it wants its legislative activity to be more productive. After a quorum was reached, Deputy Shalva Natelashvili submitted a proposal concerning amendments to the provisional rules of procedure. He said that plenary sessions of parliament should be held less frequently to allow deputies to work in commissions. The head of state supported this idea. In his opinion, parliament's legislative activity cannot be replaced by decrees. The bulk of work should be carried out in commissions. The second proposal on the agenda addressed the old painful problem of the coupon. Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Basilia said that the Cabinet of Ministers has set up a commission responsible for reorganizing the financial system. The commission has been entrusted with drafting specific steps aimed at strengthening the coupon and revitalizing the economy. In its work, the commission will take into account IMF and World Bank recommendations. The deputy prime minister said that an integrated program is needed to revitalize the economy. The first step in this direction would be to free prices, since the difference in prices [between the public and private sectors] is mainly responsible for the budget deficit. Rationing could serve as a social protection mechanism. It is necessary to determine a budget deficit limit, which is to be filled with revenues from state property privatization. These revenues should be used to repay bank credits and to establish a fund to stabilize the financial system. The deputy prime minister stressed that the National Bank is to play an important role in this process. The draft program produced heated debate and a fair amount of skepticism. In responding to deputies' remarks regarding the further impoverishment of the population, the absence of social protection mechanisms, and the impossibility of implementing reforms, Deputy Prime Minister Basilia said that it had been much easier for him to be a member of parliament and work on this issue in commissions than to speak from his present vantage point. However, he said, it is necessary to start this process, since the current situation defies assessment. The fact that both parliament and the government have discussed ways of strengthening the coupon and revitalizing the economy many times before gives ground for a certain degree of skepticism. Is it possible to implement everything mentioned above? Deputy Prime Minister Basilia gave us the following answer: [Begin Basilia recording] The most difficult part of it is to make a decision and to have the political will to implement these measures. I am profoundly convinced that the measures which I presented to parliament today are the only way of overcoming the current economic crisis. I am not aware of any other ways or measures of doing it. Therefore, I think that all of us, both parliament and government, should work in coordination to implement these measures. If our work is well coordinated, I am sure that we will achieve some results. [end recording]
