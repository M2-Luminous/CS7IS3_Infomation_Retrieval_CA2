In a statement to MENA's Kabul correspondent, Qanooni said that President Rabbani has no objection to starting discussions with Hekmatyar to resolve their dispute and that he is also willing to begin immediately forming election committees for elections to be held in six months. The Afghan official described Hekmatyar's demand that the president resign as "unacceptable and part of the political maneuvering that Hekmatyar uses whenever he finds himself in a weak position." Qanooni added: We have become accustomed to such maneuvers. Formerly Hekmatyar demanded the resignation of Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud as a condition for solving all disputes with President Rabbani. President Rabbani was appointed by the Shura Council. Qanooni pointed out that Hekmatyar cannot set conditions, because he cannot achieve a military victory. The head of the Afghan Defense Ministry's Political Department said that President Rabbani will not accept any good offices to reach a cease-fire with the forces of the communist General Abdol Rashid Dostam who is considered a remnant of the former soviet rule of Afghanistan. Qanooni added that the call to jihad which the Afghan president made against Dostam and which was responded to by all the country's mojahedin and ulema "must be implemented and cannot be retracted." Asked about the results of the military clashes between the president's forces -- which include the forces of Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, the forces of Isma'il Khan, and the Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society] forces -- on the one side and Dostam's forces on the other, Qanooni said that Dostam has lost more than 75 percent of his positions inside and around Kabul. Additionally 250 of his troops were killed and 960 captured. He pointed out that the success of President Rabbani's forces in capturing the Microryan area and purging it of Dostam's forces had made it possible for them also to capture Miranjan Hill and Bala Hesar. He explained that these two positions were Dostam's last two positions around Kabul. Asked to comment on international and regional attitudes to the current events in Afghanistan, Qanooni said that according to his own information, Moscow was seeking to replace the country's Islamic system with a regime loyal to it. At the same time, several regional powers believe that Hekmatyar was the most suitable person to help them attain their objectives in Afghanistan. He added that Hekmatyar realized after the battles of Tagab and Sorubi that he would not be able to face President Rabbani's forces alone and therefore he sought an alliance with the communist General Abdol Rashid Dostam. The head of the Afghan Defense Ministry's Political Department noted that the Western countries had adopted a wait-and-see attitude awaiting the consequences of Hekmatyar's and Dostam's "coup attempt". He pointed out, however, that they realized after one day of fighting at the beginning of the year that President Rabbani's regime was not an easy target. On the current situation, Mohammad Yunus Qanooni said that President Rabbani's forces have evident superiority in Kabul, the areas surrounding it, and in northern Afghanistan.
