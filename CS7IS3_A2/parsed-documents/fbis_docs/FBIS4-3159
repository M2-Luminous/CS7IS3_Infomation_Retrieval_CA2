Bush said Washington should not suspend the most-favored-nation status to China. Bush made the statement when meeting with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam in the presidential house. Turning to the Korean peninsula, Bush said the situation was not as tense as he thought when he was in his own country. Kim, on his part, accused certain "irresponsible" people of exaggerating the situation on the Korean peninsula. Bush arrived here earlier today to attend the 43rd Annual Conference of the Pacific-Asia Travel Association (PATA), scheduled for April 18-20.
