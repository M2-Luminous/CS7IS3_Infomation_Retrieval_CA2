The source also said a weaker yen would have a "favorable impact" on the domestic economy. In Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 113.23 yen at 10:30 A.M., down 0.04 yen from the previous day's close of 113.27 yen, but up 0.67 yen from its opening rate of 112.56 yen. The dollar's fall at the outset of trading reflected growing concern over its rapid rise against the yen in recent trading and profit-taking selling, traders said. Many dealers believe, however, that the U.S. currency will resume its upward pace against the yen in view of a wide gap of economic fundamentals between Japan and the United States. The source said, "I hope to see the dollar appreciate to about 115 yen as soon as possible." "I suppose steelmakers are pleased (with the dollar's rise). They would be at a loss if the dollar fell below 110 yen," the source said. The government source's remarks sparked renewed buying of dollars in interbank Tokyo trading Wednesday morning. A dealer at a major commercial bank said, "The dollar will gain upward momentum to break through the 115 yen line if the U.S. monetary authorities clarify their stance of tolerating a weaker yen."
