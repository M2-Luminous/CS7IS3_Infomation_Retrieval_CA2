FBIS4-58693 "drnes088_j_94029" FBIS-NES-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Fighting Continues; Airport Bombed; Calls for Peace Made Fighting Continues; Airport Bombed; Calls for Peace Made Spokesman Denies Aden Power Station Raided JN0605062194 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0330 GMT 6 May 94 JN0605062194 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement by military "source"] [Text] A military source at the Defense Ministry and the General Staff Command has stressed that since they were established -- and with the growth in their structure, resources, and abilities -- the Armed Forces and security units have remained a power owned by the people and following the will of the people and their legitimate, Constitutional, legitimate institutions in order to fulfill all their sacred national missions. They are the protector and guardian of the people, their security, stability, and their sovereignty, and the first power concerned with preserving all national, developmental, and democratic achievements and gains. They are also the people's tool that will strike with an iron fist against anyone who may be tempted to encroach on any of these gains and achievements. Therefore, we warn against any malicious and base foolish act and any criminal, adventurous act that may seek to commit such ugly crimes, even under the pretext of fabricating exposed media lies. We refer, in particular, to the statement broadcast yesterday over Aden radio, which is still under the control of the secessionist, rebellious gang in the Socialist Party leadership. The statement falsely claimed that our valiant air forces -- the protector of the skies of the dear Yemeni homeland and its blessed ground -- yesterday attacked the thermal power station in Aden, as well as other selected targets, such as the radio and television stations, and other vital and strategic installations that belong to the people and are a source of fortune and public interest and which should be protected by every Yemeni individual. But, what can we say to those who do not differentiate between their rancorous lies, their crimes against the people and the people's achievements, and their own sick aspirations? Our people must know the truth about what may have happened to these installations at the hands of the malicious people themselves in their drive toward the abyss of fabricating excuses to commit crimes of sabotage, destruction, and damage. The falsehood, lies, and deceptive claims contained in that statement are not worthy of any consideration or response on our part. This will be confirmed by facts and evidence about other lies and deceptive claims.
