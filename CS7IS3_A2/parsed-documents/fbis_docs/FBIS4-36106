He said Egypt supports international and Arab legitimacy in this and other issues. In an interview with the Tunisian newspaper AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM today, Musa said fear of Arabizing or internationalizing the Yemeni crisis should not be a justification for the Arabs to sit with their hands tied without working to stem the bloodshed in fraternal Yemen. He added that the fear of Arabizing the crisis is not a justification for an indifferent stand which some are asking us to adopt and leave the brothers fight each other. He went on: We had feared Arabizing and internationalizing the crisis in the Gulf and are now doing the same thing as if we are invited to let Arab blood spill all the time. [passage omitted] On the $275-billion African debts, Musa emphasized the need to repay them according to schedules leading to the revival of African economies. He urged the industrial nations to set an annual percentage to help development processes in African states reach the international target figure of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product. He noted that this percentage barely reaches 0.3 despite these countries' pledges in various international forums. The foreign minister said Egypt has put forth several proposals to the OAU, including one on the need to adopt specific measures urging the international community to help resolve the African debt problem.
