FBIS4-47611 "cr00000025994001" 6 May 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-063--JAPAN JAPAN: SPOTLIGHT ON JAPAN ASSOCIATION FOR TRADE WITH RUSSIA AND JAPAN: SPOTLIGHT ON JAPAN ASSOCIATION FOR TRADE WITH RUSSIA AND CENTRAL-EASTERN EUROPE The Japan Association for Trade with Russia and Central-Eastern Europe, an industry association consisting primarily of Japan's large general trading companies (GTCs), acts under the supervision of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to promote trade with the countries of the former Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the former communist nations of Europe. Much of its focus has been on overcoming obstacles to technology trade and competing against the United States and Europe to develop ties to the Russian Far East. The association, as part of its goal of promoting technology exchange, is helping MITI's policy of offering Russia defense conversion aid and other technical cooperation. Association Overview The Japan Association for Trade with Russia and Central-Eastern Europe (Roshia Too Boekikai), an industry association (shadan hojin) of over 90 companies, promotes trade and technology exchange with the countries of the former Soviet empire. According to the latest edition of an annual guide to MITI's public corporations (TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENRAN 1994 Mar 94), the association gathers and disseminates information on technology, hosts and participates in trade fairs, sends and receives survey missions, helps resolve trade problems, and provides the Japanese Government and business circles with advice on promoting trade. MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau oversees the organization's activities. The association consists primarily of large GTCs (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 8 Feb 93). Smaller firms are grouped in the Japan-Russia Trade Association (Nichiro Boeki Kyokai), another organization under the same MITI bureau (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 5 Sep 92). The association has enjoyed close connections to MITI and the business community in its nearly nearly 30 years of operation. In 1967, Kogoro Uemura, then chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren, another association under MITI's supervision), and some 20 other business leaders established the association to promote trade and technology exchange with the Soviet bloc (ASAHI SHIMBUN 3 Feb 87). In August 1970, MITI granted the association, then known as the Japan Association for Trade with Soviet Union and Central-Eastern Europe (Soren Too Boekikai), the status of industry association (shadan hojin) (TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENRAN 1994 Mar 94). The association's leadership lineup reveals its close ties to major Japanese companies. The association's chairman, Toshikuni Yahiro, a former chairman of and current advisor to the GTC Mitsui & Co., assumed his post during the 1987 "COCOM shock" that followed the revelation that Toshiba Machine Co. had exported machine tools to the Soviet Union against Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) regulations (HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN 5 Sep 92, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 19 Jul 87). Yahiro has also served as a deputy chairman of Keidanren and chaired both the trade subcommittee of the former Japan-East Germany Economic Committee and the Japan-Poland Economic Committee (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 Nov, 9 Aug 89, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 19 Jul 87). The association's four deputy chairmen also hold top positions in major companies: Takeshi Eguchi is vice chairman at the GTC Mitsubishi Corp.; Hiroo Kinoshita is a managing director at the GTC Sumitomo Corp.; Tadashi Suzuki is a vice president of the electronics giant NEC; and Yoshiro Sasaki is a former managing director of Nippon Steel Corp. (TOYO KEIZAI YAKUIN SHIKIHO 1994 and 1989). Keeping MITI, Companies Informed The association has, from the start, provided the Japanese Government and business community with information on technology and other developments. In April 1989, the association recast and expanded its research department (chosabu) as the Soviet Union and Central-Eastern Europe Economic Institute (Soren Too Keizai Kenkyusho). Hisao Kanemori, an experienced Soviet hand who had headed the Japan Center for Economic Research, became its chairman. Kazuo Ogawa, a former Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) researcher who was serving as the association's managing director and research director, became Kanemori's deputy. MITI launched the new institute, Japan's first to focus on the Soviet bloc economies, to gather primary information as a remedy to Japan's tendency to rely on secondary reports from the United States and Europe. MITI then increased its annual research subsidy to the association from 45 million yen to 80 million yen (approximately $450,000 to $800,000 at current exchange rates). MITI created the institute, which began with 16 staff members and was slated to grow to 50, as its "information center" on the Soviet bloc (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 19 Feb, 20 Mar 89, 4 Dec, 23 Jun 88, NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 5 Apr 89, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 5 Apr 89, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 26 Jun 88). Seeking To Protect Technology Flow, Develop Ties to Far East The association has sought to protect Japanese technology exchange and trade with the former Soviet bloc and its successor nations against the fallout of the Toshiba incident and other pressures. For example, Chairman Yahiro asserted soon after assuming office in 1987 that he had heard from traders that many U.S. products were entering the Soviet bloc via third countries and that it was "natural" for trading companies to overcome differences between East and West to "cooperate" (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 13 Jul 87). In an interview one month later, he rejected the argument that it was "outrageous" for Japanese GTCs to trade with communist countries, admonished Japanese companies to refrain from "pulling each other down" to the benefit of the United States, and warned that a single-minded focus on security could impede "free trade" (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 9 Aug 87). The association has also focused much of its attention on promoting Japanese ties to the Russian Far East. Managing Director Kazuo Ogawa called the region the "final frontier" in a business forum last year (HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN 21 Apr 93). At times, association leaders have cast their arguments in terms of competition with the United States and Europe. Ogawa warned an audience at a regional forum in 1991 that Japan was facing a threat from the United States and southeast Asian nations to its monopolistic position in trade with the Russian Far East (HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN 4 Sep 91). He had earlier warned that Japan's response to Soviet perestroika was "way behind" that of the United States (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 Jun 88). Chairman Yahiro, for his part, has spoken of Japan's "obligation" to develop Siberia east of Lake Baikal, a region "far from Europe" where European nations would not be able to extend their influence (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 5 Sep 92, HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN 5 Sep 92). His view of the region is mirrored in that of the NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN (29 Jan 93), which has described the Russian Far East as an area "with longstanding close ties to Japan and where aid from the West has tended to be late in coming." The association is also disseminating information on the region to Japanese officials and businessmen. The organization, cooperating with a local think tank in Hokkaido and the economic research institute of the Russian Academy of Science's Far East Division, published in April 1993 the "Russian Far East Databook," Japan's first compendium of industrial production and other economic information on the region (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 Apr 93). The 1994 edition was published in April (HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN 15 Apr 94). Participating in MITI's Defense Conversion Program The association has been assisting MITI with devising a program to promote conversion of Russian military technology and production facilities to civilian use. Association members have accompanied MITI officials on surveys of Russian military facilities. Takashi Murakami, research section chief of the association's economic research institute, and institute researcher Kaoru Sakurai accompanied an official from MITI's Aircraft and Ordinance Division on a tour from 23 to 30 October 1992 of five Russian shipyards, aircraft factories, and other military facilities in the region of Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and Komsomolsk. The survey mission also included aerospace and shipbuilding executives from Japan's leading defense companies (TSUSAN KOHO 4 Nov 92). According to NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (23 Oct 92), the mission was effectively the beginning of MITI's Conversion Model Factory program to promote defense conversion. The association had previously joined MITI in a joint defense conversion survey of the Soviet Union in July 1991. Eiichi Nakao, then MITI minister, passed the resulting survey report to his Soviet counterpart during his visit to Moscow in October 1991. The survey report, which included a call for separating companies from the defense-industrial complex, was reportedly the first defense conversion proposal Moscow had received from a G-7 nation (HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN 21 Oct 91). The association has also assisted MITI's defense conversion program by participating in seminars. NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (18 May 92) announced that the association was joining JETRO in a MITI industrial policy seminar featuring defense conversion. Attendees for the seminar, scheduled for 25-26 May in Austria, were to be government officials and legislators from Russia and Eastern Europe. NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (12 Jan 92) had earlier announced a similar seminar scheduled for February 1992 in Vladivostok. Other Technical Cooperation The association has also been active assisting MITI's initiative to offer technical aid to Russian small and medium enterprises. The organization is serving as the ministry's intermediary in providing machinery for technical training and research in marine products processing, metalworking, and four other fields. In March 1994, for example, the association helped Taiyo, a manufacturer of marine products processing equipment, export 58 million yen (approximately $580,000) worth of its equipment to a national-level marine sciences university in Vladivostok (HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN 9 Mar 94). The association also arranged that month to send technicians from the Niigata Prefectural Industrial Technology Center and four of the prefecture's local companies to Vladivostok to offer "technical guidance" to a factory attached to a technical institute there. Among the four companies was the prominent machine tool company Mori Seiki (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 9 Mar 94). The association is also working with Japan's Small Business National Corporation and local governments to train Russian technicians from small and medium enterprises in Russia and Japan (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 16 Nov 93).
