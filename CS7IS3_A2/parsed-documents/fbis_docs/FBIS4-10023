In an annual report on worldwide drug production and trafficking, the U.S. Government corroborates that Cuban authorities continue placing top priority on their anti-drug policy, and it also indicates that Cuba cooperated with the Unites States in this area in 1993. According to Washington's opinion on how the nations of the world are meeting the commitments made at the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the report contends Cuba is engaged in a struggle against drugs, despite the island's problems of fuel shortages and the lack of spare parts, all of which limit Cuba's capacity to combat drugs. Cuba is a signatory of the UN convention on this issue and has signed bilateral agreements with many nations in the region to fight the scourge of drug trafficking. Also, in 1988 it declared its willingness to sign an agreement of this type with the United States, an offer which up until now has been ignored by Washington. Cuban cooperation in this struggle includes the interception of planes and ships in its airspace and territorial waters as well as supplying information to U.S. services in charge of confronting this problem. The United States is the world's largest drug consumer, and the report admits that although cocaine continues to be the main threat to U.S. drug users, the danger of the use of heroine is growing at an alarming rate.
