The reason was to deliver to him a sharp protest in connection with the stances contained in the 31 May statement by the German Foreign Ministry concerning talks between the German State Minister Helmut Schaefer and Ibrahim Rugova, who was presented as "the most senior freely elected representative of the majority Albanian population in Kosovo." The statement of the German Foreign Ministry contains "false information and an unacceptable assessment of Serbian policy in Kosovo-Metohija, and sets out the positive assessments of the German Government on Rugova's separatist movement," the demarche notes. The Yugoslav protest stressed that the stances contained in the German Foreign Ministry statement "support in the most direct way the separatism of the leader of the Albanian national minority and are an impermissible interference in the internal affairs of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]." These stances are in contravention of the principles of the UN charter and the Final Act of the CSCE, the statement noted.
