If will alone could determine the outcome of the election, Paavo Vayrynen would become president. Vayrynen is trying to get to Mantyniemi with frightening fervor. He is trying to force a misguided nation to see matters his way. He exhorts people to read books written by him; that is the only way to find out the truth about Vayrynen and his political platform. At least, the books disclose a master in the art of nagging. Who would know Paavo Vayrynen but Paavo Vayrynen himself? As a matter of fact, he appears to feel that he is the only one who really understands Paavo Vayrynen and knows how to evaluate him correctly. The large majority of citizens fear and detest a completely wrong image of Vayrynen, a Vayrynen who is the creation of baleful publicity, a Vayrynen that does not even exist--in Vayrynen's mind. The real Vayrynen can be found in paid ads and in books written by Vayrynen. "In my own view, I am just an ordinary Finnish man. I am certainly not a saint, nor have I attempted to appear as one. I use alcohol the same way as everyone else within the same sphere of culture and customs: politicians, business leaders, civil servants, and editors. Almost everyone who uses alcohol sometimes drinks a little too much. And most Finns use alcohol. But I have not pinched any female flight attendants." For an ordinary man, Vayrynen has extraordinarily much to explain. Vayrynen must shovel through almost 1,500 pages of sludge in order to unearth the real Vayrynen, the fighter, the philosopher, and the patriot, whose pure and lofty ideals have been dragged through the dirt, and whose character has been distorted. So what kind of person is the man on whose head nasty publicity has pulled transmogrifying pantyhose, as on a robber? He is choleric. Vayrynen identified his character type as soon as he had read O. Hallesby's book, Human Character Traits in the Light of the Bible. According to Hallesby, individuals of the choleric type are strong-willed, determined, energetic, practical leaders, and possess common sense. "It is just as if obstacles would double such a person's intelligence and energy. His being is then certainly suffused by something tense and hard, but he is never heard to complain. There is a refreshing and spirited air about such a choleric person, something healthy and strong." However, a spirited choleric also has some bad traits. He is hard, power-hungry, vengeful, proud, and bursting with self-confidence. Vayrynen denies being vengeful. "I am certainly hard when it is required, but my nature is still sensitive--even unusually sensitive.... After reading Hallesby's book, I have tried to train myself," he said . Vayrynen cannot tell when he decided to become a politician. "It is as if the positions and the tasks appeared by themselves. The road chose me," he explained. The wretched road has had a tough time with its choice. One feels sorry for the road, as it could have chosen a much more enjoyable traveling companion. Vayrynen alone can fill hundreds and hundreds of blank sheets of paper without once erupting in relieved laughter. Smoke and Fire Vayrynen exhibits some kind of wry humor when he describes the election campaign in which he was involved in Lapland during the 1980's. He finally decided also to capture the votes of the athletic public and participated in a 75 km cross-country skiing event, with his own election number pinned to his chest. The number was in the sequence allotted to competitive skiers, but Vayrynen bravely endured all the jeers, as he expected to get his picture in the newspaper. Unfortunately, the reporter at the scene supported another candidate, and Vayrynen did not receive the expected reward. Even the most curmudgeonly sprouting Finnish statesman sometimes lets loose among friends and acquaintances, and, for a few hours, forgets his political machinations, relaxes, and enjoys life. Vayrynen also speaks about his friends, but he appears mainly to use them as guinea pigs for his political plans. Interaction seems to be as enjoyable as loading a rifle. As foreign minister, Vayrynen entertained international guests, and, for example, acted as host for his Soviet colleague, Andrey Kozyrev, whom he took to Lapland for some skiing and relaxation. It is certain that his colleague had a good time, as "in front of the fireplace, after supper, among other things, I entertained Kozyrev with a detailed account of Finland's history." Germany's foreign minister and his wife were also the objects of Vayrynen's skiing diplomacy. As Vayrynen and guests were having supper in a lean-to built by the Finnish Border Guard, the wind changed direction and everyone was choked by the smoke. "In the future, we must avoid this kind of hospitality," writes Vayrynen. Predators and Carrion Birds Professional advertising people have tried to explain to Vayrynen that his best election weapon is his family: his wife Vuokko, and his three children, Tiinaliisa, 24, Taneli, 20, and Lotta, 16. "I am not going to play this game. My children have a right to privacy. Vuokko participates in a manner appropriate in Finland, with dignity," said Vayrynen. Vayrynen really does not seem to need to create a political profile based on his role as a father and husband. He conscientiously lists the misfortunes encountered by his family. The house burned down with all the family's possessions. The baby died, and his wife's life was also in danger. Lotta broke her leg. His mother died. The brief glimpses from his private life drown in the endless ocean of political setbacks and misunderstandings, and ever-surging plans and hopes. Vayrynen suffers, becomes disappointed, his wings touch the ground, depression creeps up, but he does not give up. He has learned that "even in politics, the laws of the jungle apply." "If others think that you are weak, they'll attack you. At least the predators will move in on you. If you appear sufficiently vulnerable, you will end up being devoured by carrion birds," he notes. A proud choleric person would naturally not deign to become eaten by ravens. Being the quarry of larger predators is, at least, something to be proud about, but Vayrynen seems to be the victim of bad luck. The sky may darken with carrion birds, but good predators are few and far between. But, so far, there have been enough of them in Vayrynen's immediate neighborhood that he can always find opponents larger than he. An irresistible force pulls Vayrynen to the top, and he spares no effort in his quest for the original source of power. When, after having received a flying start in politics while still in his early twenties, Paavo Vayrynen had become disappointed with Ahti Karjalainen, who was clearly his senior and much more experienced, he decided to establish contact with President Urho Kekkonen. The connection was established. Advice and Criticism Kekkonen felt that Karjalainen was threatening his position and took Vayrynen under his wings. Vayrynen became a "teacher's pet" foreign minister and even received written instructions on how to act from the president. "During the next two to three years (they are the hardest), try to act as if you were 10 years older. Walk deliberately, with care. Sometimes speak slowly, as the Foreign Ministry is an institution steeped in old customs. Dress with careful attention to style. I have a bad habit of keeping my hands in my pockets. I noted during the trip to the USSR that you too have the same problem. Once I observed you saying to good-bye to a fairly prominent representative of our hosts by shaking his hand while keeping your other hand in your trouser pocket. ``Now is the time for you to stay out of the limelight. Your position demands a certain kind of publicity, but you should let others worry about domestic matters. You have your hands full with your primary duties.'' But Vayrynen, filled with his new importance, did not have the patience to wait. Kekkonen became angry and sent a critical card. Vayrynen quickly regretted his disobedience and sent a letter. "I got your message last night when I called my wife. And it saddened me," he writes. In his letter of atonement, Vayrynen whines over his difficulties and asks for understanding. At the end, he gathers up his courage and asks for more advice! The still somewhat respectful disciple continues to write to Kekkonen. The relentless challenger, who has experienced disappointment in his many political hopes, also writes to Kekkonen's successor, Mauno Koivisto. "My life in Mauno Koivisto's Finland has not been easy," complains Vayrynen. Distress and Defiance Time after time, Vayrynen bombarded Koivisto with letters; he complained, ordered, advised, begged, corrected, whined for sympathy, and wondered about the poor relationship. Even Vayrynen's acquaintances were puzzled with the manic letter writing, which Vayrynen unveils in his books. For instance, on Finnish independence day in 1990, Vayrynen approached the president. He started by saying: "Again, I spend my Independence Day writing you a letter." Vayrynen had returned from Iraq, where a few Finns were kept hostage. Ulf Sundqvist, Vayrynen's traveling companion, had visited the presidential palace; Vayrynen had not. He felt that he had been given the cold shoulder. "I exposed myself to great risks and suffered through a difficult journey in order to serve my country. I assumed that my troubles would, at least, be rewarded by gratitude from the leader of the state. This was not the case. You did not even want to see me, and instead, demonstrated your point by inviting only my traveling companion. In addition, I was distressed when I heard that during my trip, you had criticized me on at least two different occasions. ``I intend to continue my political career. If I can attract enough support, I intend to occupy some central political position. In my view, I do not exaggerate if I say that it is not in the country's best interest if we are unable to cooperate on a practical level. I believe that I have done my fair share in achieving this objective. And I intend to continue in the same vein. But at the same time, I hope to receive some kind of reciprocity from you.'' The letter was not written by a jilted lover, but by a man who at his own initiative was conducting a one-sided correspondence with the president, and who, at the time when the letter was written, was hardly anything but a rank-and-file Eduskunta representative, and whose trip was certainly not the president's idea. "In Mauno Koivisto's Finland, my greatest problem has been my personal relationship with the president," worries Vayrynen. President Mauno Koivisto has been all too conscious of his position, to succumb to becoming the executor of Vayrynen's wishes. Of course, such a relationship constitutes a problem for both parties, as one person has the power and the other one the hunger for it. Dreams and Disappointments To Vayrynen's disappointment, Prime Minister Esko Aho also has proven himself to be difficult. After all, he was not satisfied with the crumbs from Vayrynen's table. He became "Koivisto's faithful factotum," and Vayrynen suspects that he has his aim on the presidency. It was probably disconcerting for Vayrynen to discover that he has ended up in a similar position as that into which, in the past, he drove Ahti Karjalainen. The acolyte tries to surpass his master and obeys reluctantly--if at all. In the presidential elections, Vayrynen has chosen Martti Ahtisaari as his primary opponent. Vayrynen has also tried to challenge heavier fighters and has never stayed in his own weight class. Popularity polls do not look too promising for Vayrynen. Mantyniemi seems to remain a dream. Vayrynen may end up writing letters to his third president, unless we can find something else for him to do. During the last years, Vayrynen has been so busy developing his thoughts and ideas on the economy that we should perhaps offer him as a traveling consultant to, for example, Russia, which has gotten its economy into an even greater mess than spunky little Finland has. In any case, Finland is an all too insignificant forum for the son of the vegetable grower from Keminmaa who in his own mind has the formula for the salvation of all of mankind.
