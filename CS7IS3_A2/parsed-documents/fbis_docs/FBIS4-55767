Addressing an FKGP rally at Soltvadkert, southern Hungary, Torgyan said that his party, which won almost 9 percent of votes in the first round of the parliamentary elections and thus remained a parliamentary party, has clearly demonstrated that it is the only legitimate smallholder party which is accepted by the Hungarian people. Torgyan qualified the outcome of the first round, the great rout by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), as a tragic development. In his view, "after four and a half decades of communist rule, four years were enough for the Hungarian nation to vote communism back in voluntarily." Torgyan said that although the MSZP leaders do not seem to seek the restoration of communism, the party carries a mass of dead-weight, 99 percent of which came from the former state party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. The FKGP chairman pressed for every possible step to be made to prevent the MSZP's further strengthening. "Since the nation has not time to wait for four years and put its hope in changes, the Smallholders offer their support for the winners if they truly act in the interest of the Hungarian people. However, should the winners worsen the fate of the people, who already carry unbearable burdens, the FKGP will become a tough opposition," Torgyan said.
