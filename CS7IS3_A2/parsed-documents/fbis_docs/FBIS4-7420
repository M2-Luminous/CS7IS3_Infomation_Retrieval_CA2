FBIS4-7420 "dreas083_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 South Korea DP `Boycotted' Session DP `Boycotted' Session SK2904113794 Seoul YONHAP in English 1129 GMT 29 Apr 94 SK2904113794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly approved the president's selection of Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok as new prime minister Friday evening. In a plenary session attended only by ruling Democratic Liberal Party members and a small number of independents, 170 solons voted for Yi's appointment and 10 others against. The opposition Democratic Party [DP] boycotted the session, reasoning that they couldn't accept the floor act only on the nomination of a new prime minister without dealing with the issue of witnesses and references with regard to the Sangmudae scandal. In a party decision, most of the DP lawmakers stood away from the session while a few solons including Cho Hong-kyu and Chang Ki-uk strode into the hall and urged the speaker to stop taking the vote. But, they did not mount any physical harassment. Prior to the 6:10 P.M. session, the speaker arranged a last- minute bipartisan floor leaders meeting. However, they failed to reach any accord. The ruling party suggested that the issue of whether to adopt 20 undecided people out of the 50 witnesses and references produced by the opposition party be discussed later when the need of their testimonies arises. The opposition party, on the other hand, wanted that the issue of the 20 people should be expressly settled forthwith without any further delay. With the parliamentary endorsement of Yi Yong-tok's selection as new prime minister, the 167th extraordinary session of the National Assembly, whose legal period had been extended by four days, came to a close.
