Shortly before midnight, however, an annoyed Klaus Kinkel had to announce the breakdown of the unsuccessful talks. His colleagues had worked on a compromise proposal on the fish issue in long, tough negotiations with the Norwegians. The Spaniards were to be given higher catch quotas in the future. But Madrid was unyielding. [Begin recording] [Kinkel] The failure to resolve the fish issue is Spain's responsibility, and to a lesser extent Portugal's, but basically Spain's. We had put together a package -- the presidency, the Commission, and the Europeans, we Germans in particular -- we negotiated the issue bilaterally with Norway. The package didn't go far enough for the Spaniards. Great Britain was mainly responsible for the failure to reach agreement on majorities as it saw no possibility for agreement. [Unidentified correspondent] Over the last few weeks the impression has arisen that the Spaniards are resisting Norway's membership in principle. Do you think this impression is justified? [Kinkel] No, I don't think this impression is justified. The Spaniards want Norway to join. They have their internal problems with the fish issue -- we have to understand that. On the other hand, I didn't really understand today why they had to exhaust this issue in such detail. In my opinion a solution should have been possible. No, Spain wants them to join but it will get a bit more difficult now. And Spain has to move now. [end recording]
