FR941021-0-00155 FR941021-0-00022 39. First, consistent with our paramount objective of securing early implementation of these satellite services, we shall adopt a rule, consistent with our proposal in the Notice, that will enable applicants who can now demonstrate their financial qualifications to receive priority in obtaining license grants. Thus, any applicant who can submit a complete, amended application on or before November 16, 1994, and demonstrates financial capability under the standards set forth in the rule adopted in this proceeding, will be processed immediately. Assuming sufficient spectrum is available to award licenses to all such financially and otherwise qualified applicants, we will grant licenses to these applicants. Given the national and other public interest benefits of ensuring the United States' global leadership in providing these important new satellite services, we also plan to process these applications on an expedited basis, with action anticipated by January 31, 1995. Making these grants promptly will enable such fully qualified applicants to begin immediately the time-consuming process of satellite construction, thereby significantly assisting in United States' efforts to complete the international coordination process and achieving our statutory and public interest objective of bringing new and innovative services to the public at the earliest possible time. 40. We also wish, however, to accord some processing priority to other applicants in this group who may need more time to establish their financial qualifications, and who have all devoted significant time, effort and resources towards establishing the Big LEO service both domestically, in the Negotiated Rulemaking, and internationally. For example, until feeder link frequencies can be assigned to a particular system, which will not likely occur until after the next World Radio Conference to be held in November 1995 (WRC&hyph;95), it may be difficult for some of these applicants to finalize financial arrangements for their systems. Consequently, in an effort to afford an additional opportunity for entry by such applicants, we will allow applicants who cannot meet our financial qualifications requirement at this time an additional period of time to establish their qualifications. Specifically, we will require these applicants to file amended applications by November 16, 1994 to ensure their continued consideration, but we will allow them until January 31, 1996_two months after the completion of WRC&hyph;95_to demonstrate compliance with the financial standard adopted today. 41. Under our two-tiered eligibility rule, applicants who make a decision to defer their financial showing until January, 1996, will not jeopardize their status in the current processing group. Specifically, new applications for Big LEO systems will not be considered until after action on the six pending applications is completed. Nevertheless, such applicants will not be accorded the same processing priority as those applicants who are willing and able to demonstrate their financial qualifications far sooner, by November 16, 1994, and whose expeditious grants will better enable us to achieve early and successful international coordination and implementation of this service. Because the spectrum sharing plan we adopt today accommodates up to five systems, 51 we also recognize that applicants choosing not to make a financial showing until January 1996, may find their applications are mutually exclusive situations. Nevertheless, we believe a very significant likelihood exists that our financial eligibility rule will result in more of these applicants obtaining grants and that, in the intervening time frame until January 1996, events may occur that avoid mutual exclusivity altogether. 51 See paras. 44&hyph;45, infra. 42. If it turns out that all six applicants are able to establish their financial qualifications by the November 16, 1994 deadline for amended applications, or alternatively, that all six applicants defer their financial showings until January 1996 and all are then deemed financially qualified, we will implement the auction procedure described below, paras. 88&hyph;97, to award licenses. If, however, some grants have been made prior to January 1996, and a mutually exclusive situation arises then, the auction procedure outlined below cannot be used. However, given the uncertainty that such a situation will ever arise, we will not at this time decide how to process any such remaining mutually exclusive applications. Presumably, however, such grants would be awarded through an auction mechanism that is appropriate in the circumstances. We have decided, however, to defer any final decision on that issue at this time. 2. Spectrum Sharing Plan
