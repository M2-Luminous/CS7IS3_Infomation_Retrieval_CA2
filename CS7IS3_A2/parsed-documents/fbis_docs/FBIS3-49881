But this week was marked by the visit of Bill Clinton, and we simply cannot ignore this fact. [Havel] I think we cannot. I would like to make perhaps two or three minor observations in relation to this visit. As far as the substance is concerned, meaning the future European security arrangement, the political arrangement and the Partnership for Peace plan, I would not touch on it too much anymore. A lot was said about it. I would make only one observation. Voices are often heard that this is not enough, that it is only a form of pacifying us, calming us down, of delaying NATO membership and that the right thing would be to accept us immediately. I think these are quite short-sighted voices because few people are aware that all this places some demands on us. [passage omitted] For example, the Partnership for Peace plan means that our soldiers may have to go fight somewhere occasionally. It means that foreign troops could be here for certain joint exercises. It is difficult to know how the public will react to this. It will also cost some money. It will require making certain psychological, moral, and also material investments. It remains to be seen to what extent our society, our public is ready for it. It seems to me that it is a very well balanced plan, and we should not forget this side of it. On the degree of our capability to take over this common responsibility for Europe, that will primarily depend on how really and fully we are going to be able to be integrated in such structures as NATO. [Hulkova] When I think of Bill Clinton, it seems to me that compared with other U.S. Presidents he is playing a special and important role. [passage omitted] What kind of man is he? What are his qualities as a statesman? How does he measure up as the U.S. President? After all, this is the most important political post in the world. [Havel] [passage omitted] My impression was that he was an unusually responsible, sincere, direct, and open man. Although on television, especially during the election campaign, he may appear as a continually smiling television star aware of being surrounded by cameras, I have arrived at the conclusion that he is a sincere man. He is really like that. He is a very frank man who wants to know everything. [passage omitted] He is a very direct man who likes to meet people, and who likes to listen to them. [passage omitted] All this makes me like him. At the same time it does not mean that he is not a professional. He always finds time to read books on politics, history, the future, and other books. In the White House he is surrounded by a large number of intellectuals and scientists. He is a man who likes to think and who is attempting to see matters in a long term perspective. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] Let's recall another aspect of Bill Clinton's visit to our country. It has been apparent for some time that the Visegrad countries [Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary] find themselves at a crossroads and that they do not know how to continue. Have all the negotiations that took place provided some kind of an indication of what should happen next? [Havel] The cooperation between the four was surrounded by an endless number of various speculations, conjectures, and analyses that appeared both in our and foreign press. I think -- and I have said this on many occasions -- that we are in fact living in a different time now, that the original purpose of the group has been exhausted and fulfilled, as it were, and that the era of grand joint declarations, manifestos, and summits, by which we were demonstrating our indestructible unity, has passed. We had to do this at the time when we were jointly trying to extricate ourselves from Soviet hegemony. That's clear and it has been said on a number of occasions. I think, however, that the other half of the truth should be voiced, too. The truth is that we will be living side by side with our neighbors for centuries to come, and this is more important than whether our opinions are closer to a particular government or to a particular president of a neighboring country. We must bear the long term perspective in mind. We must be aware of the fact that almost 60 percent of our exports are in fact exports to neighboring countries. [passage omitted] What is at issue now is finding a new identity and a new form of this regional cooperation that will be in keeping with the present time. The fact is that at the present time, when the interests of individual countries are beginning to differentiate, when differences in the historical identity of these countries are coming to the surface, it is becoming clear that things are slightly different in this period than they were in the initial phase. Thus, cooperation will have to have a different form. It will have to be less manifest. It will have to be a specific cooperation in various spheres, in the spheres where a common minimum of joint interests exists, as our foreign minister puts it. I would like to add to this that we should hold talks even in the spheres where there is a divergence of interests or where our interests differ or where differences exist. We should conduct a lasting political dialogue. Certain differences between individual countries, which are gradually beginning to emerge, are not a reason for terminating the dialogue. On the contrary, these differences should lead to stepping up the dialogue. I became aware of this during a presidential dinner, when four presidents of the countries of this group had a very interesting, professional, and long debate. It was dominated by a discussion between President Walesa and President Goncz, whose views were quite different. I then realized how important this type of discussion is. [passage omitted] This contributes to the cleansing of regional climate, which is very important. My impression is that this meeting, this joint meeting with President Clinton, contributed to our more intensive thinking about new forms, new shapes, and new identities of this regional cooperation in Central Europe. Voices appeared reproaching the United States for forcing us too strongly into coordination or joint conduct and for not paying enough attention to the fact that we are independent states and that each of us is in a slightly different situation. Although they may well have a point, I would also like to point out that the United States has the experience of the 1,000-year-long hostility between France and Germany. Thousands of disputes came to an end after World War II when West European integration started to form itself. It was the United States that to a considerable extent contributed to this integration under the Marshall Plan. [passage omitted] To a certain extent perhaps, the United States applies or reflects this experience to Central Europe. I think that this aspect is also noteworthy. [Hulkova] Mr. President, perhaps it could be said that your considerations are aimed at a meeting in Litomysl where you will meet representatives of not only the Visegrad countries but also representatives of Germany, Austria, and Slovenia. [Havel] Reports about this meeting have already appeared in newspapers. It might be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue. Recently I, our prime minister, and our foreign minister agreed that we felt that Austria and Slovenia were also an integral part of Central Europe. [passage omitted] Last year, when attending the opening of the Salzburg Festival, we had a meeting with President Goncz, [Austrian President Thomas] Klestil and President von Weizsaecker. The talks we had were very interesting. There was also a big television discussion. We agreed to meet from time to time and also to invite those who were absent; in other words the Slovak and Polish presidents. [passage omitted] It was my idea that we could meet in Litomysl. It was in Salzburg that I invited them to visit the Czech Republic. All of them agreed. [passage omitted] It would be an unofficial meeting. The purpose of this meeting would not be to conclude treaties and agreements and issue declarations. Nothing of the sort. Its purpose would be to contribute to a good regional climate and create a psychologically favorable atmosphere or scope that would make it possible for our executive bodies -- the governments -- to carry out their work.
