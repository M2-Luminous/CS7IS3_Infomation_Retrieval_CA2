The premier believes that an unlimited amount of time can be spent finding out who of the opposing sides "is to blame or not to blame" in the escalation of the conflict in the Balkans," and whether attacks of American planes on positions of the Bosnian Serbs in the region of Gorazde have been coordinated or not. But it is absolutely clear that in the world "there are forces who need all this and whose ambitions are the reason why this all happens." Chernomyrdin noted that Russia's position remains the same: "an immediate end of bloodshed without the use of force." Otherwise, he thinks, sanctions against Yugoslavia "will not be lifted," although "the people who are reaping all these fruits of political intrigues have nothing to do with this." The premier is convinced that the sanctions imposed by the UN will not be lifted "not because Russia wants or does not want this," but because the countries neighboring to Yugoslavia "will not let cargoes of any of the warring sides through their territories in order not to fan the Balkan fire, and they will be right to do so."
