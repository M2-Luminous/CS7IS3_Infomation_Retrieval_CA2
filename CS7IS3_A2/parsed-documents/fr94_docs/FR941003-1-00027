FR941003-1-00027 FR941003-1-00003 Section 1.641 currently indicates that an administrative patent judge who, during the pendency of an interference, becomes aware of a reason why a claim designated to correspond to a count may not be patentable should notify the parties of the reason and set a time within which each party may present its views, which the administrative patent judge will consider in determining how the interference shall proceed. It is proposed to amend §1.641 to indicate that a party's views may include argument or appropriate preliminary motions under §1.633(c), (d) and (h), including any supporting evidence. In §1.643, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) for clarification and also to change ``ends of justice'' to ``interest of justice'' to be consistent with the language used in other interference rules, including §§1.628(a) and 1.687(c). In §1.644, it is proposed to simplify paragraph (a) by changing ``a panel consisting of more than one examiner-in-chief'' to ``the Board.'' Paragraphs (a)(1), (b) and (c) are proposed to be amended by changing both occurrences of ``panel'' to ``Board.'' Paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) are proposed to be changed to provide that a petition seeking to invoke the supervisory authority of the Commissioner shall not be filed prior to the party's brief for final hearing; these paragraphs currently provide that such a petition shall not be filed prior to a decision of the Board awarding judgment. Paragraph (b) of §1.644 is proposed to be clarified by amending it to state that a petition under §1.644(a) shall be considered timely if it is made as part of, or simultaneously with, a proper motion under §1.633, 1.634, or 1.635 when granting the motion would require waiver of a rule. In other words, a petition under §1.644(a)(2) must seek waiver of a rule prospectively rather than retroactively. Paragragh (d) of §1.644 is proposed to be amended to provide that the statement of facts in a petition preferably should be in numbered paragraphs and also to delete the second sentence as unnecessary. Paragraph (f) is proposed to be amended to change the ``15 days'' in which to request reconsideration of a decision by the Commissioner to ``14 days.'' In paragraph (g), it is proposed to delete the quotation marks around ``Express Mail.'' Section 1.645, which in its current form permits consideration of a belatedly filed paper only if accompanied by a motion under §1.635 which shows sufficient cause (§1.645(b)) why the paper was not timely filed, is proposed to be amended in several respects. First, it is proposed to change ``sufficient cause'' to ``good cause'' in order to use a single ``cause'' standard throughout the interference rules. Second, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) to permit consideration of a belatedly filed paper if an administrative patent judge or the Board, sua sponte, is of the opinion that it would be in the interest of justice to consider the paper. An example would be where the delay is short (e.g., one day) and there is no prejudice to an opponent. For purposes of the sections other than §1.645, a belatedly filed paper is considered ``timely filed'' if accompanied by a motion under §1.635 which is granted. Paragraph (d) of §1.645 is proposed to be amended by deleting ``In an appropriate circumstance'' as superfluous in view of the language ``may stay proceedings,'' which indicates that the administrative patent judge has the discretion to stay an interference. In §1.646, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(2) by deleting the reference to §1.684, which is proposed to be deleted. It is proposed to amend paragraph (c)(1) by inserting ``or causing a copy of the paper to be handed'' after ``By handing a copy of the paper'' to make it clear that the paper need not be personally delivered by the party, i.e., that delivery by hand can be effected by a commercial courier, for example. In paragraph (c)(4), it is proposed to change ``mail'' (second occurrence) to ``first class mail'' to make it clear that the service date specified in that paragraph applies only to first class mail. It is also proposed to redesignate paragraph (c)(5) as paragraph (c)(6) and to add a new paragraph (c)(5) which clarifies that a party may serve by Express Mail and that when service is effected by Express Mail, the date of service is considered to be the date of deposit with the U.S. Postal Service. Paragraph (d) is proposed to be amended to delete the quotation marks around ``Express Mail.'' Paragraph (e) is proposed to be amended to state that the due date for serving a paper is the same as the due date for filing the paper in the Patent and Trademark Office. In §1.651, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(2) by deleting ``(testimony includes testimony to be taken abroad under §1.684)'' in order to be consistent with the proposal to delete §1.684. Paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) are proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed amendment to the definition of ``effective filing date'' in §1.601(g). In paragraph (d), it is proposed to change ``abroad under §1.684'' to ``in a foreign country.'' In §1.653, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) in several ways. The first is to change the references to paragraphs of §1.672 to be consistent with the proposed redesignation of certain paragraphs of §1.672, discussed below. The second is to delete ``of fact'' in the clause ``agreed statements of fact under §1.672(f)'' (proposed to be redesignated as §1.672(h)), because agreed statements under §1.672(f) can set forth either (1) how a particular witness would testify if called or (2) the facts in the case of one or more of the parties. The third is to delete ``under §1.684(c),'' since §1.684 is proposed to be deleted. A fourth proposed amendment to §1.653(a) is to indicate that in addition to the types of testimony already set forth in paragraph (a), testimony includes copies of written interrogatories and answers and written requests for admissions and answers, which might be obtained where a motion for additional discovery under §1.687(c) is granted.
