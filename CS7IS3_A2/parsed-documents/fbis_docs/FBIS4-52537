Cavallo, who is a strong advocate of his country's new economic policy, told YONHAP News Agency Tuesday that the convertibility system, which has laid the foundation for economic stability, will not be changed even after President Carlos Saul Menem is re-elected. Argentina's economy has been stable for the past two to three years and the present policy will be continued; the Argentine Government hopes that Korean companies will hike their investments, he said. He pointed to the fisheries, timber, mining and energy industries as promising areas for further Korean investment.
