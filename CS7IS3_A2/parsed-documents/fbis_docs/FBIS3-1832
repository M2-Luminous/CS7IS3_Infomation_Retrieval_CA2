The name list of the third batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers will also be made public at the same time. A ceremony to renew the tenure of the first batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers will be held. In addition, the authorities concerned are considering increasing the membership of the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (PWC). Qin Wenjun, deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, attended a cocktail party held by the Hong Kong Association of Real Estate and Construction Industries yesterday to celebrate the Spring Festival. When asked about progress made in appointing "regional affairs advisers," Qin said that the Chinese side is stepping up the work, adding that the name list of about 300 regional affairs advisers will probably be published in early March. The Chinese side is also actively preparing for the appointment of the third batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers, including looking for suitable candidates and soliciting their opinions. He also said that the Chinese side is preparing the name list of the second batch of PWC members. Commenting on the possibility that the British side will table the second part of the constitutional package to the Legislative Council (Legco), he emphasized that the Sino-British talks had been suspended unilaterally by the British side. Whether the constitutional package is submitted to Legco in part or in full amounts to the suspension of the talks, as was agreed by the two sides before the talks. The Chinese side did not expect this, but since this has happened, the British side must accept the consequences. He also said that if the British side publishes the minutes of the 17 rounds of talks, the Chinese side will follow suit. When asked about support given by the Australian foreign minister to the Hong Kong governor's political reform package, Qin said: The Hong Kong issue is a matter for both China and Britain before 1997 and is China's internal affair after 1997. This is a principle the Chinese side has solemnly told the world. No third party is qualified to make irresponsible remarks on the Hong Kong issue. He also reminded the public of the disparity between the remarks by the Australian prime minister and the foreign minister. On the human rights issue, he reiterated that the Asian region values democracy and knows how to expand democracy, including human rights, in line with its actual conditions. Qin said he had no idea about the transfer of Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, to Beijing. Regarding the appointment of Wang Fengchao, director of the second department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, as deputy director of the office, Qin said Wang is the right person for the post, because he is familiar with the situation in Hong Kong and Macao.
