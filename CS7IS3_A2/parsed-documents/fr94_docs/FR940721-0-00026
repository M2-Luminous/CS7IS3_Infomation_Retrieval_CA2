FR940721-0-00026 FR940721-0-00010 The agency's lockability final rule published in the Federal Register on October 13, 1993, ``requires that lap belts or the lap belt portion of lap/shoulder belts be capable of being used to tightly secure child safety seats, without the necessity of the user's attaching any device to the seat belt webbing, retractor, or any part of the vehicle in order to achieve that purpose.'' This requirement applies to rear vehicle seating positions that are recommended, in FMVSS No. 213, as the safest positions for placing a child restraint system. The latchplate used for Standard 213 testing will be consistent with the lockability requirement, and will reflect the type and operation of latchplates used in vehicles for attaching child restraint systems. Ford and UM-CPP said that the buckle assembly length should be specified as measured from the inboard anchor, ``such that the length exposed beyond the bight is consistent with the maximum allowed by SAE J1819.'' NHTSA agrees that the length of the belt exposed beyond the bite (i.e., the intersection of the seat back and seat cushion) needs to be specified and agrees with using the value recommended by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in its draft recommended practice J1819, ``Securing Child Restraint Systems in Motor Vehicles.'' The J1819 draft recommended practice is a result of a joint effort of manufacturers of motor vehicles and child restraint systems to promote compatibility between child restraints and vehicle seats and seat belts. As stated in the draft recommended practice, ``[C]hild restraint systems and vehicle seats and seat belts having features that conform to this document are more likely to be compatible with one another.'' By using the J1819 value, the agency not only specifies a uniform standard test procedure but also reinforces the guidelines that promote the compatibility between child restraints and vehicle seats and seat belts. Accordingly, NHTSA has revised Figures 1A and 1B and the addendum (addendum A, Seat Base Weldment, dated July 1, 1993) to the Drawing Package SAS&hyph;100&hyph;1000 to show the length of the buckle assembly. (The materials have also been revised to round off the dimensions to the whole millimeter.) Ford suggested that tension in the standard belt be set at the 2 to 4 pound (9 to 18 N) force specified in Standard 208, rather than the 12 to 15 pound (53 to 67 N) force specified by Standard 213 for securing add-on child seats. Ford said that the former range is more representative of the tension induced in a typical Type 2 belt by the emergency locking retractor. NHTSA agrees. This rule adopts the proposed requirement in S6.1.1.3 stating that_ [T]hese seat belt assemblies meet the requirements of Standard No. 209 (ยง571.209) and have webbing with a width of not more than 2 inches, and are attached to the anchorage points without the use of retractors or reels of any kind. However, the agency has replaced S6.1.2.2 with a new section to specify preloading of the various belts. The new section maintains the current 12 to 15 pounds pretensioning of the lap belt that restrains the add-on child restraint to the test seat assembly, but specifies that the shoulder portion of the Type 2 belt should be pretensioned to a 2-pound force as in FMVSS 208. UM-CPP suggested that the shoulder belt should not be tightened to 12 to 15 lb prior to the test as is currently required for lap belts. It said that a procedure to determine the tension in the shoulder portion of the belt may be needed. The commenter suggested that a procedure consisting of placing a curved block with a given radius against the dummy's chest, tightening the belt to the usual tension, and removing the block before the test, is a repeatable method of introducing appropriate slack when tightening the belt. NHTSA disagrees that the suggested procedure is necessary. Today's rule adopts a procedure in S6.1.2.2 which specifies that the tension of the shoulder belt is measured by a load cell placed on the webbing portion of the belt system prior to the dynamic test. Thus, there is a procedure for ensuring that the belt has the proper tension. NHTSA believes it is immaterial how the belt is tightened as long as the requisite tensile force is achieved. Moreover, a procedure for tightening the belts can be addressed in the Laboratory Procedures for the Standard 213 dynamic test. Describing the procedure in the laboratory procedures is preferable to describing it in the standard because there might be ways to tighten the belt (e.g., by use of a metallic roller) that might be easier to use than another procedure (e.g., use of a wooden block), that lead to equally uniform and repetitively consistent results.
