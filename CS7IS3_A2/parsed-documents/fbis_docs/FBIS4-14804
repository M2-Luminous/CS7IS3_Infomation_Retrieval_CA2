The U.N. secretary general said that the solution to the problem of Sarajevo and Tuzla was found thanks to Russian initiatives. As concerns the participation of a Turkish contingent in the international peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia, Butrus- Ghali said it would play no negative role in the region. The United Nations is an international organisation, and its peacekeeping forces must also be international, he said. Asked about the international community's role in the Middle- East peace process, the secretary general pointed to the mission of the U.N. peacekeepers in the conflict zone. He welcomed any initiatives designed to promote the peace process in the Middle-East. Butrus-Ghali said the international community is interested in expanding the presence of the United Nations and Russia in the peacekeeping operations on the territory of the former Soviet Union. He noted that the main pitfall on this path was financial, as the budget of the U.N. peacekeeping efforts has increased considerably in the past two years.
