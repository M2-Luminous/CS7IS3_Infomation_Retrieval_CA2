In a telephone conversation, conducted in the presence of correspondents from Interfax and Russia's NTV television company, Grachev told Perry: "In our opinion, far from all political and diplomatic measures have been used." The minister said Russia's 400-strong U.N. contingent around 1700 GMT was entering Sarajevo, where the commander of the Russian airborne forces, Colonel-General Yevgeny Podkolzin, a group of Russian Defense Ministry officials and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin had already arrived. "The use of air forces against any of the parties to the conflict must be ruled out. This must be the basis of a solution at the present moment," Grachev said. He said Perry agreed with this and said no air strikes would be carried out on Monday. Attempts would be made that day to establish the exact location of the heavy weapons removed by the Serbs, Grachev said. He said the abundant snow was hampering the withdrawal of the weaponry. "This factor must come into account when decisions are made," he told Perry. Grachev said civilians and Russian troops could be among the victims of the air strikes. He made it clear that Moscow could send a reinforcement for the U.N. force if the Russian parliament approved it. "We are ready to respond to the appeal of the U.N. secretary general to send an addition contingent of up to 300 if such a decision were approved by the Federal Assembly," he said.
