ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted by Kent County, Michigan, under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On October 29, 1993, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by Kent County under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On April 26, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Kent County International Airport noise compatibility program. A total of ten (10) measures were included in the Kent County International Airport recommended program. Of the ten (10) measures, two (2) are ``Program Management,'' three (3) are ``Noise Abatement,'' and five (5) are ``Land Use.'' The FAA gave outright approval for nine (9) measures; the tenth measure was given partial approval. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of the FAA's approval of the Kent County International Airport noise compatibility program is April 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ernest Gubry, Federal Aviation Administration, Detroit Airports District Office, Willow Run Airport, East, 8820 Beck Road, Belleville, Michigan 48111, 313&hyph;487&hyph;7280. Documents reflecting this FAA action may be reviewed at this same location. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Kent County International Airport, effective April 26, 1994. Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps. The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel. Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150 program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act, and is limited to the following determinations: a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150; b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;
