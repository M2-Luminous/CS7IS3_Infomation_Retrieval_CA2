It Is 100 Times More Difficult to Reestablish It" -- from the RUSSKOYE ORUZHIYE section] [Text] From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file: A.I. Tushinskiy was born in Minsk in 1945. He graduated from the Minsk Radiotechnical Institute. He has worked as an engineer and chief engineer at the Minsk computer unit plant, and then as general director of the Belorussian [Belarusian] "Computer Technology" Production Association. In June 1992 he was appointed Belorusian first deputy minister of defense. He supervises questions of materiel and technical backup for the troops, technical policy, and conversion, and coordinates interaction between the military department and the Republic's defense industry. He is chairman of the Belorusian Republic Defense Ministry Scientific-Technical Council. [Kovalev] Aleksandr Iosifovich, how would you assess the Republic's defense industry's potential? [Tushinskiy] It is hard to give a simple answer to this question today. On the one hand Belorusia has a very large defense industry, which it inherited from the former Union. In the times of the unified union state, 112 industrial enterprises, scientific-research institutes, experimental design bureaus, and construction-assembly and other organizations worked for military needs, and over 200,000 scientists, designers, engineers, technicians, and workers were employed in them. Many articles that were developed and manufactured here have no counterparts -- we were the monopolists on certain models of combat equipment and components. But when, following Belorusia's acquisition of sovereign state status, an inventory of the defense industry was carried out, it turned out that it was in a position to provide for only 3 percent of the national army's needs in terms of weapons systems. This means around 20 models of combat equipment and weapons. In other words, the lion's share of output manufactured at our enterprises consisted of components -- equipment, subassemblies, hardware, instruments, and so-called basic supplies. That is, to put it figuratively, we turned out to be impoverished despite our wealth: Although we have a mighty military-industrial complex at our disposal, we can only use its potential to a limited extent to provide for our Armed Forces' needs. What is needed to increase that potential is a major structural overhaul of the defense industry. [Kovalev] And is that work being conducted? [Tushinskiy] Yes. On the government's instructions the Defense Ministry has elaborated a draft state weapons program for the period through the year 2000. It was recently examined and ratified at a sitting of the Defense Ministry Collegium. Now it is up to the government. In brief, this program boils down to bringing the level of supply of home-produced weapons and equipment to the Army from the present 3 percent up to 20 percent by 2000, and considerably expanding our own potential for repairing weapons and combat equipment and manufacturing tool and accessories kits and spare parts. At present, our industry and Defense Ministry enterprises can only guarantee the repair of 2 percent of the 4,000-plus models of armaments and military hardware making up the arsenals. [Kovalev] In light of what you have said, I cannot help wondering: From where will the remaining 80 percent of the armaments systems required to maintain the Belorusian Army's high level of combat readiness come? [Tushinskiy] The missing hardware and armaments will, of course, have to be purchased. And these purchases have been built into the program. They have been specified according to quantity, product list, and deadlines. I will tell you right away that we are geared mainly toward Russia. [Kovalev] But modern-day weaponry is not cheap. The Republic is known to be in a difficult financial position right now, and it is unlikely to be able to alter this in the next few years.... [Tushinskiy] You are right, of course. Nevertheless, we hope to be able to obtain a minimum of requirements for troop back-up anyway. And, paradoxical though it may be, our defense sector will help with this once again. The fact is that a large part of its production used to go, indeed, still does go to Russia -- it is our main client. And it seems that in the future too the Russians will be interested in supplies from us, as Belorusia has a monopoly in the sphere of developing and producing a whole range of items of military significance. The relevant scientific research institutes and design bureaus have been set up, and the production technology has been installed. In our country, for instance, many highly important elements of space technology are produced, plus equipment for space stations. Minsk's wheeled vehicle plant produces truly unique multiaxled chassis for mobile strategic missile complexes, notably for the famous "Topol" -- the RS-12M. Right now the development of a new eight-axle chassis, unparalleled in terms of navigability, maneuverability, and technical sophistication, is approaching its culmination here. Belorusia does not need such a machine, but the fact is that the commander in chief of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces is asking for the tests and technical refinement to be completed here in full.... The tractor plant is producing tracked vehicles for systems no less famous than the "Tor" and the "Tunguska." As yet there is nothing, as far as I know, to match our automated guidance and control systems, certain types of optical appliance, photometric technology, or reconnaissance devices. The list goes on. Belorusia will supply items produced here to Russian orders and update them, and in exchange we will acquire everything that our Armed Forces need. I am hardly rediscovering America here, by the way: There are agreements in this respect on questions of military-technical cooperation between the governments of our countries. As yet, unfortunately, they are functioning in by no means ideal fashion. The situation is intensified many times over by the enormous difference in prices for energy sources and raw materials -- in Belorusia these are somewhat higher than in Russia. Production from our defense enterprises, as a result, is becoming too expensive for Russian producers. But even if an order is received and fulfilled, this still does not guarantee prompt payment. How are workers and engineers meant to survive in such a situation? What can be used to acquire raw materials? Or components from subcontractors? How can the production base be updated or even maintained at the requisite level? Unless the situation changes, I fear that the Republic's defense industry, even without a conversion process, will not be long for this world.... [Kovalev] The picture you paint is not very optimistic. Where then is the way out of the existing situation? [Tushinskiy] The treaty signed in Moscow on 12 April this year on a monetary alliance between our countries does inspire some optimism. If it is introduced in full, the situation will be rectified a little. On its own, however, this agreement is of little use, and our governments and military departments need urgently to sit down at the negotiating table and define their positions on an entire range of questions linked with future cooperation in the defense industry sphere. As a result, our scientists, designers, and producers should get a clear, long-term program, a state order, and the necessary financial resources for its implementation. Right now, as we know, Russia is striving to win back positions lost in the world weapons market. This is undoubtedly a worthy decision. But many components for the most modern hardware and weaponry are produced in Belorusia. So there is a direct link here: If our defense industry suffocates, so to speak, and it is forced to wind down military production completely, then Russia will inevitably lose speed in breaking into the world market in respect of some of the most vital positions. Moreover, this concerns the production of arms and military hardware for their own Armed Forces, too. But if we can achieve close coordination in the work of our military-industrial complexes, it will prove possible to avoid losses in both speed and quality. The two sides can only gain from this. [Kovalev] But will it not be the case that, while the upper echelons are negotiating about collaboration, the Belorusian defense sector will be reduced to precious little more than a few nuts and bolts? [Tushinskiy] There are, of course, grounds for such fears. But not everything is as gloomy as it may have appeared to you from my account. We are by no means sitting back with folded arms. Contacts between Belorusian and Russian defense sector workers and between the military departments, despite all the difficulties, have not broken down. Yes, the volumes of orders have approached a critical level, but they are still coming in. And yes, the problem of payment defaulting is very severe; but, as soon as our Russian partners do receive money, the first accounts they seek to pay are those of the Belorusian suppliers. In its turn, our defense workers do not insist on payment up front, and they are striving to complete Russian orders in good faith, to a high standard, and on time. At times our scientific research institutes and design bureaus continue with promising developments and the technical finishing of new items on the strength of pure enthusiasm alone, so to speak. For instance, at our proving ground equipment plant, state-of-the-art simulators for training T-72 tank operators have just been tested and brought into series production. They will be supplied to Russia. We have succeeded in agreeing with our Russian colleagues on the uncompensated exchange of technical documentation, which is very important for us, insofar as we intend to expand the list of types of military hardware repairable at republic enterprises. We are holding talks with the Russians on setting up joint ventures. In Orsha, for instance, on the basis of the aviation repair plant a joint venture for the repair of MiG-29 fighter aircraft will begin to operate very soon. The Russian side will offer us the requisite documentation and spares. A program for the joint production in Belorusia of a dual-purpose aircraft -- suitable for scientific and training purposes and to serve business people -- is at the compilation stage. The aviation design bureau headed by Aleksandr Nikolayevich Tereshchenko and a number of Russian federation enterprises are acting as founders of the project. And there is another joint project that we will be starting in the near future -- recycling old munitions that are past their storage life. We have specific projections here. Russia has shown an interest in them. So we will pool efforts here to our mutual advantage. We are moving toward the flotation of defense enterprises: In particular, the Gomel "cluster" of our military-industrial complex and Russia's "Vympel" Science-and-Production Association are setting up a joint stock company right now, and they will work together on conversion programs and on the production of defense output. In short, despite everything, the links between the defense sectors of Belorussia and Russia have not been broken once and for all. And, I hope, they never will be. I am convinced that our fraternal countries will together show concern for reinforcing the Armed Forces. As we know only too well, something can be destroyed in the space of an hour, but reestablishing what has been ruined takes many years and concerted efforts.
