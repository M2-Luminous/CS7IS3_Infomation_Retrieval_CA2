According to data provided by relevant departments, the number of markets for trading property rights has increased to 25 across the country so far, and regional trading centers for property rights have taken shape in Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong, Chengdu, Shenzhen, and Zhejiang. Thirty banking institutions and large enterprise conglomerates-- including the China Economic Development Trust and Investment Corporation; Hangzhou Waitan Construction Co., Ltd.; China Everbright International Trust and Investment Corporation; and Shenzhen Baoan (Group) Corporation--recently decided to jointly establish the China International Property Rights Trade Center in Beijing, a market for the trade of property rights nationwide. The trade of property rights refers to the transfer of property rights between owners, whether it be in kind, in whole or in part. The best advantages to be gained from trading property rights are: Assets in stock can be turned to good account and guide the redisposition of resources, allowing assets whose supply exceeds demand or which are lying idle and produce no economic returns to now flow to departments which badly need them; highly competitive enterprises which produce good economic returns can merge with uncompetitive enterprises which produce poor economic returns; and all enterprises which produce good economic returns can make the best use of their assets and convert them into cash at all times, thereby improving the economic returns of assets in society and ensuring and increasing their value. However, under the restrictions of a planned economy over a long period of time, relationships of property rights are vaguely defined among enterprises in China; large amounts of funds are lying idle because, unlike production and management factors, property rights cannot circulate and cannot be redisposed. As a result, the production structure of the country and the scale and structure of enterprises are extremely irrational; large amounts of state-owned assets are lost; and enterprises produce low economic returns. According to statistics by relevant departments, presently about one third of state-owned assets throughout the country are lying idle, produce low economic returns, or are being wasted at a high rate. To promote the rational flow and restructuring of enterprises' property rights in order to bring about the best combination of resources and operating scale, we should put assets in stock back into the productive cycle, improve the operating structure of assets, eradicate the gap in securing construction funds, and ensure appreciation while guarding against depreciation of state-owned assets. Markets handling property rights transactions began emerging in China in the early 1980's. After a few years of development, the trading of property rights has brought remarkable benefits to our national economy, and is gradually becoming an important formula for optimizing the disposal of state- owned assets under the socialist market economic conditions. Statistics show that a total of 6,900 or so Chinese enterprises were merged with other enterprises throughout the 1980's, resulting in the transfer of stock property worth over 8 billion yuan, a reduction of 4,095 loss-making enterprises, and a 522 million yuan reduction in the amount of losses. The trading of property rights developed further in the 1990's, bringing the accumulative total number of annexed enterprises in the country to over 10,000. During the past year, property rights trading markets in 16 cities -- including Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen -- witnessed the annexation or sale of a total of over 2,900 enterprises, the transfer of assets in stock worth over 6 billion yuan, and the relocation of more than 400,000 workers and staff members. Since 1987, more than 1,000 loss-making enterprises in Sichuan have been put back into business through the trading of property rights after relocating more than 90,000 workers and staff members, transferring over 3 billion yuan worth of assets in stock, and putting 2.3 billion yuan worth of stagnant assets back into productive use. Shanghai carried out property rights transfers on 151 industrial enterprises in 1990, injecting 113,200 workers and staff members into key industries for priority development, and gradually improving the operating efficiency of fixed assets worth 2.8 billion yuan. In the first half of 1993, 30 or so Beijing industrial enterprises without any hope of getting out of the red were given new life after being merged with other enterprises. Following the emergence and gradual expansion of the trade in property rights, the establishment and perfection of a series of relevant laws and regulations also began. So far, laws and regulations--such as the "Bankruptcy Law," the "Company Law," the "Provisional Procedures for Enterprise Mergers," the "Provisional Procedures for Selling Off Small State-Owned Enterprises' Property Rights," the "Procedures for Administering the Evaluation of State- Owned Property," and the "Regulations for Transforming the Operating Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Entire People"--have been promulgated and implemented in the country, while other relevant laws and regulations--such as the "Securities Law," the "Banking Law," and the "Provisions for Unemployment Insurance for Workers and Staff Members in State-Owned Enterprises"--are currently being drafted. Economic circles believe that although the present trade in property rights is still shaded with administrative intervention and lacking standardization and fairness, it has played a positive role in remolding and optimizing the combination of the elements of production and in developing the productive forces.
