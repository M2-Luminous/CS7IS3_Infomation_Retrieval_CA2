Ankara gave a positive reply to Talabani's request to go to northern Iraq via Turkey. The meeting between Talabani and [Democratic party of Kurdistan Mas'ud] Barzani will not take place in Silopi. [Correspondent Fatih Yilmaz] Talabani was abroad when the clashes started in northern Iraq on 2 May. When the clashes intensified, Talabani got as far as the Syrian capital of Damascus, but could not proceed to northern Iraq from there. In order to go to his region in northern Iraq from Damascus, Talabani has to pass through a region under Barzani's control. Talabani had said that he could go to northern Iraq on condition that Barzani meet him at the border. As a last hope, Talabani appealed to Turkey. Ankara gave a positive reply to Talabani's request to go to northern Iraq via Turkey. It is expected that Talabani will enter Turkey in the next few days. Turkey supported Barzani during the clashes in northern Iraq. An important factor in this were the close ties Talabani had established with the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. The Talabani-Barzani summit that was expected to be held in Silopi is now regarded as highly unlikely.
