He said he is satisfied with the move to allow French firms to invest in Jordan. Upon arrival in Amman today, Juppe said that France is looking forward to the establishment of a comprehensive peace in the region and that his visit to Jordan is based on France's concern for supporting the peace process. He added: France has a role to play in the peace process, particularly in the framework of the multilateral talks and the committees in which it is involved, such as economic development, water, and refugee committees. Juppe said France is seeking to help Jordan reschedule its foreign debt; the amount of which is a burden to the Jordanian economy. He said France is working through NATO to put an end to the suffering of people in Bosnia and is determined not to miss any opportunity to achieve peace there. The recent NATO decision, he said, has restored confidence and there are encouraging signs now from the parties to the conflict that they will listen to the voice of logic, including the handing over of some heavy weapons to the United Nations. Juppe was received at Amman civilian airport by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting minister of state for foreign affairs; the French ambassador in Amman; and senior Foreign Ministry and French Embassy staff.
