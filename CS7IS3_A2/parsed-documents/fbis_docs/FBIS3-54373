A responsible Hamas source said that talk about Hamas' link with a captured fugitive in an ambush set up by the Egyptian police in Cairo's suburbs last week is totally fabricated and baseless. This sort of talk is devoid of logic and credibility and falls within framework of the deliberate campaign of distortion against Hamas' positions in the Arab world. The source reiterated that Hamas' armed activity is limited to resisting Israel. He pointed out that Hamas does not carry out this sort of activity against any Arab or foreign party. Such activity is not a Hamas strategy.
