A large assembly of the Siberian Cossack Army was held in Barnaul. The Cossacks spoke with bitterness of the Russian government's lack of effort toward reviving the Cossack society. Far from all of the Cossack communities are being allocated land for their yurts as called for in the ukase issued by the President of the Russian Federation. Cossack self-government, a unique form of true democracy and popular rights in the past, has not been established in a single Cossack village. The Cossacks are even more displeased by the way their brothers are being treated in neighboring Kazakhstan. The situation there is complex and tense. Indignation was aroused in the Cossacks by the news that Kazakh nationalists have desecrated the memorial to Ataman Yermak Timofeyevich, legendary Russian explorer. The large assembly of the Siberian Cossack Army approved a message to the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan, which demands that they look into the situation and influence the course of events. Cossacks Build Nuclear Submarines Another Cossack company has joined the existing ones in northern Russia. The charter of a Cossack association established at the state center of Russian nuclear shipbuilding, in the city of Severodvinsk, has been registered in the justice department of the Arkhangelsk Oblast administration. The association has a membership of around 60 Cossacks. Their ataman, V. Litvinov, works as a fitter/assembler in the Sevmashpredpriyatiye production association, where Russia builds its nuclear submarines. The first constructive activity of the new association, with which the Cossacks want to make themselves known to the city, has been to help maintain public order on the streets. This involves mounted patrols in Severodvinsk. The Pegas cooperative, of which Cossack V. Manevskiy is chairman, presently has only five horses which can be ridden by the Cossacks. That is true, but as they say, where there is a Cossack, a horse will be found. -- Vladimir Gundarov Where Are the Stirrups on a Tank? A small Cossack assembly of the Yekaterinburg Division of the Orenburg Cossack Army discussed the establishment of a Cossack formation out of one of the formations of the Ural Military District. It is planned to form the Cossack battalion in the spring of 1994 as a Guards tank formation. The battalion is being established in accordance with the ukase issued by the President of the Russian Federation on 15 March 1993, and members of the Ural Cossack community will serve in it. The Sverdlovsk Oblast Military Commissariat has confirmed that the proper orders have been issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. It is symbolic that the formation in which the Cossacks will be serving traveled a glorious combat path during the Great Patriotic War as cavalrymen, replacing their battle horses with tanks following the war. -- Leonid Mikhaylov
