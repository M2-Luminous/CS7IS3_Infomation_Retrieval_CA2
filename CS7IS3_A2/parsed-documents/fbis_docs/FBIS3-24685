This measure is aimed at "highway robbers," criminals who have existed in the country for years. According to a government decision, "those in possession of hunting guns and military weapons are requested to deposit them at the Gendarmerie, police stations, customs offices, or with water resources and forestry officials within one month or face coercive measures, it was learned in Bangui today. The authorities, who did not explain the nature of the "coercive measures," also decided to "suspend the granting of arms and ammunition permits until further notice." These measures concern "highway robbers" called "zaraguinas" in CAR, who terrorize rural dwellers in several regions of the country, notably the border area with Chad. Early this week, eight "highway robbers" were killed by the security forces in Bossangoa Region, 350 km north of Bangui. Another recent clash resulted in the death of seven of them in Vagaka Region, about 1,000 km east of the capital. Some time ago, the CAR Government gave itself three months to stop the activities of the zaraguinas, apparently without success.
