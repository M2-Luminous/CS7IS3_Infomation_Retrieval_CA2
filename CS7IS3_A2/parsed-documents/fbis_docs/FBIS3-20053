However, the police have not yet sounded the all-clear. In the afternoon, the traditional Newroz celebration of the Kurds began -- accompanied by several hundred policemen -- in Frankfurt/Main with much noise but peacefully. "The situation is characterized by unpredictability, fanaticism, and controlled leadership," a police spokesman said. The authorities are also prepared for activities in other places. The Frankfurt Newroz celebrations had been permitted under strict conditions. On Sunday police expect thousands of Kurds to come to Mannheim, to follow a call for a mourning demonstration for two Kurdish women from Turkey. The women had burned themselves in Mannheim in protest against the situation of their people in Anatolia. Police consider it possible that more than 20,000 Kurds will come to the rally, which was banned by the city on Friday. Units of the Federal Border Police (BGS) have been ordered to Mannheim. In Hannover about 200 people, who mainly belonged to the autonomous scene, demonstrated on Saturday against the oppression of Kurds in Turkey. In Cologne the Kurds have obviously respected the ban on demonstrations issued by the Cologne police president. Apart from a small group of Kurds carrying banners, there were no protests. Police and BGS had gathered more than 3,000 of their men in the city as a precaution. [passage omitted]
