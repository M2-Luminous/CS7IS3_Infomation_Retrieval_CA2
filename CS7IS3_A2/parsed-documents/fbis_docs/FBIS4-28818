It is natural to abolish the law in line with economic deregulation, Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the elite business club, told a news conference, referring to a plan by the Trade Ministry to abolish the law. He said deregulation is a major task to be tackled and should be pushed ahead by all means. Toyoda, who is chairman of Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp., said he was not confident enough on an economic recovery although there were some bright signs. He said the present value of the Japanese yen is too high in view of Japan's fundamental economic conditions and it should be brought down to an optimum level, or around 110 yen to the dollar.
