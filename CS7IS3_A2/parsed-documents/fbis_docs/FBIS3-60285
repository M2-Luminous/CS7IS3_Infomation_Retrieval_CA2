A research center -- the CHERCIR [Chernobyl Center for International Research] -- has opened at the site under the aegis of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. The European Union, which has been working there since 1990, decided to go further and in June 1992 signed an accord with Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. Since 1991, Europe has invested a total of ECU14.2 million (Fr95 million) in order to finance 16 research projects. A laboratory is currently being set up in the exclusion zone and an office and housing facilities are available to researchers at Zeleny Mys, on the edge of the zone. Together with health problems, much of the work is devoted to mapping out the contaminated areas, modeling the transfer of radioactive nuclides from the soil to plant life and then to animals and man, the study of their migration in the soil and the water systems, decontamination tests, etc. The researchers certainly have their work cut out. At the time of the accident, the "liquidators" had other concerns than the long- term protection of the environment. Reactor waste, the earth removed from the most contaminated areas, and the trees from the "red forest" burned by radiation were all buried, high and low radioactive waste all mixed in together. A total of 24 sites with 840 pits or trenches containing waste have been identified in the exclusion zone (10 km around the nuclear plant), explains Boris Prister, first deputy to the Ukrainian minister responsible for Chernobyl: "Studies are being carried out to determine if this waste must be treated separately from or included in the new entombment project." In the meantime, readings have already shown a certain plutonium contamination (37 becquerels per liter) of the water circulating beneath the "red forest" burial sites. The ditches in this area which contain the waste have, however, been lined with clay -- unlike those at other sites. "I do not believe that there is an immediate danger, but serious problems could arise within 10 to 15 years," believes Jaak Sinnaeve, head of the "Research Actions for Radiological Protection" unit at the European Commission. "In any event," he adds, "there is an urgent need for a thorough inventory." For the moment, the river Pripyat, which flows into the Dnieper and which could therefore contaminate the Kiev basin, is protected by a "geotechnical barrier" (waterproof underground wall) some 2.1 kilometers long. But that is no more than a temporary measure. "In the short term, it is the strontium 90 which is causing us the most concern, because it is soluble and thus migrates much more easily than cesium which is insoluble," explains Boris Prister. "After every period of heavy rainfall, we see major increases in the strontium concentration in the river." This is all the more worrying as the sandy soil favors the migration of radioactive nuclides, adds Nikolay Arkhipov, an expert in nuclear contamination who has been working at Chernobyl since May 1986, after having spent nearly 30 years studying the effects of the Kyshtym nuclear catastrophe in the Ural Mountains. "We want to pursue genuine cooperative research," explains Lucien Cecille, project coordinator for Europe. "There is an enormous amount which our radiation protection researchers can learn. They could come here for several months each year. One day, we also hope to extend this network of laboratories to include the Kyshtym site." Rather an ambitious objective, perhaps. Although professing a commitment to cooperation, the project leaders from the three countries do not always show great enthusiasm for cooperating in the field. The Ukraine-Belarus border, which is to the north of the 30 km exclusion zone around Chernobyl, sometimes seems impenetrable for men and information.
