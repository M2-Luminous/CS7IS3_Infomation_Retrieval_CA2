FR940429-0-00297 FR940429-0-00016 Change: None. Section 682.402(d)(7)(iii) 38. Comment: Some commenters objected to the requirement that a payment received by the lender from or on behalf of the borrower after the lender filed a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency must be forwarded to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its receipt. The commenters contended that the guaranty agency is not the legal holder of the loan until it pays a claim, and therefore has no right to the payment. Discussion: The Secretary sees no benefit in having the borrower's payment in the possession of the party that has forwarded other loan related documents to the guaranty agency. The Secretary is aware of at least two ways for a lender to forward the borrower's payment to a guaranty agency so that it can be applied to the borrower's outstanding loan balance: the lender could cash the borrower's check and forward its own check payable to the guaranty agency on behalf of the borrower, or the lender could forward the borrower's original check to the agency and the agency could hold the check until it paid the lender's claim. Change: None. Section 682.402(d)(7)(iv) 39. Comment: Some commenters believed that in the case of a claim filed by a lender, the guaranty agency, not the lender, should notify the borrower that a closed school loan discharge has been granted. Discussion: The borrower had an obligation to repay the loan to the lender. The borrower has no obligation to repay the loan (it has been discharged) to the guaranty agency. The borrower should be informed by the party to whom the borrower had been obligated (the lender, if the claim was filed by the lender, or the guaranty agency, if the borrower's loan was held by the guaranty agency) that the borrower's obligation to repay the loan to that party has been discharged. Change: None. 40. Comment: Some commenters noted that the proposed regulations did not specify the actions that a lender must take when it is informed by a guaranty agency that a borrower's request for a closed school discharge has been denied. Discussion: The Secretary had intended that the procedures that applied in the case of a false certification request would apply to a closed school claim also. Change: The final regulations have been revised to specify in §682.402(d)(7)(v) the responsibilities of a lender when it is notified by a guaranty agency that a borrower's request for a closed school discharge has been denied. Section 682.402(e)␣False Certification by a School of a Student's Eligibility to Borrow 41. Comment: Some commenters requested the Secretary to specifically state in the regulations what the effect of a false certification discharge would be on a school's cohort default rate. Discussion: This issue would be more appropriately addressed in the definition of a school's cohort default rate in 34 CFR Part 668. While the Secretary does not believe that a school that falsely certified a borrower's eligibility should be allowed to benefit from that false certification by having its default rate reduced as a consequence, he is studying this issue to determine the appropriate treatment of such cases, and will make a decision when information concerning actual cases of false certification discharges is available. Change: None. Section 682.402(e)(1) 42. Comment: Some commenters believed that a parent should not have a Federal PLUS Loan discharged if the school falsely certified the eligibility of the student for whom the parent obtained the PLUS Loan. The commenters believed that only loans obtained directly by the student should be discharged under this section. Discussion: Section 437(c)(1) of the HEA was amended by (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208) to permit a parent to receive a discharge of a PLUS Loan if the school falsely certified the eligibility of the student for whom the parent obtained the PLUS Loan. Change: None. 43. Comment: Some commenters requested clarification of whether the false certification discharge applied to a loan that was partially disbursed on or after January 1, 1986. Discussion: The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to discharge the borrower's liability on a loan ``*␣*␣* received, on or after January 1, 1986 *␣*␣*'' if the student's eligibility to borrow was falsely certified by the school. For purposes of the false certification discharge, the Secretary will consider the borrower's entire loan eligible if any part of it was disbursed by the lender on or after January 1, 1986.
