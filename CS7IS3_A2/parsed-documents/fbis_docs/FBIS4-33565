During his stay, Prime Minister Chan held a number of meetings with the presidents of the three government branches and was bestowed a number of medals, including the Order of Quetzal. Diplomatic sources have said the prime minister's visit strengthened the ties of cooperation and friendship between the two countries. Before his departure today, Chan offered to support President Ramiro de Leon's efforts to rebuild the country with investments as soon as a final peace agreement is signed with the guerrillas. The official believes Guatemala will enter a stage of reconstruction by ending the armed conflict, which began in 1960, and become a country that will attract Oriental investors. Lien Chan also expressed his "respect for the good thoughts" the Guatemalan president has to rebuild the country before and after the signing of the peace agreement, which is scheduled for December 1994. According to the offer, Taiwan will join the countries that will support projects of reconstruction and development, which will allow the consolidation of peace. Meanwhile, Lien Chan is carrying President de Leon's promise to support Taiwan's effort to be admitted as an OAS observer.
