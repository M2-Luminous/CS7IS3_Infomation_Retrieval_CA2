U.S. Diktat Encourages Japanese-Chinese Rapprochement"] [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar -- Is Clinton familiar with Bismarck's advice to avoid wars "on two fronts"? That we do not know, but it is a fact that Washington's nerve centers, seriously believing in a "unipolar" world following the collapse of the USSR, have been intent on picking fights with both China and Japan of late, consequently finding themselves on the brink of cold war simultaneously with the largest state and the most highly developed state in the Asian-Pacific region. This was a striking feature of Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Beijing. Of course, there was no direct evidence of any anti-American slant to the rapprochement that was apparent here, nor was that a possibility. It is indicative, though, that at a joint press conference by the two states' heads of government, Hosokawa vigorously supported China in its resistance to U.S. diktat that is being applied under the banner of "protection of human rights." The Japanese premier described the U.S. attempt to impose its "values" on the countries of the Asian continent as a mistake. There was much to be read between the lines in a number of his other speeches during his three-day stay in China. He said, for example, that Japan has looked again in depth at the lessons of the past and intends to shape its relationship with the PRC in the spirit of friendship and cooperation with a view to the future. He marveled at China's economic achievements and the confidence of the Chinese in their future. The words contained in the speeches by the guest and his hospitable hosts in favor of a fair economic order appeared to be indirectly addressed to Washington politicians who are using economic sanctions in an attempt to intimidate both Japan and China (which now faces the threat of losing is status of most-favored nation in trade with the United States). Is all this going to result in a further weakening of U.S. prestige in the region? In these conditions, further rapprochement promises a great deal for Beijing and Tokyo. Japan is already China's number one partner both in terms of trade and in terms of investments. Further access to Japanese technological achievements could be a major instrument of modernization for this giant state. China represents for Japan a boundless market that can considerably alleviate the consequences of potential U.S. trade sanctions. If there is a further deepening of bilateral cooperation, these two Asian powers could become in the future a kind of political-economic "pole" no less powerful than the United States coupled with NATO.
