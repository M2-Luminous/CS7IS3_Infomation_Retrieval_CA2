Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told a press conference that Bentsen made the remarks "too early" since vice ministerial-level talks are now under way in Washington. At a separate news conference, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito also called Bentsen's remarks "untimely" and "not constructive" because both sides are engaging in serious discussions to achieve agreements. Saito said it was not timely because Japan and the U.S. have been strengthening their efforts to produce such accords. On Sunday, Bentsen said the United States "will not settle for any cosmetic agreement" on trade and that "if we do not have credible agreements by the time of the summit, we would have to reexamine the basis of the framework." Bentsen said his remarks are not meant as a threat but were "just the logical consequence," reflecting "the realities of the situation."
