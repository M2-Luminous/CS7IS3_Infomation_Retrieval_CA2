The former U.S. President Mr. Jimmy Carter at the outset appeals for friendship, understanding, and trade, and full diplomatic relations in return for total nuclear inspections and a verifiable nonweapons production guarantee by North Korea. President Kim il-Song's reponse that it was suspicion and lack of trust which led to the crisis. His call for direct talks with Washington coupled with continued access to international inspectors to monitor the Yongbyong nuclear facility has brought good response from the United States. President Clinton remarked that if North Korea means that it is willing to freeze its nuclear program while talks take place, this could be a promising step. Though an offer for nuclear freeze made by President Kim il-Song in return for diplomatic recognition and economic cooperation was spurned by President Clinton, Jimmy Carter in his second round of talks today would secure greater and convincing steps to guarantee that North Korea is prepared to give up its nuclear intentions. President Clinton's response comes at a time when China has firmly stated that it will maintain its defense arrangement with North Korea and it is against the sanctions. Russians also opposed it, though on non-consultation and non- consideration of its proposal of an international conference on the issue. With the Security Council resolution on sanctions not materializing, President Clinton would be left with the option to go it alone with his allies Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, and Britain. Without the powers to prevent merchant ships and freight aircraft from reaching North Korea, the United States would not be in a position to stop many nations and private businessmen in its alliance countries from trading with Pyongyang. Any move to prevent such trade could provoke North Korea. Even if shunned by many countries, it has immense powers to remain isolated and pursue its (?past). Beijing's support in the face of American moves would also vitalize its strength. Therefore, a more promising way out is constructive engagement through direct negotiations between the United States and North Korea. The second meeting between Jimmy Carter and President Kim il-Song moving in that direction is promising. The two could continue it in open negotiations or secret meetings. China and Russia could then relent on a milder Security Council resolution with more time for negotiations.
