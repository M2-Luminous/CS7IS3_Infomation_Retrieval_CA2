Colonel Paiva, spokesman for the Cabinda Military Front Command, says that FLEC concentrates its actions in settlements to blame the FAA in the event of civilian victims. By 2100 [2000 GMT] on 23 April, elements of the so-called Renewed FLEC tried to destroy the microwave communication system belonging to Angola Telecom enterprise. Using 60-mm mortars and AKM and PKM automatic weapons, the so-called Renewed FLEC men infiltrated the (Trezo) area in the outlaying area of the city of Cabinda, attacking FAA positions. They then intended to destroy the communication system, isolating Cabinda from the rest of the country. The prompt response of the FAA detachment thwarted FLEC's intentions and in their flight they left the organization's pamphlets. The Cabinda Military Front Command spokesman says FAA are ready to respond to and thwart this kind of operations. [Begin Paiva recording] As well as the attack the Renewed FLEC carried out against the antennas on 25 April, which was thwarted, the FLEC recently carried another attack in the (Tando Zinze) area. On this occasion they ambushed an isolated vehicle belonging to FAA. Our forces reacted promptly, causing unspecified losses to the enemy. There is no other event worth mentioning. [end recording]
