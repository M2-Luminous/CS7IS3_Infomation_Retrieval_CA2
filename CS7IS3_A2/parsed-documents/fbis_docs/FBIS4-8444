The Czech Republic joined the Partnership for Peace program in March this year. The document will cover both cooperation in peace-keeping activities, such as the present participation of a Czech contingent in the UNPROFOR [UN protection] force in ex-Yugoslavia, as well as questions of funding and legislation, he said. Vondra was speaking after his meeting with NAA Chairman Loic Bouvard and Secretary- General Peter Corterier. Parliamentary Chairman Milan Uhde told journalists it was a huge lesson in solidarity that the Czech Republic, although feeling threatened by no country, was intensively interested in collective European security.
