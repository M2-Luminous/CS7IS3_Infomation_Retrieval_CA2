FR940926-1-00019 FR940926-1-00009 50 CFR Part 23 RIN 1018&hyph;AC55 Export of American Ginseng Harvested in 1994&hyph;1996 Seasons AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates certain international trade in plant and animal species. Export of plants and animals listed in CITES Appendix II may occur only if the Scientific Authority has advised the permit-issuing Management Authority that such export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the plant or animal specimens to be exported were not obtained in violation of laws for their protection. Export of cultivated specimens of plants listed in Appendix II may occur under certificates issued by the Management Authority if it is satisfied that the plants to be exported were artificially propagated. This document announces proposed findings on export of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) from the 1994&hyph;1996 harvest seasons in 22 States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) reviews information and data on the topics described in this proposed rule as a basis for determining whether to continue approval of export from specified States for the 1994&hyph;96 harvest seasons or to initiate changes. For Iowa and Wisconsin, approval is only for 1994. In addition, the State of North Dakota has applied to export cultivated ginseng under a State program; the State of Maine has submitted legislation which has been signed to set up a State program for the export of cultivated ginseng and is working to finalize the details of the program and to apply for export approval; and the State of Michigan has submitted draft legislation and is intending to complete its application to export cultivated ginseng under a State program soon. The Service proposes to approve only exports of cultivated ginseng from those three States, contingent on submission of adequate final State information. Monitoring State ginseng programs for 16 years has shown that the States from which ginseng export has been approved are likely to continue to satisfy CITES requirements. To ensure that this is so, the Service plans to continue its monitoring in accordance with the procedures described herein, which have been somewhat streamlined and clarified. This monitoring includes analysis of program reports made available to the Service no later than May 31 each year from each State from which ginseng export is approved. These annual reports document the most recent previous harvest and the current status of the State's program for ginseng. The requirement that all ginseng be inspected and certified by State officials is being modified to require that all wild ginseng be inspected and certified by State officials. Cultivated ginseng may be certified by licensed or registered dealers approved by the State to make such an accounting. This change is being considered since: (1) The origin of the roots is declared as to whether the plant was cultivated or taken from the wild; and (2) the marked difference in appearance and price between wild and cultivated ginseng make it reasonably unlikely that wild ginseng would be sold as cultivated ginseng. DATES: The Service will consider all information and comments received by October 26, 1994, in making its final decision on this proposal. State ginseng program reports are due by May 31 of 1995, 1996, and 1997.
