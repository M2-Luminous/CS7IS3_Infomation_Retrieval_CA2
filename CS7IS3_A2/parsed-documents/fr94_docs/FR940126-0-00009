PART 552_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES 3. Section 552.238&hyph;75 is added to read as follows: 552.238&hyph;75 Identification of Energy-Efficient Office Equipment and Supplies Containing Recovered Materials or Other Environmental Attributes. As prescribed in 538.203&hyph;71(d), insert the following clause: Identification of Energy-Efficient Office Equipment and Supplies Containing Recovered Materials or Other Environmental Attributes (Jan. 1994) (a) Definitions. Energy-efficient office equipment, as used in this clause, means office equipment that provide equivalent or better performance and value to users, but uses significantly less energy than competing models. Recovered materials, as used in this clause, means waste material and by-products which have been recovered or diverted from solid waste, but such term does not include those materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused, within an original manufacturing process (42 U.S.C. 6903(19)). (b) The offeror is encouraged to identify in its offer and include in any commercial catalogs and pricelists submitted to the Contracting Officer, energy-efficient office equipment and supplies that contain recovered material or other environmental attributes. An example of energy-efficient office equipment is microcomputers and associated equipment identified by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Energy Star Logo. Supplies that contain recovered materials and other environmental attributes include products identified in EPA procurement guidelines (40 CFR Parts 248 through 253) and products that are either degradable, ozone safe, recyclable, contain low volatile organic content compounds, or contribute to source reduction. Such supplies shall satisfy the guidance contained in 16 CFR Part 260, Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims. (c) An offeror, in identifying an item with an environmental attribute, shall possess evidence or rely upon a reasonable basis to substantiate the claim (see 16 CFR 260.5). The Government will accept an offeror's claim of an item's environmental attribute on the basis of_ (1) Participation in a Federal agency sponsored program, e.g., EPA's Energy Star Computer program; (2) Verification by an independent organization that specializes in certifying such claims; or (3) Possession of competent and reliable evidence. For any test, analysis, research, study or other evidence to be ``competent and reliable,'' it must have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results. (End of Clause) Dated: November 15, 1993. Richard H. Hopf, III, Associate Administrator, Office of Acquisition Policy.
