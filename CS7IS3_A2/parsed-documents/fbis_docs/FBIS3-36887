In Leninogorsk the prime minister visited the Riddersky mine in the Obruchovskaya valley, which is a big mineral deposit of ores with gold, silver, and zinc which can be recovered in big amounts with little expenditures. Foreign firms are very interested in these deposits. In Ust-Kamenogorsk, the prime minister familiarized himself with a new store run by the titanium and magnesium combine. This store is currently under construction and is expected to be commissioned this year. Mr. Tereshchenko examined samples of products from titanium and displayed interest in the way the combine tackles its problems in selling the products. He gave useful advice on the problem. He also met representatives of parties and public movements of the oblast. During the conversation, the head of government stressed that the disintegration of economic ties in the former USSR influenced all spheres of life. New burdens were placed on the nation's shoulders after Kazakhstan had to opt out of the ruble zone. In order to tackle the problem, President Nazarbayev recently put forward an initiative to create a supranational currency -- the altyn, from which all the republics could have benefited. The head of government said: "We are aware how complicated the situation is. One of the reasons for this are non-payments. Enterprises of the oblast have over 1 billion tenge of debts. Main debts and counterclaims will shortly be offset. This will help to find out insolvent and loss-making enterprises which will be declared bankrupt. "Many enterprises ask for loans and demand that power should be made cheaper. Kazakhstan will soon receive over 1 billion in foreign loans but we will not allow credit issue [sentence as received]. The money will be mainly channeled to the economy. "Russia sells us power at virtually world prices and we should accelerate the commissioning of another power generating unit of Ekibastuz-2 which will allow us to to reduce our import of energy. "Our agriculture is inefficient. We have much greater production costs per tonne of grain in comparison, say, with Canada. We should implement advanced technology in agriculture so as to reach a modern production level in in 5-7 years. "We have discussed dual citizenship here. But people of over 100 nationalities live in Kazakhstan. If we pass the law on dual citizenship, what kind of situation will we have in our sovereign state? I think we have a different way out. We are preparing a treaty with Russia according to which every person who leaves Kazakhstan for the Russian Federation will obtain its citizenship, and vice versa. In order to stop specialists leaving, we are elaborating a document which envisages signing 5-7 year contracts with a better salary. "The language policy is constantly the focus of attention of the state leadership. The president will soon speak very precisely on these issues."
