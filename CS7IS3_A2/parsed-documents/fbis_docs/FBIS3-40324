Union representatives reminded the public on Wednesday that unions were again excluded from such an important matter as the agreement on minimum pay. At the same time they denied all responsibility for renewed protests by workers. That there will be new strikes is evident from the data that 20 dinars are not even enough to buy a liter of milk and 600 gram of bread a day. The cost of the daily consumer basket is equal to the minimum monthly pay. To buy just bread and milk, a worker would need 39 "super dinars" a month, twice the minimum wage. As a result, 800 IMT workers blocked Tosin Bunar Street in front of their factory in Novi Belgrade on Tuesday. They demanded from the government an immediate one-time payment of DM100 per employee, a regular supply of food and other necessities, and a guaranteed monthly income to enable their families "to survive and not to starve." More than 600 Zastava workers from Kragujevac announced a general strike on Wednesday. These are the employees of the defense plant, which is the only one still in operation. The Kragujevac "gunsmiths" demand pay of DM20 a week as well as the resignation of Director Vukasin Filipovic, whom they accuse of numerous abuses. The Kragujevac workers announced: "No appeals or pressures from Belgrade will stop our strike. It is easier for us to sit hungry than to work hungry."
