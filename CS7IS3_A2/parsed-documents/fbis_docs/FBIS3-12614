Asked by an AL-'ARABI correspondent if an earlier statement he made, expressing readiness for dialogue with the Israelis, remains valid after the massacre in the Ibrahimi mosque, the mufti asked: "What is the use of canceling dialogue between the Arabs and Israelis?" The AL-'ARABI correspondent said the mufti's office represents a symbol for Muslims in Egypt and is therefore in a delicate position; it must not get embroiled in efforts aimed at normalization with the enemy, something that several professional associations and popular organizations still oppose. The mufti commented, saying: "Don't get emotional. We are averse to dialogue with no one, as long as it can help to solve problems and conflicts."
