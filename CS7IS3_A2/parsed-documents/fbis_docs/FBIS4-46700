Smaha: "The Steal of the Century? PRYVATNA SPRAVA Invites a Public Debate in the Pages of VECHIRNIY KYYIV by Officials of the State Property Fund and the Anti-Monopoly Committee Concerning Privatization in Ukraine"] [Text] Wonderful are Thy works, O Lord! Mass privatization in Ukraine is still in the talking stage. And at this crucial moment, its main character--the State Property Fund--sends the draft "Ukraine Law on Changes to the Ukraine Law `On the Privatization of State Enterprises'" to the Supreme Council and the President for signature. The bill reads: "The Supreme Council decrees that the following changes be made to Paragraph 1, Article 8 of the Law: remove the words `citizens of Ukraine.'" That passage of the Law reads: The right to privatization shall be enjoyed by citizens of Ukraine, foreign citizens, and stateless persons.... So it looks as if the State Property Fund does not want fellow-citizens. They are just in the way. But why? Let us recall that the State Property Fund soon plans to privatize 150 items of state property that it has designated and to run an advertising campaign inviting people to invest their certificates in them. Is this bad or good? "What associations does the number 150 call up for you?", television viewers are asked. Let us reflect on this. There are 76,000 [as printed; probably should be 6,000] state enterprises in Ukraine. Formally they are matched by citizens' 52 million privatization certificates. How many of those 52 million vouchers do you think the State Property Fund will attract to those 150 enterprises? And how many vouchers will be left over for privatizing the 5,850 (approximately) enterprises that are left over? Do you see? Try to imagine how much your voucher will depreciate when millions of people try to invest theirs in the "first" wave of privatization. Everybody is aware that after that there will be a "second" and "third" wave. At that point, the State Property Fund is going to need intermediate agents. The list of them has already been designated by state decision. It is the agent's aim, of course, to make a profit. Therefore a trust (which is what the intermediate agency is called) will obtain from citizens both their certificates and the right to exercise ownership. Let us emphasize that it is their lawful right. Hence, the "first" wave of privatization as planned by the State Property Fund will cut the price of the vouchers, while the "second" and "third" waves will turn things over entirely to the financial sharks. We are assured that a certificate is worth a million karbovantsy [Ukrainian rubles]. V. Pylypchuk, a member of the former Supreme Council Presidium, reminds us that there have already been two indexations of fixed assets--by a factor of 11.5 and a factor of 40. The product of those figures should form an index by which it is useful to multiply the property value of the certificate. Having performed these simple operations, we divide the resulting figure by the dollar's exchange rate (40,000) and get 4,040 dollars. Even that, however, is not the market value of the certificate. An ordinary bathhouse in Odessa was sold at auction for 3 billion karbovantsy after a starting price of 1 million--a 3,000-fold increase. Hence, our correction for the market value (2.5 times) is maximally understated. In fact, the value of our Ukrainian voucher is vastly more than 10,000 dollars! (which, incidentally, has already been reported in VECHIRNIY KYYIV). If a person knows the value of his voucher, he will come to respect it more. And he will invest it wisely, and not just give it away to the first person he meets. Of course, citizens who try to do these calculations, and organizations which help them do it, trusts which have their own views on privatization, are undesirable to those who aspire to destatization for their own sakes. These latter were especially displeased by the newspaper PRYVATNA SPRAVA, which tried to explain people's rights to them and their chance to acquire their fair share of state property. In addition to a series of "accusatory" articles in the controlled press and the above-mentioned draft amendment to the law, Anti-Monopoly Committee Chairman Oleksandr Zavada himself sent a letter to the Deputy Chairman of the Board of SPPU [the Union of Private Entrepreneurs of Ukraine] (the newspaper is its organ) concerning the start of investigations into dishonest competition with respect to anti-monopoly legislation. A spicy detail: this was done at the initiative of persons having a particular interest--the Association of Securities Dealers. I have before me a copy of KOMERSANT UKRAYINY (No 13, March). It has a report of a meeting of the Association (I remind you that [a] this is not a state body, and [b] it is an association of businessmen). I quote: "The latest meeting of the Association of Securities Dealers held a preliminary discussion of spheres of control. The advertising [of PRYVATNA SPRAVA and the SPPU--editor] will have to be overseen by the Anti-Monopoly Committee." Think about that: a civilian commercial organization is directing a state body--the Anti-Monopoly Committee--to "oversee" someone's advertising. Where does the Association get off acting like a Masonic lodge in terms of influence on a state apparatus! Let us continue the quote. "The State Property Fund (FDM) was directed [emphasis mine--V. S.] to submit a proposal to the Provisional Commission of the Supreme Council on an amendment to repeal the paragraph on creating purchasers's unions based on residence." Which was done. True to its obligations, the FDM did on 1 April submit the appropriate legislative initiative to the Supreme Council (see above). In effect, this amendment would signal "privatization for foreigners," because the FDM (the letter to the Supreme Council was signed by Kaptsov, the FDM's acting chairman) was undertaking to remove citizens of Ukraine as subjects of the privatization process. After that legislative transaction, you and I were left with just one option--the trust. And that is exactly what they are waiting for. The FDM's bureaucrats have faithfully kept their promise to the dealers. A slightly awkward question arises. Exactly how are they beholden to the latter? And what about the rules of behavior of a state employee? In a civilized country, at any rate, merely publishing a bureaucrat's promises to a businessman would at least call for resignation and prosecution. It would be hard to assess it otherwise. The SPPU warned owners of privatization certificates against overly trusting civilian intermediary agencies and trust companies, which, as we know, are formed primarily to make a profit. The purpose of PRYVATNA SPRAVA is different. It is concerned with creating the material base for local business in Ukraine. The privatization option proposed by PRYVATNA SPRAVA calls for creating purchasers' partnerships all over, based on residence. It is this paragraph of the Law on Privatization that the intermediaries are against, along with the bureaucrats they have "recruited." The SPPU's Privatization Center is turning over to them a data bank of enterprises that are being privatized in a given locality. PRYVATNA SPRAVA has never taken a single privatization certificate from citizens, nor does it intend to. All of this completely legal activity is spelled out in the "Procedures for Creating and Registering Purchasers' Companies in the Privatization Process." The FDM and the Anti-Monopoly Committee should not oppose it, they should be glad that the privatization process is becoming available to everyone. Its operation is simple: citizens join together to find the most profitable ways to invest their privatization certificates. The firms help them according to the PRYVATNA SPRAVA model. They do not buy up vouchers directly. They have just one aim: to help people invest their certificates most usefully. Naturally, the service has to be paid for, but anyone dealing with PRYVATNA SPRAVA is not going to lose the main thing--the right to own the property he receives. I don't want to name specific enterprises, although there are many of them in Kiev, but directors are now creating closed-type joint stock companies for themselves and then transferring workers to the night shift while providing no work for them. They are happy to sign discharge papers, because a voucher, according to the company charter, stays with the enterprise. And new workers will not be proprietors but ordinary hired labor, that you can do with as you will. The most far-sighted politicians and economists can see this. When the scandalous facts of the exclusion of citizens from privatization became known to the press, the FDM started to "backpedal." The letter to the Supreme Council, they said, was not authorized by any Fund official. Those guilty of technical policy [!] have been punished. At a press conference, FDM Administration Chief A. Otchenash had this to say: "The girls typed the wrong thing." It isn't the citizens of Ukraine that the FDM is trying to prevent from taking part in privatization, as they say, but rather the purchasers' companies provided for by existing legislation. Why is it that the purchasers' companies stick like a bone in the throat of the Fund during the privatization of state property? Let us recall that there are several ways to destatize property. First, when the state itself directly undertakes the entire process. What that leads to, we know. Second, the process is undertaken by an intermediary--the trust company. Naturally, "XYZ promises to turn your voucher into gold." But Naftoinvest in Russia in bankrupt, and 500,000 citizens who entrusted their vouchers to it don't know what to do. The third option is to create a purchasers' company as provided for by law. It is astonishing how newspaper journalists who pretend to leadership in the economic press can pour abuse on this new and progressive endeavor, without even taking a look at the law. If that is so hard to do, we repeat that the Ukrainian investment company PRYVATNA SPRAVA has never involved itself in any activity with privatization papers. And the activities of the SPPU's Privatization Center PRYVATNA SPRAVA have nothing to do with intermediary agency and are not subject to licensing. According to Article 6 of the Ukrainian Law on Privatization of the Property of State Enterprises, the following are subjects of privatization: state privatization agencies, purchasers, sellers, and intermediaries. Article 8 of that same Law states that the FDM "shall issue licenses to intermediaries." Article 8 defines purchasers' companies as purchasers, and they do not need licenses. It is hard not to agree with the comments of V. Lesin, the Chairman of the Kiev Chapter of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Ukraine, concerning this story: "For three years now, the State Property Fund has been going through the motions of privatization while actually making it available only to a narrow circle of people. Of the results of its activities we can say confidently that it is obstructing the Law on Privatization.... "Under these conditions, the Liberal-Democratic Party of Ukraine (LDPU) and the SPPU initiated mass privatization in the interests of all the citizens of Ukraine. The initiative was supported by the PRYVATNA SPRAVA company. All over Ukraine, including Kiev, lawful purchasers' companies began to be set up on the basis of residence. Their activities began to encroach upon the interests of certain financial groups and nomenklatura bureaucrats. A flood of disinformation, lies, and slander was launched. It took on the character of a campaign directed, ultimately, against the citizens of Ukraine, who want to dispose of their privatization certificates as they see fit, without intermediaries. "You see, if the citizens of Ukraine become owners--that is, if they obtain the share of state property they have coming to them, then we will be living in a different kind of state where the main thing will be to work for oneself today rather than for some mythical wellbeing in the future. The Kiev Chapter of the LDPU vigorously protests the legislative initiative of the FDM." Also very eloquent are the words of the famous economist Volodymyr Pylypchuk, a people's deputy to the new convocation of the Supreme Council. A reporter asked him these questions: "How do you assess the latest `legislative' initiatives of the FDM?" "It is utter nonsense to exclude the citizens of Ukraine from privatization. The Supreme Council would not allow it. "And now the bureaucrats are saying that the proposal was a mistake made by technical workers and are preparing a new one that would make purchasers' companies based on residence unlawful. "The FDM's games are its death throes. Right now the FDM and the Anti-Monopoly Committee are our most passive structures. Compare their activities to similar ones in Russia. Voucher-based privatization there is nearing completion. The final hundred days. With us, it's the first 150 enterprises. The work has hardly even started. In other words, they're a pack of do-nothings." We have to forgive this eminent politician his harsh words. But even the most prudent words cannot explain something that is incomprehensible. The head of the PRYVATNA SPRAVA chapter in Mykolayevo, Valentin Kryvosheyev, has been commanded by the local department of the FDM to have all 700 members of the purchasers' company report for registration; this is in conflict with the law. The FDM is not an organization that grants permission but one that registers. And, according to the law, its departments are supposed to register purchasers' companies within a 10-day period. Why isn't this being done? So far, neither the FDM nor the Anti-Monopoly Committee have distinguished themselves by anything except abusive and illegal letters to the press and attempts to thwart the new endeavor by any means possible. And it is too important to allow it to drift. It is a matter, fundamentally, of the fate of Ukraine. Is privatization here to serve the nomenklatura or the people? Are we to create a class of moneybags and a mass of disenfranchised beggars, or are we to lay that which is the the backbone of any civilized society--a large stratum of small proprietors? These are the most acute questions on the agenda. This is why the editors of VECHIRNIY KYYIV, true to its democratic traditions, intend to organize a debate of officials of the FDM, the Anti-Monopoly Committee, and PRYVATNA SPRAVA. Let the parties concerned use these pages to express their views on how to solve the problem which, we can say without exaggeration, will determine the fate of Ukraine. We also invite readers to express their thoughts. Please write to us. We will not allow our great and long-suffering people to be cheated anymore.... PRYVATNA SPRAVA Is Legal. The Actions of the State Property Fund Are in Conflict With the Constitution. The Ukrainian Supreme Council Control Commission for Matters of Privatization has examined the FDM's representation regarding the activities of PRYVATNA SPRAVA with regard to the creation of purchasers' companies on the basis of citizens' residence. The Commission has stated that the measures being taken by PRYVATNA SPRAVA to create purchasers' companies are not in conflict with Ukrainian laws on privatization. A news item on this issue was submitted to the Press Service of the Supreme Council on 19 April 1994 by Yu. L. Kamyanin [surname unclear], the head of the Commission's secretariat. But for reasons that are unclear, the document was not made public. Instead, certain newspapers published FDM materials which groundlessly vilified PRYVATNA SPRAVA and the Union of Private Entrepreneurs of Ukraine. The Commission also examined the FDM's proposal to exclude citizens of Ukraine from the list of subjects of privatization of state property as designated in Article 8 of the Ukraine Law "On the Privatization of the Property of State Enterprises." That proposal has been declared to be in conflict with the Constitution and laws of Ukraine and cannot be endorsed as a legislative initiative.
