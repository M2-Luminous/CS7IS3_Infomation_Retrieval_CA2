FR940810-0-00014 FR940810-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;49&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8999; AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A300 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; rescission. SUMMARY: This amendment rescinds 14 Airworthiness Directives (AD), which are applicable to all Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes. Those AD's require repetitive inspections to detect fatigue cracks in certain areas of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer; and repair, if necessary. The requirements of those AD's were intended to prevent reduced structural capability of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer. Since the issuance of those AD's, the FAA has issued an AD that requires the accomplishment of certain inspections or modifications that terminate the requirements of the 14 AD's issued previously. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 10, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1989 and 1990, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the following 14 AD's, applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes: ␣ 1AD No. 1Amendment No. 1Federal Register citation 1Date published in Federal Register 89&hyph;25&hyph;07 39&hyph;6404 54 FR 49267 Nov. 30, 1989. 89&hyph;26&hyph;03 39&hyph;6417 54 FR 50487 Dec. 7, 1989. 90&hyph;02&hyph;20 39&hyph;6468 55 FR 999 Jan. 11, 1990. 90&hyph;02&hyph;21 39&hyph;6482 55 FR 1579 Jan. 17, 1990. 90&hyph;03&hyph;01 39&hyph;6483 55 FR 2231 Jan. 23, 1990. 90&hyph;03&hyph;14 39&hyph;6491 55 FR 2634 Jan. 26, 1990. 90&hyph;06&hyph;01 39&hyph;6533 55 FR 8125 Mar. 7, 1990. 90&hyph;06&hyph;05 39&hyph;6536 55 FR 8115 Mar. 7, 1990. 90&hyph;06&hyph;08 39&hyph;6535 55 FR 8119 Mar. 7, 1990. 90&hyph;06&hyph;11 39&hyph;6534 55 FR 8121 Mar. 7, 1990. 90&hyph;06&hyph;15 39&hyph;6542 55 FR 10042 Mar. 19, 1990. 90&hyph;06&hyph;17 39&hyph;6543 55 FR 10044 Mar. 19, 1990. 90&hyph;07&hyph;03 39&hyph;6552 55 FR 10600 Mar. 22, 1990. 90&hyph;08&hyph;19 39&hyph;6576 55 FR 13758 Apr. 12, 1990. Those AD's require repetitive inspections to detect fatigue cracks in certain areas of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer; and repair, if necessary. Those actions were prompted by full-scale fatigue testing by the airplane manufacturer, which revealed cracking in certain areas of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer. Those conditions, if not corrected, could result in reduced structural capability of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer. Since the issuance of those AD's, the FAA has issued AD 93&hyph;01&hyph;24, amendment 39&hyph;8478 (58 FR 6703, February 2, 1993), which requires supplemental structural inspections to detect fatigue cracking, and repair or replacement, if necessary; or the installation of specific modifications on certain Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes. Paragraph (j) of AD 93&hyph;01&hyph;24 specifies that accomplishment of the requirements of that AD constitutes terminating action for the 14 AD's listed previously. AD 93&hyph;01&hyph;24 became effective on March 9, 1993, and the actions specified in that AD were required to be accomplished within one year after that date. Since the actions required by AD 93&hyph;01&hyph;24 were required to be accomplished by March 9, 1994, and because such accomplishment constitutes terminating action for the requirements of the 14 AD's listed previously, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to rescind those AD's in order to eliminate redundant requirements. Since this action rescinds requirements that have been rendered moot by subsequent AD action, it has no adverse economic impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. For the same reason, the FAA has determined that there is no particular public interest in this action. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary and the rescission may be made effective upon publication in the Federal Register . The Rescission Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendments 39&hyph;6404, 39&hyph;6417, 39&hyph;6468, 39&hyph;6482, 39&hyph;6483, 39&hyph;6491, 39&hyph;6533, 39&hyph;6536, 39&hyph;6535, 39&hyph;6534, 39&hyph;6542, 39&hyph;6543, 39&hyph;6552, and 39&hyph;6576. 94&hyph;17&hyph;04 Airbus Industrie: Amendment 39&hyph;8999. Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;49&hyph;AD.
