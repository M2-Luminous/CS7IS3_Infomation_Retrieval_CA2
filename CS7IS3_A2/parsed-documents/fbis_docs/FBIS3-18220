An hour ago the Finnish delegation met the EU representatives, who are due to convene any minute now. Overall, the situation in Brussels is really confusing. At about 0800 it was still being indicated that extra time would be allowed for the membership talks. It was said that the talks have been suspended and are due to be continued in a week's time. After long and difficult negotiations, the candidate members and the EU have not been able to reach an understanding. Greece, the current EU chairman, had already announced in the early hours the EU is seeking to reach agreement with each candidate member in parallel. The Finnish EU negotiating delegation has announced that, unless the situation clarifies in the morning, the negotiators will have no other option but to return home. The Finnish attitude to the situation is not yet known. At about midnight, empowered by the government, Finland put forward a new negotiation offer to the EU. In this offer Finland compromised somewhat on its original demands. The EU rejected the offer and the government, which had convened in Helsinki, dispersed. The Finnish Government has just met to receive the latest information about the negotiations in Brussels. The government is studying the situation at the EU membership negotiations in the Council of State banqueting suite.
