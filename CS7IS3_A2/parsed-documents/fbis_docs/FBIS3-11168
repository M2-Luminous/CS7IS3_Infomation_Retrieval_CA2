President Menem interrupted to tell him that he himself had supported it. Saul Bouer, who was seated directly opposite Cavallo, ended his rift with the economy minister. Domingo Cavallo waited for the right moment. When Armando Caro Figueroa finished his weekly defense of more flexible labor laws, the economy minister asked for the floor: "I am going to raise a point of privilege," he said, unexpectedly recalling his brief time in the legislature. Everyone realized that this marked the beginning of what they were all waiting for: the last round in the fight between Cavallo and Buenos Aires Mayor Saul Bouer. The justification for his solemn introduction, which was unlike the language typical of cabinet meetings, was not long in coming. Cavallo complained officially about the "lack of solidarity of the Executive and Legislative" branches with him and his efforts in light of developments over the past few days (read: his defense of the automotive industry against the onslaught of the DGI [General Directorate of Taxation]), the battle with Saul Bouer and Miguel Angel Broda, and the incident with federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, among others. This was actually the conclusion that Cavallo drew after a detailed rundown of the attacks that he said he had suffered for the past two weeks. To show that he was not talking about rumors, the minister had done his homework and brought a folder containing clippings of all the newspaper articles about him during this time into the Situation Room of the Government Palace. Menem Speaks Out "Except for the president, who clearly backed me, no one here spoke up to defend me. The Executive and Legislative branches showed a lack of solidarity with me," Cavallo said, reducing the room to an uncommon silence. A reply came from the only person around the table who was not holding his breath. "Mr. Minister, do you know what the Executive Branch is?" asked Carlos Menem, as the other cabinet ministers looked on as mere spectators. "Because in case you do not, Mr. Minister, I am the Executive Branch. And I defended you not only this morning but also since I was on my trip through Colombia. So, the only thing that ought to concern you is what I say; the others are just incidental colleagues. Moreover, what I say I say on my behalf and on behalf of my ministers...." Hugo Anzorreguy's departure to answer an urgent call succeeded in tempering the chill that had descended on the room. By then the president's outburst had given Jorge Matzkin the courage to defend the other branch that Cavallo had attacked, the Legislature. "There is a confusion of terms here," began the head of the Justicialist bloc in the Chamber of Deputies. "The minister has repeatedly gotten our political solidarity; but we Peronists owe Bouer our friendship as well, and here we are talking about a different kind of solidarity...." Matzkin avoided direct reference to the heart of the matter: Peronism stands behind Cavallo's efforts but defends the Justicialists whom the minister is attacking. It was a way of excluding Cavallo from the Justicialist "space" by seeking to confirm a political identity. Menem then resorted to an almost paternal tone to illustrate his remarks and put an end to the issue: "Don't forget," he said, looking at all times into Cavallo's blue eyes, "that you have to be on good terms with God; the angels are always around..." according to the account of someone at the meeting. The president was thus trying to put an end to the episode that began last week when the former untouchables broke into the Sevel agencies. The minister gave an extremely personal analysis of the situation yesterday: "The fact is that if I do not come out and defend the model, I do not know who will..." he complained from his chair, directly opposite Bouer's, in justifying his verbal excesses. The mayor interrupted the minister's monologue only to tell his colleagues that the incident that had set them at odds (Cavallo accused him of having leaked the news that led to the run on the peso in 1991) was now "completely behind them." "We have already spoken in private, and there is nothing else to clarify," Bouer said 48 hours after his last attempt to resign. Several cabinet members remarked afterwards that yesterday Cavallo had made every possible "gesture" towards the mayor. He even apologized over the phone to Bouer's wife and daughter, who were the ones most interested in seeing the mayor return to private life. Cavallo Attacks Cavallo had begun his outburst by reading the main remarks that Judge Roberto Marquevich had made about him (calling him "raving" and authoritarian, among other things) in the newspaper interview that appeared on Wednesday. Newspaper clipping in hand, Cavallo received his first show of solidarity. Maria Julia Alsogaray, the secretary of the environment, recalled other "inappropriate" remarks by the San Isidro federal judge. Marquevich, who is now investigating Francisco Macri for tax evasion, was the one who sent another prominent businessmen, Roberto Constantini, to jail for an environmental crime. Again according to Maria Julia, the judge had also attempted to implicate her in the case. But Cavallo was not satisfied with talking just about Marquevich. He also complained about Alberto Piotti, the former judge who became a pro-Menem deputy and is now the brand-new Buenos Aires security secretary. Piotti, a member of the "Rating Group" (the band of deputies who wander around the mass media defending Menem's policies), had criticized Cavallo. Menem did not miss his chance to show, at little cost, how far his solidarity with his minister goes. He looked around him and saw Munir Menem, his brother, chief of presidential advisers and the virtual "owner" of the seats at "Tango 01." The president immediately ordered him to exclude Piotti from the presidential party that will be traveling to Spain. An hour after the meeting ended, the rumors about the short-circuit between Cavallo and the Executive Branch reached the financial district. But the sharp fall in the stock market lasted only 45 minutes. Calm then returned to nervous offices in the financial district and the government.
