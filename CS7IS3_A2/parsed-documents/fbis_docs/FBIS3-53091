It is not at its best. Of course, it could be worse. That all is not well is becoming more and more pronouncedly clear. The Al Murtaza firing death of a student supporter of Mir Murtaza Bhutto; the dramatic arrest, release and arrest of PPP activist Suresh Kumar; the weird allegations of harbouring RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] agents against Begum Nusrat Bhutto; the hasty suspension of a whole platoon of police officers and men in Larkana; Premier Benazir Bhutto's prolonged stay in Larkana; her renewed emphasis on a rapprochement with the much maligned MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement]; the swearing in of a bloated cabinet in Punjab; intermittent sparring between Punjab Chief Minister Wattoo and Senior Minister Hayat; the unexplained delay in finalising the government at the centre... One could go on and on with embarrassing items of omission and commission. In a word there is widespread scepticism about how confident a grip the Benazir Bhutto government has over the issues that need effective handling. What is undermining the PPP administration's image in public eye is the family feud which shows no sign of abating. The elder lady has not distinguished herself for either patience or propriety; the younger remains manifestly unsure. There is no doubt that she is trying her best to play it cool. So far, her best has not been good enough. The temperature is constantly rising. The Al Murtaza incident was exactly what the Prime Minister should have done without. No one except the PPP government in Sindh is to blame for it. There may or may not be a convincing case for the heavy hand falling on the Larkana police, but there is a compelling case against the Government of Sindh. From the very start, it went about its precautions to prevent untoward incidents in a very unwise manner. It virtually invited trouble and got it in unendurable abundance. This gigantic error of the Sindh Government has already cost the PPP leader so much of undeserved agony. And no end to it is in sight. The damage done is profound and painful. Part of it may now be beyond repair. What Ms. Benazir is apparently trying is damage-limitation. How much she may be able to salvage is still not very clear. The professional Cassandras may be exaggerating the losses incurred by the PPP, or the cracks in party unity. However, there is little doubt that a hairline fracture is there. It is a challenge to the PPP leadership to heal it. Patience, forbearance and even forgiveness may be the right recipe. Begum Nusrat Bhutto has undoubtedly been unduly rasping with her tongue. Perhaps she cannot help it at this moment in her life. But the real damage caused to the PPP is by its own jialas [workers] hurling thoughtless and undignified accusations questioning the integrity and patriotism of Begum Nusrat Bhutto. It is difficult to imagine of anything more condemnable. It is not the politics of civilised people. Political differences are understandable, debasing of politics is not. Let us not pollute the already muddied waters. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto would be less than wise if she failed to realise that there is need to lift politics out of the abyss into which it has fallen as a result of what should have been no more than a passing family misunderstanding sorted out pleasantly -- and in private. There is still time and room to set things right. Start by clearing the question of "succession". The Pakistan People's Party is not Bhutto family property. It is the legacy which the people of Pakistan -- no individual, however high or mighty -- is entitled to inherit. This humbug about Mir Murtaza Bhutto or the Bhutto widow, is the sole proprietor of the PPP, must be buried under a million tons of earth, never to be resurrected. The election of Ms. Benazir Bhutto as Party Chairperson should be regularised according to PPP constitution. And that should be that. The Prime Minister should accord the highest priority to a settlement with MQM, without which it would be almost impossible to normalise Sindh. And it is about time the Prime Minister started governing the country in right earnest.
