The operation to move the vessel to a safe place was ordered by the Pacific Fleet command after the workers of the plant and the mass media spread concern over a possible spill of radioactive wastes into the sea. Even though after a careful inspection of the vessel specialists did not register any increased radioactivity or the penetration of sea water into the containers with wastes, it was decided to take the tanker away from the shore.
