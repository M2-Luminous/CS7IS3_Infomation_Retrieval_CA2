The decision was made today at a plenary session of the OAS General Assembly in Belem by all of the 34 OAS member countries. Haiti has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1991, when Army coupists ousted the first elected president since the downfall of a previous dictatorship that had lasted approximately 50 years. OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares has described the OAS General Assembly's decision as unequivocal proof of a clear political will to resolve the Haitian crisis. In his opinion, the holding of the general assembly in Haiti will be instrumental in confirming the restoration of democracy in that country.
