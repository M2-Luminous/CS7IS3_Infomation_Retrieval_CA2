Major items for smuggling are China's chief daily necessities, such as training suits, fabric for Western clothes, underwear, and socks. These goods are smuggled into black markets in Pyongyang and other major cities of North Korea. In cities bordering China, particularly in Sinuiju and Hyesan, even youth and students are involved in the smuggling. So much so that the saying "senior high school students are excellent smugglers" is very much in vogue in these cities. The smuggling in the border area is being conducted mainly by the ethnic Koreans living in China, and it has rapidly expanded since it is possible to smuggle those Chinese articles into Pyongyang with only a small bribe. As a result, smuggled Chinese items have become so popular that almost all residents in Sinuiju and Hyesan are wearing at least one Chinese item of clothing. Meanwhile, it has been learned that South Korean goods are among the contraband smuggled into North Korea from China. South Korean trademarks are torn off prior to being smuggled into North Korea, and training shoes and socks seem to be some of the major South Korean items being smuggled in, according to a source. Those South Korean goods sell at high prices -- two or three times the price of Chinese goods -- because of their good quality. Those found to be using South Korean goods are regarded as political criminals and are sent to a camp for political criminals. Despite this regulation, the number of users of South Korean goods is ever increasing because of a shortage in daily necessities in North Korea.
