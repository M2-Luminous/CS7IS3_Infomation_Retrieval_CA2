I. Angelopoulos: "The Difficult Balance Between the United States and the European Union"] [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's talks in the United States and the statements that followed sealed the impressive "turn" of Papandreou's foreign policy. Even before last October's election, his associates already knew that the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] leader believed developments in the Balkans had brought Athens closer to Washington than to Brussels. After 10 October 1993, the prime minister saw that the majority of the European Union [EU] partners negatively viewed his return to the European scene. Their stance on the "Macedonian" issue became even tougher, something that disappointed and angered a significant part of the Greek popular opinion. So, although the U.S. State Department decided to recognize FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and the U.S. Pentagon considered that a military "umbrella" for the neighboring republic was necessary, Papandreou chose to trust the U.S. Balkans policy and tried to bring the Greek stance closer to the U.S. strategy and diplomatic approach in the southern Balkans. In the United States, the prime minister did not hide his satisfaction at the White House's "understanding" of the Greek problems. Addressing Greek-Americans, Papandreou did not hesitate to state publicly his bitterness and disappointment at the lack of EU "solidarity." In his statement after talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the prime minister "acquitted" the United States of beginning the Yugoslav affair and clearly implied that the responsibility lies completely with the strong members of the EU. All of this comes at a time when Greece holds the six-month EU presidency and Papandreou is preparing to chair the EU summit in Corfu in June. The prime minister's preference for the U.S. policy did not just appear on the Greek political scene after 10 October 1993. Former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis' government had originally favored the Balkans' policy of former U.S. President George Bush. It was during the time (1990-91) the U.S. leadership was opposing the division of Yugoslavia. Greek political "attraction" toward the United States has since increased. At the same time disappointment has escalated at the policy adopted by the strong countries in the EU and the way they intervened in military clashes in the former Yugoslavia. The "turn" toward the United States is now a fact. This development, however, leads to a basic question: What are Greece's relations with the European Union today and what does the government believe they will be in the future? Will the issue of Skopje prove to be "fatal" for Greek-EU relations? What will happen in connection with the "harsh" conditions for Greece stemming from the Maastricht Treaty? It is a fact that the EU is not in a position to formulate a common foreign policy. It is also a fact that the majority of EU members do not share Athens' view regarding the Balkans. From the beginning of this great crisis in the former Yugoslavia, Greece found itself "isolated" from the community, not only because there was rejection of Greek views and arguments, but because the strong EU members did not wish to allow Athens to take any initiative in the Balkans. With their stance adopted from the beginning, the strong partners showed that they did not want Greece to be considered, even occasionally, as an EU "spokesman" in the Balkans. The Germans, British, French, and Italians clearly demonstrated that the "new order" in the Balkans is "their business." But is it possible for the prime minister to withdraw the country's foreign policy from the European Union without endangering it and link it to that of the United States? Can he do that at a time when in the economic sector -- especially during a great crisis in the national economy -- Greece depends greatly (if not decisively) on communal funds within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty, which Papandreou has accepted? The prime minister appears willing to take the "risk" and search for solutions to the country's critical foreign issue within the framework of the U.S. foreign policy's designs and pursuits. In the United States Papandreou surely found interlocutors that were better than the ones he meets in the EU. What will happen next? How will the EU partners react to the "turn" in the prime minister's foreign policy? Will Athens manage to create a balance between Washington and Brussels? And what could happen tomorrow if Clinton's Balkan policy proves to be unstable or changes some of its basic points? Papandreou's bet is difficult and certainly does not lack interest. Only the future will show whether his risky political choice is justified. Right now it does not seem to contradict a large part of the Greek common view. However, the danger of inflating an "anti-European" feeling is visible today. We do not believe it is unreasonable to raise the issue at this point as to whether strong "anti-Europeanism" would be beneficial to the national interests.
