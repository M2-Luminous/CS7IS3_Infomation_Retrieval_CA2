Transport ministry officials said the French-registered Sherbro (eds: correct) had been docked at Amsterdam since Wednesday evening following the discovery of the sachets during the day Wednesday. The sachets, which the ministry said were lost overboard in December, contained two highly toxic agricultural fungicides. The substances can be fatal if inhaled or ingested and can seriously damage the eyes in case of contact. A ministry spokesman said the Sherbro was identified with the help of the Lloyd's register of ships. The Sherbro is owned by SCAC Delmas-Vieljeux, based in Dunkirk, and is insured by the British company P and I. The Sherbro lost 88 containers containing 500,000 sachets last December 8 and 9, while weathering an overnight storm off the French coast. Thousands of sachets have already been washed up on French and Belgian beaches. Delmas's representative here said the ministry was claiming five million florins (about $2.6 million) in compensation to pay for the clean up operation. The worst of the pollution discovered Wednesday occurred near Amsterdam, the ministry said. Most beaches along the Dutch coast were affected but most of the sachets were found at Velsen and Ijmuiden near Amsterdam. Police sealed off the beaches on Wednesday night and clean-up teams, equipped with protective clothing and goggles, began cleaning up the beaches on Thursday morning. In some spots there were six sachets per square meter (yard), the ministry spokesman said. Clean up work should take two days, the spokesman said, declining to estimate the cost. He added that two cigarette-box size objects had also been found near Amsterdam, also from the Sherbro. They were being investigated to determine whether they were detonators, he said. The Dutch subsidiary of Swiss chemicals giant Ciba-Geigy offered to cooperate in the operation, offering to transport the recovered sachets and dispose of them in a specialised plant near Rotterdam. It said it too would seek payment for its services from the container ship's owners, or their insurers.
