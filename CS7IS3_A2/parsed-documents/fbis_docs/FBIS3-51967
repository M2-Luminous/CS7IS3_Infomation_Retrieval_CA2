Assistant Secretary General of the OAS, Christopher R. Thomas, said a major objective of the assembly "is to look at ways of boosting and promoting development in the context of consolidating democracy in the hemisphere". Development, he added, "is at the core of the stability of democracy and progress of most of the countries of the hemisphere and so we must pay special attention to issues such as critical poverty which threatens stability and democracy". According to Thomas, the special general assembly will also examine the mechanisms through which OAS technical assistance is provided so as to make such assistance more effective. He said the assembly will consider a recommendation that two instruments within the OAS responsible for the provision of technical assistance - the Inter-American Council for Economic and Social Affairs and the Council for Education, Science and Cultural Affairs - be merged into a single council for integral development. The establishment of a single council, he said, will provide for better coordination and serve to make OAS technical assistance more effective and efficient. "I know there is some concern in the Caribbean that this new development because of the emphasis it places on the multilateral approach to providing technical assistance could result in a reduction of such asssistance to our Caribbean member-nations, but there is no tangible indication of this," he said. Mexico's permanent representative to the OAS, Ambassador Alejandro Carrillo Castro, said the assembly was being convened "so that we can focus on the issue of critical poverty and take advantage of this new mechanism to ensure the best use for all of us of the resources at our disposal." Canada's permanent representative to the OAS, Brian Dickson, chairs one of two sub-committees preparing for the special general assembly. He said in an interview that the establishment of a single council for integral development within the OAS "will help to alleviate problems such as duplicaton and over-bureaucratization" which impede the effectiveness of technical asssitance. "The OAS has made, we think, some very important efforts to reform and to adapt itself to the beginning of a new century and to respond to the new challenges which are before us. "We believe that the efforts it is making in the area of technical assistance are very important in analyzing what the OAS is doing now, how it could do things better and how it could be more responsive to the needs of the hemisphere," Dixon said.
