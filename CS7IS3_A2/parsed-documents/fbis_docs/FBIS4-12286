An upcoming multilateral meeting in the Hague on the environment will not be boycotted. Instead Jordan will be sending a junior diplomat to the meeting in a gesture that is meant to send a double message to the international community: The Kingdom is committed to the peace process; yet it will not accept to be taken for granted when a national interest is at stake. Jordan will thus attend the meeting to prove that we will go all the way to advance the cause of peace in the region. But by doing so, at a minimum level of representation, we intend to drive the point home that unless our legitimate rights and concerns are properly addressed, we will have to do what is necessary in the future to protect this country and its people. All through its history, Jordan has demonstrated its genuine interest in bringing about a just and lasting peace to the region. In the words of many American officials, Jordan has been an oasis of moderation in the area. The Kingdom never played the spoiler game. it is not about to start that now. The warning that the unfair and unjustifiable siege against al-'Aqabah should end was a call prompted by the country's real need to have that done right away. For years, the Kingdom has been applying quiet diplomacy to have its concerns dealt with. But little attention did the decision-makers in Washington and the United Nations give to the country's requests, it seems. When Jordan exhausted all possible channels without receiving a positive answer, it resorted to the only option left to it: Let the whole world know that it is no longer willing to have its rights violated at a time when it is meeting all its obligations under international law and norms. The United States, which repeatedly said it "understood" Jordan's concern, was supposed last week to discuss means of enforcing the sanctions against Iraq without continuing to hurt the Kingdom. Yet that did not happen, apparently because the various U.S. government organs needed more time to study the matter, but more likely because the Clinton administration did not want to appear as bowing to pressure from a small country like ours. The U.S. would be wrong to think Jordan is merely playing a political game over the issue of sanctions and their implications on our economy. We do not need to make political capital this way. Jordan wants a speedy solution and has gone out of its way to prove its goodwill, by sending a delegate to the Hague's meeting. Washington should reciprocate. Nobody doubts the ability of the U.S. to find a suitable way of enforcing the sanctions against Iraq without hurting Jordan if it wanted to. Otherwise, Jordan has at least to be compensated for all the economic losses sustained as a result of those sanctions. After all, the way the international community chooses to deal wth this problem will be an important indication of what it might do to bring about real peace in the region. If it is going to be an imposed, shaky peace, Jordan might not need it anyway.
