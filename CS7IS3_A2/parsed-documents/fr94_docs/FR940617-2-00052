The review will include details of classified defense programs throughout. A special agenda item for this meeting is the review of the draft ARPA Microwave and Analog Front End Technology (MAFAT) Broad Area Announcement (BAA). Because comments on the BAA are due immediately, and since the members necessary for review of this planning document could not be brought together except on this date, the normal 15 day advance notice requirement specified in the General Services Administration Final Rule, ``Federal Advisory Committee Management, 41 CFR part 101&hyph;6'' could not be met for this meeting. In accordance with section 10(d) of Public Law 92&hyph;463, as amended, (5 U.S.C. App. II section 10(d)(1988)), it has been determined that this Advisory Group meeting concerns matters listed in 5 U.S.C. section 552b(c)(1)(1988), and that accordingly, this meeting will be closed to the public.
