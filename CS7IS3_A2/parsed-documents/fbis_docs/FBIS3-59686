In regards to new type fuels such as nitride and metallic fuels, viewing from the point of its economics and safety, their future appears to be brighter than with the mixed oxides, and consequently, it is necessary to aggressively make feasibility studies and accumulate irradiation results. Furthermore, concerning the technical aspects of fuel production and recycling, the nitride fuels are technically on the same extension line with the presently existing MOX techniques. Therefore, it is believed that the outlook for its application is going to be easier to attain. 2) Medium Reactors and Small Reactors. By utilizing an appropriate size power output reactor core, it is possible to secure the reliability for the cores passive safety characteristics and the heat of decay removal system with ease. In concurrence with the technical development directed towards commercial large power generating reactors, the catching on of the developmental movements of medium and small sized reactors were investigated. As a result, in response to the diversified needs in the future, the foundations to satisfy these needs are to be built: -- Investigation of characteristics of medium and small sized reactors. -- Investigation of safety of medium and small sized plants. -- Investigation of the conception of medium and small sized plants. 3) Fuel Cycle. In regards to the technical development of fuel cycling for FBRs, further sophistication and application in fuel production, processing and recycling techniques are planned for the exceptionally high degree technically mature MOX. Also from the viewpoint of planning for the sophistication and harmony for the entire fuel cycle system, the TRU combustion technique and TRU recycling technical development are being promoted. Consequently, it will be necessary to coordinate and advance the development of reactor cores and fuel with these fuel cycling technical development movements. In Conclusion: Before the assumed FBR commercial application would be in effect by the early part of the 21st century, the FBRs would concur with LWR and the possibility points to the direction that they would become the main power generating facilities by then. In order for FBRs to be applied, the advancement and fixation of the technical development of FBRs must be made through the construction and operation of first the model reactor followed by the demonstration reactor. In addition, the commitments for long term and well planned technical developments are going to be necessary for the following. -- Improvement of reactor core characteristics -- Highly reliable safety setup for the heat of decay removal system -- Equipment integration such as using large capacity immersion electromagnetic pumps -- High performing fuel -- Elimination of secondary sodium system -- Shock proofing Therefore, hereafter, as in the past, under the countries' combined drive for developmental projects, it is important the government and the people follow each others assigned tasks and coordinate so that an efficient technical development can be promoted and a cooperative posture can be maintained. It is vital that these efforts be continued into the future.
