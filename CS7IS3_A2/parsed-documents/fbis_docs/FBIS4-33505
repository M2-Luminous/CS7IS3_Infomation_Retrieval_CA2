The Argentine president is to attend the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena, Colombia, on 14-15 June, and will then make a state visit to Canada from 20 to 22 June. The meeting being considered by the U.S. Department of State and the White House could therefore be held between these dates or on the way back from Ottawa. The idea of a meeting between the two presidents originated at the top levels of government. Yet when some weeks ago the president made it clear that he would not make a stopover in the United States on his trip from Cartagena to Canada -- that he would return to Buenos Aires due to affairs of state, and then leave from there for Canada -- some circles in Washington expressed their interest in Menem's reviewing his decision. In other words, they considered such a meeting to be quite possible. However, where could the meeting be held? As all the bureaucratic formalities have not yet been gone through, it is still not possible to talk about an event that is certain, but rather about the possibilities, which are the following: -- If the U.S. President were to decide to attend the inauguration of the World Cup of soccer or to go to some of the matches, he could meet up with his Argentine counterpart. -- If Clinton decided to spend some days resting in California, he could play golf with Menem. -- If Clinton's activities at the White House allowed him to be free for luncheon, Menem would lunch with him. Career diplomats, who are always willing to undertake difficult tasks (like this one, on account of the dates), believe that the meeting is likely to take place, and will even be a promising one. The analysis they make is that Argentina has become a reliable country and an excellent channel for conveying to big brother [preceding two words in English] the region's concerns. In the view of the sources consulted, the Summit of the Americas to be held in Miami on 8-9 December is just round the corner, and its sponsor, the United States, has not proposed subjects that have drawn much interest. Hence, the contribution of a friend might help the host to offer a more attractive agenda. Menem is very much aware of the importance of elections -- even those for electing Constituent Assembly members -- and knows that his friend -- according to the exchange of letters -- faces a difficult test in the upcoming November parliamentary elections. The lack of definition concerning Haiti, for example, may decrease the Democratic Party vote. In other words, from a domestic standpoint, it would suit Menem admirably to have another meeting with Clinton. After all, it would be another proof that the United States takes Argentina into consideration. Moreover, it would not be immaterial for Clinton to listen to the opinion of a partner who knows how to translate into words the thinking and reluctances of his Latin American counterparts.
