People were especially excited when they saw Deng Xiaoping, at the age of 88, making an inspection tour of Shenzhen and Zhuhai, pushing for a new upsurge of reform and opening up throughout the country. While wholeheartedly wishing Comrade Xiaoping good health and longevity, people also are interested in how this great and tested revolutionary has managed to remain in good health. A newspaper report revealed that Comrade Xiaoping's principle for healthy living is to lead a simple and spare life, and to do moderate exercise. According to the newspaper report: Comrade Xiaoping's daily diet is extremely simple. Breakfast: a small bowl of glutinous rice wine mixed with an egg, two steamed buns, a bowl of porridge, and a bit of soybean paste. Lunch: a glass of white or rice wine, three vegetarian dishes, a dish of soybean paste or chili paste, and two small bowls of rice. Supper: a glass of white or rice wine, three vegetarian dishes, and two small bowls of rice. He has some meat dishes only on Sunday. Comrade Xiaoping likes to drink wine, especially glutinous rice wine. He said: "I like to drink some rice wine. The brewing of rice wine is simple and easy, and I always do it myself. To brew glutinous rice wine, you first cook some glutinous rice, put it in a jar, and add some sugar and some yeast. Then you seal the jar, and the wine will be ready to serve in a few days." This is a very traditional formula in China for the brewing of glutinous rice wine. Comrade Xiaoping has adhered to the principle of a simple diet and has persisted in doing moderate exercise. A few years earlier, despite his advanced age of over 80, he used to go to Beidaihe to swim. Therefore he has managed to keep his weight constant. Constant weight is an extremely good indication of health for people of advanced age. A REUTER reporter once filed an interesting piece of information: On 19 December 1986, the reporter had an exclusive interview with Tian Atong, one of the four master tailors of the Hongdu tailor shop in Beijing, which is the Chinese leaders' specially designated garment supplier. Mr. Tian told the reporter: "I first made clothes for Deng Xiaoping in 1956. His figure has remained constant since then, so the cutting has not needed to be changed." This implied that Comrade Xiaoping had neither gained nor lost weight for the whole 30 years from 1956 to 1986. No change in the cutting of garment is an important indication of good health. In addition, Comrade Xiaoping, as a great proletarian revolutionary and the chief architect of China's reform and opening- up program, always has remained strong-willed, broad-minded, and optimistic, whether under favorable or unfavorable circumstances. This is not only a very lofty character, but also seems to be a part of his secret for healthy living and longevity.
