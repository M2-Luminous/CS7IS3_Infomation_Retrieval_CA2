The ministerial posts and the posts of political and administrative state secretaries will be filled on a professional basis. Judit Laszlo reports on the governmental committee session. [Laszlo] The two parties do not wish to amend the Constitution in order to transform the government, but the law on ministries will require correction, said Imre Szekeres, the committee's Socialist cochairman, at the end of the discussions. He added: The work of the new government will require 12 portfolios. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of International Economic Relations will be amalgamated. The new government will have to decide which organizations of national jurisdiction it will want. Until then they will come under ministerial supervision, said Imre Szekeres, who spoke about other decisions as well: [Begin Szekeres recording] We agreed that the internal structure of the ministries will not change; that is the 1990 decision, namely the separation of the political and professional tasks, will remain in force. In other words, political state secretaries will remain, whose first tasks will be deputizing for the minister and a liaison role with parliament. For the time being we have left it in the balance whether to change the name. There are two possible standpoints; I think that there is no dispute between us on this point; both are acceptable. What we must look at is which one represents less of a change, a change either of a legal or financial nature, if we alter the name. We have agreed not to alter the ministries' internal structure insofar as the professional work will be coordinated by an administrative state secretary, one administrative state secretary. However, we will propose that the number of deputy state secretaries should be determined in accordance with the tasks and not according to a general rule. In other words, that there should not be five deputy state secretaries everywhere where that number is not actually needed. [end recording] [Laszlo] The two parties are agreed that the majority of the minister without portfolio posts are not needed. There is a debate about the post of minister without portfolio in charge of national security. This topic will come before the plenary coalition session on Friday [17 June], as will the tasks of the various ministries, said Gabor Kuncze, the committee's SZDSZ cochairman. The politicians were agreed that one and the same party should provide the minister and the political state secretary for a given portfolio, but that one or two exceptions are possible. To this Imre Szekeres added: The important thing is that both the minister and the political state secretary should be experts, and if one of the parties can recommend a more qualified candidate, it is conceivable that in exceptional cases the minister and the political state secretary would belong to different parties. In answer to a question, Imre Szekeres said: If nominated, he would accept the post of SZDSZ parliamentary group leader.
