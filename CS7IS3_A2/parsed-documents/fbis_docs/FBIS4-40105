Will the new decree [On Russian Government Action Plan for Environmental Protection for 1994-1995] help our environment? [Yablokov] Undoubtedly. This decree is the first step in carrying out the not unknown Edict of the President dated 4 February of this year, which instructed the government to elaborate a specific plan of action for the protection of the environment for 1994-1995 and present a concept for its consistent development by 1 October. The plan of action has been elaborated by the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment together with the Ministry of the Economy, which is very important. For the first time, we are not setting the environment against the economy, but bringing them together. This step signifies the beginning of a new state policy in the sphere of the protection of the environment. After all, policy is when people who adopt decisions look far into the future. The shortcoming of today's politicians is that they most often adopt decisions for today. And after all, the environment is a matter of the future. [Lyashenko] What basic guidlines for the protection of the environment have been elaborated in the government's plan of action? [Yablokov] Primarily international cooperation. We need to determine how Russia fits into global ecological problems, such as the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect, and the protection of the oceans. Equally important are regional problems -- Lake Baykal, the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea, and the Volga. After all, this is not just a matter of individual regions. The health of the population, which is deteriorating disastrously, is a special sphere. Despite the fact that the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment assures us that the situation is improving, there are grounds for concern. In 1993 alone, the average lifespan fell by three years. A boy born this year has no chance of even reaching pension age, since average life expectancy for men by that time will be 59. And after all, our health depends on the environment by approximately 30 percent. The new decree is also important because all the federal programs and legislative acts named in it have been coordinated with the relevant State Duma committees. [Lyashenko] Will it not turn out that we will once again put off ecological problems till later and our good intentions will be left hanging in mid-air? [Yablokov] Unless we organize constant pressure on the government, and in the mass media too, then nothing will be done. Remember how it all began: The explosion of the ecological movement occurred in 1987-1989, then people forgot about it, and the economic confusion began. Today we have gone back to the original positions, because the burden of the environmental load is so heavy that the country may stumble and there may simply be no economic development. A very great deal in the implementation of the outlined program depends on the regions. After all, the government cannot operate by giving orders any more, like it used to in the past. And indeed this would not work economically: A large part of the money is in the localities. [Lyashenko] Are you satisfied with the normative base of the decree? [Yablokov] On the whole, yes. There are just a few sections of wording that do not suit me. For example, the law on waste from production and consumption. This concept is too broad. I think that we need a law on particularly dangerous waste. That kind of wording is more precise.
