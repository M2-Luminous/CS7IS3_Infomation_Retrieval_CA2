The HZDS is the major party in the government coalition and the SDL is the largest opposition party. The two men did not reach agreement on the date for the early elections or the extension of the present coalition, but the talks are to continue and a later agreement has not been ruled out. The SDL suggests September or October as a "compromise" election date while the HZDS sticks to the June term. "We have formed a basis for further alignment," party spokesmen said. "The [Slovak National Party] SNS led by Jan Slota is not an acceptable partner for the SDL," Ftacnik said, adding that he considers finding clear answers to the contents of the political agenda on future legislation and social, political and economic policy a priority compared with personnel questions. "If Meciar's government agreed to take on certain obligations, we could visualise the present cabinet leading the country to early elections," Ftacnik said, mentioning wider government coalition and replacing the present cabinet with another one with or without Meciar's participation as other ways to resolve the current political situation. "We remain a party of the opposition," Ftacnik said.
