FR940304-1-00039 FR940304-1-00008 Day 16 Removal from the refinery subzone 14 barrels of asphalt to customs territory, equivalent to 5,000 pounds. The 5,000 pounds of asphalt will be attributed to 5,000 pounds of PF Class II crude oil from Day 1&hyph;5. Day 17 Removal from the refinery subzone, 324 barrels of motor gasoline to customs territory, equivalent to 81,000 pounds. The 81,000 pounds of motor gasoline will be attributed to 1,000 pounds of domestic motor gasoline blend stock from Day 10, to the remaining 5,000 pounds of PF Class II crude oil from Day 1&hyph;5 and 75,000 pounds of domestic Class III crude oil from Day 6&hyph;15. Day 16&hyph;20 Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 169 barrels of Privileged Foreign (PF) 34 Class III crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds. Day 22 Removal from the refinery subzone, 214 barrels of jet fuel for exportation, equivalent to 60,000 pounds. The 60,000 pounds of jet fuel will be attributed to the remaining 25,000 pounds of domestic Class III crude oil from Day 6&hyph;15 and 35,000 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16&hyph;20. Day 21&hyph;25 Transfer, within the refinery subzone from one or more storage tanks into process, 143 barrels of domestic Class I crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds. Day 30 (End of Manufacturing Period) It is determined that during the manufacturing period just ended, that 34 barrels of fuel, equivalent to 10,000 pounds was consumed, and 5 barrels of oil, equivalent to 1,500 pounds was irrecoverably lost as provided in §146.53(c)(1)(iv) of this part, in the refining production process within the refinery subzone. The 10,000 pounds of fuel consumed will be attributed 10,000 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16&hyph;20. The 1,500 pounds of oil lost in the refining production process will be attributed to 1,500 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16&hyph;20. The remaining 3,500 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16&hyph;20 will be the first to be attributed during the next manufacturing period. III. Relative Value Calculation Because privileged foreign feedstocks transferred into process during Day 1&hyph;5 and Day 16&hyph;20 have two or more products attributed to them, each feedstock will require a relative value calculation. Relative value calculation for UIN Day 1&hyph;5, 50,000 pounds, equivalent to 150 barrels. ␣ 1␣ 1A lbs 1B bbls 1C $/bbl 1D product value 1E feedstock factor 1F r.v. bbl 1G dutiable bbl Residual, Oil Po; 40,000 119 15.00 1,785 .9047 108 108 Asphalt 5,000 14 13.00 182 .7840 11 11 Motor Gasoline 5,000 20 26.00 520 1.5682 31 31 n,s Totals 50,000 153 2,487 150 150 A=Pounds Attributed.
