The Croat delegation, accompanied by the Croatian ambassador in Geneva, Dr. Miomir Zuzul, met with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on Tuesday morning in Geneva to establish a joint negotiating position regarding the territorial demarcation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Zubak said that the Croat and Bosniak delegations would support the maps established by the Vienna agreement, which anticipates 58 percent of the territory for the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and 42 percent for the Bosnian Serbs. The Croat and Bosniak delegations are prepared to discuss the possibility of a compromise and the division of the territory into 51 and 49 percent, as stated in the European plan. With regard to the so-called corridor, the position of the Croat and Bosniak delegations is that, in principle, the Serbs being given a corridor is out of the question, as the Croats and the Muslims would then also demand certain corridors going through Serb territories, said Zubak. However, he added, if the international community insists on this, there is a possibility of introducing free roads in Bosnia-Herzegovina, under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control, in accordance with the solutions contained in the Vance-Owen plan. As far as the talks on the future political and legal organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned, we are prepared to discuss all the possible solutions, including the Serb side joining the federation, or a loose Bosnia-Herzegovina union consisting of the Croat-Bosniak federation and the future Serb republic, as stated in the Vance-Owen plan, said Zubak.
