We reviewed the remaining items -- there were approximately 19 -- on the Civic Committee's agenda. These include direct and indirect taxes, the treasury, and other items that were also addressed by the Economic Committee's talks in Paris. We also (?found) a way to transfer powers in these areas. As for outstanding issues, we will try to finalize them next week. These include such things as electricity, water, highways [al-turuq al-'ammah], pension funds, etc... Today we looked at archeology; we are not through with this subject yet. We will also discuss water-related issues and city planning next week. [Abu-Zayid] The Civic Committee is said to have made tangible progress from the beginning. [Al-Tarifi] The problems the Civic Committee has to contend with are fewer than those encountered by other committees. This is not to say that we did not encounter any obstacles. Yesterday, we worked out ways to surmount hurdles. [Abu-Zayid] What are the issues that have yet to be dealt with by the Civic Committee? [Al-Tarifi] We transferred the work of approximately 20 authorities, and about 19 authorities remain. I think that, God willing, next week will see us complete their transfer. [Abu-Zayid] And what about the water issue? [Al-Tarifi] We will address that next week, God willing. [Abu-Zayid] You looked at the archeology issue today. [Al-Tarifi] That's right. We exchanged ideas about the issue. The Israeli side brought along experts and we had one. We had a general exchange of ideas ahead of a more detailed discussion next week about a transfer of authority and powers to the Palestinians. [Abu-Zayid] What is your assessment of this week's talks in Taba? [Al-Tarifi] I think the resumption of the talks in itself is something extremely positive. We hope we will wrap up our work as quickly as possible. However, we should not let ourselves be unduly constrained by the time element, since this accord is supposed to meet our national aspirations and the Palestinian understanding of the accord. The time factor is important for the Palestinians. We must realize, however, that it is equally important for the Israelis. But let us not let ourselves become obsessed with the time factor by committing ourselves to a time frame of one week or two or three. More importantly, we must implement the accord so as to meet national Palestinian aspirations. [Abu-Zayid] The Security Committee is moving slowly, isn't it? [Al-Tarifi] The nature of the problems there, I think, is somewhat intractable. But we hope they will be sorted out. [Abu-Zayid] We were given to understand the talks will conclude today. [Al-Tarifi] You understood right.
