The significant decrease in the number of combat operations at the NKR's front lines during the past few days should not be taken to mean that tension has subsided. Regrettably, instability continues to exist. The reason for this state of affairs is the systematic firing on the Armenian defense positions by Azerbaijan's military forces and the concentration of Azerbaijani reinforcements and military vehicles in areas close to the front. This is not the first time that Azerbaijan's military command has used the relatively peaceful situation to organize wide-scale attacks. Although the enemy has agreed to hold talks to resolve the dispute, it has not abandoned its military operations. It is a fact that the talks held between the chairmen of the parliaments of the two sides was a hope-inspiring development. However, it is difficult to predict the outcome of their talks. The latest reports we have received from the NKR Defense Headquarters have confirmed our viewpoint. NKR advance positions in Agdamskiy, Martuninskiy, and Fizulinskiy Rayons were fired on with various types of arms from Azerbaijan's military bases in Fizulinskiy and Agdzhabedinskiy Rayons the night before last. The Armenian defensive positions in Yusifdzhanly, Novruzlu, and Egerly in Agdamskiy Rayon were fired on with various types of arms from the military bases in Agdzhabedinskiy and Agdamskiy Rayons. No one was wounded in the incidents. The Azerbaijan Military Command Headquarters has used its air force units once again. Two enemy aircraft tried to bomb Stepanakert at about 1020 yesterday. The NKR air defense forces took retaliatory measures. The first reports we received said that one of the aircraft was hit and downed near Dashbulakh in Askeranskiy Rayon. We recall that one of Azerbaijan's aircraft was destroyed in NKR's airspace nearly a month ago. Obviously, the losses suffered by Azerbaijan's air force units have increased. The situation on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan continues to be tense. However, serious clashes and exchanges of fire have not occurred. The situation can be described as relatively peaceful.
