FR941011-0-00002 FR941011-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 890 RIN 3206&hyph;AG03 Federal Employees Health Benefits Program: Debarment agency: Office of Personnel Management. Action: Final rule. summary: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to incorporate into regulations the statutory requirement that carriers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program may not deny claims for services or supplies due to the debarment of the providers who supplied them if the claimants could not have known that the provider was debarred. The purpose of these regulations is to comply with the provision of law that requires OPM to prescribe regulations on this issue. effective date: November 10, 1994. for further information contact: Margaret Sears (202) 606&hyph;0191. supplementary information: On May 10, 1994, OPM published interim regulations in the Federal Register (59 FR 24030) clarifying that carriers cannot deny claims based on debarment if there was no reasonable way the claimant could have known that the provider was debarred. When an individual who has not previously been notified of a provider's debarment submits a claim for services or supplies furnished by a debarred provider, the carrier must (1) honor the claim under the terms of its contract with OPM, and (2) inform the individual about the debarment of the provider and the minimum period of time remaining under the terms of the debarment. In practical terms, this generally means that the first claim(s) an enrollee submits for services or supplies received after a provider has been debarred, but before the enrollee has been informed of the debarment, is (are) paid to the same extent it (they) would have been paid had the provider not been debarred. The carrier must, at the same time, inform the enrollee concerning the debarment. The carrier will deny any subsequent claims for service or supplies furnished during the period the provider is debarred. OPM received no comments on the interim regulations. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affect Federal employees and annuitants. E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review This rule has been reviewed by OMB in accordance with E.O. 12866.
