This was an initiative of the Peruvian delegation. Information on this important agreement was disclosed by Ernesto Vera Tudela, member of the 11th Lima Criminal Superior Court, who represented Peru together with Victor Prado, Judge Irma Simeon, and prosecutor Loayza y Sanchez of the Attorney General's Office. The convention was held in Bogota, Colombia, and had the merit, thanks to Peru, of implementing an agreement that was signed but never enacted in 1988, when the first proposal to create a Judicial Assistance Office of these characteristics was made. Vera Tudela said that the Peruvian proposal was approved and received the congratulations of the Colombian Justice Minister himself, in view of the fact that offices of this nature, at a continental level, are currently necessary to provide information requested by any Judicial Branch of the area in order to be able to complete an investigation. Vera Tudela commented: "Police investigations were only coordinated through Interpol, but we lack a coordination between Judicial Branches in order to be able to complete investigations which many times reach a stalemate because the necessary evidence or information is retained in another country." He added that the purpose is to create this office at a Judicial Branch level so that it can encourage the signing of conventions and agreements of public need, to allow the clarification not only of drug trafficking crimes but also crimes against the state, trafficking in minors, etc.
