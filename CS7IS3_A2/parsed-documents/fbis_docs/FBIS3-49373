Speaking at a press conference in Warsaw, Aleksander Hall said that the decision of the majority of communes to delay the date of taking control over primary schools was the result of centralist policy of the government coalition. According to Hall, the left-wing groupings halted the process of decentralisation and weakened the prestige of local authorities. Hall announced that the PK would take steps to create anti-socialist coalitions during the forthcoming local government elections. Pawel Zalewski strongly criticised the draft budget for 1994 for what he termed as excessive fiscalism and the upholding of ineffective system of social security and insurances as well as the failure to reform the public sector. According to Zalewski, the draft budget for 1994 demonstrates that the "coalition has no will nor concept of reforming the insurance system and the public sector, while its shortsighted policy is designed to help the coalition to remain in power."
