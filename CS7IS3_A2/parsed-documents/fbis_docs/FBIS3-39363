This was indicated by Andrey Kasmin, deputy finance minister of the Russian Federation, speaking in a series of lectures at the Reconstruction Loan Corporation [KfW] in Frankfurt. The main goal of the "medium tough" stabilization policy remains the further reduction of inflation. There are particular expectations from cooperation with Germany; in this connection, Kasmin thinks that the relations with the KfW are more effective than those with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] in London. Furthermore, Kasmin did not want to leave unchallenged the impression that there is a permanent contradiction between the policy of the Finance Ministry and the attitude of the Russian Central Bank. In reality, there is now rather sensible cooperation at expert level, which is not so much noticed in public. This exchange is effective, and the parliamentary committee for supervising the central issuing of loans also has an influence on the Russian Central Bank. At the moment, however, the problem consists in restructuring the way the Central Bank is constitutionally anchored. In this respect, one must make certain pragmatic concessions during a transition period. This also applies to the issuing of loans to industry by the Central Bank. Here one has to take into consideration the social interrelationships of the large industrial and economic institutions. This sets limits for the restrictive course in monetary and loan policy. Nevertheless, it is necessary to make a really serious start with restructuring the real economy in Russia. This is the only way to ensure a future for the Russian economy. If one follows a tough course, which will logically be painful, one must keep the consequences of social dissatisfaction under control. if the current path is continued, however, and an uncontrolled influx of money permitted, it is possible to predict that Russian economy will completely collapse. For the First Time Saving With Positive Real Interest Rate Last year financial policy certainly made progress, Kasmin explained. After all, in December the inflation rate was reduced to a monthly rate of 13 percent, which, of course, is still extraordinarily high by Western standards. However, one has to set this against the background that throughout 1993 the monthly inflation rate was still between 25 and 30 percent. In addition, the financing of the budget deficit has been improved, and during the second half of the year it was finally possible to keep a grip on the development of the ruble exchange rate. Calculated on the basis of the dollar, real wages even increased, and at the end of 1993 it was possible to raise the interest rate for savings deposits of private individuals to such an extent in nominal terms that, compared with December inflation, they even achieved a positive real interest. After more than two years of negative interests, financial policy certainly has the ambition to bring about a general trend toward positive real interests, whereby the main goal of financial policy remains the further reduction of inflation. The volume of the budget deficit has been brought down to a rate below 10 percent of the national product. A certain amount of success was also achieved by means of a "medium tough" loan policy. After all, it was possible to limit the volume of the global loans controlled by the Central Bank to 12.8 percent of GNP, compared with 35 percent a year ago. However, one has to take into consideration the fact that these loans constitute 85 percent of the total loan volume in Russia. This shows the weakness of the country's financial and banking system. It is important to increase the share of loans issued by the commercial banking sector. Corresponding decrees can be expected in March. The attempts to establish a financial market are also showing the first, encouraging results. It has at least been possible to issue state securities for the first time -- three- and six-month treasury bills and gold certificates. Even though only 3 percent of financial resources are raised via these securities, the most important thing is that it has been possible to gain credibility for state securities at all. Financial policy planning envisages a clear increase of such issues for this year, and work is already being done on the issuing of medium-term state bonds. After the "child-like belief" that every city needs a stock exchange, these institutions are not so important at the moment. One must also first wait for the continuation of "coupon privatization." The currency exchange gained ground in the end. However, the development of the financial markets also requires the development of the securities markets. The securities dealers have already developed considerable know-how. In the end, it is intended to establish a unified securities exchange, which permits "real time" trade from Moscow to Vladivostok. In the currency area progress has been achieved by the fact that, after the dramatic period of confusion in cash circulation as a result of the uncoordinated behavior of 12 central banks, it was possible to establish new structures by revitalizing the idea of a unified currency area. Above all, it is necessary to develop orderly foreign currency markets in other ruble-zone countries outside Russia. Russia's foreign currency situation has been improved by the decree that 50 percent of foreign currency revenues must be put on the market. Kasmin said that Russia's foreign assets amount to $4.9 billion. In 1993, gold reserves went up from 243 to 305 tonnes. Passive Bank for East Europe In 1994 further negotiations about agreements with international financial institutions are planned. Further loan agreements are being prepared with the IMF and the World Bank. However, Kasmin's statements indicated disappointment concerning cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. The EBRD remains "surprisingly passive," Kasmin noted. A total of 16 projects covering an overall volume of $1.7 billion are being examined. Relatively little has been paid of the promised volume of about $174 million for the country's oil industry and for further infrastructure measures. In any case, the means received are clearly below the capital share of $56 million, which Russia has had to pay to the EBRD so far. So far, no progress has been made at the EBRD regarding the fund for medium-sized industries. All the greater are Russia's expectations concerning cooperation with Germany and, in particular, relations with the KfW. Kasmin expressly paid tribute to the relations with the KfW and to KfW advice. Cooperation with the KfW is more effective than with the EBRD. He expressed the expectation that the bank for medium-sized industries, which is planned in Russia, will be established this year. Increased integration in the discussions and agreements of the G-7 is of particular importance for Russia. Having been invited to the summit in Naples, Russia can practically be considered as the eighth member of this group of industrialized nations.
