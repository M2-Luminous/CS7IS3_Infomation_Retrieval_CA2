At a meeting with the Danish Slaughterhouse Association on Friday [29 October] Agriculture Minister Bjorn Westh (Social Democrat) maintained that for the sake of consumers he will not relax the action plan to combat salmonella bacteria in pig herds and in processed products from slaughterhouses. On the other hand the minister regards the slaughterhouse group's fear that up to one-fifth of the 1,500 medium-sized pig herds will come under public supervision by Christmas as greatly exaggerated. Only five out of the 50 medium-sized herds in which analysis has been completed so far have such a high incidence of salmonella that they have come under supervision. This corresponds to 10 percent and not the 20 percent the swine sector fears might be the result of the action plan. ``If the tendency holds expenses for the sector will be less than 150 million kroner,'' said the minister, referring to the slaughterhouse association's own estimate that the cost would be more than twice that amount. After the meeting the chairman of the Danish Slaughterhouse Association, Bent Sloth, said he was glad that there is apparently less of a problem in herds than they had feared. But he stuck to his criticism of the action plan and expressed disappointment that the swine sector did not meet with the necessary sympathy from Westh. But the group did get a number of concrete concessions from the meeting. The minister said among other things that he is prepared to discuss conditions for producers of small pigs, who have had problems with the plan, that it may be possible to reduce testing costs and that the authorities can help slaughterhouses find the most efficient methods of slaughtering salmonella-infected pigs. ``I well understand that with swine prices at the current low level farmers find it almost unbearable to have this additional problem. But it is no use complaining, we must try to get through it,'' the minister said.
