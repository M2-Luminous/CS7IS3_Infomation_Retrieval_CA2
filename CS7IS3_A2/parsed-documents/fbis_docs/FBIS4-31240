Meeting the demands of the striking workers would cause a loss of the enterprise's financial liquidity and make it impossible for the enterprise to meet its obligations, including salary obligations. The Katowice Steelworks would then end the year with a 720 billion zloty [Z] deficit and with an increase of salary costs amounting to Z130 billion, Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek told journalists on 6 June. The Ownership Transformations Ministry has also conducted estimates of two other possible options. The first one envisages further activity by the steelworks, without changes in the salary situation. Under that option, the company would have a chance to end the year with a surplus of Z160 billion. Under a second scenario, where it is assumed that agreements signed on 31 May by six trade union centers would be implemented, the steelworks would end the year with a deficit of Z86 billion, with salary costs having risen by Z45 billion. Because of the enterprise's particular significance for the country's economy (steel pig-iron) and a network of cooperative ties, the strike's impact will be felt not just by the steelwork's employees. If there is someone who is deliberately leading the enterprise to disaster, he should be aware of the consequences, Minister Kaczmarek said. He added that, in this situation, it will be the government's duty to have the necessary imports of steel for domestic industries, even though he would not like to threaten anyone with that. Katowice Steelworks lived through its worst crisis in the 1991-92 period. The year 1993 showed the first symptoms of overcoming the crisis--the steelworks ended the year with a positive result of Z590 billion and a net profit amounting to Z180 billion. At the same time, conciliation proceedings with banks were conducted as a result of which the steelworks' debt level was reduced by 30 percent. The remainder is to be repaid in 18 installments by the end of 1994. The company also received governmental guarantees for an investment in a continuous steel-production division. These measures created a chance for a better future for the enterprise. The current situation creates the danger of wasting what has already been achieved. I am afraid that the outcome of this will turn out to be dangerous for many companies in Poland that will have nothing to produce with. Already at this stage, trains with steel pig-iron are being prevented from leaving, and that is called anarchy. I am hoping that the strike organizers will come to their senses. In addition, all measures should be undertaken within the confines of the law, Minister Kaczmarek said.
