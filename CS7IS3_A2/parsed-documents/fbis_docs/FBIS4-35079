[Aristide] First of all, there must be reconciliation with my enemies and a judicial reform to reestablish justice. At the moment, one can still buy justice. Without money you will not get any justice. [FOCUS] The military will not give up so quickly after the "Tontons Macoutes" have been reorganized. [Aristide] Judging from my seven months in office, it is certainly possible to rule Haiti democratically. You can see this alone by the fact that after my election, those Haitians who fled under Duvalier returned. I claim that at the moment, 99.95 percent of the population support me. Many have fled abroad again and are just waiting to be able to return. [FOCUS] Nevertheless: Are all the military officers and other terror troops not a constant threat to you? [Aristide] Many of these people are abused by the Army Command. They are just afraid that they themselves will be killed. As soon as they realize that there is no point in fighting against the world, they will stop. [FOCUS] Will you put the military leaders on trial? [Aristide] No. First of all, I will issue a political amnesty. I have committed myself to that on the basis of Article 147 of our Constitution. [FOCUS] What role does the United States play in the Haitian conflict? [Aristide] With Haiti, the United States has one of the poorest countries right on its front door. Almost 76 percent of our foreign trade is conducted with the United States. In addition, more than 1 million Haitians live in the United States, who send about $300 million back to Haiti. If the United States, together with Haiti can revive democracy, this would be a positive signal for the entire region. In the end, the security of this hemisphere depends on what is happening now in Haiti. Just think of Venezuela. There the military wanted to stage a putsch along the lines of Haiti, but, fortunately, they failed. [FOCUS] Did you not expect more help from the United States and the United Nations after your ouster? [Aristide] We have decided in favor of a non-violent path. With this, we have gained respect. [FOCUS] But recently you demanded a military intervention.... [Aristide] No, I have never spoken up in favor of that. I still think of a solution with the help of the international community. We must finally separate the police from the Army, an Army that consists of 7,000 men but devours 40 percent of the entire budget. At the moment, there are 10 soldiers for 10,000 Haitians, but only 1.8 doctors. There is no sense to that. [FOCUS] Recently, you spoke of a "surgical intervention".... [Aristide] I just wanted to say that the international community should not just discuss the matter but also do something. Only a total embargo can shorten my people's time of suffering. Unfortunately, this was imposed only recently. Now the military's game is over.
