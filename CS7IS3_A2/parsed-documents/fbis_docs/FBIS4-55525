Klaus Answers LN"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Martinkova] In the context of the Hungarian elections, you declared the Czech Republic a little island in the sea of peculiar returns. How do you explain, however, that the Hungarian Socialists are promoting an economic policy similar to that of the Czech Government? Is there a difference between the left wing and the right wing in the declared stands or in specific economic measures? [Klaus] I made a very balanced statement on the Hungarian elections. The cheap little joke was at the very end of this and, taken out of context, it acquired an inappropriate setting. I am far from assessing the outcome of the elections in Poland or Hungary in a simplified manner. The idea that it is a return of the communists is a jest that did not come to my mind. Their ideology is markedly different from the former communist ideology. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that they are parties from the left of the political spectrum. I have never had any serious doubts that these parties could implement a more or less balanced and reasonable economic policy. On the other hand, I must say that, when I had the opportunity to meet with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialists, at a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum last year, our visions of the world were infinitely different. His arguments reminded me of debates on the economic reform scenario with the adversaries of our economic strategy in 1990-91. In this sense, it would be wrong to conceal the differences. The main thing is, however, that Hungary is and has been in all aspects a very close partner of ours. I am convinced that we will be able to cooperate with the new Hungarian Government just as effectively as we did with the previous governments, and I even believe that a certain sharp ethnic minority tone that was very strong in the previous Hungarian Government and that I have always feared a bit may, in this case, retreat into the background.
