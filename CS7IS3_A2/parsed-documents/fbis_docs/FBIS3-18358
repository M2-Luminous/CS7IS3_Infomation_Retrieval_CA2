Lambeck report: "Bonn Considering Involvement"] [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government is considering ways to become involved in the peace process in Bosnia. Although the Chancellor's Office denied reports that it was planning to send Bundeswehr medical staff and pioneers to Mostar, Chancellor Kohl said that for Bosnia one would "go to the bounds of possibility." The Chancellor expressly promised logistic help for the NATO countries involved in the peacekeeping operations, if this is required. This would involve air lifts and logistic measures in Italy and the Adriatic. In Bosnia itself, civilian relief organizations might become active. Together with the idea of having Mostar, besieged by the Croats, administrated by a German, plans have been published that Bundeswehr medical officers are to put the local hospital in order and German pioneers are to repair roads and bridges. On these allegations, the Chancellor's Office says: "We do not have any such plans." The prompt denial has a good reason: Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and government experts are afraid of a Serbian hunt for German helpers in Bosnia. "Only officials at conference tables could plan something like that," the Chancellor's Office said -- a discreet dig at the Foreign Ministry. After all, the Defense Ministry also has a plan for German soldiers to be made available in the former Yugoslavia: Once the peace process is finally under way and no more shots are fired in Bosnia, Volker Ruehe might consider establishing a field hospital in Croatia where the injured could be treated and UN peacekeeping troops supplied.
