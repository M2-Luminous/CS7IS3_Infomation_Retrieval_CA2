Violante, a member of the Democratic Party of the Left, came under heavy fire from parties and spokesmen on the right of the political spectrum after the Turin daily, LA STAMPA, published remarks in which he reportedly claimed the managing-director of TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's Publitalia advertising arm, Marcello Dell'Utri was under investigation by the Catania public prosecutor's office for Mafia ties in a case involving arms and drugs trafficking. The prosecutor's office denied the claim yesterday with a less than categorical statement, which deplored press leaks and voiced "surprise, alarm and disappointment" over publication of news which "should it prove true, would definitely jeopardise investigations." This afternoon, Berlusconi was meeting here with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in his role as president of the Superior Council of the Magistrature, the body through which the judiciary governs its affairs, to end what the media mogul-turned-politician called "this provocation against the liberty of the Italians." Reports that Dell'Utri has been named by Cosa Nostra supergrass Salvatore Cancemi in connection with organised crime activities have been legion in recent days, and there was court testimony from the late 1980's in which he was linked to Mafia figures. LA STAMPA's confirmation of its printed version of the remarks in which Violante is quoted as asking the journalist not to print some of his more flippant observations was greeted by Berlusconi's conservative Go Italy party as triumphant confirmation of a "Communist plot" to prevent the Right from winning the imminent elections. Other conservatives joined the chorus, most of them arguing that Violante, who said yesterday evening he was meditating resignation as an "act of conscience," should step down because his remarks may have represent a breach of the judicial secret. Informed judicial sources said that the name that had in fact occurred in the investigations was that of Alberto Dell'Utri, Marcello's twin brother, who apparently cropped up during telephone taps on the conversations of organised crime figures. Violante told journalists that it was the LA STAMPA reporter who had mentioned the Catania investigations to him, then putting the remarks into his mouth. He also said he had asked his lawyers to start legal proceedings, claiming he had been "trapped." Today, Violante's letter pointed out that, "beyond their party membership and political opinion," during his chairmanship at the Anti-Mafia Committee, all the committee members, who come from both houses of parliament, gave their full cooperation to enquiries that had for the first time elucidated the nexus between organised crime, business interests and politicians. "Consolidated equilibriums have been upset," he told the speakers of the two houses of parliament. "A start has been made to ascertaining responsibilities never identified before, and hitherto concealed collusions have become public and have been made evident. Whence the attempt to strike back, using every means and with the aim of delegitimising this work. The trap was sprung on a lie, and the attack is built on lies, using the contingency of the elections beyond any acceptable limit." Chatting with journalists, Violante claimed one should have "strong doubts" about the whole of the power system from which the attack against him and the Anti-Mafia Committee were coming: "When the first Mafia trials started, there was talk of plots. When a certain type of power is questioned and brought back in line with the law, there are shouts of a plot because it needs illegality." He also said he had received hundreds of messages of support, not least from the families of police and magistrates slain by the Mafia, adding that he was also acting in defence of his own personal values. Now 52, Violante has been on leave from his job as a judge since 1979 when he first won election to the Lower House for the Italian Communist Party after working as an assistant prosecutor in Turin, handling mostly terrorist cases. For his thirteen years in parliament, he has been a leading voice in the national debate on judicial affairs and played a direct role in moves in parliamentary enquiries to uncover the Gladio stay-behind operation, earning violent criticism from then President Francesco Cossiga who on one occasion described him as "the Italian Vyshinskiy." But the work that has taken most of his attention and projected him firmly into the public eye when he became the Anti-Mafia Committee's chairman has been organised crime. He was a major force behind approval of legislation on Mafia association and in support of witness protection programmes for Mafia state's witnesses. The Anti-Mafia Committee's reports on the links between organised crime, politicians and business were approved by a large majority. Even though he denied alleging that Berlusconi has any direct responsibility in it, Violante said he sees a "general strategy to delegitimise... my work and the commission's." "My impression is that the nucleus of interests collected round Go Italy is in deep continuity with the system of power that in the past caused so much mourning and so much damage in Italy," he added. In other remarks, he described the remarks published by LA STAMPA as a "pseudo-interview" and told reporters to refer to his denial. He also repeated that his resignation was not capitulation to the charges against him, but was to avoid charges of partiality being advanced against the Anti-Mafia Committee and its work.
