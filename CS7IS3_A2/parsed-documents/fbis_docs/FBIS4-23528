The total cost of development: 126 million rands. Marinus Wijnbeek reports that the tank demonstrates the technological capabilities of the South African arms industry. [Begin recording] [Wijnbeek] The tank technology demonstrator, as it is called, bears little relation to the existing Olifant tanks used by the armed forces. An important feature of the tank is its suitability for the unique and harsh African conditions. A number of South African firsts are incorporated in its design. This is the first tank that has an adapted commercial engine and cooling systems which ensure crew comfort under the hot African sun. The gun sight is stabilized for all-round functioning and has a thermal night sight. Only the latest American Abrahms has a comparable sight. The tank commander has state of the art passive night vision. The gun on the demonstrator has a 105-mm caliber, but this will soon be upgraded to a South African developed 120-mm, and later a 140-mm barrel. The maneuverability of the tank and its cross country and road speeds are 35 and 71 km/h which aren't at all bad for a 58.3-ton armored vehicle. It also has extensive crew safety systems in case it is hit by an enemy. This includes top protection. [Armscor spokesman Andre Buys] This tank technology demonstrator will be used as a test-bed to evaluate new technology and to retain our armor system capability. It will also be used to market our upgrading capability. There is an attractive global market for the modernization of older generation armored vehicles. [Wijnbeek] Impressive though it is, Armscor's latest fighting vehicle will probably not go into production. Although the tank's technology may find its way around the world, this demonstrator is likely to remain just that. [end recording]
