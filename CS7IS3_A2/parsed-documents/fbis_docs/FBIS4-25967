It has adopted all positive methods and measures to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of Shandong's national economy on the basis of fulfilling the quadruplication task ahead of schedule and raise it to a new level. These measures include inviting banking investments, transferring stocks, exchanging markets for technology, and expediting construction of two projects which will straddle the next century, i.e. the development of the Huang He Delta and the construction of offshore Shandong. In the course of the interview, Governor Zhao said: Shandong Province has earnestly implemented a series of principles and policies by the party Central Committee and the State Council and, in light of the province's reality, carried out its work in a creative way. It fulfilled the task of quadrupling its national economy ahead of schedule in 1993 and thus laid a good foundation for its development this year. Zhao said: In light of the international and domestic situations and environments, as well as the reality in Shandong, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have put forward an outward-driven strategy under which Shandong will boost its economic growth by developing its export-oriented economy and improving the quality of its economy as a whole. The utilization of foreign capital will be grasped as a key to boosting economic growth and numerous flexible methods will be adopted to extensively invite foreign investments, especially banking investments. Great efforts will be made to increase the number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises to over 10,000 and raise the foreign capital actually used to over $3.5 billion this year, an increase of over 50 percent. Governor Zhao disclosed: With regard to key development projects this year, the province has defined the direction of using foreign capital to build large iron and steel plants, power plants, and automobile industrial projects. The focus of foreign capital introduced into Shandong this year will be placed on infrastructure, basic industries, and the technological transformation of enterprises, as well as on capital and technology intensive industries. To this end, Shandong has selected a number of large and medium enterprises for "grafting" and transformation through the use of foreign capital. Governor Zhao said: Shandong should reach a new level in its exports this year. Beside bringing into play the role of foreign trade companies at all levels as a main force, we should take foreign-invested enterprises as a focus for expanding exports and strive to increase the province's foreign exchange earnings by 20 percent. Meanwhile, we should steadily develop Shandong's overseas enterprises and gradually improve such networks as the sales promotion of Shandong products abroad, fundraising, technological cooperation, and information. According to statistics, Shandong's overall economy has constantly developed in a good direction this year. There are three principal characteristics: The introduction of reform measures has been smooth and the transition from an old to a new structure has been stable; the national economy has developed in a sustained way, with the major indexes satisfactory; and social problems have been satisfactorily resolved. The masses are in a good mood and the society is stable. Governor Zhao said: In the first quarter of this year, Shandong's national economy maintained its fine development momentum, with a GDP of 66 billion yuan, an increase of 18.3 percent over the same period last year. The situation in agricultural production was fairly good, with total summer grain output expected to top 40 billion jin, the highest level ever. The growth in industrial production has tended to stabilize. In the first four months of this year, industrial output value at the township level or above rose by 27.9 percent and the production-marketing ratio was 92.1 percent, an increase of 2 percentage points over the same period last year. The scale of investment in fixed assets was initially kept under control and the export-oriented economy developed steadily. Foreign exchange earnings rose by 16.1 percent and the actual use of foreign capital by 25 percent. Financial revenue and expenditure rose steeply, with revenue growing by 21.8 percent and expenditure by 20.9 percent. The banking situation was fine, with deposits in financial institutions rising by 17.46 billion yuan compared with the figure at the beginning of this year and loans increasing by 6.26 billion yuan. Commodity sales were relatively stable, with the total volume of retail sales growing by 28.3 percent. Since reform and opening up over a dozen years or so ago Shandong, characterized by its rapid, stable, and overall development, has gradually developed into a big economic province on China's eastern coast. After reviewing the earth-shaking changes which had taken place in impoverished Shandong, which in the past was noted for its people "braving the journey to the northeast to eke out an existence," Governor Zhao said with feeling: We owe all this to the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to the party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," to the correct leadership of the central authorities, and to the hard struggle of the people of the whole province. He said: Shandong's strategic goal in economic and social development for some time to come will be divided into three steps: The first step is the goal of quadrupling the 1988 GDP ahead of schedule, which was accomplished in 1993; the second is to octuple the GDP by the end of this century; and the third is to attain the level of an intermediate developed country in Asia in 2010 in terms of economic aggregate and basically achieve modernization. Governor Zhao said: To achieve this goal, while improving the quality of economic development, we should strive from now till the year 2000, to attain a higher economic growth rate than the nation's average, with the GDP growing by an annual average of 10 to 12 percent, the total agricultural output value by 5 to 6 percent, the total industrial output value by over 15 percent, the added value of tertiary industry by 16 percent, the foreign exchange earned from exports by 16 percent, and a natural population growth rate of less than 8 per mill. Proceeding from the actual conditions in Shandong, we should focus on doing a good job of the "3321 project" (reinforcing the three foundations: Agriculture, basic industries, and infrastructure; fighting well the "three major campaigns"; invigorating Shandong through application of scientific and technological advances, developing the export-oriented economy, and developing tertiary industry; and doing a good job in the two major projects extending beyond this century: the "offshore Shandong" construction and the development of Huang He Delta), and cultivate a number of leading industries and superior products so that Shandong's economy can scale a new height.
