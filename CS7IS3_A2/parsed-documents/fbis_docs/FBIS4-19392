He holds the view that the wish of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for a reaction force of this kind is "right in principle," Kinkel said today on Hessischer Rundfunk radio. At the moment it is the case that the United Nations always has to go begging when it is a question of getting troops for stemming or eliminating crises in troublespots. "We have told Butrus-Ghali that we support him on this matter in principle, but cannot participate at the moment," Kinkel stressed. He said he assumes that the Federal Constitutional Court will reach a decision in May or June. It is a question of the Bundestag's being able to decide on each individual case for blue helmet or peacemaking measures, Kinkel said. However, he added that he adheres to his view that the culture of restraint shown by Germany in foreign and security policy since the World War II must be "retained at all costs." Thus Germany will "in the future say `no' far more often than `yes'" even after a decision has been made by the Federal Constitutional Court.
