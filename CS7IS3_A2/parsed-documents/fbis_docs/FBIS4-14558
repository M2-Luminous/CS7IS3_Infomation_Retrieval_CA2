"The question now is whether there are clients behind these people, something the investigation will now reveal," Vyacheslav Kostikov said. Replying to a question as to who would benefit from this provocation, the press secretary emphasized that neither the president nor his team "had gained any dividends from this sensational story, which is testimony to the lack of any interest on their part in this petty game." In Vyacheslav Kostikov's opinion, those who were interested in this provocation are those political forces who have been striving "to sound out the level of stability in society and the degree of the president's staying-power." He believes that on both these criteria, "the result has proved positive. Even the extremist political forces have not used the provocation to make statements, and the president did not interrupt his holiday, although a year ago he would surely have got into an aircraft and flown to Moscow." So, Vyacheslav Kostikov concluded, this impartial story has nevertheless demonstrated a definite "level of civic accord in society." At the same time, the president's press secretary did not argue with journalists over the fact that the publication of the "versions" of the coup reflected a degree of indifference on the part of society to political scandals on the Olympus of power.
