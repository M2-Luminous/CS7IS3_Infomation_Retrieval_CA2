The dollar is defying the law of gravity, and foreign exchange markets, bond markets, and stock exchanges are alight. Not much remains of the fixed parities which, for decades, ensured law and order in international economic relations. Exchange rate fluctuations, which earlier would have been called a devaluation or revaluation, now happen in the space of a few hours. Since last year, even the European Monetary System -- the last beacon in the monetary chaos -- is heading toward fluctuation bands which remind one more of floating exchange rates than fixed parities. Leaving the setting of national currencies up to the free market has given individual countries much more room for maneuver than they used to have under Bretton Woods. Unorchestrated leaps in economic policy are no longer held back by fixed parities; instead they are reflected in wild currency fluctuations. At the same time, the financial markets are leading their own lives. The reserves held by the central banks are just small change in comparison with the enormous amounts of capital shifted every day. Markets for currencies, raw materials, bonds, and shares influence each other's trends. New, sophisticated financial instruments cut across existing patterns. Markets are breaking away from the underlying economic fundamentals, and are increasingly letting themselves be driven by expectations of expectations [as published]. The nervousness has increased even more since the recent turnaround in the economy, a move which is now well established in the United States, while Europe and Japan are still only just recovering from the recession. This situation has caused more distortion than before. In Europe, long-term interest rates are shooting upward too, although this is not justified by low growth and inflation. The dollar is sinking, while according to all the guidebooks and forecasts its should be rising. What Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says or does -- whether he increases interest rates or waits a while instead -- will still cause uneasy shivers in the markets. Greenspan has lost his grip on the greenback. With all these complications, the markets are forgetting that the underlying causes are actually very positive. The American economy, which not long ago seemed doomed to eternal recession, is reaching for the stars. Yet, there are no concrete signs of an inflation backlash. Do these arbitrary market reactions necessarily mean that we are heading for a financial crisis? That is what it is called, after all. The market always finds its balance. It may cause problems, but it is always the beginning of something new. The stock market crash of 1987 was also originally called a crisis. Subsequently, it looked like a correction to an exaggerated movement, and had no impact on the real economy. If people want to avoid such corrections, then an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. A little more coordination between the industrialized countries in their underlying economic policy concerning the balance of payments, government budget, income development, growth, or combatting inflation would help a lot.
