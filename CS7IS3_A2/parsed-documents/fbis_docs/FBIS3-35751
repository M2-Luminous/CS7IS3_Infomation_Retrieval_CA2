During their meeting in Jurmala today, the Baltic prime ministers made a statement concluding that Kozyrev's declaration means that "the very essence of the `Partnership for Peace' plan proposed by the United States and accepted at the NATO summit in Brussels, as well as the building of new structures for European safety, have become questionable." The prime ministers voiced the opinion that this "new attitude" toward relations with the Baltic States will complicate the negotiations on Russian withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia. "Such statements by Russia regarding foreign and military policy are aimed directly against the sovereignty of the Baltic states," reads the declaration signed by the Baltic prime ministers. The statement also includes a demand that Russia keep its promise to withdraw its military units from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994. As was admitted at a press conference by Maris Riekstins, state secretary of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the statements on Tuesday by A. Kozyrev might be regarded as his characteristic style. M. Riekstins recalled the end of 1992, when A. Kozyrev presented a scenario in Stockholm of what would happen if nationalist radicals assumed power in Russia. These statements were later disavowed. M. Riekstins said that the Foreign Ministry is in possession of information about several Russian Foreign Ministry officials who, in expressing their own opinions, have tried to counteract Kozyrev's statement. M. Riekstins assumed that what Kozyrev said was his own view of last week's summit of NATO leaders. It "did not solve the acceptance of different countries in East Europe into this organization." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not in possession of the precise text of Kozyrev's speech; officials will probably have it on Thursday. Anxiety in connection with A. Kozyrev's speech was also expressed by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry, as reported by BNS. "There is an impression that Russia has not resolved to give up its military influence in the Baltic states. It is odd that this statement has been made after the meeting of the presidents of the United States and Russia, and at the same time the new Russian parliament is beginning its work," reads a statement issued by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. A member of the Lithuanian Seimas [parliament], Romualds Ozols, expressed the view that Lithuania should declare strictly that it does not intend to cooperate with Russia in the military field. Anxiety over Kozyrev's speech was also expressed by the Estonian Foreign Ministry. Already on Tuesday, an assumption was expressed that the recent conduct of Russia, which contradicts the previous policy towards the Baltic states, might be connected with the latest meeting of the Russian and U.S. presidents, as well as the possible agreement on this question, therefore an official statement from the United States regarding Kozyrev's statement was impatiently awaited. Today, the U.S. State Department declared: "The statement by Minister Kozyrev contradicts what was said at the meeting of the two presidents in Moscow." The statement says that during his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, U.S. President Bill Clinton stressed the immediate and complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia. M. Riekstins said at a press conference that the U.S. State Department has requested a formal explanation of A. Kozyrev's speech. The head of Latvia's delegation to withdrawal negotiations with Russia, Martins Virsis, said at the press conference that it is difficult to foretell how this statement might affect the talks between Latvia and Russia. "If this radical conceptual attitude is maintained, Latvia will apparently be forced to think the whole situation over and possibly change its position." M. Virsis refused further comment on the subject.
