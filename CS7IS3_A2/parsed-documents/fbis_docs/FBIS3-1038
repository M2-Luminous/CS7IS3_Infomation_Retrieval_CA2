He has been in Paris since 9 March and it is in Paris that he has given a news conference. As you know, Gabonese Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba is currently trying to form a national unity government. Monique Mas asked Father Paul Mba Abessole if he or his friends are ready to participate. His answer was clear, to say the least: [Begin recording] [Abessole] No, no, and no. Mr. Bongo is holding out a hand but he has no hand. Mr. Bongo is the head of state by force. We don't expect anything from the government that will be formed. We mobilize people to explain to them what democracy means. We explain to them respect for human rights. We are no longer bothered by what Mr. Bongo and his armed gang are doing with the government. We are no longer interested. All this is in the past, as far as we are concerned; we will continue our work and take the risk. We will not back off. [Mas] What are your next political steps? [Abessole] The steps will be determined by the people. I have said that the people will soon feel hungry. How do you think hungry people can be restrained? They cannot. [end recording] During his news conference, Father Mba Abessole said he is basically turning toward France. Monique Mas asked why he made such a statement. [Begin Abessole recording] I had to say it this time because when the French mercenaries attacked my home, I started to doubt the idea that France was my friend; some people said look what your friends are doing to you. I said these people are individuals, they are not my friends. This does not mean that I would do anything to harm France or that I would accept that France does anything to harm me. We are just, correct, and fair. I am not asking France to help the opposition. France can help Gabon, particularly during its current impasse. The future of Gabon -- France should understand and I think it has already understood this -- resides with those who are fighting to attain power. [end recording] Father Mba Abessole stressed that he has not taken refuge in France and that he will return to Gabon when he wishes to do so, despite the arrest warrant issued against him by the Libreville authorities.
