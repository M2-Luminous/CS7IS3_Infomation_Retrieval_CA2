Status of Environmental Analysis: This application has been accepted for filing and was previously noticed as ready for environmental analysis. Comments, recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment were not solicited, however, because we had not decided on whether the data and results from the entrainment studies completed for the Rothschild Project No. 2212, Centralia Project No. 2255, and Wisconsin River Division Project No. 2590 could be extrapolated to an environmental analysis of this project. We have determined that the data and results for the three other projects can be extrapolated to this project. Therefore, we now request comments, recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment for this project. l. Description of Project: The project as licensed consists of the following: (1) An existing dam with a total length of 1,075 feet which is comprised of (a) an uncontrolled overflow timber crib spillway which has a length of 638.2 feet, a height of about 21 feet, crest elevations of 942.01 and 942.41 feet mean sea level (msl), and which is surmounted by 4.1 foot-high flashboards; (b) a 12-foot-long nonoverflow section between the timber crib spillway and the gated spillway; (c) a gated spillway section which has a length of 110 feet and contains three 17.5-foot-high by 30-foot-wide Taintor gates with a sill elevation of 930.11 feet msl; (d) a nonoverflow reinforced concrete/sheet pile wall section about 30 feet long located between the gated spillway and the powerhouse; (e) a 146-foot-long powerhouse; (f) a water-retaining wall or bulkhead located upstream of the paper mill which has a length of about 40 feet; and (g) nonoverflow abutment sections; (2) a reservoir with a normal pool elevation of 946.3 feet msl, a surface area of 400 acres, and a length of about 3 miles; (3) a 146-foot-long by 97.7-foot-wide powerhouse which contains seven flumes and five turbine/generating units_three are vertical Francis turbines and two are horizontal ``camel-back'' units_with a combined nameplate rating of 3,780 kilowatts (Kw), an average head of 21.9 feet, and a total hydraulic capacity of 3,225 cubic feet per second (cfs); and (4) appurtenant facilities. The project would have no switchyard, switchgear, or transmission line included in the project facilities. Additionally, the adjoining paper mill would not be a part of the project licensed facilities. The Applicant is not proposing any changes to the existing project works as licensed. The Applicant estimates the average annual generation would be 27.3 Gwh and owns all existing project facilities.
