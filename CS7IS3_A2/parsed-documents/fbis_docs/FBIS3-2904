Congressional supporters of linking the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status to an improvement in its human rights performance status are unlikely to be convinced by the Secretary of State's inane claim that Beijing now understands the U.S. view. The Chinese leaders Mr Christopher met are even less likely to have come away from their talks impressed by U.S. resolve. The simple truth is that China, with its cynically timed crackdown on dissidents, has called President Bill Clinton's bluff. Short of a change of heart by the Chinese, the ball is clearly in the U.S. court. Mr Clinton can try to prove he is no paper tiger by revoking China's MFN status. He would then have to accept that he has to live with the economic and electoral fallout. Alternatively, he could argue that U.S. economic interests are more important than human rights in a distant country of which many Americans know very little. That would mean renewing MFN, despite the evidence that China has not met the conditions he set for renewal. Or he could admit that linking trade and human rights was not the best strategy for promoting change in China. The consequences to America of cancelling MFN should not be underestimated. It would lose an estimated US$9 billion in export business, with resulting damage to employment and economic recovery. It would also have to sit back and watch while its less-finicky competitors scrambled to take its place in the Chinese market as the two giant nations fought a mutually destructive trade war. Greed for Markets Beijing long ago mastered the art of playing off export-hungry foreigners against one another. Once America's traditional allies had thumbed their noses at Washington in their greed for new markets, Beijing would have little fear that their behaviour would be any different in future when it came to membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for instance, or support for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong. Beijing would have scored a political victory in proving the U.S. could not rely on international support for inflicting such arbitrary damage on a developing nation and potential superpower. But these would be pyrrhic victories neither wants nor can easily afford. MFN, however, is not a privilege the U.S. grants only to China. It is a right enjoyed almost automatically by most other nations. Not even such dictatorships as Iraq or Libya have lost that right, despite other sanctions imposed on them. It is an accident of Cold War history that China, as one of the few still-nominally socialist nations, must be subjected to the annual farce of the MFN renewal debate while worse regimes remain out of the firing line. The original aim of imposing conditions on MFN for communist countries was to ensure they allowed their citizens to emigrate freely. The conditions on China go far beyond that requirement. Blunderbuss Tactics The bitter truth, as the Hong Kong Government and as Hong Kong and American business interests have been telling Mr Clinton since the start of his election campaign two years ago, is that MFN is the wrong weapon. Human rights in China are too important a cause to put at risk by such blunderbuss tactics. These will always be questioned in the U.S. because of their potential to cause harm at home. And they will be questioned by many human rights supporters who see trade and the development of China's economy as essential to eventual political reform. The MFN tactic also suffers from the weakness that it is a purely American initiative. Because other countries want to trade with China as well as press for human rights improvements, MFN makes it impossible to build an international coalition intent on trying to persuade China to improve human rights. Since taking office, Mr Clinton and his State Department advisers have begun to learn the lesson that the yearly MFN fiasco is not a good way to deal with China. Indeed, Mr Clinton has learned both economic and political lessons swiftly. But he has not learned how to package them to make them appeal to his Congressional supporters. Now the President and his advisers have painted themselves into an awkward corner, and are facing a Congress which does not understand the lessons the White House has learned. Yet neither Mr Clinton nor anyone else has worked out how the MFN weapon can be used -- if Congress forces that upon him -- without committing political suicide. MFN withdrawal will explode in the face of the president who orders it. Some weapon.
