FBIS4-27499 "dreas106_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 North Korea Spokesman Issues Statement on UNSC `Allegations' Spokesman Issues Statement on UNSC `Allegations' SK0206012294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2100 GMT 1 Jun 94 SK0206012294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2100 GMT 1 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] issued a statement on 1 June refuting the UN Security Council [UNSC] president's statement of unreasonable allegations of finding fault with us, which was released a few days ago. Press statement of a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry: The UN Security Council, on May 30, according to a scenario which had been worked out in advance by some member states, published a statement of its president groundlessly finding fault with us and containing the unreasonable claim that the fuel rods must be replaced only in compliance with the practical demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and that the opportunity for selecting fuel rods for separation and preservation might be lost. It is entirely unjust for the UN Security Council to have discussed our question without any justifiable reason on the basis of the wrong judgment made by the Secretariat of the IAEA. It was only a few days ago that negotiations on the replacement of fuel rods of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station were held between us and the agency. The main question discussed at the negotiations was the preservation of technical possibilities of future measurement of replaced fuel rods and, in particular, there was sufficient debate on the reasonableness of the method we are applying at present. The agency side, too, said it would seriously study our method and the two sides agreed to continue to discuss it in future negotiations. And it was confirmed that none of the fuel rods being replaced were diverted for other purposes and, practically, that the whole course of the current replacement of fuel rods is going on in the presence of agency inspectors and under strict control of inspection equipment. By the way, what justification on earth does the UN Security Council have to put our question on its agenda and discuss it now. If things were to take a correct track, the UN Security Council should have called, not us, but some quarters of the agency secretariat, into question. Before starting to replace fuel rods, on several occasions, we requested that the agency take necessary measures such as its presence and the removal of the seals. But it did not send a team of inspectors to the end, when the replacement of fuel rods began, thus openly neglecting its duty as an international organization. This was what some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat did. Even when we allowed "an additional inspection" which alluded to "an inspection left incomplete," they shunned it, thus intentionally ignoring the statement of the president of the UN Security Council dated March 31. It was also the agency's Secretariat that distorted the fact by talking as if the negotiations had broken down and hurriedly referred our problem to the UN Security Council without a clear explanation, categorically denying our method even before the negotiating delegation of the agency, which had promised to study the method, arrived at the head office in Vienna. In all, such an act by the Secretariat of the IAEA was aimed at capping us ultimately with the title of culprit [pigo] by justifying their past behavior in concocting, by any means, "inconsistency" against us on the basis of fabricated information. It is only too natural that our country, which has engaged itself only in peaceful nuclear activities as a dignified, independent, sovereign state, will not yield to such unreasonable act of the agency's Secretariat and allow itself to be treated as an offender [choein]. In view of this, the UN Security Council, instead of finding fault with us, should have taken issue with some officials of the IAEA Secretariat who laid hurdles in the way of our peaceful nuclear activities, framed sinister political intrigue to shift the blame on to us and referred the problem to the UN. It is also self-contradictory that the presidential statement of the UN Security Council unreasonably urged us to allow selected separation and preservation of fuel rods and preservation of the possibility of future measurement. Since we are in a unique status after the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it is clear that we cannot accept such routine and ad hoc inspection as the selected preservation of fuel rods. A full understanding of this was reached at the recent negotiations with the agency. Although we are replacing the fuel rods in a unique status, we are doing the utmost to show the transparency of our nuclear activities. The replacement of fuel rods is taking place in such a way as to fully preserve the technical possibility of measuring the fuel rods in the future as requested by the agency when our unique status comes to an end. This is the most scientific and realistic method invented by our scientists and facility operators with a high sense of cooperation, motivated by their consistent position to show the uprightness of the nuclear activities. Its feasibility has already been proven fully through experiments. If this method of our style is applied, it will be possible to reproduce the channel and order of any fuel rods and measure them correctly in the future. At the recent negotiations in Pyongyang, we gave the IAEA side a full explanation of our-style method concerning the replacement of fuel rods and suggested with a good intention that negotiations should be held any time if there were any more questions to be discussed. There have been attempts these days to create the "urgency" of the situation by alleging that the pace of the replacement of fuel rods is too fast. Since it is part of the pure peaceful nuclear activities and technical possibilities for ensuring the continuity of safeguards and measuring fuel rods in the future are fully guaranteed, there is no ground for finding fault with the speed of replacing fuel rods. It was necessary to test the maximum efficiency of the refueling machine that our replacement of fuel rods progressed at a rather fast speed some time ago. This was also a normal course of the peaceful nuclear activities. So, this is hardly a matter for surprise. Such being the case, at a time when everything is progressing smoothly on a normal track, the UN Security Council discussed the biased report submitted by some officials of the Secretariat of the agency without any examination and hurriedly adopted a presidential statement. It is hardly understandable. This was because they were too dull to sense the reality or they were affected by some sinister political background. If the UN Security Council, for this matter, is disgracefully charged with being manipulated by some specified member nations while ignoring its noble mission to be responsible for world peace and security, it will be a shame to history. Originally, the basis for the existence of an international organization is impartiality. If the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council, bereft of impartiality, continue to insist on pressure with an unreasonable attitude, we will not feel any need to be restricted by such pressure, either. It is intolerable that we have suffered from big obstacles in our peaceful nuclear activities, restricted by the unilateral demand of the IAEA. In case pressure is put on us again, we will no longer fall victim to the unreasonable demand but will have to go our own way, unhindered by anything. This is our firm will, who regard independence as our life and blood. If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the technical possibilities of the future measurement of fuel rods are gone or the UN Security Council puts pressure on us, talking about sanctions under that pretext, we cannot but take the course of taking decisive countermeasures, freeing ourselves from such unreasonable restrictions rather than suffering from them, and we will be left with no other choice but to go over to the continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. We will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the intention to solve the issue in a fair way and resolve it in a peaceful way through dialogue. But we will counter without slightest compromise even the slightest intention to ignore our sovereignty by unjustifiably putting pressure on us.
