The government thinks that the northern policy implemented by the Sixth Republic must have deepened North Korea's isolation, thereby leading to the acceleration of its nuclear development, and that, therefore, practical assistance to North Korea to open itself up will be necessary for the development of inter-Korean relations, said a relevant government official on 31 December. Relevant government officials understand that North Korea and the United States almost agreed to hold the third round of high-level talks through a series of working contacts in New York and that, accordingly, the inter-Korean dialogue and North Korea-U.S. dialogue to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue will make rapid progress this year.
