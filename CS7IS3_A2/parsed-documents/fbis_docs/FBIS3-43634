Speaking at the closing session of yet another course for commandos of the Angolan Armed Forces, the defense minister accused the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] of wanting to Balkanize the country. [Begin Pedale recording] In view of its thirst for power and ambition, UNITA has launched a number of military operations greatly affecting our people as a whole. With its warmongering actions, UNITA has killed thousands of Angolans. Such actions prevent the free movement of people and goods, leading to famine, misery, and malnutrition of Angolans. UNITA's dream is to Balkanize Angola. Likewise, UNITA's actions prevent the government from implementing its program to raise the standard of living of Angolans and to establish democratic institutions. [end recording] The defense minister said UNITA is opposed to democracy. All it wants is to subjugate the people by the force of arms. [Begin Pedale recording] Another aspect of UNITA's activities is its irresponsible handling of the peace talks with the government. As we all know, UNITA is not interested in true peace for Angola. UNITA only wants to seize power by force of arms and then establish a dictatorship, because UNITA is aware that Angolans have rejected its rule at the ballot box. [end recording] Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Marcos Garcia Mbanza, commander of the Moxico Military Region, yesterday said UNITA is moving troops and military equipment to attack positions of the government armed forces and the residents. Lt. Gen. Mbanza reminded Jonas Savimbi's warmongering movement that Luena is and will always be a UNITA graveyard should the Black Cockerel's forces dare to attack that city. Right now UNITA's activities consist of abducting civilians, mining main roads, and stealing civilian property.
