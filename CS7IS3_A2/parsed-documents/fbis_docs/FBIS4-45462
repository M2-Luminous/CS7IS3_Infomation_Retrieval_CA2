The place of seizure was falsely declared to be on the highway near Jamnagar by top DRI officials for operational reasons. In fact, the trucks were intercepted near Jetpur on the Rajkot-Junagadh highway around 6 a.m. on Wednesday. DRI sources said that the involvement of Haji Haji Ismail came to light during the interrogation of the four persons, Yusuf Rajak, Dhimaraj Gadhvi, Dinesh Harijan and Suda Hussain, who were detained from the trucks. The truck drivers disclosed the names of the two transporters of Jamnagar, Khafi alias Karo Gafar Suleman and Ali Sumra, who provided the trucks for transporting the Mandrax tablets. They were also the main transporters involved in arms smuggling of Haji Haji Ismail a year ago. The DRI officials raided the premises of Khafi and Ali in Jamnagar. Both the culprits are absconding for the past one year. Haji Haji Ismail and his two transporters, Khafi and Ali, are also wanted in some of the cases being investigated by the Jamnagar police. The investigation revealed that the trucks were sent from Jamnagar by Khafi and Ali on May 9 to Visavadar town for lifting the steel drums containing Mandrax tablets. The trucks reached a particular farm on the outskirts of the Visavadar town, where the drums were hidden by some associates of Haji Haji Ismail. The name of the owner of the farm has been kept secret by the officials. The drums were loaded into the two trucks by the four drivers and around 100 wheat bags were used by the culprits to cover the drums. The trucks left for Jamnagar late at night on May 10. It was further revealed that the drums were to be sent to Bangalore in vessels through Salaya Port with the help of some of the landing agents.
