Fellow countrymen: Please excuse my voice. I was in Pacora and had scheduled a news conference because I thought the president of the Republic was going to make an announcement that would be very important for the nation. I will confess, quite honestly, that I feel truly embarrassed. It embarrasses me to see a man go back on his word, especially when that man represents the majesty of the homeland, a man who, before the diplomatic corps and the whole nation, signed this document which he now seems to have forgotten. It is a document which, among other things, states--Mr. President, please allow me to remind you of it--: We cannot use our authority and influence to serve the interests of those who are running for office. The president did not keep his word. The president has involved himself in party politics. I would like to say this does not mean we will change the tone of our national proposal. [applause] Under no circumstances will we be provoked by this despicable intervention in party politics by the head of the Panamanian state. I now call on my supporters, friends, and fellow party members to remain calm and maintain peace following this brief period of instability that Mr. Endara's words have created. I would like to reiterate what I have said in the past: No one, and at no time, can think of returning to those days of improvised presidents, economic sanctions, and of suffering for all Panamanians. [applause] We want to begin the 21st century with a new concept of homeland, with a united Panama, with our political differences discussed as the democratic nations do, without intervention from governments, with our own autonomy, our proposals for solutions to the country's problems. Fellow countrymen, after we win on 8 May we will celebrate, without revenge, and without looking back to the past, not even to this day. We will introduce what must be a government of reconciliation for which most Panamanians are hoping. [applause] In conclusion, I hope this will be an isolated incident, that we will maintain the dignity of the office the Panamanian people gave us. Mr. President Endara, do not shame the people again by not keeping your word. [applause] [crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"]
