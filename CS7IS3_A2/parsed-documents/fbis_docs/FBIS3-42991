It was developed with consideration for the concept of the draft of the ``Law Regarding Selection Improvements Whose Adoption Is Eagerly Awaited by Breeders.'' In view of the fact that some genera and species of agricultural crops will not be subject to the Law for a certain period, the Statute published here will regulate relations arising during the creation and use of new varieties of these crops. Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant Varieties in the Russian Federation This Statute specifies the procedure for government testing of plant varieties for the purpose of scientifically substantiated formation of the variety resources of the Russian Federation and regulates relations arising in connection with the creation and use of new varieties. The Statute is in effect until the passage and effective date of the Russian Federation Law Regarding Selection Improvements. I. General Provisions 1.1. Government tests of new varieties, hybrids, and lines of agricultural crops and other cultivated plants and silkworm breeds and hybrids (henceforth referred to as varieties) are conducted by the All-Russian State Commission on Agricultural Crop Variety Testing (henceforth referred to as the Gossortkomissiya) through the following: - republic, kray, and oblast inspectors to test varieties of agricultural crops (henceforth referred to as inspectors); - government variety-testing stations (henceforth referred to as gossortstantsii); - government variety-testing sections located on an independent balance sheet or organizational variety-testing sections on a contractual basis in agricultural enterprises under different forms of ownership (henceforth referred to as gossortouchastki); - the All-Russia Center for Quality Evaluation of Agricultural Crop Varieties [VTsOKS]; - regional chemical technology laboratories (henceforth referred to as laboratories); - other organizations on a contractual basis. 1.2. The Gossortkomissiya, in accordance with this Statute, will assume the examination of variety applications, conduct an expert examination of them and test the varieties, manage the State Register of Varieties Authorized for Use in Production in the Corresponding Region of the Russian Federation (henceforth referred to as the State Register), issue certificates and authorship certificates, publish rules clarifying the use of this Statute and the government's variety-testing method, publish official information, and perform other functions in accordance with the applicable statutes. 1.3. Inclusion of a variety in the State Register grants the right to reproduce, import, and sell seeds and plant material of a variety in territories of the republics, krays, and oblasts of a respective region. Crops of these varieties are subjected to testing, and variety documents are issued for them. Reproduction of seeds and plant material of a variety for purposes of their export beyond the confines of its respective region does not require inclusion of the variety in the State Register for the given region. 1.4. For a variety included in the State Register, the Gossortkomissiya issues a certificate to the applicant and an authorship certificate to the developer. 1.5. State testing of plant varieties is financed with the resources of the republic budget of the Russian Federation. II. The State Register 2.1. The State Register includes varieties permitted for use during that year in the respective region of the Russian Federation (Appendix). 2.2. In the case of crops on the list specified by the Gossortkomissiya, inclusion of varieties in the State Register is based on government tests; in the case of all other crops, inclusion is based on expert evaluations or studies conducted by the applicant. Varieties regionalized in the Russian Federation as of the approval date of this Statute are included in the State Register de facto. 2.3. The following varieties are excluded from the State Register of Varieties: varieties that have lost their agricultural value, homogeneity, or stability; seeds (plant material) that are not in demand and have not been used in the production of the respective region for the past 5 years. 2.4. When the reasons prompting exclusion of a variety from the State Register have been eliminated, the originator has the right to send the Gossortkomissiya a petition requesting that the variety be reinstated in the State Register after the appropriate tests. 2.5. Revisions in the State Register and lists of the following are approved by the Russian Federation Ministry of Agriculture upon the recommendation of the Gossortkomissiya: - varieties of hardy wheat; - varieties of grain, cereal, and leguminous crops that are valuable from a quality standpoint; - varieties of brewing barley; - high-oil varieties of sunflower; - erucic acid-free and low-glucosinolate varieties of rape and summer rape. III. The Certificate 3.1. The certificate certifies the originator of the variety and grants him the right to conclude agreements to produce the seeds (plant material) and sell them, as well as to otherwise introduce the variety into economic circulation in accordance with the State Register. In the event that a certificate for a variety is issued to several applicants who have jointly created the variety, the relationships regarding use of the variety in production is regulated by an agreement among them. 3.2. A certificate shall remain in effect for 20 years from the date of its issue. In the case of grapes and decorative and fruit tree varieties, including their rootstock, this period shall constitute 25 years. 3.3. The holder of a certificate is obliged to maintain the variety so as to preserve the traits specified in the description of the variety on the priority date, its homogeneity, and its stability and is, upon the request of the Gossortkomissiya, obliged to send them at his own expense seeds of the variety for check tests and to permit on-site inspections when necessary. IV. The Authorship Certificate 4.1. The authorship certificate certifies the authorship of a variety and priority and grants the developer the right to receive authorship royalties from the holder of the certificate based on an agreement with him for as long as funds are received as a result of use of the variety in production. The royalties to a team of developers are distributed in proportion to the extent of each developer's participation in creation of the variety. 4.2. The physical individual whose creative labor has either created or discovered a variety may be the developer of that variety. Disputes regarding authorship are resolved in a judicial procedure. 4.3. The period for which an authorship certificate remains in effect is unlimited. V. Handling of an Application 5.1. The breeder submits an application for inclusion of the variety in the State Register and issuance of a certificate and authorship certificate to the Gossortkomissiya. In the case of a variety created while the breeder is performing his job or job duties, the application is submitted by the originating institution. 5.2. The application should include the following: - a request to have the variety included in the State Register for the corresponding region and to issue a certificate and authorship certificate; - a description of the variety with its proposed name; - information regarding the creative participation of each of the developers of the new variety that has been signed by all of the developers; - the obligation to provide the required amount of seeds (plant material) of the variety free of charge.
