FR940603-0-00053 FR940603-0-00024 Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The authority to establish regulations pertaining to the issuance of merchant mariner's documents has been committed to the Secretary of Transportation by Federal statute and delegated to the Coast Guard. Documentation of merchant mariners is a matter national in application for which regulations should be of national scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variances. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State action addressing the same matter, although no such action is expected. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this final rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this action is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The amendment involves only elimination of the requirement that an applicant provide proof of a commitment of employment as a member of the crew of a United States merchant vessel prior to receiving an MMD and clearly would have no environmental impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES . List of Subjects 46 CFR Part 12 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Seamen. 46 CFR Part 16 Drug testing, Marine safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Safety, Transportation.
