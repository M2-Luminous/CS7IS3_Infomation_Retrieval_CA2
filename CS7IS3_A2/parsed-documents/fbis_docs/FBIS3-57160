Shokhin believes that the Economics Ministry should not only calculate the effects of economic decisions, but also "thrust quite explicit variants of economic policy on the government." Following the changes in the government's structure and personal composition, the ministry should take up coordinating the policies towards both domestic and foreign investments, Shokhin said. Therefore, the functions of the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development which earlier attracted foreign investments must be transferred to the Economics Ministry. In addition, the ministry will focus on the maintenance of financial proportions in the economy and access to the world market, according to Shokhin. Commenting on Boris Fedorov's resignation, Shokhin noted: "Boris Grigoryevich put himself in quite an uncomfortable position by making a number of wittingly uncompromising demands formulated in quite an indelicate manner." Fedorov made the resignation of Vice Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Central Bank Chairman Viktor Geraschenko a condition to his work in the reorganized government. "It seems to me that the main thing Boris Fedorov could demand from the president and the prime minister was pursuing a certain course of financial policy and make this a condition to his stay in the government only," the minister said. "If Boris Fedorov sincerely believed that Geraschenko and Zaveryukha hampered the reforms, the need for Fedorov's presence in the government as a counterbalance to these people must be even stronger," Shokhin is convinced. "I do not think that the life of the present government may shorten due to the absence of Gaydar and Fedorov," Shokhin pointed out adding that "everything will depend on the line the cabinet will be pursuing."
