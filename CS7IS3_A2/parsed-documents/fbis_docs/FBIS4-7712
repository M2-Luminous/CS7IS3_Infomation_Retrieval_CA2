The U.S. visitor was today received by Presidency member and President of the Serbian Civic Council Mirko Pejanovic. In the course of the meeting the topic most discussed was the possibility of the Serbs joining the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation. Moreover, the work of the Serbian Consultative Council and the Serbian Civic Council was also discussed, as were the possibilities for the return of Bosnian Serb refugees. Mirko Pejanovic acquainted the distinguished visitor with the new wave of ethnic cleansing that Karadzic's Serbs are carrying out in the areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor, and other places that are under their control. He asked McCloskey to strive for the United States' increased engagement in the region, because this great [word indistinct] is well-known precisely for the protection of human rights and liberties. If we fail in halting the Serbian fascism, I am not sure that we will be able to stop other fascism in these areas, said Pejanovic, and once again appealed to McCloskey to influence the United States' increased engagement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. McCloskey promised to do everything in his power to achieve -- through the consultative bodies of the U.S. Congress -- an increased U.S. presence in the solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The distinguished U.S. visitor was also received by the Chief of General Staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Supreme Command Rasim Delic. On this occasion, Mr. McCloskey showed interest in the progress of the implementation of the signed agreement between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions adopted so far. He also showed interest in the situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts, particularly in the situation in Gorazde after the Serbian aggressor's latest offensive. General Delic informed Mr. McCloskey about the situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts with special stress on the situation in Gorazde and Bihac. He reiterated that all that was happening in Gorazde and Bihac is yet another expression of the Serbian aggressor's defiance of the international community. General Delic also explained the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army's position regarding the situation in Sarajevo and regarding many other details important for grasping the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
