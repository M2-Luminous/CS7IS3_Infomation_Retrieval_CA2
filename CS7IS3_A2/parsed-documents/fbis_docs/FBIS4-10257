British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is examining the Brazilian proposal to create a businessmen's forum, but talks between Hurd and Foreign Minister Celso Amorim did not stop there. They also discussed the environment, free trade zones, and technical cooperation, but all attention was indeed focused on the extradition accord. The accord has yet to be signed, but according to Minister Celso Amorim it will soon become a reality. [Begin Amorim recording] An extradition accord was proposed a long time ago. The idea was not born after the Paulo Cesar Farias affair. The problem is that in the past the United Kingdom did not sign extradition accords. That policy has now changed, and they do sign this sort of accord. The Farias affair, naturally, made the need more urgent. From that affair on we began a negotiation process, which is practically finished. I believe, however, that there is still a small problem regarding coordination among UK Government departments. I believe the difficulty resides, practically speaking, in a language problem. [end recording] Douglas Hurd has already left for Britain.
