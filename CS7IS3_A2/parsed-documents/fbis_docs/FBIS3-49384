It recalls that before he became president, Kovac was one of the leaders of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), of which Meciar is the chairman, who in the (June 1992) election campaign coined the idea of creating a government of experts irrespective of their party affiliation. If Meciar interprets Kovac's proposal as a small revenge for their disputes, he will probably decide to continue fighting against the majority which can imagine a broad-coalition government with "his" movement, but without him, PRACA writes. If Meciar accepts the challenge and "allows himself to be dismissed" because his time in this historical stage has run out, he will certainly return to political life as a messiah with which he already has his own experience, the paper adds. Slovak President Michal Kovac's new year's appeal to parties and movements to look for suitable personalities for a broad-coalition government will probably give rise to much controversy, the left- leaning PRAVDA writes. "Supporters of status quo from both the government and the opposition will assess (Kovac's) appeal as inappropriate," the paper says and adds that Kovac "does not want the HZDS and its chairman to do nothing less but... to share power and responsibility with other political subjects. They (the subjects) should cooperate with the HZDS as with a recognized partner, according to the president's notions. He may be asking too much of what our politicians are not capable," PRAVDA says. But it adds that Kovac's appeal had to be made "because time for making a meaningful change is quickly running out." The economic and social situation in Slovakia has been too bad for social energy to be spent on unproductive political struggles and disputes, PRAVDA stresses. [passage omitted]
