The sources said that Dr. al-Turabi made al-Mahdi "an astounding offer" expressing willingness to meet all the Ummah Party's demands if the latter agreed to merge with the NIF. They added that al-Mahdi rejected the offer and told al-Turabi that the NIF cannot escape accountability and answerability for the harm done to the country. Ummah Party sources contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT have confirmed these facts and said that non-Sudanese parties with NIF links also contacted al-Mahdi to persuade him to enter into a dialogue that would lead to a reconciliation with the regime but he refused to discuss the matter and submitted documents and facts showing the magnitude of the damage inflicted on the country over the past four years, pointing out that the NIF was responsible for that. The Ummah Party sources said that al-Turabi admitted that the internal situation had reached a dead end. They also said that NIF officials who were members of the Sudanese Government's delegation to the second Abuja round of negotiations offered Garang's movement the option of merger with the NIF in one party but that was rejected by the movement on the grounds of vast differences between the views of the two sides.

There has also been a severe bread crisis in Khartoum for the past two weeks. Furthermore, circles close to the government have admitted that there is also a liquidity crisis which has delayed payment of the salaries of the government employees and members of the armed forces.
