Republic's Parliament Not Ready To Compromise"] [Text] Tbilisi -- The topic of Abkhazia continues to dominate sessions of the Georgian parliament. Attitudes toward the Russian leadership's statement about the introduction of CIS peacemaking forces to the conflict zone have sharply divided the top legislative organ into supporters and bitter opponents of this step. This could lead to a crisis of power in the republic and even to a possible change of political course. The opinions held by deputies in different factions are largely diametrically opposed. The Republicans, as before, are insisting on a parliamentary debate on the issue of preserving statehood, and on the legality of the agreements on Abkhazia signed 4 April and 14 May. Republican deputy Ivlian Khaindrava called them the "political and legal formulation of the results of Georgia's military failures, which will directly and unambiguously lead to the loss of Abkhazia." The refusal by most parliamentarians to include these issues on the agenda prompted a stormy reaction from the Republicans, who staged a walkout and announced that they would be boycotting the sessions. They were joined by deputies from the Merab Kostav Society, who are insisting, aside from anything else, on the abolition of the institution of head of state and a transition to exclusively parliamentary rule. But if some people are worried solely about the Georgian-Abkhaz agreements that have been signed, others are concerned about the position of a third party -- Russia. People's Front leader Nodar Natadze, for instance, assesses the great northern neighbor's peacemaking efforts merely as an attempt to "quietly" seize Georgia's Black Sea coastline and to federalize the republic into part of Russia.... Representatives of the parliamentary majority are also talking about boycotting the work of the top legislative organ of power. Roman Miminoshvili, deputy [head] of the parliamentary commission for deputies' ethics, accused the opposition of destructive actions, sabotage, and antistate debates leading to the deepening of the crisis and drawing Georgia into war and chaos, and directly stated that such a step is possible. Roin Liparteliani, leader of the Agrarians, is not even ruling out the possibility of parliament's dissolution. In these circumstances, it is impossible to have a constructive discussion of any documents on Abkhazia -- the language of ultimatums is not helping at all. Zurab Zhvaniya, general secretary of the Union of Georgian Citizens, even proposed declaring a moratorium on open parliamentary debate of the issues relating to Abkhazia. Will his appeal be heeded? Georgian citizens have differing assessments of the question of introducing CIS peacemaking troops to Abkhazia. According to the latest opinion poll staged by the newspaper SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, 62.6 percent of Tbilisi people do not see them as any reliable guarantee of the safe return of refugees. Although most nonetheless believe that the conflict cannot be resolved without compromise. But it is the people's elected representatives above all who will have to learn the art of compromise. Otherwise, they may talk themselves into a new war.
