Constantine is sinking deeper and deeper into a deathlike torpor. The year just ended has left the old city of Rocher tragically stricken, and there is nothing to indicate there is hope of arresting continued decline. Constantine--The recent landslide that caused the collapse of several buildings on Avenue Kitouni and Rue des Maquisards was unfortunately only one very small entry in the catalog of disasters that has struck this city that is now on its last legs. Housing sites at CILOC [expansion not given] are also at serious risk, and urgent appeals from inhabitants over the last three years have not yet succeeded in moving the authorities concerned. The road that gives access to Bardo, near the old slaughterhouse, has been closed to traffic ever since a previous ground subsidence long ago, and no one seems concerned about the situation. In an entire section of Saint-Jean, Aouinet El-Foul, and as far out as the El Menia plain, people live under the threat of a catastrophe that could strike at any moment, and everyone acts as if nothing were wrong. It probably serves little purpose to point out that the alarm was first sounded 21 years ago. One has only to refer to the small book Memoirs of an APC [People's Communal Assembly] President by the last real mayor of Constantine, Mohamed Tahar Arhaoui, to find these words: "The zone extending from the base of Coudiat to the El Menia flatlands is disturbingly unstable. The 1972 landslide is etched deeply in the memory of the 1,200 families that were relocated into new housing only after many patient years spent in so-called temporary housing." In fact, ever since 1972 the old buildings on Rue des Maquisards, Avenue Kitouni, Rue Charboneau, etc. had been threatened with destruction by the continual land subsidence that has also caused increased buckling of the road between El Djebbas and the El Menia bridge. And what has been done to remedy the situation? Nothing, except to become further entrenched in an obstinate "ostrich policy." How could anyone fail to be irritated by the sententious and almost obscene speeches made by certain incorrigible "public servants"? December 1993: Close to 60 families lost their homes. Some of them, living on the sidewalks, are still exposed to the rigors of a very harsh winter. With children, wives, and oldsters exposed to all the attendant dangers. A dreadful situation, which some try to ignore but that cannot be hidden. What will become of them tomorrow? Must we wait until the sky falls on our heads again? Alas! This is almost certainly the outcome, because local administrative authorities seem unable to come up with even the rudiments of a plan. True, the country's economic crisis or even the security situation might be used to justify the authorities' inaction. But still.... All you need do to see the plight of the people struggling to survive is turn your head in their direction. We tried repeatedly to meet with the president of the communal executive delegation, who serves also as head of the daira of Constantine, but in vain. A large number of questions thus remain unanswered. How can the authorities' abdication of responsibility in the face of a city's death agonies be explained? How do they react to the sight of goats serenely grazing on...Ben Boulaid avenue? Why do more and more huge holes appear with every passing day in all the side streets of the city, and even in the principal arteries? Go take a look at your Constantine, from El Kantar to Bellevue, from Sidi Mabrouk to Bardo, from the Filali settlement to CILOC and even downtown. Not one single street has been spared. Day after day workers slave away, armed with scaling hammers or simple pickaxes, cutting gashes into the city. When evening comes, they put their tools down and leave. But they do not come back. Not even the outlying districts, the "express" suburbs, have been spared. For more than a month, two strapping young workers have kept the main highway virtually impassable. Add to that the innumerable piles of refuse springing up almost everywhere. Frankly the picture is grim. And all this is happening under the noses of the impassive, silent authorities. Their attitude not only greatly tarnishes the institutional credibility of government but also encourages all sorts of abuses--and reminds one of the stereotypical...banana republic. So are we not justified in asking ourselves, in the last analysis, whether all this could be part of a calculated plan? Isn't it just one more effort to sap what little strength the country still has? The idea is perhaps too fantastic, but so is the quality of everyday life in a city that has become an immense "gypsy" campground, where all sorts of crimes go unpunished, where simple good citizenship is trampled underfoot. As a matter of fact, isn't it the only city where the head of the daira is also the president of the DEC [expansion not given]? Who controls whom? Isn't it the only city in the world where so-called intelligent humans designed a highway but created no access roads? Isn't it the only city where paintings of inestimable value were confiscated to gratify the whims of a high-level official? Examples of this sort of behavior are almost endless. But what good would it do to compile a list? They have well and truly decided to ruin this country, and nothing seems able to shake them from their purpose. [sentence as published]
