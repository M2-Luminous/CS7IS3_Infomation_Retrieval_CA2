The following requirements concerning documentation and public access disclosures are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA. 1.

This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 2.

DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3758; FR&hyph;3637&hyph;N&hyph;01] Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for FY 1993 and 1994; Invitation for Applications: Public Housing Development_MROP Activities AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 and FY 1994 for Public Housing Development_MROP Activities; Invitation for Applications. SUMMARY: This NOFA announces the availability of FY 1993 and 1994 funding, and invites eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) to submit development applications for MROP activities. Because the number of applications for FY 1993 funding which received perfect scores was in excess of available funding (funding of all applications receiving a perfect score of 90 would only have permitted funding at 40 percent of the amount requested), this NOFA withdraws the FY 1993 NOFA published on September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47940). The FY 1993 funding is being combined and re-announced with the FY 1994 funding under this Public Housing Development_MROP Activities NOFA (MROP Activities NOFA). All unfunded MROP activities applications submitted in response to the FY 1993 NOFA will be returned to the PHAs for resubmission in response to this combined FY 1993 and FY 1994 NOFA. At the option of the PHA, an application may be amended and resubmitted, or a new MROP activities application may be submitted. No other types of applications will be accepted under this NOFA. A separate NOFA applicable to the public housing development program will be published in the Federal Register . This MROP Activities NOFA provides instructions regarding the preparation and processing of applications. This NOFA is NOT applicable to the Indian housing program. * * * * * SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement: The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been approved by the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB control numbers 2577&hyph;0033, 2577&hyph;0036, and 2577&hyph;0044.
