"The continued embargo prevents the port of al-'Aqabah from developing and resuming the activity level it had in 1989," according to Sufyan al-Muhaysin, director of the Jordanian shipping agents association. "Trade should have recorded an annual growth of five to 10 percent in the last four years," he said. In 1993, 1,498 ships docked in Aqaba, compared to 1,552 in 1989. The port handled a total of 11.55 million tonnes of goods last year, down from the 18.5 million tonnes in 1989. The 38 percent drop in activity from 1989 "in fact conceals a decrease of more than 50 percent compared to what should have been recorded in 1993 if there had not been an embargo on Iraq and a blockade of the port," he said. Instead of 11.55 million tonnes, the port should have handled 24.2 million tonnes, he said. The resulting loss in revenue for 1993 was 440 million dollars. Since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, ships heading to al-'Aqabah have had to submit to strict inspections by US, French and Australian warships in the Straits of Tiran. Because of these measures designed to stop banned goods from reaching Iraq through Jordan, only 19 of the 40 shipping companies that used to serve Aqaba before the Gulf crisis continue to sail to the port. A shipping source told AFP that Jordanian officials were in contact with international organizations to consider a plan to put inspectors in the port rather than at sea. The London-based firm Lloyds has agreed to provide inspections but a final decision was awaited from the UN Security Council, the source said on condition of anonymity. The Security Council imposed the embargo on Iraq days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.
