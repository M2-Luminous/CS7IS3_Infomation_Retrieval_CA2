The highest rate of increases in prices for goods and services was registered in the Far Eastern and East Siberian economic regions (about 3 percent), and the lowest--in West Siberian and Central Chernozem regions (1.3 percent). Indices of prices for consumer goods and services were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding observation date): 03/05 03/15 03/22 Average daily price rise March February Consumer goods 101.7 102.4 102.1 0.27 0.34 and services including: foodstuffs 101.5 101.7 101.4 0.22 0.32 nonfood items 101.5 103.1 102.8 0.32 0.34 for-fee 104.8 103.5 103.5 0.53 0.48 services for the population Over 22 days of March prices for goods and services increased by 6.3 percent (by 41.3 percent since the beginning of the year), including those for foodstuffs--by 4.6 percent (38.6 percent), nonfood items--by 7.6 percent (33.1 percent), and for-fee services for the population--by 12.3 percent (2.2-fold). Assuming that the current pace of price rises remains the same until the end of the month, the total rise in prices for goods and service in March will be about 10 percent. Foodstuffs. Over the period 15 to 22 March prices in organized and nonorganized trade rose by 1.5 percent and 0.9 percent. Price changes by main categories of food products are shown below (as a percentage of the preceding observation date): Total including: in organized in nonorganized trade trade All food products 101.4 101.5 100.9 including: Meat and meat 100.8 101.1 99.8 products Fish and fish 101.6 101.7 100.4 products Milk and milk 102.4 102.5 101.6 products Eggs 100.1 100.1 100.7 Sugar 99.4 99.4 100.3 Bread and bakery 104.1 104.1 products Cereals and 104.1 104.1 104.3 macaroni items Vodka 99.2 99.2 99.6 Potatoes and 105.1 106.2 103.9 vegetables In organized trade over the period 15 to 22 March vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate: garlic--by 11 percent, carrots and fresh cabbage--by 8 percent, and beets and potatoes--by 4 percent. A high rate of prices increases remained with respect to bread and bakery products, cereals, cheeses, frozen fish, and salt (4-7 percent). There has been practically no change over the week in prices for meat, vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, and vodka. Since the beginning of the month vegetable prices have gone up by 17 percent, bread and bakery products--by 13 percent, milk products--by 9 percent, and meat and meat products--by 4 percent. Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases in nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh produce: prices for fresh cabbage, onions, and carrots went up by 6-9 percent. Prices for meat and milk products remained practically unchanged. Since the beginning of the month vegetable prices have increased by 13 percent, milk products--5 percent, and meat--3 percent. The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs increased over the week by 1.5 percent and as of 22 March amounted to 43,700 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured a factor of 3.9. In terms of the cost of consumer basket Moscow and St. Petersburg ranked 34th and 36th among 132 monitored cities (R47,700 and R47,600 on a monthly basis). Nonfood items. Prices for basic medicines increased over the week by 5 percent; those for light industry products--by 2-3 percent, and tobacco items--by 1.4 percent. Since the beginning of the month prices for medicines have increased by 14 percent; garments, knitwear, and fabrics--by 7-9 percent; footwear--by 5 percent; and tobacco items--by 3.5 percent. For-fee services for the population. The trend of anticipatory rate increases with respect to for-fee services continued over the period under review. The cost of city bus fares increased by 10.9 percent. In Astrakhan, Novgorod, Ukhta, and Moscow they jumped over the week by a factor of two to 2.5. The cost of some categories of consumer and municipal services went up by 2-6 percent. There was a considerable increase in the cost of municipal services in Yakutsk, where apartment rents increased 1.5-fold, electric and gas rates--threefold, and hot water rates--more than fivefold. Since the beginning of the month the greatest rate increases have been registered with respect to municipal housing and hot water (1.7-fold) and city bus fares (by 22 percent). Fees for certain categories of health care services and visits to sanitariums and resorts increased by 7-10 percent. Industrial production. Over 20 days of March 1994, of 163 most important categories of products counted in periodic reports, the average daily production, as compared to the corresponding period of 1993: --increased with respect to 13 items, (including city telephone cables, polypropylene, potassium fertilizer, asbestos-cement pipes and couplers, cotton fabrics, school notebooks, pencils, high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese, and facial soap), or 8 percent of the total number; --decreased with respect to 145 items, or 89 percent of the total number; as compared to the corresponding period of February 1994: --increased with respect to 59 items, (including automotive gasoline, diesel fuel, pig iron, steel, finished rolled metal, coking coal, sulfuric acid, mineral fertilizer, calcinated soda, synthetic ammonia, polystyrene, processing control panels, traveling electric cranes, passenger railcars, excavators, automobiles, buses, tractors, lumber, cardboard, roof slate, high-grade asbestos, asbestos-cement pipes and couplers, decorative ceramic tile, video tape recorders, knitting machines, motorcycles, linen fabrics and sack cloth, raincoats, suits, footwear, meat, butter, high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese, and canned milk products), or 36 percent of the total number; --decreased with respect to 99 items, or 61 percent of the total number; Based on the dynamics of the production of most important varieties of industrial output, it is estimated that the average daily production in industry over the elapsed period of March 1994 amounted to 73 percent of that for the corresponding period of March last year. The output of the main categories of industrial products over 20 days of March 1994 is characterized by the following data: Produced over As % of the corresponding period 20 days of (in terms of average daily March 1994 production) of March 1993 February 1994 Electric power--billion 54.4 94 92 kw-hr Oil, including gas 15.7 82 98 condensate, million tonnes Natural gas, billion 36.4 99.0 99.0 cubic meters Coal, million tonnes 14.9 85 91 Steel, million tonnes 2.4 73 104 Finished rolled ferrous 1.9 82 107 metals, including destined for export, million tonnes Steel pipe, thousand 174 49 86 tonnes Large electric 112 14 77 machinery, units Metal-cutting machine 263 29 79 tools, units Passenger cars, thousand 47.0 88 113 units Tractors, thousand units 1.1 15 130 Chemical filament and 10.4 49 99.0 fiber, thousand tonnes Mineral fertilizer 386 77 110 (recalculated as 100-percent nutrient), thousand tonnes Automotive tires for 1.1 50 86 agricultural vehicles, motorcycles, and motorollers, million units Commercial timber, 3.8 60 97 million cubic meters solid wood Lumber, thousand cubic 568 67 104 meters Paper, thousand tonnes 114 63 89 Cement, million tonnes 1.6 68 92 Roof slate, million 75.3 35 111 standard tiles Construction brick, 403 70 95 million units of standard brick Soft roofing and 16.3 47 91 insulation materials, million square meters Fabrics, total, million 131 80 86 square meters Hosiery, million pairs 18.1 65 87 Knitwear, million units 10.0 67 87 Footwear, million pairs 2.9 42 106 Television sets, 136 71 89 thousand units Radio receiving devices, 41.1 29 69 thousand units Refrigerators and 127 71 79 freezers, thousand units Electric vacuum 50.6 29 100.2 cleaners, thousand units Washing machines, 92.3 47 85 thousand units Meat, including 84.0 67 101 subproducts, category I, total, thousand tonnes Whole-milk products, 343 83 100.4 recalculated as milk, total, thousand tonnes Butter, total, thousand 15.4 63 117 tonnes Granulated sugar, 43.9 32 82 including quantities produced from customer-supplied material, thousand tonnes Over the elapsed period of March 1994 there was no production of gantry cranes with lifting capacity of eight or more tonnes, grain-and flax-harvesting combines, and electric locomotives. Progress in Defense Industry Conversion. In 1993 conversion measures were being implemented at 716 enterprises of the Russian Federation defense complex, which comprises 98 percent of all enterprises with defense contracts. Production cutbacks were typical in 1993 both for industry as a whole and for enterprises undergoing conversion, as may be seen from the following data: 1993 as % of 1992 Volume of including: production (contracts, services), total military civilian Industry--total 83.8 71.2 84.1 including enterprises 86.0 77.9 90.2 undergoing conversion Under the influence of conversion processes, the share of military products in total output dropped from 52 percent in 1990 to 31 percent in 1993. The change in the structure of output and number of employees engaged in this production may be seen from the following data (in percentages): 1990 1991 1992 1993 Volume of production 100 100 100 100 (contracts, services) (in 1993 prices)--total including military items 52 45 34 31 civilian items 48 55 66 69 average number of 100 100 100 100 personnel engaged in industrial production on payroll--total including those engaged in production of: military items 52 46 38 33 civilian items 48 54 62 67 Wages at enterprises undergoing conversion were lower than in industry overall and in 1993 amounted on average to R44,000 per month (in industry--R66,000 per month, including in machine building--R47,000). In 1993, 165,000 persons quit their jobs at enterprises undergoing conversion. The number of personnel engaged in industrial production at enterprises undergoing conversion fell over the year by 12 percent, which is somewhat higher than in machine-building (by 10 percent), and twice as high as industry as a whole. As in the rest of industry, the financial situation of enterprises undergoing conversion in 1993 was typically unstable. The amount of money owed by consumers for products purchased from these enterprises reached R1.2 trillion; of that, more than half was owed to them by the state. In turn, past due payments owed by enterprises undergoing conversion to suppliers for raw materials, parts, and components amounted to R854 billion. There were no substantial changes in the structure of financing of conversion measures in 1993. The share of money provided from the federal budget amounted to, according to data supplied by enterprises undergoing conversion, 21 percent of all expenditures, as compared to 24 percent in 1992. The share of outside sources of money in conversion financing has increased (from 41 percent to 44 percent). This is mostly bank loans; the share of money received from foreign investors is extremely small (0.3 percent of all means received from outside sources). The share of self-financing of conversion measures in 1993 remained at the 1992 level and amounted on average over the year to 18 percent, although in the first quarter of 1993 it reached 29 percent. In 1993 the destination of 18 percent of the output produced by enterprises undergoing conversion was outside Russia; military equipment and arms accounted for one-third of this output. Operation of Urban Electric Transportation. In the Russian Federation, 113 cities have electric urban passenger transport; of them, 27 have only streetcars; 43--only trolley buses; and 43 have both. Six cities have subways. The production base of urban electric transport and the passenger volume they carry are characterized by the following data: 1992 1993 1993 as % of 1992 Operating length of 3.3 3.3 100 streetcar tracks, thousand kilometers trolley bus lines, 4.79 4.84 101 thousand kilometers subway, kilometers 367.0 372.6 102 Rolling stock as of the end of the year, thousand units --streetcars 14.3 13.9 97 --trolley buses 13.9 13.8 99.5 --subway cars 5.5 5.6 101 Number of runs completed, millions --streetcars 36.7 36.1 98 --trolley buses 56.4 56.7 101 --subway trains 4.6 4.7 101 passengers carried by 20,257 21,439 106 urban electric transport--total, million persons including: --by streetcar 8,071 8,125 100.7 --by trolley bus 8,619 9,102 106 --by subway 3,567 4,212 118 In 1993, 13.9 km of streetcar track (one-way) were put into operation (one-third less than in 1992) and 103 km of trolley bus lines (2.1 times more). Additions to trolley bus lines were made in 17 cities, including Orenburg (21 km), St. Petersburg (14.0 km), Kemerovo (13.0 km), Kazan (12.8 km), Irkutsk (10.7 km), and Perm (9.8 km); to streetcar tracks--in eight cities, including Vladivostok (5.5 km), Prokopyevsk (3.8 km), and Chelyabinsk (2.2 km). The operating length of subway track increased in 1993 by 5.6 km, which is 1.5 times less than in 1992. New segments were put into operation on the Samara (3 km) and Nizhniy Novgorod (2.6 km) subways. In 1993 urban electric transport enterprises received 498 streetcars and 1,341 trolley buses, which is somewhat higher than 1992 deliveries. At the same time, the wear and tear on rolling stock remains high. Currently more 10 percent of all trolley buses and streetcars in Russia have exceeded the term of their useful life. In Kaliningrad, 71 percent of streetcars have been in service for 15 or more years; in Volgograd, Samara, Vladikavkaz, and Izhevsk--more than 50 percent; and in Ulyanovsk, Pyatigorsk, Salavat, Yekaterinburg, and Komsomolsk-na-Amure--more than 40 percent. In Leninsk-Kuznetsk more than 50 percent of trolley buses have exceeded their normal service term; in Arkhangelsk, Yoshkar-Ola, Novocheboksarsk, Astrakhan, Balakovo, Nalchik, Rostov-na-Donu, Taganrog, Sterlitamak, Kurgan, Berezniki, Abakan, Bratsk, Chita, and Kaliningrad--more than 20 percent. In the subways rolling stock inventory, 32 percent of cars have been in service between 15 and 25 years, and 13 percent of cars--for more than 25 years. There are 247 cars (6 percent) in Moscow subway that have served their useful life (more than 30 years). As a result, the main cause of off-line idling of rolling stock are technical malfunctions. In 1993 on average 28.6 percent of trolley buses a day were not in use, of which 18.5 percent were under repair or awaiting repair; with respect to streetcars these figures amounted to 26.9 percent and 20.5 percent respectively; and subways--24 percent and 10 percent. More than 30 percent of trolley buses a day on average were not in use due to repairs or the need for such in Volgograd, Maykop, Cherkessk, Vladikavkaz, Volgodonsk, Berezniki, and Novokuznetsk, and more than one-quarter in Smolensk, Tula, Rybinsk, Voronezh, Astrakhan, Krasnodar, Izhevsk, Chita, and Kaliningrad. For the same reason more than half of all streetcars were idle in Cherepovets and Astrakhan; more than 40 percent--in Pyatigorsk, Vladikavkaz, Nizhniy Tagil, and Kaliningrad; and 25-35 percent--in Ivanovo, Moscow, Smolensk, Yaroslavl, Volgograd, Samara, Zlatoust, and Magnitogorsk, Barnaul, Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk, Novosibirsk, Ulan-Ude, Krasnoyarsk. Over the year, there were 104,100 incidents of trolley buses and 166,500 incidents of streetcars returning from their route ahead of schedule due to technical malfunction. The unsatisfactory technical condition of the rolling stock results in the cancellation of scheduled runs and schedules not being followed. In 1993, 3.4 million (5.6 percent) of scheduled trolley bus and 2.5 million (9.4 percent) streetcars runs were not accomplished. In a number of cities the frequency of runs of ground passenger electric transport was reduced considerably. The number of completed trolley bus runs in Barnaul dropped by 36 percent as compared to 1992; in Sterlitamak--by 31 percent; in Leninsk-Kuznetsk and Novokuznetsk--by 21 percent and 23 percent, respectively; in Makhachkala--by 19 percent; in Shakhty--by 14 percent; and in Moscow, Cherkessk, Novorossiysk, and Stavropol--by 8-10 percent; of streetcar runs--in Ust-Ilimsk--by 43 percent, Shakhty--by 40 percent, Tver, Karpinsk, Biysk, Novokuznetsk--by 22-30 percent, Astrakhan--by 15 percent, Ufa--by 11 percent, and Tomsk--by 10 percent. Despite considerable rate increases for urban electric transport fares (in December 1993 as compared to December 1992 the cost of fares on streetcars and trolley buses increased by a factor of almost 15), passenger transportation by ground electric transport remains a money-loser. In 1993 in Russia as a whole operating expenses with respect to trolley buses exceeded revenue by R56.5 billion (1.7-fold), and streetcars--by R67.7 billion (1.9-fold). In most cities less than 10 percent of expenditures for maintenance and operation of streetcar and trolley bus transport is covered by sales of fare passes. As a whole in all subways of the Russian Federation in 1993 revenues from transporting paying passengers covered only 29 percent of expenses; in Yekaterinburg this share amounted to 3 percent, Samara--5 percent, Nizhniy Novgorod--14 percent, Moscow--28 percent, St. Petersburg--34 percent, and Novosibirsk--59 percent. Oil and Gas Industry Operations in Tyumen Oblast. In 1993 Tyumen Oblast accounted for 67 percent of all Russian oil production, including gas condensate, and for 91 percent of natural gas. The decline of oil production in the oblast continued in 1993, and for the first time since production of gas began at Tyumen deposits, production of gas decreased as compared to the preceding year. The main indicators characterizing the work of Tyumen Oblast oil and gas industry are shown in the following table: 1990 1992 1993 1992 as % 1993 as % of 1991 of 1992 Oil production, 365 270 236 84 87 including gas condensate, million tonnes Natural gas 574 582 563 100.4 97 production, billion cubic meters Wells available for exploitation wells as of the end of the year: --oil 62.6 69.7 71.7 104 103 including 7.5 16.8 15.8 159 94 nonoperating wells, thousand units --gas 2.6 3.2 3.3 106 106 including 155 174 180 118 103 nonoperating wells, units New wells put in operation: --oil, thousand 9.1 5.7 5.5 75 97 units --gas, units 147 51 118 86 2.3 times Volume of 24.9 15.4 13.7 71 89 development drilling for gas and oil, million meters Average daily production rate: --oil wells, 19.2 14.3 12.6 88 88 tonnes --gas wells 722 667 620 96 93 (Russian Joint-Stock Society Gazprom), thousand cubic meters In 1993 enterprises of the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy system in Tyumen Oblast produced 227 million tonnes of oil, including gas condensate, or 14 percent less than in 1992, and 562 billion cubic meters of gas (3 percent less). Oil production by joint and small enterprises amounted to 7.5 million tonnes, which is 1.7 times more than in 1992, and by Russian Committee for Mineral Resources enterprises--1.5 million tonnes (a 2.1-fold increase). Oil production through application of modern methods of increasing the output of oil beds increased by 14 percent, and its share in the total volume of oil production--from 9 percent in 1992 to 12 percent in 1993. The trend toward an increase in the nonoperating stock of oil wells has been halted. While as of 1 January 1992 it accounted for 15.8 percent of all operating well stock, and on 1 January 1993--24.1 percent; as of January 1994, 22 percent of wells were not operational. At the same time, this figure is considerably higher than the all-Russia average (15 percent). In 1993, 7,600 previously idle oil wells were restored to operation, including 436 wells with the participation of foreign companies on a contract basis, which is 1.7 times and 2.2 times more, respectively, than in 1992. The decline in production of fuel in the oblast as a whole is the result of depletion of major deposits and the lack of money to invest in the development of the fuel industry. As compared to 1990, the average daily production rate of oil wells declined by one-third. The rate of water encroachment of the pool increased from 75 percent to 80 percent. As a result, the energy-intensiveness of oil production in the oblast almost doubled. A similar situation is beginning to develop in the gas industry, where the average daily production rate of wells over the indicated period declined by 14 percent. The situation with respect to utilization of associated petroleum gas in not improving. In 1993, 23 percent of gas produced at oil fields was burned in flares (21 percent in 1990). The volume of capital investment in the oblast's fuel industry from all sources of financing is continuously declining; in 1993 alone in the oil industry it dropped as compared to the preceding year by 46 percent, and in the gas industry--by 29 percent. Lack of money for investment is to a considerable extent a result of consumer insolvency. As of 1 February 1994, Tyumen Oblast oil industry enterprises were owed R4.3 trillion, and gas industry enterprises--R0.5 trillion. In 1993 Tyumen Oblast industrial enterprises earned $2.8 billion--mainly from exports, which equals 22 percent of all Russian industry's foreign currency earnings. Over the year $1.2 billion was used for imports. Among products imported were 83,000 tonnes of steel pipe, 88,300 tonnes of liquid-carrying pipe, 3,000 vacuum and air pumps, and other equipment. The amount of money remaining in enterprises' foreign currency accounts amounted as of 1 January 1994 to $1.5 billion. In January-February of this year, oil production, including gas condensate, amounted to 33.9 million tonnes, or 13 percent less than over the corresponding period of last year; and natural gas--99.5 billion cubic meters, which corresponds to the level of January-February of 1993. Foreign Investment. According the Russian Goskomstat data, foreign investment in the economy of the Russian Federation in 1993 amounted to $2.9 billion. Of that, $2.6 billion (89.7 percent of all investment) was direct investment (which gives the investor the right to participate in managing the enterprise).
