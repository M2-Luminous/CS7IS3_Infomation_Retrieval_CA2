The southerners had vowed to retaliate after Aden's oil refinery was bombed on Sunday and storage tanks set ablaze. A Western oil official said that two planes dropped bombs near one of the facilities in the Ma'rib oil field in north eastern Yemen early Monday but there was no damage. The official news agency SABA' said the attack by southern warplanes was "unsuccessful" and that the jets were driven off by northern jets. The oil company Yemen Hunt Oil, a local subsidiary of the Dallas-based Hunt Oil, is still operating in the Ma'rib field neighboring the Shabwah region. The Ma'rib zone produces 320,000 bpd, nearly all of Yemen's output.
