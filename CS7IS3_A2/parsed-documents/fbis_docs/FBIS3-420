Levy] [Text] Johannesburg March 6 SAPA -- The latest killings in Bhambayi, north of Durban, were a grim warning that the intolerance of African National Congress [ANC] and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters would deprtve people of freely exercising their democratic right of choice during the elections, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said on Sunday [6 March]. Reacting to the murder of at least eight people in the squatter settlement, Mr Kriel said continuing violence showed the ANC and IFP leadership cared only about power and not about people's lives. Both organisations had had years to end their power struggle but their leaders had only used people's lives as pawns in their power game. "The ANC and IFP pay only lip service to peace and democracy but have done nothing to control their supporters," said Mr Kriel in a statement issued to SAPA.
