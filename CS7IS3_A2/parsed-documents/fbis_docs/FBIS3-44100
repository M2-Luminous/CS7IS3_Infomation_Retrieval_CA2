FBIS3-44100 "drafr016_c_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-016 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 25 Jan MB2501135594 MB2501135594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Clear ANC Economic Policy Required -- "As the outflow of capital increases alarmingly, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals calls on the ANC [African National Congress] to help staunch the flow," notes a page 20 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 January. "What is required, he says, is a final and clear statement on the organisation's economic policies. Many of South Africa's older citizens would also like the ANC's comment on disturbing speculation that a new government will scrap a major tax concession on retirement annuities. Stals is right: uncertainty is contributing to the flood, and the ANC should speak loud and clear before it is too late." BUSINESS DAY ANC Policy Contribution to Balance of Payments Exaggerated -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 25 January in a page 8 editorial notes that Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals "blamed uncertainty over the ANC's economic policy for most of the R[rand]10bn [billion] outflow" in the second half of 1993. According to Stals the "pre-election ANC ambiguity could worsen the haemorrhage on the capital account of the balance of payments. But Stals is probably exaggerating the contribution of ANC economic policy -- or lack of it -- to balance of payments problems." "Most foreign banks do not want to make commitments beyond April," but the reason for that "probably has more to do with political stability than with ANC economic policy." So the ANC will be careful about responding to Stals's call for a clearer ANC economic policy, "as it balances the risk of losing votes with the knowledge that no major turnaround in the balance of payments can be expected until after the election. It should nevertheless place more emphasis on its commitment to financial discipline." SOWETAN S. Africa Able To Influence Events in Lesotho -- South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha's "smugness over what is happening in Lesotho is discomforting," declares a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 25 January. "South Africa was involved in the various military governments that have affected that kingdom's fortunes. There is no doubt that South Africa is able to influence events in Lesotho in various ways. It can close the border gates and, at best, can send in armed forces to help Mokhehle. There is no need for Botha to be so smarmy about the misfortunes currently befalling this unhappy country." Furore Over 'Communists' on ANC Election List -- A second editorial on the same page says the "furore over the number of SACP [South African Communist Party] members in the ANC's parliamentary list is amusing but shows the hard ball that will be played in events running up to the elections." In the election fight the ANC's opponents will "deliberately forget or ignore the fact that the link with the SACP goes back many years. There will be an attempt to use the communist bogeyman to scare white voters from the organisation. And while all this is quite silly, it will be the way in which the elections are to be fought." BEELD Zulu Leaders Must Reconsider Boycott Strategy -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 18 January says in a page 8 editorial: "When King Goodwill Zwelithini and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi began to beat the ethnic drums last year over the so-called elimination of the Zulus, BEELD warned that fires were being fanned which could be difficult to douse." "The stayaway action which was planned as a show of strength to coincide with the king's meeting with the state president was purportedly not arranged by Mr. Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, but that is purely academic. The IFP leader, who has always strongly opposed any stayaways and consumer boycotts by the ANC and its allies on account of the economic disruption caused, this time gloated over the Zulu nationalists' actions. The fires which have been fanned for the past months flared dangerously on the Reef in the form of vehicle hijackings, intimidation, arson, violence, and even loss of life. These actions by the followers of the two leaders will not promote their cause or win them new friends in the black community or even among moderate whites. The politically 'neutral' Zulu monarch has now been dumped knee-deep in the political arena -- a step he might regret. There is an urgent need for the two leaders to think seriously about their boycott strategy. It is based on incorrect facts and misconceptions and is being spurred on by misplaced political ambitions." Dialogue Needed on ANC Reconstruction Plan -- A second editorial on page 8 points out: "There is no doubt that the ANC's plan for economic and social reconstruction has fundamental shortcomings. The question is, what must be done to ensure a better and more workable plan?" BEELD concludes: "We firmly believe there is a growing number of white South Africans who accept the realities of their fatherland, and understand that they will be asked to make sacrifices. But then the demands made on them must be realistic and fair, and above all must not be perceived as punishment. If the ANC takes note of that, the basis will be laid for a sober debate on an explosive issue." `Limited Violence' Not Easily Controlled -- General Constand Viljoen, chairman of the Afrikaner National Front, AVF, speaks of 'limited violence' to achieve the Afrikaner homeland. He might believe he can keep it limited, but I am not so certain," argues Willie Kuhn in his "Political BEELD" column on page 10 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 January. "One example suffices: It appears that there is an onslaught on members and property of the ANC in the Orange Free State. One cannot be sure who is responsible, but it would be surprising if it were not the right wing. Let's assume this pattern continues. Does Gen. Viljoen believe there will be no reaction? We will then be back in the eighties; violence begets violence." Mandela Outbursts Against De Klerk `Inopportune' -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 January in a page 10 editorial criticizes Mandela's "two-facedness". "Mr. Mandela accuses President de Klerk of orchestrating violence in the townships with the aim of stopping the ANC from winning the April elections." BEELD questions why Mandela resorts to this when he and De Klerk are presently engaged in talks to try and find a solution to the violence in black townships. "Or does he want to wreck this peace plan for the townships?" One can understand that the ANC, co-responsible for "the bloody political battle in black townships," is eager to win the election, but then one at least expects a future state president to be more careful when talking about the present head of state. His unproven allegations are not promoting the political climate and feeds the general idea that "what he says today contradicts what he says the following day." This will affect his credibility. "The first welcome fruits of joint control over the security forces are being reaped," notes a second editorial on the same page. "The ANC's announcement that a campaign is to be launched in unrest areas on the East Rand to 'educate' residents to accept the police and Defense Force and to stop attacks on them, is a direct result of the extensive democratization process currently underway in the country." "The sooner other organizations copy this example, the quicker the quality of life will improve for all South Africans." The ANC should, however, refrain from creating the perception that the security forces are an extension of any particular political grouping, for this will only exacerbate existing problems. "Ultimately, it is the community in general that must make the security forces feel welcome."
