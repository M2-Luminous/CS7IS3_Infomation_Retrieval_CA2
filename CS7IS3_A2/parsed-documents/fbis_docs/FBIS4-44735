Special. High-Tech": "Machines of the Future. Closer Man-Machine Contact. German Manufacturers for Years Developed Machines As Their Customers Stood By Watching. Now for the First Time the Units Are Operator-Friendly and No Longer Shut Out the Know-How of Skilled Operators"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On the broader front research institutes and companies have set about long overdue radical changes: - Intuitive input and programming by means of graphic symbols, voice and gestures. Aspect GmbH in Norderstedt has developed voice recognition for a limited number of machine commands. Siemens researchers recently introduced an image processing system in which a hand gesture is sufficient to control the machine interfaced to the system. - Process control and monitoring. From now on operators will be able to be informed directly on the machine's screen about every situation, invoke auxiliary functions and intervene in the computer-controlled process. Grundig Gildemeister Automation GmbH in Hannover has integrated into the control system the operator's manual, that up to now has been on paper, so that the operator can consult it at the scene of the action. - Planning. Via internetworking with production planning, the machine operator already in the near future will be able to decide totally on his own when and in which order he wants to make individual parts. Not that the industry's mighty have accelerated the progress of the change, but former outsiders like Oberhachinger Autocon GmbH, R&D Steurung und Datentechnik [Control and Data Systems Technology] GmbH in Mochengladbach, R. & S. Keller GmbH in Wuppertal, Augustin & Partner GmbH in Neubrandenburg, and IG Metall [Industrial Trade Union of Metal Workers]. It starts with seemingly trivial changes that reactivate the operator's senses: For instance, in R. & S. Keller's control system the screen and operator's panel are to be moved so that the operator always has the monitor and machining process simultaneously in his field of view. Or that the operator, in spite of complete enclosing, can listen into the machines in order to monitor acoustically the machining process. Sensors and headphones suited for this purpose have been developed at the Kassel cluster college's Institute for Ergonomics. Then the operator's closer contact with the machine brings about, with revolutionary simple programming and control systems, a decisive jump in productivity--for instance, via Keller's GKE/CAM or Autocon's Autowop M, that the operator can operate in the shop, as well as control systems that enable intervention in automatic operations. Up to now programs for machines have had to be written with cryptic- appearing commands like G0, L100 or M30. Because each control system producer has its own dialect, the mastery of a single type of control system really represents a truly Herculean task. "It is almost impossible for a single operator to be able to operate several machines at the same time," complains Herbert Schulz, head of the Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Machine Tools at Darmstadt Technical College. The consequence: Programs are being created in production planning and not by the operator in the shop. "New factory models with team work and fractal structures are accordingly from the outset doomed to failure," Werner Bauer, manager of the European Federation of Fractal Enterprises GmbH in Nuremburg, says knowingly. However, Keller and Autocon make do without a program code line: For instance, if the operator wants to turn a taper by means of GKE/CAM, he chooses the proper graphic symbol from a menu and enters the coordinates and machine data. Before the machine sets to work, the operator can view the part in three dimensions on the screen and run through a simulation of the machining process. Outstanding point: So-called postprocessors knit together from these entries conventional programs for over 30 different types of control systems, and these programs can then be run online or from diskette. Keller, thinking ahead, is adding one other thing to its new CNCplus control system that is now coming on the market. Not just that programming on the machine is a cinch here, similar to GKE/CAM software. CNCplus weds the computer control system to two handwheels that are normally used to control conventional machines and are not present on any current CNC machine. A lathe or milling machine so equipped can now for the first time in the world be run manually, semiautomatically and fully automatically. Other manufacturers are slowly following suit: Grundig Gildmeister Automation has now introduced a control system that upgrades conventional machines to semiautomatic CNC machines. The integration, now beginning, of complex computer technology and manual operation is urgently necessary. In German companies CNC machines live in the shadows with a meager 15-percent share of the machine inventory. This is the operators' revenge: "Because one could hardly operate CNC machines, operators stuck with conventional machines," Autocon head Hannes W. Politsch says knowingly. This, says the former vice president of Deckel, "is a considerable productivity disadvantage for the base of Germany vis-a-vis Japan and the U.S." User-friendly machines will gain in importance even more in the future. Further improved performance is to be expected in every type of machine, with high-speed machining, greater precision and the use of new materials. On paper anyway. Autocon head Politsch says, urging haste, "If a revolution does not occur now at the man-machine interface, the advantages will be theoretical."
