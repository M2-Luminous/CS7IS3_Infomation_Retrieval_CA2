I represent Lithuania -- one of the three Baltic states which base their development on universal and acknowledged values: Democracy, freedom, human rights, the supremacy of law, and social justice. I believe that one of the most important things that we have gained in Lithuania after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 is the feeling of, and the aspiration for, unity with Europe. This is a clear understanding in the people that Lithuania is a European state. Lithuanian people are consistently implementing and testifying to this inner principle in practice. Apart from all this, we do not mean that Lithuania expects benefits from Europe, but we mean that it is actively looking for ways of becoming useful and interesting to Europe. We pursue neither a policy of nationalistic egoism nor state isolation. On the contrary, our openness and readiness to reconciliate different interests meeting in Lithuania and the desire for wise compromises push us ahead. We cannot allow Lithuania, which, incidentally, is in the geographic center of Europe, to become its province. There are people in this assembly who are familiar with my background and who have heard that I headed the secession of the Lithuanian Communist Party from Moscow. Back in 1989, we clearly spoke out for a democratic and independent Lithuanian state. That was the first move of its sort in the former Soviet Union, which was transferred to the CPSU monolith in 1989. I do not want to overestimate any party or movement, the role of one politician or another in restoring the independent Lithuania. The will of the Lithuanian people themselves to manage their affairs and create a citizens' community and a democratic state was and remains the decisive basis for change. History itself, the beginning of reform in the former Soviet Union, and support of the free world community for our aspirations, which pursued the policy of nonrecognition of occupation and annexation, create conditions for this state to become a reality. In the first direct presidential elections in the history of Lithuania, people voted for me as I am, knowing my background. I am convinced that history has granted a chance for all Lithuanian people, including myself, to create a democratic state and a new community, where people should not be divided into winners and losers. The collapse of the communist system in Eastern and Central Europe, and the deepening processes of integration in the West, simply do not leave any other alternative than participation in building the new Europe. Following the "Cold War" and ideological confrontation, I think that we would not be satisfied with a Europe of "cold peace" and local conflicts. Lithuania, as well as other Eastern and Central European states, would like to see the West expand its attention and assistance to the countries east of the fallen Berlin Wall, treating this region as an integral part of the new Europe. The West should have a better understanding of the complicated and real problems, and even dangers that could ensue from the increasing instability in some Eastern states. In terms of European security and stability, and within the context of the predicted expansion of the European Union to the East, the importance of the Stability Pact becomes obvious. Lithuania understands this initiative not only as a forum for discussions on regional security and stability problems, but also as an effective measure for regulating interstate political conflicts and a means of preventive diplomacy. Exerting our efforts to prevent the problems of ethnic minorities and borders from posing additional threats to the security of regions or even of all Europe, we should not forget the influence of economic and social factors and their link with these problems. It seems that the latter could be resolved through the so-called "additional agreements" which are envisioned in executing the pact. Last spring, during my meeting with members of the Vilnius University Senate and ambassadors accredited in Vilnius on the occasion of Lithuania's admission to the European Council, as well as during the summit meeting in Vienna, I proposed to hold a conference of the heads of new democratic states. This conference could be held under the auspices of the European Council. This would not be an attempt to form another bloc or a place to complain of economic difficulties. The most important thing is that we could have businesslike consultations on how to strengthen the democratic system, conduct reforms related to it, and overcome difficulties that are common to most countries. West European states have learned the art of democratic and equal cooperation for decades. We do not have so much time. It would be very important if we could shorten this time by joint effort and with the assistance of the European Council. I believe that the participation in this conference of Western States, which have the experience of the successful transition from autocracy to democracy, would be extremely significant. I see the exceptional role of the European Council in ensuring progress in the creation of a new and democratic Europe. The activities of the Parliamentary Assembly are important both in implementing pan-European political cooperation, and in specifying, defining, and defending human rights and freedoms considering the world changes under way. It is very important that all European institutions, which are already operating or which are being created, function in agreement, without mutual duplications and contradictions. Our country has achieved a sufficient level of political, economic, and social stability. Since the 1992 democratic elections, all government institutions projected in the new Constitution, that was adopted in a referendum, have functioned in Lithuania. Nine political parties are represented in the Seimas [parliament]. The current majority in the Seimas is held by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, which has formed a stable government. Several opposition factions are very active. Implementing the principle of division and balance of powers, the Constitutional Court has begun its work. A multiparty system is emerging in society, while the government does not restrict the freedom of speech. The Seimas is debating the law on local self- governments, which defines their duties, responsibility, and relations with central bodies in a more detailed and stricter manner. We do not have any problems with either ethnic minorities or borders. We have adopted a law on investments favorable to foreign investors. We have curbed inflation. Lithuania has had a stable currency for a year, the viability of which is guaranteed by sufficient gold and hard currency resources. According to the statistics of representatives of the European Union [EU], privatization in Lithuania is the most rapid among all other Eastern and Central European countries. More than half of the employed population works in the nonstate sector. Living standards have stabilized after a four-year decline, even though they are not high. We have halted the dangerous rise in the crime rate. A stratum of active people with initiative is emerging in the process of reform. Certainly, all of this strengthens the foundation of democracy. At the same time, we notice, however, that hidden unemployment is spreading in Lithuania. A considerably high crime rate infringes on citizens' rights and affects the development of market relations. Sometimes the freedom of speech also encounters economic problems, when it is necessary not only to publish but also to sell a newspaper, or to financially support an independent radio or television station. There are too many people living on the verge of poverty. The middle class is slow in emerging. The ill- considered reform in agriculture has produced very painful social and economic effects. The influx of foreign investments into Lithuania is overly slow. I regret that last fall, the Seimas failed to rally the qualified majority for the constitutional amendment allowing the sale of land to foreign investors. Under current Lithuanian law, foreigners can lease land for 99 years. Seeing these troubles as typical of newly democratic states, we realize that thus far we have secured the irrevocability of reform. However, we have not yet achieved the stage in which reform, designed to create a social market, would become the source of wealth and progress for all citizens. Therefore, we will require much effort to escape impasse in the transitional period and the danger of returning to the autocratic rule common to Eastern and Central Europe between the wars. Taking this opportunity, I would like to repeatedly express Lithuania's determination to sign the European (Association) Agreement with the EU as early as this year, which would become an unequivocal sign of support for our reform. It seems that this time we, the people from Eastern and Central Europe, must encourage Westerners for more resolute and powerful moves, and remind them that their hesitation and indecisiveness can again divide Europe and deprive us of our future. The time has come to welcome our future. The European Council seems to have been the first organization that had enough courage to greet and admit this future along with us, the newly democratic states. On behalf of Lithuania, I express my gratitude to the European Council, which rendered and continues to render vital support to the development of democratic traditions in our state. European security is indivisible. Therefore, Lithuania's security is indivisible from that of Europe. On 27 January of this year, Lithuania joined the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program, stressing its goal -- from partnership to full NATO membership. It is important to note that Lithuania's cooperation is not and cannot be directed against any European state. Defense and political integration with Europe through cooperation with NATO and the West European Union will be impossible and unreal without the possibility of speeding up Lithuania's political and economic relations with the EU. Good relations with neighbors is Lithuania's priority. Thus far, there have not been any serious reasons that could hamper Lithuania's good-neighborly relations with Russia, Poland, or Belarus. I say nothing about cooperation among the three Baltic states, where recently we have passed over from good intentions and projects to their implementation and the creation of relevant structures. The free-trade agreement among Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia has come into effect. A unified visa space is emerging. The bodies of parliamentary cooperation are operating, while those of government cooperation are being created. Meetings among the presidents are held regularly. The three Baltic states attach great importance to the expansion of cooperation with the five Nordic states according to the formula "3 plus 5," as well as with the states of the Baltic Sea region and Eastern and Central Europe. This complies with Lithuania's strategic foreign policy goals. I assess the initialing of the Lithuanian-Polish treaty as a great political success. The treaty testifies to the growing mutual understanding between the two countries and nations, and provides a legal backdrop to our historical conflicts. The Lithuanians and the Poles, who had lived in one state in the Middle Ages, were divided by profound hostility in the first half of this century concerning the fate of Lithuania's capital Vilnius and its region. Echoes of this hostility are sometimes felt in society's moods and in statements by some politicians even today. I think that this agreement, which President L. Walesa and I will sign in 12 days in Vilnius, will allay the path of both countries to the new Europe and become a substantial contribution to the stability of the continent and the Stability Pact. The process of reconciliation, which began in Europe after World War II, is inexorably spreading from West to East. The place where this process would halt could, probably, mean an end to the Europe of the 21st century. In sight of the tragedies in the Caucasus and former Yugoslavia, which seemed to be impossible in the late ah century, we must find a more operative and effective possibility for utilizing the influence of international organizations, including that of the European Council. Multilateral international cooperation is another level about which I would like to speak. Although Lithuania is not a large state in geopolitical terms, I believe that from most viewpoints all countries are relatively small today in comparison with the problems that have befallen Europe, the goals of universal integration, and the future perspective. Therefore, I fully support the idea of the French prime minister that there are no small or large states in Europe but that there are only partners of the common cause. I suppose that the European Council will have an exceptional role in Europe's architecture -- as a forum of equal pan-European states, an effective guarantor of states' commitments in the sphere of human rights, and a mechanism for implementing new initiatives. The expansion of the European Council is another responsible task that emerges in projecting the new Europe and promoting political dialogue. I am certain that the compliance of candidates with the principles and standards of the European Council will be checked on very thoroughly, and that they will be rendered the necessary assistance in implementing these principles and standards. The integration among the three Baltic states largely depends on Latvia's membership in the European Council. The ethnic situation in Latvia, which emerged over the period of Soviet occupation, is unique. However, the problems arising from it should not be the reason for delaying Latvia's full membership. I suppose that Russia has a chance to implement democracy and escape the outbreak of dangerous imperial forces. Therefore, the procedure of Russia's membership begun by the Parliamentary Assembly implies political and moral support for the democratic forces of this country. The withdrawal of its Army from Latvian and Estonian territories by 31 August of this year would be a favorable reflection of Russia's intention to peacefully regulate its relations with neighbors. At the same time, I would like to draw your attention to another trait in Russia's relations with neighbors that has become distinct recently. One had the impression in the second half of the past year that new relations based on constructive and mutually beneficial cooperation were emerging between Lithuania and Russia. As had been agreed, Russia withdrew its Army from Lithuania, and I met with President B. Yeltsin. Shortly thereafter, Russian Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin paid a visit to Vilnius where he signed 10 agreements. Unfortunately, the subsequent developments demonstrate that it is not so easy to change the established stereotypes in relations with smaller neighbors. The trade and economic agreement signed between Lithuania and Russia has not yet come into force due to the latter's position. Lithuania, as well as other Baltic states, is not included on the list of countries with which Russia concludes normal trade agreements. It would be important for us, and, I think, also for other European states, to know whether the aforementioned facts reflect the work style of Moscow's officials or its political line. It is regrettable that defending the Russian- speaking population by words, Russia is actually worsening the social situation of those citizens by applying economic levers against Lithuania. This will primarily halt large enterprises in Lithuania and other Baltic states, the output of which is largely exported to Russia and the workers of which are mostly Russian speakers. In my opinion, Russia's principles in relations with neighbors should comply with universally acknowledged principles of international law. I think that Russia's respect for the sovereignty of the Baltic states, the rejection of the concept of "near abroad countries," and the execution of international agreements would speed up the decision of the European Council on this country's membership. The Baltic states and, I would suppose, the European Council would assess it as most positive if Russia's governmental institutions officially dissociated themselves from some political groups in the parliament and their statements negating the lawfulness of the independence of the Baltic states and the territorial inviolability of some European states. Lithuania has a common border with Russia through Kaliningrad Oblast. Therefore, it is very important to us whether this region that used to be the military outpost of the former Soviet Union will gradually be demilitarized and will become a zone of active business. We feel positive efforts in this direction both from Moscow and Kaliningrad. However, sometimes one can notice the opposite tendencies as well. I think that Russia and its neighbors would be interested in attracting capital and various businessmen to this area, and in a larger role of international organizations there, particularly that of the EU. Here is the last idea that I would like to share with you. Lithuania freed itself after 50 years of oppression. Therefore, the appeal that was voiced at the summit meeting of the European Council in Vienna urging to combat national egoism, ethnic hatred, racism, and anti-Semitism is very important to us. I can assure you on behalf of the Lithuanian leadership that we are strictly following this Vienna declaration. Lithuania can rightly take pride in the rational resolution of ethnic problems, including those of the Russian minority. It is strange that now and then we hear unfounded accusations against Lithuania, from both the Russian press and some politicians. The tradition of ethnic tolerance is viable in our country, and we are interested in its further promotion, particularly among young people. We can remember that not a single ethnic minority has disappeared in Lithuania over 600 years. Another historical topic painful to all of us is linked with the Jewish genocide and the execution of the fascist regime in Lithuania during World War II. I mourn those numerous victims. I also regret the fact that some Lithuanians participated in punitive actions. Therefore, I state firmly that all criminals who have not yet been reached by the hand of justice must be exposed and punished. We are accomplishing this with consistency and calling on all interested organizations and individuals to cooperate with us. Maybe, not everything has been yet said about those tragic events. However, we are not afraid to speak about them, and with open hearts we seek mutual understanding both with Israel and the Jewish communities in our state and others. The firm basis for this is not only the centuries-old tradition of the Lithuanian and Jewish nations living together on the same land, but also the self-sacrifice of hundreds of Lithuanians in saving Jews persecuted during the war. Now that we have restored Lithuania's independence, we have accomplished much in rebuilding hundreds of Jewish graveyards and monuments, and granting possibilities for their cultural and educational activities. Lithuania is working intensively to bring its laws in line with the European Council Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms. The president's duty to submit international agreements for ratification, contained in the Constitution, has encouraged me to set up a group that engages in active work and cooperates with European Council experts. Being fully aware of your constant attention and the fixed limit of the "proper period," I will assure the most rapid ratification of this convention. By joining conventions that constitute the European Agreement System, Lithuania not only assumes new commitments but also acquires new possibilities. Integration with this system is one of our state's priority goals. Lithuania realizes the importance of its state commitments to the international community, and primarily to its people. The exceptional significance of the European Council in Europe's current changes repeatedly proves that the human dimension is the basis for the lives and reinforcement of all democratic states.
