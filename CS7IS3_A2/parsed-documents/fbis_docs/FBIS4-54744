Petersen, who arrived for a two-day visit to Slovakia, said that once Scandinavian states and Austria are admitted to the EU, "a long-term" need to expand the community eastwards would arise because union between West and East was the only guarantee of stability on the continent. Asked by CTK whether Denmark preferred individual or joint entry of Central European countries into the EU, Petersen said the EU would apply the same model as in admitting the Scandinavian countries and Austria. The pattern is clear and logical: to conduct talks with each country separately, but simultaneously to the biggest measure possible, he stressed. Petersen said that there were no problems in relations between Slovakia and Denmark, but added that trade was very low and cooperation other areas could also be promoted. Before Slovakia Petersen visited the Czech Republic.
