Before his departure to Warsaw, he gave an interview to our correspondent. Minister Zlenko emphasized that Ukraine attaches special attention to Poland both in terms of politics and diplomacy. For Ukraine, the existence of independent Poland is of strategic importance, as is the existence of independent Ukraine for Poland. Ukraine expects that the visit to Poland will help it achieve more understanding in interstate relations, stabilize relations, encourage closer cooperation and coordination of efforts on the international arena -- both in the system of international organizations and regional cooperation. [Levytskyy] The opinion is widely held that Ukrainian-Polish economic relations are not developing in an appropriate way. [Zlenko] Over the past two years of Ukrainian-Polish relations, a relevant legal base was created and 45 necessary agreements were signed, a considerable portion of which are in the economic sphere. However, figures for Ukrainian-Polish trade do not reflect potential opportunities. The $500 million is far from the level that would give either side the feeling of fully exploited opportunities and mutually beneficial economic cooperation. Economic agreements should receive more attention, and we must also create mechanisms for their implementation. [Levytskyy] Still, which of the 45 agreements with Poland have already brought tangible results? [Zlenko] Almost all of them work at present, but not at their full capacity, though. [Levytskyy] In January and in early February, the U.S.-devised "Partnership for Peace" initiative received very mixed opinions. Now, six weeks after Ukraine became a member of the "Partnership," could you point to any concrete advantages that membership in this initiative has given Ukraine? [Zlenko] Ukraine was the first CIS country to join this program. We did this to hold relevant consultations, acquire relevant experience in military and political spheres, and finally, to resolve issues of our national security through the "Partnership." We are currently preparing a document outlining forms and extension of Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership." We are working hard on this document. We will determine everything that is of any interest for Ukraine, based on our possibilities, including economic ones, so that we could definitely establish the volume of our cooperation with that program. [Levytskyy] But I am curious what price Ukraine will have to pay for its participation in the "Partnership?" [Zlenko] This question cannot be answered before we finish our document. [Levytskyy] What economic effects will political participation in this program have on Ukraine? [Zlenko] The "Partnership" program is first of all military and political in nature. But the very fact of cooperation in the framework of this program, the fact of agreement, can incline our partners to also resolve economic issues. We do not link our membership in this program with resolving economic problems. We see it in the much broader context. [Levytskyy] Political parties in Poland, Ukraine, and other former socialist camp countries are actively discussing the idea of creating a political and economic center or an alliance for coordination of efforts. Promoters of such an alignment dubbed it the "Inter-Sea Area" [Mizhmorya]. Are you familiar with this initiative? What do you think about it? [Zlenko] We have an initiative intended to establish a zone of stability and security in the Central and Eastern Europe. We are working on this idea, and have conducted organizational measures -- also with the participation of countries that expressed their interest in it. I believe I gave a comprehensive answer to your question. We are proceeding from the assumption that some kind of security vacuum is emerging in Europe which needs to be filled. This initiative could be used to solve all issues based on trust and the creation of the political climate so that it could serve as a preventive measure. This would allow us to preempt events, instead of following them, as is the case in the Balkans. No matter what name this initiative has -- the "Inter-Sea Area," "Inter-Ocean Area," or "Between Heaven and the Earth" -- it is designed to provide conditions for national security guarantees. [Levytskyy] Jacek Kuron and other Polish politicians have repeatedly stressed that Ukrainian-Polish relations could only get rid of negative tendencies when Polish history is written by Ukrainians and vice versa. What is your attitude toward this problem? [Zlenko] This problem was discussed during my first visit to Poland in 1992. We agreed on the need to write such history. We have reached understanding. Unfortunately, this is idea is unfolding very slowly. However, it is not dead. Joint commissions are actively working on revising history textbooks. This work is drawing to a close. [Levytskyy] One more question regarding mutual understanding. An idea was proposed some time ago to cast Polish television programs to Ukraine, and Ukrainian to Poland... [Zlenko] This is an interesting thought. However, it needs some work yet. The Ukrainian State Television is putting together its programs intended to access other countries. This issue needs to be specified so one can develop a clear position and know how to implement this idea. [Levytskyy] Some delegations, Polish among them, met with representatives of political parties on their visits to Ukraine. At present, there are three directions in the Polish Eastern policy -- the first one is orientation toward Moscow, the second gives priority to cooperation with Ukraine and Belarus, while the third option advocates the soonest possible jump into the United Europe with no regard to the fate of Eastern neighbors. Do you plan to meet with any leaders of political parties? [Zlenko] We orient ourselves toward the Polish official policy. Besides, I have plenty of meetings in the government, Sejm, and Senate that will give me the picture of current trends. But let me stress it again -- we are primarily oriented toward the official politics.
