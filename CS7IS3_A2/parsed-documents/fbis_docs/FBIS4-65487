Even after his personal meeting with [Italian Foreign Minister] Martino, the president of the European Commission was not thrown off balance: "The new foreign minister strove to reassure me that Italy will pursue its traditional policies in the European field. This is all. I have noted what he had to say," he stated to a small group of journalists in a corridor at European Council headquarters. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Do you indeed feel reassured, Mr. President? [Delors] I am a prudent man. Experience has taught me to judge from facts, not words. On the other hand, I do not want to call intentions into question. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] What assurances or guarantees have you requested from Minister Antonio Martino as regards the continuity of Italian policies? [Delors] None. In fact, what articles of the Community treaties could I have invoked in order to put his Europeanism to the test? I am certainly not a teacher examining students and giving out marks. This is not my role. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Early in the year you met [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi in Brussels. Did you discuss politics with him, or did you receive him simply as a private businessman? [Delors] Yes, I met Mr. Berlusconi, but only in his capacity as a businessman. Of course, I asked him for his opinion -- as a businessman -- of the economic situation in Italy. But we did not discuss politics. If anything, we talked about movies and Cinecitta [film studios in Rome], a subject I am very interested in. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Are you now planning to meet Berlusconi in his capacity as head of the new Italian Government before the European summit in Corfu? [Delors] There are no meetings scheduled. On the other hand, I believe Mr. Berlusconi's agenda is very, very full.
