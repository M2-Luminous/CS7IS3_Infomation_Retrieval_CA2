FR940224-1-00060 FR940224-1-00011 (3) If the Council decides to proceed, a document will be prepared describing the problem and the proposed regulatory adjustment to resolve it. The document will demonstrate how the adjustment is consistent with the purposes of the established measure and that the impacts had been addressed in the document supporting the original imposition of the measure. The document will be submitted to the Regional Director with a recommendation for action. The Council may indicate its intent that the recommendations are to be approved or disapproved as a single action. (4) If the Regional Director approves part or all of the Council's recommendation, the Secretary, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, may implement the approved change in an established measure by publishing a final rule, waiving advance notice and comment. This does not preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional opportunity for advance notice and comment, but contemplates that the Council process will satisfy the requirements of the Magnuson Act and Administrative Procedure Act. It is emphasized that established measures are measures that have been evaluated and applied in the past, and adjustments are meant to be consistent with the original intent of the measure and within the scope of analysis in previous documents supporting the existing measure. (5) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(e) of the Magnuson Act. (d) Procedure for implementing new measures. (1) New measures are those that have not been used before or measures that, while previously applied, would be applied to another fishing sector (e.g., non-longline pelagic fishery) or gear type for the first time. New measures may have been previously considered in a past FMP amendment or document, but the specific impacts on the persons to whom the measures would newly apply have not been evaluated in the context of current conditions. Potential new measures include, but are not limited to: Permit requirements for new fishery sectors; reporting requirements for a fishery sector other than longline fishing; effort limitations; quotas (for total catch or by species) including individual transferable quotas; fractional licensing; or bycatch limits. (2) A Pelagics Plan Team report (annual report or an in-season report), input from advisors, or input from NMFS or other agencies will first bring attention to a problem or issue that needs to be addressed at the next Council meeting. In its notice announcing the meeting, the Council will summarize the concern or issue raised, the party that has raised the problem, and the extent to which it is a new problem or a problem that may require new management measures. The Council will seek to identify all interested persons and organizations and solicit their involvement in discussion and resolution of this problem through the Council process, and the Council meeting notice in the Federal Register will emphasize that this problem will be discussed and that proposed actions may result. (3) The document presenting the problem to the attention of the Council will be distributed to all advisory bodies of the Council who have not yet received it, with a request for comments. The document also will be distributed to the Council's mailing list associated with the FMP to solicit inputs and to indicate the Council will take up action at the following meeting. The Council's chairperson may request the Council's Pelagics Standing Committee to discuss the issue and review the comments (if any) of the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Panel, Pelagics Review Board, or Scientific and Statistical Committee, and develop recommendations for Council action. (4) At the meeting, the Council will consider the recommendations of its Pelagics Standing Committee, if any, and other Council organizations and will take comments from the public concerning the possible course of action. If the Council agrees to proceed with further action under the framework process, the issue will be placed on the agenda for the following meeting. A document describing the issue, alternative ways to resolve the issue, the preferred action, and the anticipated impacts of the preferred action, will be prepared and distributed to the public with a request for comments. A notice will be published in the Federal Register summarizing the Council's deliberations and preferred action and indicating the time and place for the Council meeting to take final action. (5) In its notice for the following meeting, the Council will indicate that the Council may take final action on the possible adjustment to regulations under this section. At the meeting, the Council will consider the comments received as a result of its solicitation of comments and take public comments during the meeting on the issue or problem. The Council will consider any new information presented or collected and analyzed during the comment period. The Regional Director will be provided a specific opportunity to indicate any objections or concerns about any or all components of the measures being considered. The Council then will decide whether to propose a new measure or measures under this section. (6) If the Council decides to proceed, the Council will submit its proposal to the Regional Director for consideration with supporting rationale and an analysis of the estimated biological, economic and social impacts of the proposed actions. The Council may indicate its intent that all components of its recommendations be approved or disapproved as a single action. (7) If the Regional Director concurs in whole or in part, the Secretary, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, may implement the approved new measure by publishing a final rule, waiving advance notice and comment. Nothing in this procedure is intended to preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional opportunity for advance notice and comment in the Federal Register , but contemplates that the Council process (which includes two Council meetings with opportunity for public comment at each) will satisfy that requirement.
