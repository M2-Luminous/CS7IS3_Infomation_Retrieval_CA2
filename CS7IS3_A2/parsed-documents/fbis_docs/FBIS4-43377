FBIS4-43377 "drweu116_h_94015" FBIS-WEU-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 GERMANY Bundesbank: Economy Improving Despite Unemployment Bundesbank: Economy Improving Despite Unemployment LD1606101794 Berlin DDP/ADN in German 0859 GMT 16 Jun 94 LD1606101794 Berlin DDP/ADN German BFN [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- The German Bundesbank is expecting the number of people out of work in western Germany to continue to rise in 1994. In its monthly report for June, the Bundesbank said the expected level of economic growth will not suffice "to prevent further limited growth in unemployment." In eastern Germany, however, the employment situation seems to be stabilizing, even though official and concealed unemployment remains "depressingly high." The Bundesbank said 2.6 million persons were out of work in western Germany at the end of May, 360,000 more than the same time last year. The number of unemployed in eastern Germany increased during the same period by 63,000 to 1.16 million. The overall state of the western German economy "clearly improved" during the spring, the report said. "Recessionary trends" have evidently been overcome. Counter to earlier fears, the GDP during the first quarter did not fall again but rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 1993, and by 1.5 percent against the first quarter of 1993. A "continuation of this moderate upward trend" is expected for the rest of the year. The main driving force here is currently foreign demand, showing that Germany's exporters have generally retained or restored their competitiveness. The Bundesbank said there was a "clear continuation" of the upward economic trend in eastern Germany during the first months of the year. Output in the manufacturing sector, previously one of the eastern German economy's "weak points," "rose no less than 21.5 percent" over the first quarter last year. The report said this was apparently because more and more eastern German companies are recovering lost market shares and gaining a foothold in the western German market. However, exports have failed to recover. Eastern German companies have so far failed to secure in western export markets the success needed to make up for the loss of their East European export markets.
