The opposition is neck and neck with President Eyadema's party, but there have been cries of foul over the conduct of the poll in the remaining four seats, which were regarded as in the bag for the opposition. Now the electoral commission has handed it all over to the Supreme Court for ratification. But it seems some of the commissioners are far from happy. From Lome, Ebow Godwin reports: [Begin Godwin recording] Togo's National Electoral Commission waded into deep crisis today following decision by four opposition members serving on the commission to resign their posts. The resignation of the four follows the delay by the commission in releasing results of voting in five constituencies in which voting was disrupted by violence during last Sunday's second round of voting. A spokesman for the opposition representative, Pastor Lawson, told reporters that they were pulling out of the commission because of intimidation. Yesterday, Togo's electoral commission said it was withholding results from the five disputed constituencies pending a ruling by the Supreme Court. That decision came only a few hours to the 72-hour deadline within which the commission was required by law to publish all provisional election results. Yesterday's statement said that the commission has submitted all 19 results out of the outstanding 24 constituencies to the Supreme Court for ratification. But opposition sources said they have no confidence in the country's constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court which has to determine petitions, because it is filled with appointees of President Gnassingbe Eyadema. Currently, the constituencies under litigation include two in Wawa, in the north, one in Haho in southern Togo, one in Sokode in central Togo, and one in the Lome metropolis. Under Togo's electoral laws, Togo's Supreme Court has 15 days within which to make a ruling on the petition. [end recording]
