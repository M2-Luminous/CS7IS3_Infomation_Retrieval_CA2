Perez] [Text] Officials who met to discuss an economic growth plan for the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), have agreed to establish an air service system that will promote, develop, and enhance trade and investments in the area. As a step closer toward the realization of a common air service system within the area, the officials have agreed that Brunei will become the focal point of air linkages in the region. "Because of Brunei's strategic location (it is practically smack at the middle of the growth area), it will be positioning as the focal gateway to the EAGA (East ASEAN Growth Area, now known as BIMP-EAGA)," Department of Tourism (DoT) Undersecretary Ramona Lopez-Ty said. Ms. Ty, who was with the Philippine delegation when the ministers of the BIMP-EAGA met in Davao last Saturday, said: "Royal Brunei has offered to take the initiative to add to the frequencies. With their wealth and economic resources, it will not be too difficult for them to expand their (air service) capacities." She reported that Brunei's national carrier, Royal Brunei, had already bought two 50-seater Fokker planes primarily for the purpose of servicing the area. Apart from the existing bilateral air agreements between the BIMP-EAGA member countries, officials are still working for more air linkages, Ms. Ty said. Increased Access She, however, qualified: "We're not talking of open skies here. There are certain rights that our national carriers have that you just don't give away. We're talking of increased accessibility." Ms. Ty reports that the idea of establishing a regional airline jointly owned by the four countries has been shelved. Instead, they are more inclined toward establishing "common operations and increasing air links and capacity."
