As the Oil Information Agency learned in the Russian Customs Committee, its leadership is not yet prepared to comment on the incident, "because we understand that we create a precedent of persecuting a state enterprise which fulfils orders of the government." At the same time, representatives of West Siberian oil and gas enterprises told the agency's correspondent that they do not rule out the possibility of appealing to the Russian President's Administration's Control Department following the facts "of absurd attempts to take the money for export of oil which we must supply under intergovernment agreements to those who do not pay for it." Out of the total amount of payment for this lot of Russian oil (225 billion rubles) Kiev paid less than half. A well-informed source in "Rosneft" said in an interview with the Oil Information Agency that Russian oil and gas enterprises received an additional export quota for supplies in the summer of 1993 of 2.6 million tonnes of oil to Ukraine in connection with "the need to supply this oil anywhere, in order just to unload pipelines." He said that Kiev and Moscow acted in the framework of the Russian-Ukrainian intergovernment agreement envisaging tough terms of payment for Russian fuel supplied to Ukraine. "Rosneft's duty was to conclude contracts with oil plants concerning technical organization of supplies and control payments by the Ukrainian side. Kiev in turn promised to attract foreign investors for paying Russia up to $50 million a month and to purchase up to 20 billion rubles on hard currency exchange to pay for oil supplies. However, despite efforts by Russian organizations, the full debt has not been repaid. Russian government experts note the weakening of Russia's positions on the world and domestic oil markets caused by a fall in oil prices and non-payments crisis. In their opinion, attempts to increase financial pressure on fuel and energy complex enterprises may cause a sharp decline in the extraction of oil and other fuels, as well as a sharp reduction of oil and gas exports.
