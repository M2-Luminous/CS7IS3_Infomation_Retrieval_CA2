There is no doubt of this, and the hearing once again confirmed this. Inasmuch as the Georgian side is not in control of the situation on a significant part of the territory of the former GSSR, we are unable to count on Georgia's fulfillment of all of its treaty obligations. It was noted on several occasions that unless the problems of Georgia's internal structure are settled, and unless there are guarantees of full and honorable resolution of the Abkhazian and South Ossetian problems, which generated bloody conflicts involving many of our fellow countrymen in the recent past, some articles of the treaty (chiefly articles 3 and 4) will, in the event of its ratification, impose a unilateral obligation on Russia to arm the Georgian side, support its attempts to regain control over lost regions, and cut off attempts to assist them (the regions.--NG) from Russian territory in the event of escalation of the military conflict. We must note that by accepting obligations before Georgia in the Caucasus that would be difficult to fulfill even for Russia, we lose the trust of the other parties to the conflict, and do damage to our intermediary peacekeeping mission. ...We reject the capability of the Georgian side to guarantee strict fulfillment of the provisions of the treaty regarding nontransfer of armament and military equipment and technology to third parties. ...The members of the committee support the oral statement by RF President B. N. Yeltsin regarding postponement of submission of the treaty, signed on 3 February 1994, for ratification to the Federal Assembly until the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia are settled. What we cannot understand in any way is this: For what purpose is Russia, as represented by its supreme official, to sign the new treaty, which the president does not intend to submit for ratification, before such a settlement is reached, before Russian demarcation forces are introduced on the line of confrontation along the Ingura River, and before the earlier treaty between Russian and Georgia dated 9 October 1993 is submitted for ratification? ...2. What raises certain concerns in the Committee for CIS Affairs is not the fact itself that besides the treaty an entire list of Russian-Georgian agreements have been signed, including many that are useful and necessary, but that they are not being examined as supplements to and a consequence of the Treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighbor Relations and Cooperation that was concurrently signed and is now subject to ratification. As an example these agreements also include ones like the "Agreement on the Status and Conditions of Operation of Russian Border Troops Located in the Georgian Republic," which foresees transfer of real and movable military property, assistance in personnel training and so on. Members of the committee did not receive an answer in the course of the hearings to the question as to why Article 33 of this agreement, in contrast to the analogous article of the concurrently signed treaty, foresees its enactment "from the day of exchange of written certificates of fulfillment of internal government procedures by the Parties necessary for its enactment," rather than making a direct reference to the need for its ratification. ...All the committee has in this regard is the "Protocol on the Meeting of Delegations of the RF and the Georgian Republic," signed on 3 February of this year by P. Grachev and O. Patsatsiya. The protocol, which requires no ratification, documents only the principle of creating Russian military bases in the Georgian Republic. It is known from statements made at the hearings by the RF minister of defense and representatives of the Defense Ministry that the reference is to the bases in Vaziani, Akhalkalaki and Batumi, with the latter to have branches in Gudauty and Sukhumi. The Abkhazian Supreme Council has already declared that it does not recognize any agreements of which it is not a participant in regard to territory under its control (that is, Gudauty and Sukhumi). ...3. Examining the general problems of the Russian-Georgian agreements, the Committee for CIS Affairs notes that speculations regarding a unilateral advantage for Russia in the signed Russian-Georgian treaty acts do not withstand criticism. The economic assistance provided to the government of the Georgian Republic, which is increasing the amount of Russia's internal government debt, cannot as yet be estimated in absolute figures because we do not have data by which to appraise the value of buildings and structures being transferred to the Georgian Republic, the prices of the military equipment, arms and technology, the cost of leasing military facilities on Georgian territory and so on. Implementation of the agreements will mean reduction of Russian military presence in Georgia. No matter how some superficial conclusions in the press may try to make us believe the reverse, replacement of Russian divisions in Akhalkalaki and Batumi by regiments can in no way be said to be an expansion of military presence. As for growth of our military influence as a result of equipment deliveries and personnel training, the history of Russia and the USSR contains many cases in which equipment and personnel that we trained were used against us (German armament in the 1920s-1930s, assistance to the People's Republic of China after the Second World War, and so on.
