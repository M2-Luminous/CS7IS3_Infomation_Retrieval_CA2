Rescue workers were today planning to continue their search for more victims still believed to be trapped in the rubble. The tragedy happened the day after fire tore through the six- storey printing and dyeing factory and while workers were on the premises, reportedly trying to clear up and salvage goods. Reports yesterday said the authorities had arrested three welders they claim had started the blaze by igniting bales of cotton in the factory, a joint Hong Kong and Chinese venture. No one was hurt in that incident. The factory site, five kilometres north of Macao, was cordoned off by police, and reporters were barred from Zhuhai People's Hospital where an emergency team awaited victims. There were unconfirmed reports that one Hong Kong worker was taken to hospital and three others had died in the tragedy. Last night, 57 of the injured had left hospital and 101 were still being treated. All buildings in the region are being checked by officials today for safety and fire security measures. Some workers suggested a combination of thunderstorms and the fire had prompted the collapse of the damaged building and that many more bodies were still buried in the rubble. The factory employed over 2,000 workers. Labour activists in Hong Kong met in emergency session yesterday and denounced greedy local investors who put profit ahead of human life. A coalition of trade union and human rights groups vowed to fight for strict worker safety regulations, and planned to enlist the support of international labour groups. Rescue teams and firemen were reported to be among those missing in the disaster, which occurred minutes after workers were ordered back into the factory to salvage equipment in the aftermath of Thursday's blaze. The area was not cordoned off by government officials, according to local reports. "How come these workers were allowed back in?" asked Lam Wah-hui, chairman of the Joint Organisation of Unions in Hong Kong. "This is crazy. The authorities should be guarding the site to prevent this kind of disaster. If the area is unsafe, no one should be allowed inside." Representatives of eight worker, human rights and women's groups met yesterday in the territory to form a coalition to improve Chinese worker safety, said Winnie Tam, executive secretary of the Confederation of Trade Unions. "We plan to push investors to pay more attention to worker safety," she said. "Most of these incidents involve Hong Kong investors. We plan to advocate strong measures for the protection of workers in China. They shouldn't be victims of Hong Kong investors." The Zhuhai accident is the second this month involving Hong Kong businessmen. A toy and plastics factory in Shenzhen collapsed two weeks ago, killing 11 migrant workers. Last November 84 people, mostly migrant women workers, died in a fire at another Hong Kong- owned toy factory in Shenzhen.
