[Al-Alfi] Charges have been brought against some of them and are being investigated. [Mansur] Arab and Western intelligence services are said to have helped Egypt contain what you call fundamentalist and terror movements. Can you confirm this? [Al-Alfi] There are no intelligence services working alongside us. However, we coordinate and cooperate through the international police or the Egyptian Foreign Ministry with some countries insofar as those who are wanted and those sentenced in their absence are concerned. [passage omitted] [Mansur] The Muslim Brotherhood are excluded from the mainstream of national dialogue. Don't you think that, considering the group makes up quite a segment of the community, this detracts from the value of the dialogue? [Al-Alfi] You say Muslim Brotherhood; are we a blasphemous brotherhood? [Mansur] We are talking about a party with a political ideology. [Al-Alfi] I am absolutely against the labels Muslim and non-Muslim; Egypt is an Islamic state where the sharia is the prime source for legislation. Do you regard millions as non-Muslim and restrict the adjective to those? This is unacceptable. [Mansur] We are talking about a political party. [Al-Alfi] These are not a party. The party is an organization described by the Constitution and law. If they want to be regarded as such, why not join the political party fold. We can engage in dialogue only legal and legitimate parties. More to the point, it is wrong to found a political party on religious grounds, since all religions will then demand that they have their own parties. [Mansur] You referred to Arab and Islamic repercussions on Islamic Egyptian groups. Have you documented proof to support your contention that terrorism in Egypt receives backing from Arab regimes or Arab Islamic groups? [Al-Alfi] The matter is under investigation by the state prosecution. It does not serve our interests to name governments. However, obviously there are foreign hands involved. [Mansur] You have hinted at the involvement of Sudan and Islamic groups in Algeria, but you ignored the role of certain Gulf states and Usamah Bin-Ladin, for example? [Al-Alfi] I do not want to name names. The investigations are ongoing. It serves no one's interests for me to disclose our line of investigation. All facts will come to light when all the defendants stand trial in public. [Mansur] How are the interests of the nations that you do not want to name served by such an involvement? [Al-Alfi] We are the target of a ferocious onslaught waged not only by the misguided but also by vested interests who have joined forces with the former. They want to hurt Egypt as a superior economic force. By thus hurting Egypt they would intimidate the other Arab states. In any case, they will not succeed; the Egyptian people will spurn misleading ideas. [passage omitted] [Mansur] The Islamists in Egypt maintain links with Afghan Islamists, who, in their turn, had links with the United Staters. Do you see American involvement there aiming to drag Egypt into sectarian conflicts so as to weaken your country? [Al-Alfi] The United States supported Afghanistan not by virtue of the fact that it is an Islamic state, but did that within the context of an anti-communist effort. That support has now served its purpose. Let me here warn about what is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina lest it be used to promote the same end. [Mansur] Do you think Western powers, including the United States, have a stake in instability in Egypt? [Al-Alfi] I will not name names. But there are those with an interest in a weakened Egypt on account of its strategic location, standing, and role. The aim also is to strike at tourism and lead the young section of Egyptian society into thinking tourism is a bad thing an anti-religious. Indeed, there are those who want to hurt us in any way possible and are using Islamists to advance that end.
