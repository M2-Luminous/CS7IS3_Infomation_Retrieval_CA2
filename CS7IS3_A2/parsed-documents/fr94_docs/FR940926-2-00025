ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance. SUMMARY: DOE/NV announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), it is awarding a noncompetitive financial assistance grant for the research of detector materials for nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: U.S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office, ATTN: Steven Curtis, P.O. Box 98518, Las Vegas, NV 89193&hyph;8518. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This award will provide financial support to the Nuclear Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in order to continue materials research work for detectors to aid nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The MIT graduate and doctoral students have made exceptional progress in refining the purity and increasing the size of crystals. This award will enable MIT to continue making great strides in this field of research. These efforts promise to be beneficial to DOE by significantly improving detector efficiency thereby reducing the cost. Eligibility for the award of this grant is being limited to the MIT because of their exclusive domestic capabilities and unique qualifications to perform the activity successfully. The project period of this grant is three years and will commence on October 11, 1994, through September 29, 1997. The total estimated cost of this award is $865,000.
