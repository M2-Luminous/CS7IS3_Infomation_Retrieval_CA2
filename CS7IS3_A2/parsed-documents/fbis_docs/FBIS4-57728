FBIS4-57728 "drlat100_k_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Ambassador to U.S. Supports Patents Law Ambassador to U.S. Supports Patents Law PY2305163394 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2315 GMT 22 May 94 PY2305163394 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS Spanish BFN [Text] Salta, May 22 (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo, Argentine ambassador to the United States, said that he supports the approval of a patents law, adding that "all countries, and not only Argentina, agree that it is advisable to recognize the intellectual rights of researchers." Granillo said: "This is accepted even by the association organized to defend national laboratories. Besides, it is not an Argentine commitment with the United States alone, it is a commitment with the entire international community." The ambassador recalled that Argentina "and another 106 countries signed the GATT agreement," which "obligates" Argentina "to approve a law recognizing patent rights." "The real problem will be if Argentina wants to join NAFTA, because the requirements here are much tougher and anyone wanting to join in must respect the local rules of the game," Granillo Ocampo said, during an interview with the daily EL TRIBUNO from this provincial capital. Granillo Ocampo said Argentina "will try to balance what we and others must give up," adding that "we must not be afraid of this type of conflict, as on most other topics we are working in absolute harmony, together and in agreement." The Argentine ambassador said "it was vital" for Argentina to join NAFTA "to consolidate the model," because "when a country coordinates its macroeconomic polices with other countries, the rules of the game are consolidated and stabilized." Regarding Argentina's trade deficit with the United States, Granillo Ocampo said the situation was not dramatic, as the deficit is the result "of an important increase in imports in capital goods used in the incorporation of new technologies." "Argentina let a lot of time go by without investing in technology. The deficit ended up producing a very large hole, which condemned the country to suffer a loss of competitiveness and trade deficits," Granillo Ocampo said. The ambassador dismissed the possibility of creating a common front with Australia and the United States on agriculture subsidies, adding that "we are negotiating only because we must face a situation that hurts us all." Regarding the purchase of planes equipped with radar, the ambassador said the country "got the planes it was looking for." Asked about the possible sale of Pampa planes to the United States, Granillo Ocampo said: "Price conditions established in the offer will determine whether we can go ahead with the deal."
