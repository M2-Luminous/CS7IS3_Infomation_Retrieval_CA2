This Is the Purport of a Telegram Received in Sverdlovsk Oblast"] [Text] Yekaterinburg -- "In connection with numerous instances which have come to light concerning the conveyance of commercial freight in mail cars in most flagrant violation of the transport regulations, particularly when a highly flammable liquid is loaded into cars and the actual weight of the freight is understated -- which poses a threat to the life and health of passengers and train crews -- the Ministry of Railways orders that as of 15 March this year, it is forbidden to couple all mail cars to fast trains and passenger trains, except for local ones." If you consider that local trains are few and irregular today (once again on the initiative of the Ministry of Railways), it follows from this that thousands of subscribers to IZVESTIYA and other publications printed in Yekaterinburg will receive the newspaper two or three days later in Perm or Tyumen. But even in Sverdlovsk Oblast itself, which covers an area of thousands of kilometers, any newspaper will now arrive much later, for previously the whole system of newspaper delivery was geared not to the convenience of railroad workers but to the speed of delivery of the printed word. It is clear that nobody wants a "stale" newspaper.... In the opinion of specialists, the reference to concern for the health of passengers is clearly of a demagogic nature. This, incidentally, can be seen from the telegram itself. Everything here is simpler -- if a really commercial car is coupled instead of a mail car which is used as a commercial car, then the railroad will make a corresponding profit. It is clear that if corruption exists in society, for example, then it is necessary to combat corruption and not all of society. From the Editors Together with the report from own correspondent Aleksandr Pashkov we also received from Yekaterinburg a copy of the Railways Ministry telegram signed by Deputy Minister Salatov. It turns out that the ban on coupling mail cars to fast trains and passenger trains extends not only to Sverdlovsk Oblast but also to the entire area of the former USSR, including the Baltic countries! In order to understand what kind of a blow this is to readers of daily newspapers, let us report that IZVESTIYA, for example, is printed in 27 CIS cities, to which newspaper pages are sent by phototelegraph, are duplicated in regional printing plants, and are then sent on to other cities and villages -- frequently precisely by rail transport. If a newspaper is held up for two-five days on its way to the subscribers, this renders the journalists' work pointless. Reporters sometimes risk their lives to be the first to report events; every day, on the eve of signing an issue to press, the production group calculates the production schedule minute by minute -- all so that the finished product, in accordance with the will of the railroad chiefs, can be turned into unwanted bundles of waste paper! Alas, this is not the first time in recent years that newspapers, particularly daily ones, have fallen victim to the petty tyranny of officials. The press is not even mentioned in Mr. Salatov's order. But must the press and its millions of readers pay for the fact that mail car guards convey "freight which does not correspond to the carriage documents, including flammable and dangerously explosive freight"? Why are newspapers, which already pay the railroads punctually for delivering their goods, obliged to pay for the Railways Ministry's internal departmental innovations? If such a thing had happened some 10 years ago, the very next day the minister of railways would have received a severe reprimand in the CPSU Central Committee Agitation and Propaganda Department. What? -- the "voice of the party" might not be heard by the people! Times are different now, and the press "merely" helps to realize citizens' constitutional right to timely and objective information. But this function of the press seems an empty abstraction to the officials of various ranks who are accustomed just to severe reprimands and administrative rebukes. There is no serious counterweight to departmental tyranny in the government either, which is concerned with more "important" matters than the timely delivery of newspapers. There must, however, also be the matter of elementary respect for the millions of our fellow citizens who certainly do not live in capitals. What wrong have they done Mr. Salatov? Is there a body in our country which is capable of repealing the decision of the deputy minister of railways? If there is, when will this happen?
