Well-informed Interior Ministry sources disclosed that Fourth Army Region Commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya has told the Interior Ministry that "a third party" was responsible for the attack. However, the police and the southern authority have submitted preliminary reports to the Interior Ministry blaming southern separatist bandits. The sources said Lt-Gen Kitti, in his report to the Interior Ministry, said the bomb attack was not the work of members of Pattani United Liberation Organisation [PULO] but that of a "third hand" who wanted to create more problems for the government. However, Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre Director Wisut Singkhachonworakun and the police said PULO separatists were behind the attack. Mr Wisut said it has yet to be established which faction of the group was responsible for the attack on the railroad track in Chana District of Songkhla Province. Local officials have been instructed to gather information to find out if this faction is a new or old group of the PULO, he said. Mr Wisut said no promises had been made to the separatist bandits, as suggested by some news reports. It was reported that the group claimed in a letter left at the scene of the attack that the Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre had promised the bandits they would speed up the investigation into the torching of schools in the south last year. He said the centre would try to prevent a similar recurrence but admitted that the task would be difficult. Police Department deputy chief Phongamat Amattayakun said it was believed that the separatists might have received support from overseas. Pol Gen [Police General] Phongamat said local politicians should be able to help play a role in solving the problem of subversive activities in the south as they were familiar with local problems. "The incident (the bomb attack) is a political problem. The local politicians should know it well and should help solve it," Pol Gen Phongamat said. Meanwhile, Deputy Police Department Chief for Crime Suppression Phot Bunyachinda yesterday ordered security to be beefed up at public buildings and bus and train terminals after Tuesday's attack. In his order to the regional police headquarters in the south, policemen are to set up highway checkpoints and conduct random searches of vehicles of suspicious-looking people around the clock to prevent another attack. Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday ruled out speculation that the bomb attack at Songkhla was designed to discredit him. Gen Chawalit said the police have submitted a preliminary report but he would have to wait for a detailed investigation and analysis to determine if the attack was really conducted by the PULO, as stated in the letter placed at the blast site. Gen Chawalit said it was probably the work of certain movements that have been operating for 40-50 years already, which have begun using weapons. [passage omitted] Gen Chawalit said it is noticeable that the groups are beginning to come out of the woodwork. "The people should carefully watch their movements without being shaken about it." The Interior Minister said one should understand that the bomb blasts have occurred in many places and would continue to happen because there are many kinds of people in society, where there are different kinds of conflicts, both concerning personal issues and business.
