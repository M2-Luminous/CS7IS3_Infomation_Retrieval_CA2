FBIS4-13138 "drnes074_m_94011" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 JORDAN Papers Reject Israeli `Allegations' of Hamas Support Papers Reject Israeli `Allegations' of Hamas Support Remarks `Do Not Scare' Country JN1604095094 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 16 Apr 94 p 28 JN1604095094 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN ["Every Day" column by Tariq Masarwah: "Security Bankruptcy and the Failure of the Peace Game"] [Text] The Rabin-Peres warnings to Jordan declare the failure of Israeli policies in the occupied territory. Hamas is not in Amman, but in 'Afula, Hadera, Gaza, Hebron, and in every part of Palestine. Hamas communiques are faxed, in moments, from Jerusalem -- which they call the eternal capital of Israel -- to Amman, Damascus, and London. Jordan Television broadcast a very brief report, no more than a minute, about the Hadera explosion while the Israeli radio carried for one and a half hours a report about the explosion and the reactions to this explosion. These Israeli threats do not scare us; they are a declaration of the bankruptcy of the military and security occupation forces inside the occupied territory and an unconvincing quest for excuses, outside the occupied territory, to justify this failure. The occupation is an impasse for Rabin and Peres, not for Jordan. Violent resistance against occupation has exposed the game of peace, and turned the doves of the Labor Party -- who preach about the prosperity that will be achieved in the region once the Middle East market is established -- into hawks who make threats against others. Violent resistance has also who turned carriers of olive branches into pilots of lethal U.S. aircraft. They want the game to play in accordance with their own rules and, if it deviates from this course, war will be the alternative. We say these ridiculous Israeli threats will not scare us. We will put them in our political calculations together with the U.S. siege on al-'Aqabah. We know that the U.S. Embassy [in Amman] has been working, since the 'Afula incident, to mobilize public opinion against two youths who carry Hamas faxes to the Jordanian media just as Arab journalists in London carry Hamas faxes to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, AL- HAYAH, AL-QUDS AL-DUWALI, and AL-AHRAM AL-DUWALI. Hamas communiques reach us as they reach every part in the world. The Labor Party doves, who turned into hawks, and peace advocates who turned into warmongers, have reached a deadlock and the game of peace has deviated from its course and has been exposed. And Jordan is not responsible for this.
