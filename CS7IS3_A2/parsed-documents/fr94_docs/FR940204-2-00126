Example # 1: Buy group 1: Order 1_BUY 2000 XYZ + will pay 1¢/shr liquidity fee Buy group 2: Order 1_BUY 2000 XYZ Sell group 1: Order 1_SELL 2000 XYZ Because the order in Buy group 1 is willing to pay a liquidity fee, this order will have the highest priority and will match with the order in Sell group 1. It will not be necessary for the order in Buy group 1 to pay a liquidity fee in this case. b. Example # 2: Buy group 1: Order 1_BUY 2000 XYZ + will pay 1¢/shr liquidity fee Buy group 2: Order 1_BUY 2000 XYZ Sell group 1: Order 1_SELL 1000 XYZ Sell group 2: Order 1_SELL 2000 XYZ + wants a 1¢/shr liquidity credit Sell group 2: Order 2_SELL 2000 XYZ + wants a 1¢/shr liquidity credit Because the order in Buy group 1 is willing to pay a liquidity fee, this order will match first with the order in Sell group 1 (1000 shares), then with the orders in Sell group 2 (each of whom will receive 500). The order in Buy group 1 will pay no liquidity fee for the order in Sell group 1, but will pay 1¢/share for the orders in Sell group 2. Thus, the user will only pay an average liquidity fee of 1/2¢/share. Note: The order in Buy group 2 would not participate in the match as the only shares remaining to be matched require that a liquidity fee be paid. Orders willing to pay a liquidity fee will experience higher match rates than the other order types, with only an occasional payment of the liquidity fee. As in the above examples, because of the higher priority, a willingness to pay a higher liquidity fee will often result in a lower average liquidity fee paid or even no liquidity fee paid. Again, because of the priority rules, this system minimizes the liquidity fee rather than maximizing the shares matched. The CHX believes that this encourages users to enter liquidity fees and credits without fear of being disadvantaged by the system. These liquidity charges are exchange fees and credits and will be paid to the exchange for disbursal to those entitled to receive them. 4. Other Issues As discussed above, while entering stocks into his computer, a user can include a limit price. This feature allows a user to specify a maximum buy price or minimum sell price to protect the user against large swings in the price of a stock that may occur between the time he enters the trade into his computer and the cross. If a limit price is entered, the order will not participate in the match if the stock is above (or below) the limit price at the time of the cross, depending on whether the order is a buy order (or sell order). Of course, if the stock is within the limit range, the execution price will be the same as for all other stocks in the cross. In addition, as discussed above, users can enter linked orders. These are orders that are combined with other orders. For example, a user may only want to sell stock A if he can buy stock B. A user would then link his sell order of stock A to his buy order of stock B. Then, when the match occurs, the user's order to sell stock A will only be executed if the user's order to buy stock B is also executed. Otherwise, both orders will remain unmatched. The MMX facility, by allowing linked orders and allowing orders that specify a limit price, allows money managers greater cash management capabilities. The CHX believes that this in turn will cause the effective match rate of the MMX facility to be greater than other crossing systems. It should also be noted that a user can only prohibit a match with another particular user because of a concern that an ERISA violation might occur if a match took place. 5. Fees The Exchange will only charge a fee to users of the MMX Facility if their order is executed (or matched, in the case of securities that are not listed on the Exchange or have UTP). The Exchange fee will be as follows: Orders entered by MMX market makers and orders that are part of CHX's quote will not be charged a transaction fee; users who enter orders that the user is willing to display will be charged $.005 per share; and all other users will pay $.02 per share. There will be no fee to enter or cancel orders in the system. The Exchange fee does not cover liquidity fees and credits. The MMX market makers will be paid 1/8th of a cent per share when they do not participate in a cross in their issue so long as the liquidity parameter enter by the MMX market maker is within a pre-determined range. This 1/8 of a cent per share fee will be paid by the Exchange out of the 1/2 of a cent (or 2 cent) user fee that CHX will receive from users of the MMX facility. This will provide the MMX Market Maker with an incentive to providing a guarantee. In the event there is more than one MMX market maker in an issue, the 1/8 of a cent per share fee will be paid to the MMX market maker that enters the highest liquidity fee or lowest liquidity credit. If more than one MMX market maker enters the same fee or credit, such fee will be pro-rated. An additional Exchange fee will be imposed on all users equal to the liquidity fee to be paid with respect to a particular order, and an Exchange credit will occur that is equal to the liquidity credit to be received. The clearing broker will collect all fees from institutions and submit the appropriate amounts to Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC''). MCC, in turn, will pay the appropriate amounts to clearing brokers for forwarding to institutions.
