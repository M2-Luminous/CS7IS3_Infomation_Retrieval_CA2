In a few days' time, the small aircraft carrier will be off the coast of Mogadishu at the head of the naval task force responsible for protecting and supporting the withdrawal of the Italian troops from Somalia. "Operation Garibaldi," which was decided on by Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri, was planned under the supervision of Admiral Guido Venturoni, chief of defense staff. The navy had little choice whether or not to use the Garibaldi: The cruiser Vittorio Veneto, an aging flag ship, despite its glorious past, is too old a ship and has a smaller flight deck than the Giuseppe Garibaldi. The Garibaldi can carry AV-SB vertical-takeoff fighter aircraft (the American version of the British Sea Harrier), but the aircraft cannot be used in Somalia: None of the aircraft is operational yet. "However, we do not believe that aircraft are indispensable in the type of operation that we are preparing to carry out in Somalia," says a naval general staff source: "The protection and transport capability provided by the helicopters are sufficient guarantee of effective cover." The Garibaldi will be accompanied off Mogadishu by a frigate, the San Marco battalion's two amphibious ships, which will accommodate most of the army's bersaglieri [riflemen] returning to Italy, and a supply ship. Italy has also reached additional agreements with the government of Kenya guaranteeing access to the runways at Nairobi airport: The air force's C-130 and G-222 aircraft whose job it will be to bring the last soldiers in Somalia back to Italy will land in the Kenyan capital. The operation that is planned is a massive one, confirming the fears prevailing at the Italian Defense Ministry. Yesterday, Minister Fabbri confirmed, discreetly, that the intelligence services' information channels have been put into top gear. The information received indicates that the Somali irregular militias are preparing to fill the "vacuum" left by the Western blue berets as soon as the latter withdraw. Many sources expect fighting, and fighting requires weapons: If necessary, the Somalis will not hesitate to attack the military convoys as they withdraw.
