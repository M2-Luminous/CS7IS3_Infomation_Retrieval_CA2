Defense Minister Warns About Possible Catastrophe"] [Text] Yesterday the Ukrainian Supreme Council tasked the Council of Ministers with "stepping up efforts" to sign specific treaties on compensation for the nuclear weapons to be removed from Ukraine. As for Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it was decided to consider the question at a separate Supreme Council meeting. Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said that "Ukraine has considerably tarnished its image as an international partner by reneging on its promises." Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy sweetened the pill by saying that Ukraine is a powerful space state that will in time be capable of manufacturing delivery vehicles and weapons on its own. But later he said that the storage time of the combat nuclear blocs, where uncontrollable physical processes may begin, is drawing to an end and that "the Chernobyl catastrophe would pale beside what might happen." Mr. Kravchuk, on his part, said that he received a telegram from U.S. President Clinton on 3 February saying that the United States plans to double its aid for dismantling nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
