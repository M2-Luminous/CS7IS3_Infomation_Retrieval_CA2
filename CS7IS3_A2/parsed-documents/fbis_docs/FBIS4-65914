The main topic of discussion at the NATO summit, which opened in Evere this morning [24 May], was what form this cooperation should take. At the beginning of the year, NATO launched the so-called Partnership for Peace, a form of close military cooperation excluding NATO membership. A total of 16 former East bloc countries already have accepted the invitation. Russia wants to accept as well, but under certain conditions. [Begin recording] [Reporter Katelijne Hermans at the military airport at Melsbroek] Belgian Defense Minister Delcroix is waiting for his Russian counterpart. General Pavel Grachev will explain to NATO what Russia thinks about military cooperation, about the so-called Partnership for Peace. A total of 16 former East bloc countries already have accepted the invitation, but Russia is hesitating, demanding a special status of its own. Furthermore, it bothers the Russians that the Partnership for Peace concept originated with the Americans. So, Minister Grachev will present to NATO a Russian document on military cooperation. The two documents, the Russian and the Western, will have to be discussed and signed together. [Grachev, in Russian, with Dutch subtitles] We will sign the document on the Partnership for Peace, but we first want to explain our vision of military cooperation. A representative of President Yelstin will sign the two texts in Brussels, the Partnership for Peace and our document on cooperation between Russia and NATO. [Hermans] But NATO sees this slightly differently, and feels that Russia, like every other country, must sign the normal Partnership treaty. Apart from that, a special political dialogue can be held. [Delcroix] I believe that every sensible person agrees that Russia cannot be compared to other countries. Russia has a separate tradition, a separate position, and a separate political and military force. We have to take this into account. I believe that we in NATO must begin the dialogue with Russia, also and perhaps especially outside the Partnership for Peace framework. [end recording]
