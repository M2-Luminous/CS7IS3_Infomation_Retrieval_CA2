FBIS4-310 "drafr068_d_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-068 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Envoy on Postponement of Security Council Meeting Envoy on Postponement of Security Council Meeting MB0704064494 Luanda Radio Nacional Network in Portuguese 1900 GMT 6 Apr 94 MB0704064494 Luanda Radio Nacional Network Portuguese BFN [Text] The UN Security Council meeting on Angola will no longer be held tomorrow. The UN Security Council requires more information concerning the Lusaka peace talks, and this information will only reach New York after UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, have met in Geneva. Radio Angola reporter Andeiro Joao has just interviewed Angolan Ambassador to the UN Afonso van Dunem Mbinda. [Begin recording] [Joao] Good evening, Ambassador Mbinda. So we should see the UN Security Council hold its meeting on Angola in New York tomorrow? [Mbinda] I can tell you that no date date has been set yet for a meeting of the UN Security Council. Informal consultations will probably only begin tomorrow and it is quite likely that a formal meeting of the UN Security Council will only occur next week. That means that this meeting of the UN Security Council has suffered a considerable delay. [Joao] What reasons could be at the root of this latest postponement of the UN Security Council's meeting on Angola? [Mbinda] I do not know the reasons, but I think that the UN Security Council would like to receive a report on the meeting which the UN secretary general and UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye are scheduled to hold in Geneva today or tomorrow. Moreover, the UN Security Council is waiting to receive more information so that it can have as much information as possible on the talks being held in the Zambian capital. Those are the only reasons for the UN Security Council meeting being delayed so many times. [Joao] Ambassador Mbinda: If this UN Security Council meeting does go ahead, what decisions would the Angolan Government like to see made? [Mbinda] Well, our government hopes that the UN Security Council will make a realistic analysis of the situation on the ground and of the Lusaka peace talks, and that it will take whatever measures are necessary. [Joao] Mr. Ambassador: When you talk about necessary measures, are you referring to a possible new package of sanctions against UNITA? [Mbinda] I do not believe that the UN Security Council will take such measures. I do not believe that it will introduce a second package of sanctions at this juncture. That is because conditions are not in place for that to be done. The fact that the Lusaka peace talks are continuing, that they have not collapsed despite all the problems, all that makes us believe that present conditions do not justify drastic measures against UNITA by the UN Security Council. In view of that, I think that when it holds its upcoming formal meeting the UN Security Council will be asking UNITA to adopt a more realistic approach. The fact is that UNITA has been given an opportunity. Our government offered a number of ministerial portfolios and afforded UNITA the possibility of wider participation in government. So, the UN Security Council is waiting for UNITA to come up with an answer as rapidly as possible. [end recording]
