He said that FSLN leaders must communicate more with the voters and bear in mind that they represent a party "which rejects all methods of violence...." Turning to the current crisis, Ramirez said that the government's greatest weakness in its economic policy is "ignoring the massive problems of the population" and "overemphasizing the dictates of the international financial organizations." Stating that he is against neoliberal policies, Ramirez also said that he has no intention of seeking the position of FSLN secretary general. In response to a question about the social-democratic nature of the FSLN, Ramirez explained that while the FSLN is a member of the Socialist International, there is a current within the Front which represents "the democratic left."
