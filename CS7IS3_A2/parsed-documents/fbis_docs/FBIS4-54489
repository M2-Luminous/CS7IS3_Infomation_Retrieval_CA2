Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Bekic reports on the situation in the town and says that "the chetniks have withdrawn outside the 3-km exclusion zone on the left bank of the Drina River, but on the right bank, they are still on the positions that they occupied before the arrival of the UN Protection Forces. It is true that they are quiet and there is no sniper and antiaircraft activity in the town and surrounding villages. However, there is large-scale looting. They [Serbs] are systematically taking everything from the villages of (?Bubijer) and Fazlagici, and there is sporadic torching of property. The chetniks on the northwestern part of the front used artillery to target civilian targets in Brdarici, [name indistinct], and (?Unje). Moreover, they attempted an infantry breakthrough in the region on Brdarici." Mirudin Aldobasic, correspondent from the 7-South Operative Group Information Service, reports that "a large concentration of tanks and other armored hardware has been sighted in the areas of Putnikovo Brdo, Plane, and Usce, and artillery on the northern and western parts of the front, particularly in the wider areas of Kriz, Kalosevic, and the Tesanj-Teslic demarcation lines. The aggressor is also carrying out large-scale regrouping on the western slopes of Mt. Ozren and is directing the massive equipment toward (?Sevadlije), Jagotic Polje, Srbuk, and Maglaj. Overnight and early this morning, the Serbian terrorists have been perpetrating constant small arms' provocations. Snipers are also active on most of the front."
