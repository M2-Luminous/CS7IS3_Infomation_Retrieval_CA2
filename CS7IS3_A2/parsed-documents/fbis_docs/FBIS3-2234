The law, passed at a National People's Congress standing committee session Saturday [5 March], warns that "snake heads," or criminals who are behind illegal immigration rackets, will face jail terms of between seven years and life for their involvement in illegal emigration schemes, the report said. Those guilty of the murder, injury, rape or sale of illegal emigrants or of the murder or injury of border inspectors may be sentenced to death, the new law states. Previously, the maximum penalty for organising illegal emigration was five years imprisonment, but a surge last year in the numbers of Chinese paying snake heads up to 30,000 dollars to be smuggled abroad on decrepit ships has forced the authorities to stiffen punishment. In the most spectacular case, six illegal immigrants died when almost 300 of them tried to swim and wade ashore after their ship, the Golden Venture, ran aground in New York City in June.
