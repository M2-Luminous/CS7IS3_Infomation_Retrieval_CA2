Five tax incentives including ones for information management, investments in Japan, and energy and two reserve fund systems were established. In addition, the current corporate restoration system for businesses in the red that was suspended will be revived. In the long-term depressed domestic economy, these tax incentives are established to stimulate the recovery of equipment investment. At the same time, recovery funds for businesses which continue to be in the red are earmarked as sources of revenue for restructuring. The new tax systems established by MITI are the High-Level Information Management Tax Incentive, the Corporate Investment in Japan for Opening the Market Tax Incentive, the Senior Citizen and Disabled Persons Participation in Society Tax Incentive, the International Joint Research Tax Incentive, the Investment for Strengthening the Energy Supply and Demand Tax Incentive, the Reserve System for Investments in Establishing Small and Mid-Sized Enterprises, and the Thermal Exchange Reserve Fund System. The content of the new tax system settled on so far includes a tax deduction of 7% for purchasing (including leasing) equipment or a 30% special refund system for improved information management. There is a tax deduction for users of system integration (SI) contracts. Investments to open the Japanese market are limited to 10 years following establishment. When sales in Japan exceed 2% of the highest previous total, the increase is limited to 5%. In addition, the amount of one half of the rate of increase multiplied by total increase is a tax deduction. The Senior Citizen and Disabled Persons Participation in Society Tax Incentive sets up a 3% special refund system for the introduction of support equipment. A 6% tax deduction of research costs is provided in the International Joint Research Tax Incentive. The Investment for Strengthening the Energy Supply and Demand Tax Incentive promotes advances in energy conservation, renewable energy, and thermal-electric cogeneration, as well as providing for the stable supply of oil and natural gas. A 7% tax deduction of the total acquisition costs and a special refund of 30% for the first year have been approved. In order to support the establishment of small and mid-sized businesses by investment, lending, and start-up companies, in the investment losses in establishing small and mid-sized enterprises based on the new reserve system, up to 20% of the capital invested annually will not be taxed and a reserve fund will be accumulated. Depreciation is applied when losses in investments occur during the establishment of a business. The remaining depreciation is introduced as profit after five years. The Thermal Exchange Reserve Fund System is diredcted at gas companies in small and medium-sized cities (240 companies). The system allows the expenses required to convert to high-calorie gas to be accumulated over a five-year period as a reserve fund and for loss inclusion.
