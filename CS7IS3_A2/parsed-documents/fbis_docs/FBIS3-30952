We have just received the declarations made by President Tudjman and the French foreign minister. [passage omitted] [Juppe] Ladies and gentlemen, given the time, I shall be brief. I would like first of all to thank President Tudjman for having received me at such short notice, as I only decided to make this trip yesterday. My delegation and I are grateful for the welcome we have received. I came to tell President Tudjman to what extent the gravity of the situation was of concern to France. As you know, France, with its American and European allies, initiated the decision taken yesterday by the North Atlantic Council, demanding the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and the placement of the heavy weaponry under the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. If these demands are not met within 10 days, the decision makes provision for the use of force. We are totally determined to implement this decision. In the 10 days before the expiry of the ultimatum we would like to remind everyone that a European-sponsored peace plan remains on the table. This proposal, I repeat, is still valid. It can, I may add, be adapted in the course of negotiations, and I call on all parties concerned to allow reason to prevail in order to prevent an escalation. I hope that Croatia can join in this search for a peaceful solution. [Tudjman] For my part, I told Mr. Juppe that Croatia welcomes the current EU [European Union] and NATO decisions, adopted with the approval of the EU and the United States, to undertake resolute steps not only to bring the suffering of Sarajevo to an end but also to exert pressure on all sides to achieve peace. Croatia has also welcomed and done everything to implement the Juppe-Kinkel plan of action, which later became the EU plan. Croatia welcomes the new plan and will do everything it can to prevent further bloodshed and, as Mr. Juppe said, get all sides to accept the peace plan, which can also be modified, to end the war and provide conditions for stability and the establishment of the new international order in this part of Europe. We highly appreciate the efforts of the French Government as well as this act by Minister Juppe, who came to the dark Balkans at this late hour.
