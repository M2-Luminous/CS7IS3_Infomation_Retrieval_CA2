FR940810-1-00037 FR940810-1-00007 In paragraph (f) the Secretary proposes to specify the procedures for, and content of, the decision on appeal. Judicial review could not be sought until this decision was issued. Paragraph (g) would contain the substantive and procedural requirements for compliance with any order of the Secretary issued under this section. Executive Order 12866 1. Assessment of costs and benefits These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this proposed regulatory action. The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading of Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. 2. Clarity of the regulations Executive order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. The Secretary invites comments on how to make these regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol ``ยง'' and a numbered heading; for example, ยง682.410 Fiscal, administrative, and enforcement requirements.) (4) Is the description of the proposed regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful in the understanding of the proposed regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the proposed regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? A copy of any comments that concern whether these proposed regulations are easy to understand should also be sent to Stanley Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., (Room 5125 FOB&hyph;6), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these regulations are small organizations that contract with guaranty agencies to administer aspects of the agencies' participation in the FFEL programs. However, the regulations would not have a significant impact on these small entities, because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Sections 682.410 and 682.417 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Secretary will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. Guaranty agencies receive payments from the Secretary and others for exclusive use in the FFEL programs, and the accumulated surplus of those payments over permissible expenditures are Federal property, to be returned to the Secretary upon the agency's termination or under certain other circumstances. The Secretary needs and uses the information to enable him to determine whether the guaranty agencies comply with the requirements for safeguarding this Federal property and the limitations on its use. Annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden contained in the collection of information proposed in these regulations is estimated to be 90 hours, including the time for searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, completing and reviewing the collection information, and submitting materials. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should submit them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 10235, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok.
