All those talks are already producing results on the ground. Croatian forces are no longer participating in battles around Maglaj and conflicts in central Bosnia and Mostar have stopped. That is the most important thing. On the ground, with the help of one team made up of Americans and other allies, forces must be disengaged and the structure of a new Bosnia-Herzegovina army must be created. That means we would have a defense alliance with Croatia regarding military matters. As far as other things are concerned, if God lets us -- all of us living in these parts -- come to our senses and establish some sort of peace, then such an alliance opens up tremendous possibilities, especially as everyone is more willing to invest in peace than in war. [Puljic] Does this agreement foresee a presidential or a parliamentary system? [Silajdzic] It will be a combination of parliamentary and presidential systems. Regardless of what it will be, I hope it will become effective and that it will lead us into either a presidential or a parliamentary system. It does not matter what it is, as long as it exists. We will try to consider the possibility of agreement with the Serbian side. Then we have much to do to prepare and draft the constitution of the federation and the confederate agreement with Croatia. After we have agreed on the text of the constitution and of the agreement on confederation, President Izetbegovic and President Tudjman are expected to sign a confederate agreement here in Washington. [Puljic] The United States has evidently demonstrated the initiative and this could have a very beneficial effect on Bosnia- Herzegovina. [Silajdzic] It is not a coincidence that all this happened in the United States and I think Washington is the right place for something like that. The seed we planted two years ago is slowly shooting. I have always believed Bosnia is a global issue and that it can only be solved as such. That is possible only if all world factors become involved, and the United States is the number-one world factor. You see that there are already some results. Our contacts with the United States are on the highest level. That is very important, for, in a way, it brings balance to those relations. Naturally, when we say world factors, we mean others as well. The Russian Federation is one of those factors and that is why we will intensify contacts directly through the United States in order to reach a final solution. I am supposed to go to Moscow and meet with Kosyrev and other leading Russian politicians. The Russians are an important factor in this process. In Moscow, we will discuss the possibility of making an agreement with the Serbian side. Furthermore, I talked to Mr. Juppe, French foreign minister, and we understood France would continue to be positively involved in solving the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mr. Juppe said he would like to meet with me in Paris and I hope we will hold that meeting. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the ground, it is now most important that the United States and other allies help us. They will probably send a good team headed by one of the U.S. generals, regarding the disengagement of forces and the agreement, first on separation and then also on forming a military structure in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Puljic] Is a new world order being created, and to what extent is Bosnia-Herzegovina a part of global events? [Silajdzic] Those who doubted the fact that Bosnia-Herzegovina is involved in creating a new world order now realize they were wrong. That was our thesis from the very beginning. Bosnia- Herzegovina is a small country, but it plays an important role in international relations and this engagement of the United States and the allies, even Russia, proves that. You know, regardless of the world order we have, it must be founded on some kind of principles and on respecting the order. Genocide in the heart of Europe, aggression, the destruction of towns.... That is not a world order, that is a disorder that will sooner or later lead to war, not only in that region, but also in Europe and the world. The new order must be founded on the principle of rights and not on the principle of force. If it is not so, we will not have any kind of order or world order, but world disorder. That is the whole matter. In Bosnia, we had to prove there is order and that the order, if disrupted, is being established -- by force. That is very important. And that is why this is an opportunity not only for the Bosniaks and the Croats, not only for Bosnia and Croatia, but also for the Serbian side to realize that people must live together in the world. That people must talk at a negotiating table and not solve problems using guns. This is an opportunity for everybody to be included in the peace process. This process includes the Bosniaks and the Croats and does not leave anybody out. [Puljic] In case those "others" do not get involved, what will happen? [Silajdzic] I hope there will be negotiations, not war. [Puljic] In conclusion, let me ask you whether the United States intends to continue to firmly lead the initiative for solving the Bosnian problem? [Silajdzic] They definitely intend to do that. Many factors decide on that and we are one of those factors. As I said, we have been working on involving the United States in this historic battle for the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina for two years. According to statements by their leaders, the Americans will keep supporting Bosnia-Herzegovina. We hope they will keep us in the family of democratic countries and nations, that we will finally have a free country. There are many victims and, unfortunately, we cannot bring back the dead, but I hope those people did not die in vain.
