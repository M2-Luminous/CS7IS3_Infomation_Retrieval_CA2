FBIS4-7250 "dreas082_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea Papers on ROK-Japanese Defense Ministers Talks Papers on ROK-Japanese Defense Ministers Talks SK2804062494 SK2804062494 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 April on ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to Japan and on talks between the ROK and Japanese defense ministers now under way in Japan. The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word article by senior Tokyo-based correspondent Pae In-chun from the "Reporter's Eye" column entitled "Defense Minister Yi's Consciousness of 'ROK- Japan Military Exchanges.'" The article reports that after holding talks with his Japanese counterpart Kazuo Aichi, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said that the ROK will push ahead with military exchanges with Japan in a "quiet yet substantive" manner in view of "special relations" between the ROK and Japan in the past and of the "unnecessary irritation" of North Korea. Commenting on the possibility of Japan becoming a big military power, Defense Minister Yi said that Japan seems to be keenly aware of "concerns" by neighboring countries and the ROK's position is to "carefully watch" Japan's moves. Asked if Japan would regard a "reunified Korea" as the enemy, Minister Yi notes that the concept of the enemy would "change" according to the change in the situation. Observing that the ROK and Japanese defense authorities are striving to begin military exchanges between the ROK and Japan on the premise of North Korea's "threat," the article points out that Japan is emphasizing the North Korean "threat" more than the ROK. TONG-A ILBO also publishes on page 5 a 1,300-word article by Ha Chun-u under the headline: "Significance and Prospect of ROK-Japan Defense Ministers' Talks." Noting that ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to Japan, the first of its kind in history, will be an occasion for activating ROK-Japan military exchanges, the article reports official talks between defense ministers of the two countries themselves mean the "official declaration" of military exchanges. The article notes that the ROK and Japan maintained a "military balance and stability" in Northeast Asia based on their respective military alliance with the United States, and held positions to deter military threats by the communist bloc. Nevertheless, the article notes, ROK-Japan military exchanges have been greatly restricted owing to the past colonial rule. Prompted by the collapse of the communist bloc, the two nations came to have a common understanding that their military exchanges should no longer be put aside. The article points out that during his visit to Japan, Defense Minister Yi discussed ways to seek "common interests" in military and security domains, and that the two sides reached an agreement even on "operational" matters, including rotating training of naval academy cadets, mutual visits of military ships, and prevention of accidental crashes of military aircraft. The article, however, predicts that although military exchanges between the two countries will be gradually expanded with Minister Yi's visit to Japan, such exchanges will likely remain "relaxed cooperative relations" for a considerable period of time, because formulation of military relations by concluding a military treaty or a peace treaty may touch off "dispute" over confirmation of territories and may not be appropriate in view of the flexible situation in Northeast Asia. Thus, the article concludes, drastic progress in military exchanges, including joint military exercises, will not be "likely" for the time being. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word editorial under the headline "Conditions of ROK-Japanese Military Ties." Describing the agreement to expand military exchanges and cooperation between the ROK and Japan as "significant," the editorial expresses the hope that the security ties between the two countries will contribute not only to "stability" on the Korean peninsula but also to "global peace." Recalling that our national sentiment hindered expansion of ROK-Japan military exchanges in the past, the editorial stresses that "regional security" has now emerged as a "mutual, common task" and that with independent strength of a nation, security cannot be guaranteed. Pointing to the ROK's effort to "diversify" its military friendly relations with China, Russia, and Germany, the editorial describes ROK-Japanese military exchanges as "desirable." The editorial, however, expresses "concern" over the possibility of Japan becoming a big military power, and stresses that cooperation between the two countries is necessary only on the premise that Japan will not become a big military power, and that military cooperation should start from the work of broadening "mutual trust and understanding."
