They accused him of appointing himself policeman, prosecutor, and judge at the same time. Al-Iryani said that the YSP and its cadres have been exposed to nine attempts only, and that the suspects are in jail. But the sources stress that the incidents exceed 152. Elsewhere, YSP Information Center sources in Aden have said that YSP representatives on the military committee continue to insist on the party's position urging that the Armed Forces withdraw from the seven governorates (Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah, Ma'rib, Ta'izz, Ibb, and al-Bayda') and that all military units be moved out of these governorates, saying that there is no justification for a military presence in these areas, known in the past as the fringes between the two parts of Yemen, except in the areas which represent protection for the Republic of Yemen. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the sources denied that the YSP had demanded the withdrawal of what used to be known as the southern and northern forces to their positions before unity, contrary to what has been reported by some circles in the General People's Congress. The YSP demanded that all armed forces, wherever they are, be treated equally in terms of food, clothes, and other necessities. [passage omitted]
