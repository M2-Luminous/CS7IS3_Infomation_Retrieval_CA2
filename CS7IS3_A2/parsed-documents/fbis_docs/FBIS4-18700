He urged Ankara to persuade TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas to agree to resolve the Cyprus problem. The letter, dated 31 March, held Turkey and Denktas responsible for the lack of movement toward a solution in Cyprus. Christopher recalled the guarantee the Ciller government gave to the United States some time ago to the effect that it will do everything it can to contribute toward the effort being made to find a solution to the Cyprus problem and said that until now Ankara has failed to make any move in accordance with that guarantee. Stressing that the absence of a solution in Cyprus was largely due to Rauf Denktas' negative approach, Christopher said: "Had Turkey used its influence on Denktas in the right way, the existing negative conditions would not have been created in Cyprus." Christopher also informed Cetin that the UN secretary general moved to prepare a strong UN Security Council resolution against the Turkish Cypriot side when it became apparent that the talks were heading toward a deadlock. Ciller Must Fulfill Her Promise The date of Warren Christopher's stern letter led to interesting comments in Washington. The U.S. Administration is aware of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's wish to hold talks with President Clinton in Washington when she visits the United States on 13 April. In view of that, Warren Christopher's letter can be regarded as a high-level reminder to Ankara by the U.S. Administration that "Ciller is expected to take a step on Cyprus before she embarks on her visit to the United States." The United States Expects a Concrete Step The reason for the pressure the U.S. Administration has directed against Turkey on the Cyprus problem is the guarantee Tansu Ciller gave to President Clinton when she visited the White House some time ago to the effect that "Turkey will take the necessary steps to have that problem resolved as soon as possible." Ciller gave that guarantee both in the talks she had with President Clinton in camera and in the joint news conference she held with him later. In view of that, the U.S. Administration expected the Ciller government to take concrete steps to contribute toward the effort being made to find a solution to the problem between the two communities in Cyprus. Naturally, the term concrete step is a reference to the pressure Washington expects Turkey to direct on Denktas to force him to change his approach, which the United States believes is "irreconcilable." Meanwhile, it is common knowledge that President Clinton has clashed with the influential Greek lobby in the United States on matters related to The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In view of that, he attaches significant importance to an opportunity to satisfy the Greeks and Greek Cypriots by paving the way for the solution of the Cyprus problem.
