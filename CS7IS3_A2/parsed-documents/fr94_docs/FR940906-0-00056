FR940906-0-00056 FR940906-0-00019 Comment 31. Actual prices paid to fishermen are recorded on fish tickets and these prices should be used to calculate fee assessments, rather than the proposed method of using standard exvessel prices. If standard exvessel prices are used, NMFS should implement a separate rebate program to reimburse fishermen who were ultimately charged more than 2 percent of the exvessel value in those cases where the standard exvessel price is less than the actual price they received. Response. See the response to Comments 26 and 27. Comment 32. Fee assessments should not be assessed on deadloss crab. Response. Fee assessments will be based on the amount of crab retained by a processor. Crab that is harvested alive but dies enroute to the processor is considered deadloss and is not purchased by the processor or buyer. This crab, therefore, will not be considered retained catch for the purpose of calculating fee assessments. Comment 33. Under the proposed rule, retained catch for processor vessels would be determined by using standard product recovery rates (PRRs) to calculate round-weight equivalents. Retained catch can be calculated most accurately by actual weights, rather than by using a derivative system. Recognizing that not all processor vessels are equipped with scales, a system should be implemented under which a processor could elect to have retained catch calculated by any recognized acceptable means, such as actual weight, volumetric measure, or standard PRRs. Response. NMFS has prepared a draft analysis for Council consideration that evaluates different alternatives for obtaining accurate catch weight measurements. The Council is scheduled to take final action on a preferred alternative before the end of 1994. Until regulations are implemented that serve as consistent guidelines for obtaining accurate measurements of catch weight, NMFS will continue to rely on PRRs to calculate round-weight equivalents. Comment 34. NMFS has reported that a 10&hyph;20 percent discrepancy exists between observed retained catch estimates and retained catch amounts reported by processor vessels in their weekly production reports. Currently, an easy and precise method to verify the accuracy of reported catch amounts is not available. Given that the projection of groundfish exvessel value was based on projected catch using a blend of observer and vessel data, concern exists that this projection overestimates the fees that will be collected during the start-up year by 10 percent or more. If this is the case, full implementation of the Research Plan may be unnecessarily delayed. A better alternative is to calculate the fee based on retained weight, but incorporate the ``blend'' method to decrease the problem of under-reporting. Response. Retained catch amounts used to project exvessel value of groundfish for purposes of the Research Plan were based on data submitted by the industry on weekly production reports and ADF&G fish tickets. These data, not blend data, were used to project exvessel value of retained catch and provide the best information available on which to base projected revenues under the Research Plan. Comment 35. The use of PRRs to calculate round weight of retained catch is problematic for several reasons. First, a sizeable disparity exists within the industry regarding the PRRs of various products. Second, the current rates being used by NMFS are not necessarily based on scientific or statistically defensible data. If PRRs must be used, they must be based on the best available scientific evidence. Response. NMFS has determined that the standard PRRs that it will use to calculate round-weight equivalents of retained catch by at-sea processors represent the best available scientific information about product recoveries being achieved by the processing industry. NMFS has invited public comment on the standard PRRs it will use and will soon publish them in a final rule. NMFS will continue to review information about product recoveries and will propose regulations to revise any particular standard PRR, if necessary. See also the Response to comment 33. Comment 36. Under the proposed Research Plan, vessels are charged a fee based on the round-weight of retained fish. As a result, a large incentive will exist to not make products such as fish meal or process small fish or male flatfish, which may be perfectly fit for human consumption but have a lower market value. A better method would be for each vessel to pay for what it catches, whether or not the fish are retained for processing. If vessels were assessed a fee based on the weight of fish caught, there would be an economic incentive to reduce bycatch and other fish waste, as well as an incentive to collect and report the best possible data. Response. NMFS has revised the final rule to exempt from bimonthly fee assessments the exvessel value of whole fish that are processed into meal. This action is intended to address concerns that the imposition of Research Plan fees on the exvessel value of retained catch may create an incentive for processors to discard low value fish that otherwise may have been retained. Section 313 of the Magnuson Act authorizes the assessment of fees on both retained and discarded catch. Given this authority and the Council's desire to encourage retention of catch under the Research Plan, the Council has asked the OOC to explore options for assessing fees on discarded catch. Any future recommendation by the Council to implement a fee assessment program for discarded catch will require rulemaking and likely would not be implemented before 1996. Comment 37. Insurance coverage requirements should be established for observers. Response. At its June 1994 meeting, the Council indicated that it will appoint a technical committee to address the issue of standard insurance coverage for observers. Comment 38. The concept of a risk-sharing pool for observer insurance is not acceptable because the pool concept undermines the competitive process for insurance.
