FR941110-1-00023 FR941110-1-00006 Test Methods and Laboratory Review EPA's sampling procedures are detailed in Appendix D of 40 Code of Federal Regulation part 80. EPA has recommended, in its credit program guidelines, that states adopt these sampling procedures. New Jersey has adopted EPA sampling procedures, which include established federal testing procedures and tolerances. Labeling EPA requires the labeling of gasoline pumps and has strongly recommended that states adopt their own labeling regulations, consistent with the federal regulation. New Jersey has adopted labeling regulations consistent with the federal regulation. EPA's review of subchapter 25 and supporting materials indicates that New Jersey has adopted an oxygenated gasoline regulation that meets the requirements of the Act. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve New Jersey's Subchapter 25 oxygenated fuels program. Vehicle Miles Travelled Forecast Section 187(a)(2)(A) of the Act requires moderate carbon monoxide nonattainment areas, such as that portion of New Jersey included in the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island nonattainment area, to submit a SIP revision that forecasts vehicle miles travelled (VMT) through the year 1995. In addition, annual reports and annual updates are required by the state, the first of these is required by September 30, 1994. The VMT forecast must meet two requirements. First, it must estimate the VMT from 1990 through 1995 using a method acceptable to EPA, and must be conducted in the appropriate geographic area. Second, there must be proper coordination between the state agencies involved in developing the VMT forecast. Contingency measures are to be implemented in a case where the actual annual VMT or the updated forecast exceeds the most recent prior VMT forecast by 5.0 percent in 1994, 4.0 percent in 1995, and 3.0 percent thereafter. In addition, if these annual exceedances are less than these maximum percentages but cumulatively exceed 5 percent, then contingency measures are also triggered. The estimated VMT for 1990 and 1991 are 94.9 and 97.4 million miles per day, respectively. In addition, the future forecasts are (in million miles per day) 99.8 for 1992, 102.2 for 1993, 104.6 for 1994, and 107.1 for 1995. EPA proposes to find that New Jersey has submitted documentation satisfying these requirements, and therefore proposes approval of its VMT forecast SIP revision. Contingency Measures Section 187(a)(3) of the Act requires that states adopt contingency measures to take effect without further action by the Administrator or the state if the state fails to attain the NAAQS by the required date or if the VMT forecast is exceeded beyond the allowable limit as discussed in the VMT forecast section. New Jersey submitted three contingency measures, the Employee Commute Option (ECO) program, an enhanced inspection and maintenance program (benefit from emission reductions outside of the carbon monoxide nonattainment area), and Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) to fulfill this requirement. The ECO program will act as a contingency measure for failure to attain the carbon monoxide standard while the state-wide enhanced inspection and maintenance program and the TCMs will be used as measures for exceeding the VMT forecast.
