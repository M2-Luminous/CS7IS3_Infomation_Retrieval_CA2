FR940603-1-00019 FR940603-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 671, 672, 675, and 676 [Docket No. 940556&hyph;4156; I.D. 050494B] RIN 0648&hyph;AE62 Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would implement a moratorium for a temporary period on the entry of new vessels into the groundfish, crab, and halibut fisheries contained in proposed Amendment 23 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI), proposed Amendment 28 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), proposed Amendment 4 to the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area, and a proposed regulatory amendment affecting the Pacific halibut fishery in the waters in and off of Alaska. The moratorium is designed as a temporary measure that is necessary to curtail increases in fishing capacity and provide industry stability while the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) prepare, review, and, if approved, implement a comprehensive management plan for these fisheries. This action is intended to promote the objectives of the Council to promote conservation and management of groundfish, crab, and halibut resources, and to further the objectives of the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act) and the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). DATES: Comments must be received at the following address by July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments must be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, 709 West 9th Street, Juneau, AK 99801, or P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802, Attention: Lori J. Gravel. Copies of proposed Amendments 23 and 28 to the BSAI and GOA groundfish FMPs, Amendment 4 to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area king and Tanner crab FMP, and the Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (EA/RIR/IRFA) for the moratorium may be obtained from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David C. Ham, Fishery Management Biologist, Alaska Region, NMFS at 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI are managed by the Secretary under the GOA and BSAI FMPs. The commercial harvest of king and Tanner crabs is managed under the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area. These FMPs were prepared by the Council under the Magnuson Act. The FMP for the GOA groundfish fisheries is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR parts 672 and 676, and the FMP for the BSAI groundfish fisheries is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR parts 675 and 676. The FMP for the king and Tanner crab fisheries in the BSAI is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 671 and by Alaska Administrative Code regulations at title 5, chapters 34 and 35. For crab, BSAI means the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area as defined at ยง671.2, and is a slightly different area than the BSAI management area as defined for groundfish at ยง675.2. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. groundfish and crab fisheries are set out at 50 CFR part 620. The Council does not have a FMP for halibut. The domestic fishery for halibut in and off of Alaska is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention), signed at Washington, DC, March 29, 1979, and the Halibut Act. The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the respective Regional Fishery Management Councils established by the Magnuson Act to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in conflict with, regulations adopted by the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council may develop for approval by the Secretary limited access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery in Convention waters in and off of Alaska. ``Convention waters'' means the maritime areas off the west coast of the United States and Canada as described in Article I of the Convention (see 16 U.S.C. 773(d)). The Council acted under this authority in recommending its proposed moratorium for the halibut fishery. Regulations governing the harvesting of Pacific halibut are set out at 50 CFR parts 301 and 676. In 1987, amid growing indications of excess harvesting capacity in the North Pacific groundfish fisheries, the Council adopted a ``statement of commitment'' to pursue alternative management measures that would achieve optimum yield through more rational fishing effort than exists with the current open access system. The Council identified ways to fulfill this commitment that included the development of an alternative management strategy for groundfish fisheries and the consideration of effort management in the crab and halibut fisheries. Fishery management planning work continued in 1987 with the formation of the Future of Groundfish (FOG) Committee. The FOG Committee undertook a comprehensive examination of the groundfish, crab, and halibut fisheries off of Alaska. It concluded that problems of excess harvesting capacity and allocation conflicts would worsen under a continued open access system. The committee recommended a limited access management approach for these three fisheries. In 1989 and 1990, the Council considered methods for implementing a moratorium that would limit access of new vessels into the groundfish, crab, and halibut fisheries. At its meeting in August 1990, the Council recommended that NMFS publish a notice in the Federal Register to: a. Inform the public of the Council's intention to develop measures to limit access; and b. announce a control date after which owners of vessels that had not previously participated would not be assured future access to these fisheries if a limited access system were implemented using that control date. The control date notice was published on September 5, 1990 (55 FR 36302), corrected on September 13, 1990 (55 FR 37729), and announced September 15, 1990, as the control date.
