This development of events harms prospects for normalizing the situation in that country," says a joint statement on Afghanistan, which was issued here on 8 February by the foreign ministers of Russia and Uzbekistan. The two countries' foreign ministries, the statement says, "call for an end to the fratricidal war in Afghanistan and urge all Afghan military-political forces to abandon their reliance on force and to embark on a joint search for political compromises, for the sake of national consolidation and reconciliation." The statement stresses: "The sides consider that the conflict in Afghanistan, which is a result of internal contradictions in that country, threatens security and stability in the region. They are seriously concerned at the increased tension on the southern borders of the CIS. The foreign ministers of Russia and Uzbekistan support the integrity of the Afghan state and the inviolability of its borders. They are convinced that a settlement of the existing contradictions and a decision on Afghanistan's future development is a matter, first and foremost, for Afghans themselves. The sides intend to continue maintaining strict neutrality and abiding by the principle of noninterference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Russia and Uzbekistan are willing to do their utmost to facilitate the achievement of these objectives within the framework of general international efforts, cooperating with the United Nations and all interested states. In this connection, the ministers stressed the timeliness of the initiatives that the Uzbek president presented at the 48th session of the UN General Assembly concerning a settlement of regional conflicts in Central Asia, including the Afghan problem. They emphasized their readiness to take part in their joint implementation. The sides confirm their readiness to develop goodneighborly relations and comprehensive, mutually advantageous cooperation with a peaceful, independent, and sovereign Afghanistan in the interests of mutual understanding and confidence in the region."
