Briviba: "Demographic Situation of Ethnic Latvians Detailed"] [Text] The Latvian nation experienced a very heavy shock in the sixteenth and seventeenth century when war and the Black plague ravaged the land. The Kurlandish writer Jekabs Jansevskis described this era in his book Mezvidus laudis (People of the Forest) as follows: "The bright side of this plague is that it quickly eliminates the aristocracy, the monks, the church leaders and all of the collectors of tithes and tribute. The tragedy is that the plague does not spare our kind of people who also die in entire regions." The historian Edgar Dunsdorfs estimates that half of the population of Latvia perished at this time. The greatest losses were suffered by the Kurzeme and Vidzeme regions with lesser losses to the inhabitants of Latgale. Later, in the 18th century, the people of Latvia also lived under conditions similarly stressful to the 16th and 17th, but at this time they had large families with as many as ten or more children. As a result, after the years of ruin Latvia experienced an explosive growth in population. For example, at the beginning of the 18th century Latvia's population was about 465,000 but at the end of the century it had already reached 873,000. Therefor, the population nearly doubled during the following 90 years. Information about the ethnic composition of the population is shown in Table 1. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1. Ethnic Composition of Latvia's Population at the End of the 18th Ce-| |ntury (in thousands) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ethnic Group |Population in thousands as a | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Latvians |784 |89.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Germans |57 |6.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jews |10 |1.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Poles |7 |0.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russians |5 |0.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Livs |3 |0.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vots |3 |0.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lithuanians |3 |0.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Estonians |l |0.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |873 |100.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- E. Dunsdorfs indicates that this figure (873 thousand) does not include the Russian army and that the number of Latvians includes only those in the territory of Latvia. Table 1 shows that the Latvian comprise a high percentage of the total population -- 89.8 percent. This means that the immigration from neighboring countries was negligible and that the rapid increase of the population resulted from the high birth rate and natural population growth. Naturally, 18th century Latvians did not have demographers or other specialists, who were concerned with and encouraged the renewal of the living force of the nation. It is also unlikely that at that time that heightened national consciousness would have motivated larger families to leave less room for foreigners to settle in the homeland of the Latvian people. In our era, when it is known that families with only one child, or none, dominate, and that the once strong and healthy Latvian nation is dying out in its own country, during a time of peace (see Table 3) it is useful to reflect on and learn from the objective conditions that stimulated the higher birthrate. First, families and high birthrates received moral support, because the manor lords were interested that they had a pool of familiar, Latvian workers instead of having to hire unknown strangers. For example, the court of the Duke of Kurland issued regulations that peasants are to be encouraged to marry and that these marriages are to be facilitated in every way possible. This regulation also says that mothers of children born out of wedlock are to be punished only lightly and that they cannot be shamed with punishment meted out by the church. It is also, however, stated that older wives of farmers and servants are to watch over young girls. Historical data shows that some manors ordered bachelors to find brides even in other regions. The Russian government of the 18th century showed little interest in the inhabitants of Latvia, however, they did issue a decree, that the inhabitants cannot be restrained from marriage. Second, at that time families were also supported by economic means. The historical record shows that manor lords in Vidzeme paid premiums to the newly married and their children. Also the manors permitted proper families with children to purchase their own homes, but gave the most difficult and unpleasant jobs to the unwed without children. The difficult conditions of the time also motivated the peasants to have more children, because large families made it easier to complete the work demanded by the manor as well as the tasks for one's own farmstead. Third, we can mention another significant factor contributing to the high birthrate which is that at that time modern methods of birth control were unknown. It is noteworthy that at this time that the registered number of abortions significantly exceeds the number of live births. As an example, in 1990 there were 37,900 births and 45,100 abortions. This condition persists to this day. At the same time, we are first in the world with our divorce rate, because nearly every other marriage ends up in divorce. The next destructive shock that Latvians experienced was the first World War. The War, the fleeing of refugees and the fight for independence resulted in a loss of more than 700,000 inhabitants. The psyche of the people, however, was not traumatized. By 1935, when the Latvian government began to be concerned with the demographic state of the country, Latvia's birthrate began to recover. In the inter war period one could encounter not a small number of large families (ref. to the picture of President Cakste's large family [photo not reproduced]) -- among farmers, workers and intellectuals. It must also be noted that at this time that there were few abortions and divorces. For example, in 1937 statistics show 1,300 divorces and 4,100 registered abortions or about one tenth the current number of abortions and one eighth the number of abortions. Following 20 years of peaceful development terrible destruction was wreaked by World War II when Latvia lost more than half a million inhabitants. As a result of both world wars Latvia lost more than 1.2 million inhabitants as a direct result of the wars, through migration of refugees, losses in the fight for independence, and deportations. No European smaller country has experienced a comparable loss. This left a negative impact on the psyche of the nation, but still did not destroy the will of the country and following the war the birthrate grew at a satisfactory rate which is evidenced by Table 2. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2. Births, Deaths, and Natural Population Growth in Latvia per 1,000 | |Inhabitants | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Births |Deaths |Natural Growth | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1939 |18.5 |13.9 |4.6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1950 |17.0 |12.4 |4.6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1970 |14.5 |11.2 |3.3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1980 |14.0 |12.7 |1.3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |14.1 |13.0 |1.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |12.9 |13.0 |-0.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 2 shows that births and natural population growth fell rapidly in the Postwar period, and that starting in 1991, until the current moment, growth has been negative, that is more inhabitants are dying than are being born. Latvia's native people are in a particularly critical situation, because beginning with 1991 they are on the gloomy path of national extinction (see Table 3). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3. Latvian Ethnic Population Growth | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Natural Growth (Number of People) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |+1546 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |-310 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |-584 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Statistical information also shows, that during the past 45 years that the number of immigrants has exceeded the number of emigrants by 470,000. Since the immigrants tend to be younger people, then in Riga's public schools in 1992/3 there were 63,800 students studying in Russian and only 30,900 studying in Latvian. In this same period (in the beginning of 1993) there were 138 pre-schools for Russian speakers and 60 for Latvian speakers. According to information of the State Statistical Committee (Table 4), Latvians are an ethnic minority in the largest cities of Latvia. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4. Ethnic Latvians as a Percentage of the Population in the Largest Ci-| |ties in Latvia. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |City |Percentage of Ethnic Latvians | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Daugavpils |13.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Riga |36.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rezekne |37.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Liepaja |39.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ventspils |42.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jurmala |44.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jekabpils |48.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jelgava |49.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In this Year of the Family, the association For Country and Freedom, the Latvian Militia (strelnieku) Association, the Christian Democratic Union, the Latvian Association, and the citizens group "Our Land" have agreed, without hesitation, to take a stand against the extinction of the Latvian people. To halt this process the Latvian People's Self-help Foundation is being established to stimulate broad and far reaching measures throughout the territory of Latvia. This is a not-for-profit, public welfare foundation whose mission is fight for the ethnic survival of the Latvian people. First, the Foundation, based on experience from prior years, is to provide moral support to families and to encourage young people to marry and to establish stable families. It is proposed to involve existing social welfare and women's organizations, medical workers, and other social organizations and representatives of the intelligencia, especially of pensioners. It is also proposed to invite established religious organizations to participate in this important undertaking. The Foundation is expecting to wage an unwavering battle against alcoholism, smoking, drug addiction and other immoral behavior. Secondly, families, particularly those with more children, need material support. In Western countries, as we know, this is seen as a social norm. We can only hope that this will also happen in our country. The Foundation is also expected to provide support to those who are experiencing economic difficulties. It is expected that the Foundation will seek donations of money, clothes, shoes, and food. Thirdly, artificial birth control, primarily abortions, are a complex and difficult to solve problems under present circumstances, but we expect to work in this direction as well. I must mention that in 1991, when the Council of Ministers was still in power, that I submitted a proposal to at least establish a price limit for abortion operations, to which I received only a form letter as a response. During my lectures at the Latvian World Science Congress I touched on the abortion problem. Foreign scientists were surprised at the large number of abortions. After my lecture we discussed this problem with a consensus that without government support it will be very difficult to achieve visible results. The Latvian People's Self-help Foundation's primary mission is to wage an energetic fight, using all legitimate means, to increase the natural growth rate of the population, and to provide the family, as the primary institution of society, with material support. I invite other social and political organizations, as well as individuals, to participate in the formation of the Latvian People's Self-help Foundation.
