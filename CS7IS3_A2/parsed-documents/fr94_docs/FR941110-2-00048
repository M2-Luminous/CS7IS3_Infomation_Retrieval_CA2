FR941110-2-00048 FR941110-2-00016 [C&hyph;201&hyph;003] Ceramic Tile from Mexico; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the countervailing duty order on ceramic tile from Mexico. The review period is January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. We preliminarily determine the total bounty or grant to be zero or de minimis for 32 companies, and 2.55 percent ad valorem for all other companies during this review period. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.5 percent ad valorem is de minimis . We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gayle Longest or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 28, 1993, the Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 25802) of the countervailing duty order on ceramic tile from Mexico. We received a request for review from Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A., (Ceramica) a Mexican exporter of the subject merchandise. We initiated the review on June 25, 1993 (58 FR 34414). The review period is January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. This review involves 33 companies and 10 programs. On February 7, 1994, the Government of Mexico submitted a request for partial revocation for 14 companies with their questionnaire response. According to 19 CFR 355.25(b)(3), a request for revocation can only be submitted in the fifth and subsequent anniversary months of an order. Since the anniversary month for the review period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992 is May 1993, and the request was submitted on February 7, 1994, the request was untimely. Therefore, the Department is unable to consider partial revocation for these 14 companies in this administrative review. The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act), as amended. The final results of the last administrative review of this order were published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2823). Scope of Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of Mexican ceramic tile, including non-mosaic, glazed, and unglazed ceramic floor and wall tile. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 6907.10.0000, 6907.90.0000, 6908.10.0000, and 6908.90.0000. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. Calculation Methodology for Assessment and Cash Deposit Purposes In calculating the benefits received during the review period, we followed the methodology described in the preamble to 19 CFR 355.20(d) (53 FR 52306, and 52325; December 27, 1988). We calculated a country-wide rate, weight-averaging the benefits received by the 33 companies subject to review to determine the overall subsidy from all programs benefitting exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. In weight-averaging the benefits, we used each firm's share of exports to the United States as weights. Because the overall weighted-average country-wide rate was above de minimis , as defined by 19 CFR 355.7, we proceeded to the next step in our analysis and examined the ad valorem rate we had calculated for each company for all programs combined, to determine whether individual company rates differed significantly from the weighted-average country-wide rate. Thirty-two companies received aggregate benefits which were zero or de minimis (significantly different within the meaning of 19 CFR 355.22(d)(3)(ii)). Therefore, these companies were treated separately for assessment and cash deposit purposes. Ceramica's rate was not significantly different from the weighted-average country-wide rate. Since Ceramica was the only company receiving subsidies greater than de minimis , the all other rate was calculated based on the unweighted aggregate benefits that Ceramic received from all countervailing programs. Analysis of Programs (1) BANCOMEXT Financing for Exporters Effective January 1, 1990, the Mexican Treasury Department eliminated the Fondo para el Fomento de las Exportaciones de Productos Manufacturados (FOMEX) loan program and transferred the FOMEX trust to the Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior, S.N.C. (BANCOMEXT). BANCOMEXT offers short-term financing to producers or trading companies engaged in export activities; any company generating foreign currency through exports is eligible for financing under this program. The BANCOMEXT program operates much like its predecessor, FOMEX. BANCOMEXT provides two types of financing, both in U.S. dollars, to exporters: working capital loans (pre-export loans), and loans for export sales (export loans). In addition, BANCOMEXT may provide financing to foreign buyers of Mexican goods and services.
