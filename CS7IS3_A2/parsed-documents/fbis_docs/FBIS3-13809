Therefore, first and foremost, we say the resolution is only a small step in a direction that will make the UN Security Council begin to assume its humanitarian and international responsibilities in accordance with the UN charter, yardsticks, laws, and international legitimacy resolutions, and start to pass more serious, effective, clear, credible, and just resolutions in favor of the just causes of people and against injustice, crime, aggression, occupation, and the violation of the most basic human rights. Let us hope this small step will give the peace process a push ahead on bases that will open the door to securing international protection for the Palestinian people. It is very important and necessary that negotiations continue under the canopy of a suitable atmosphere propitious for realizing the required progress and that enhances trust in the peace project and the possibility of attaining peace. No doubt, international protection will ward off the threat of Israeli terrorism and ugly crimes and provide the Palestinian people with the opportunity to live normal daily lives so they can pursue their legitimate struggle for independence and freedom. We say there is no doubt this protection, which still needs much to become reality, is, alone, now capable of spreading the appropriate atmosphere and pushing the peace process ahead with serious steps to attain the required progress, foremost being the withdrawal of occupation forces from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. We wait for the UN Security Council resolution to be translated into practical steps so we can speak with real optimism. Until this happens, we reiterate that we hope this small step by the UN Security Council will lead not only to pushing the peace process ahead but to making the UN Security Council itself give up the issuance of resolutions in accordance with double standards and to stop using two different yardsticks. The just causes of people and their legitimate right to a free, dignified, and secure life are an indivisible whole. Injustice cannot be viewed as a relative matter. It is impermissible to tackle it in accordance with restrictive political yardsticks. International legitimacy should not open its eyes here and close them there. In short, the UN Security Council is now called upon to review its repressive resolutions against Iraq and the people of Iraq, resolutions that conflict with the UN charter, laws, and its famous Universal Declaration on Human Rights. An unjust embargo is imposed on the fraternal Iraqi people. Since the beginning this embargo has had nothing to justify it on the legal, and humanitarian level. It is a very dark and ugly blot on the history of mankind's civilization that the international community should expeditiously erase. The international community must expeditiously remove many dark other blots that have brought about the endless sufferings of militant people. Let us really hope this march begins, the march that will place international legitimacy in the prestigious position it used to enjoy so it will be possible to respect its resolutions when they are equitable.
