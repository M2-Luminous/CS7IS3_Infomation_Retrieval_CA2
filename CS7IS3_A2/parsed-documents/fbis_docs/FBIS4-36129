Shahin] [Text] Gaza City -- Every day hundreds of people gather outside the headquarters of the Palestinian police force waiting to meet with officials. Carrying papers and a request of some sort, they seek to make their first contact with Palestinian authorities, who they hope, will begin to solve some of their problems. But the Gaza police headquarters, with only 500 policemen at its immediate disposal, is completely overworked. "Our priorities are law and order, to clean up Gaza and to help set the ground-work for a civic society," said the overall commander of all military units in Gaza, Major General Nasir Yusuf. Meeting delegation after delegation of well-wishers and people with complaints in his spartan office overlooking the Mediterranean Gen. Nasir is visibly tired, keeping a dawn-to-midnight office schedule. The return to Palestine is much harsher than expected by Gen. Nasir and most other Palestinians here. The 500 policemen stationed in Gaza and 3,500 other members of the Palestinian National Security Forces (PNSF) as well as the two investigative branches of the armed forces have not been paid in months. Housing is extremely sparse and most of the policemen and PNSF members are still being dined by Gazans' in on-going gestures of welcome. But Gen. Nasir comes straight to the point. "We have not received sufficient promised equipment and aid from the donors," he said. According to Gen. Nasir almost none of the promised aid with the exception of blue police-uniforms and some weapons have reached the police force. "The communications equipment, the cars, the office furniture have not materialised. I don't know how the donors expect us to work," says Gen. Nasir with a tone of frustration. A tour of several police stations showed that the furniture has been donated by local Gazans. The sanitary conditions of police and army bases left behind by Israel are "unacceptable" and belied Israeli prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement promising to leave well-kept and well-equipped stations behind for the Palestinians. No furniture was left behind. Sewage systems are being totally renewed, creating some work for Gazan plumbers. Last week newspaper ads called on eligible Palestinians to join the Palestinian police. "We waited so far because we can't train people without some equipment. So we want to start recruitment in the hope that the needed equipment will arrive soon. The donors in Cairo and Oslo signed papers but thus far have done very little follow-up work," said Gen. Yusuf. Palestinian policemen are being driven to their posts by the PNSF members in their American-provided khaki coloured Chevrolet jeeps. Gaza, says Gen. Nasir, needs some 3,000 policemen. The "requirements" listed in the local newspapers for a policeman is that he be between 18 and 25 years of age, have a secondary school certificate, be of two Palestinian parents, be of good "national character" and agree to serve 12 years in the police force. Most of the serving policemen where either policemen during Egyptian and later Israeli rule or men conscripted outside the occupied territories specifically for police work. Its purpose is to control traffic and deal with civic issues and register and act on complaints about crime. So far there has not been much crime, but at the police headquarters in the southern part of the Strip in Khan Yunus, eight men have already been arrested on charges ranging from theft to rape. Four men each sit in cells which measure five metres by five metres and the local police chief allows journalists to take a peek to observe the clean conditions of he cells. Photographs, however, are not allowed. Prior to the arrival of the Palestinian police, crimes were punished through the intervention of local notables or tribal leaders or through retaliations, says Gen. Nasir. "Now people come and report to us and we must act fast to show that we can take control and make people feel secured by our presence." But most of the work that Gaza policemen have to deal with is either traffic control or land complaints. When not directing the rather chaotic traffic in Gazan towns and refugee camps, policemen dutifully sit at their desks and register land complaints. Since the Israeli occupation began in 1967 land registration stopped; 27 years later issues of inheritance and family feuds over inheritance is by far the most prominent police-related issue for many Gazans. "These land issues are taking up a lot of our time. Soon a judiciary will be in place to deal with them in a more concrete form. We are being a bit overburdened by these issues because we have very little power to make legal decisions of this kind -- once these decisions are taken we can implement them," said Gen. Yusuf.
