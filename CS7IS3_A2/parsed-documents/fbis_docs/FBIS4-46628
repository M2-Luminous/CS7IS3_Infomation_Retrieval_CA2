As is well known, a governmental delegation from Ukraine composed of Vice Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Borys Tarasyuk, National Space Agency General Director Volodymyr Horbulin and Deputy Minister of Machine Building, VPK [the Military-Industrial Complex] and Conversion Valeriy Kazakov, has returned from Washington. Meetings were held at the Pentagon with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, at the State Department and at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Consultations were held pertaining to the fulfillment of the trilateral agreements among Ukraine, the United States and Russia, cooperation between Ukraine and the United States in conversion programs for the defense industry, the monitoring of missile and space technologies, power engineering and the safety of nuclear reactors. Questions associated with the early deactivation of missile complexes in Ukraine, among other things, were explored during the meetings with the head of the Defense Department of the United States, W. Perry. American strategic missiles, as journalists were informed at a recent press conference by Valeriy Shmarov, will no longer be "looking" in the direction of Ukraine. A joint statement of the governments of both countries was adopted in which their devotion to relations of partnership, mutual trust, respect and the development of relations in the realm of security and defense was affirmed. The government of the United States announced that American strategic missiles will no longer be targeted either at Ukraine or the territory of any other countries as of 30 May 1994. Ukraine, in the words of U.S. Vice President Gore, has proved that it is a reliable and responsible partner, especially in matters of arms control and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Valeriy Shmarov called question number one the negotiations on Ukraine's joining with the control regime for the proliferation of missile technology and equipment for its production. The idea that Ukraine has somehow refused to participate in that prospective area thus does not conform to reality. A memorandum of understanding between the governments of Ukraine and the United States was adopted on the transfer of missile equipment and technology. This document, signed by Vice Prime Minister Shmarov and U.S. Vice President Gore, provides for strict monitoring of the proliferation of nuclear technologies, the performance of joint inspections, and consultations and an exchange of information in the event of the transfer of missile equipment and technology. It was emphasized that this missile technology control regime rules out the creation of impediments to the development of the Ukrainian national space program, or to cooperation with other missile and space powers in that sphere. The United States has thus de facto recognized the right of Ukraine not only to preserve, but also to develop further its own scientific, technological and production potential in the missile and space field. Our country has also been recognized as a full-fledged participant in international cooperation and a participant in the world aerospace market. Common missile-engineering interests exist, by the way, between Ukraine and Russia as well. Valeriy Shmarov, answering a question about this, stated that Russia is ordering missiles and satellites from Ukraine. And we are ordering missile engines. As concerns the prospects for the existence of "Ukrainian space" programs and the participation of our state in the space market, Ukraine will "go in" for that if it has something to go with, and if there is a consumer for our goods... The legal support exists today. A harsh market fight is expected. We are already feeling pressure on the part of the American firms that dominate the space field today, said Valeriy Shmarov. But the Americans acknowledge today, as they have before, that we have one of the best and cheapest launch vehicles, especially the Zenit-3, a modification of the well-known series. There is also a place for them in the Freedom-Mir program. It is acknowledged that our space components have "substantial weight" in that program. They are talking about systems for guidance, docking, on-board systems etc. There is interest in the United States in our developments in the field of space welding, and problems of the effects of gravity on the person. The general director of NASA acknowledged, during a meeting with Valeriy Shmarov, that the United States is prepared to cooperate with Ukraine in the world space field. The utilization of converted launch stages is a very attractive project. The placement of a satellite in orbit using the launch stage of the SS-24 missile is entirely possible. The more so as we already have a legal basis for the activity in the missile and space sphere. It was indicated that the Americans are implementing conversion programs somewhat slowly. A corresponding discussion pertained to this. The so-called "List No. 1" exists in the United States, on which there are 35 Ukrainian enterprises that are subject to conversion. The corresponding partners for them are already being sought in the United States. There is also a project being carried out by the American firm of Westinghouse and the Ukrainian firm of Khartron (Kharkiv)--the installation of an ASU [automated control system] for operation in nuclear-power plants and other power-engineering projects. The Nunn-Lugar fund allocates five million dollars, with another 20 million from Westinghouse... We will hope that the partnership of the two nations in conversion programs will develop in the future as well.
