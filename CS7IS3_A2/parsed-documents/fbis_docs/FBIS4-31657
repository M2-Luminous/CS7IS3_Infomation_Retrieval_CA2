During the debate, the PRAVDA correspondent asked him the following questions: [Lesko] Mr. Deputy, there have not been many opportunities to meet you since March; therefore, I would like to return to some older affairs. In the television program "Kroky" [Steps] about two months ago, you said that the fundamental change of your stand on the Tatragate affair [involving the alleged "sale" of the right to commercial use of the Tatra mountains to a U.S. company] was linked to a certain document you had obtained only a few weeks before and that you did not have at your disposal earlier. I would like to ask you what kind of document this is and why it has not been published to date. And now my second question: At about this time last year, [Deputy Prime Minister] Mr. Roman Kovac said under the chestnut trees [in the garden of the Slovak Government building in Bratislava] that he had received some $5 million. How is it possible that you did not file a lawsuit against him at that time, and how is it possible that he kept executing the post of deputy prime minister for a few more months? [Meciar] It is fairly easy to respond to the first question. We discussed in the government a report on a trip to the United States by [then Deputy Prime Minister] Mr. Kucerak, [then Finance Minister and present president] Mr. Kovac, Mr. Rakicky, and perhaps there was also a fourth member of the delegation. We approved that report and considered the matter closed. We did not know at that time that there existed yet another signed document. Subsequently, a commission of the National Council carried out an inquiry, but, as you know, the commission of inquiry was practically recalled before it reached any conclusions. The commission was chaired by a Green Party deputy, whose name was Huba. This commission never completed its work. After we went over to the opposition, one citizen came to see me and brought a copy of documents that he called the fourth part and that carried the signatures of Mr. Kucerak, Mr. Kovac, and Mr. Rakicky and showed that an agreement had been concluded in the United States. I then had a talk with Mr. Rakicky, in which he confirmed this act, when it happened, and under what circumstances. I was not the only person before whom Mr. Rakicky confirmed this. Even before that, he had confirmed it to another member of my government. I therefore believe that these matters have been proved and that parliament should take them and investigate them. As far as Mr. Roman Kovac is concerned, the situation was somewhat more complicated. He really admitted this fact [the acceptance of a $5-million bribe]. Quite a few of us were present when he said it, and we remember it well. Should it be necessary to remind him, we will do so one more time. As for the conclusions, what options and possible solutions were open to me? The option of asking the president of the Republic to recall him was not feasible. At that time, the president had already considered Roman Kovac as my successor for the post of prime minister. The option of asking parliament to pass a vote of no confidence in him was equally unfeasible because some [HZDS] deputies from Zilina district had already announced that, should anything be done to remove Kovac, they would leave the [HZDS] club of deputies. The third option, that of filing criminal charges, was also unfeasible because Roman Kovac, in his capacity as deputy to the Federal Assembly, enjoyed immunity and there was no one to strip him of this immunity. There was an analogous case involving Duray; the Mandate and Immunity Committee of the National Council of the Slovak Republic declared that it did not have the authority to strip him of immunity. We therefore thought we would drop Roman Kovac from the government in the process of concluding a coalition agreement with the Slovak National Party. This resulted in a very strong internal misunderstanding, with Keltosova, Gasparovic, Roman Kovacj, and me present. Following talks with the president, it was impossible at that time to put forward a proposal that Roman Kovac be recalled. I more or less announced to Kovac that he could not be in the government and called upon him to resign from the government, which he did not do. At that time, he had simply already worked differently, and the alliances were different. You know well that, from approximately March 1993, there were efforts on the part of the Castle to recall my government, and, from approximately August, the president was proposing Roman Kovac for my post to HZDS and National Council functionaries. This was announced to me personally. That was simply the limit, and nothing could be done at that moment. That is why we did what we did. By making it possible for him in that television program to sue me, I actually gave him the chance to clear his name. This was also discussed in the National Council, which is easier for him than to prove now that I was not speaking the truth. [sentence as published] If what I said was not the truth. [Lesko] Judging from what you said, everything you know about Tatragate has been actually known to you since 1991. You have had plenty of opportunities since then to present your new standpoint and did not have to wait until March 1994. As for the second case, if you really lost trust in Roman Kovac in the summer of 1993, why did the HZDS authorize him to conduct coalition talks with the Slovak National Party, which, as is well known, took place in September and October 1993? He must have enjoyed your trust; otherwise, he would have scarcely been authorized to conduct these talks on behalf of the HZDS.... [Meciar] Regarding the first question, I envy you for knowing what I know. These documents were not known to me in 1991. There were two agreements. The first, which was known to me, was acknowledged by the government. The second was not known to me. As for the talks with the Slovak National Party, it is true that they were conducted also by Roman Kovac. But they were conducted also by Ivan Gasparovic and me. The conclusions from the talks were made by me. Roman Kovac was responsible only for the final legal formulation, or, to be more accurate, it was done in his office because there was a meeting in mine. He was not the only person present at these talks, in which there were many other participants. You know that the talks with the Slovak National Party were very complicated and took place concurrently along several lines. Apart from talks with [then Slovak National Party Chairman Ludovit] Cernak, there were also talks with a number of other Slovak National Party functionaries.
