The relevant material, which Civic Democratic Alliance Chairman (ODA) Jan Kalvoda was to give to ODS Chairman Vaclav Klaus, was marked as party material and dated April 8, Strasky said. He added that the Executive Council was disturbed by the standard of the material's groundwork, which returned to alternatives which had already been considered and rejected. This was not in keeping with ODA's proclamations about setting up higher local administration units as soon as possible, Strasky said. There is still room for improvement in coalition relations, and the ODS Executive Council is somewhat disturbed by the statements of several Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) representatives about the ODS, the party's Executive Deputy Chairman Petr Cermak said. The Council had repeatedly stated that there was very little talk about the matters on which the four coalition parties agreed, and too much emphasis on the differences in opinion, Cermak said. He had made "a very accommodating speech," as a guest at last weekend's ODA conference, he said, and believed that ODS was tending towards a conciliatory solution to relations. The ODS Executive Council meeting is continuing late into the night, with election laws and the preparation of a law on the financing and activities of political parties on the agenda.
