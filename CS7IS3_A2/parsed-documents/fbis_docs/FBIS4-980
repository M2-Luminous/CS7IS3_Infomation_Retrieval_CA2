UNITA handed its proposal over to the mediators on 15 April. The government did the same the next day. This morning, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye held separate meetings -- first with the government team and then with the UNITA delegation. The observers attended both meetings, where Blondin Beye delivered a document reflecting the mediators' views regarding the proposals advanced by the government and by UNITA. No meetings were held this afternoon. The negotiating teams took time off to reflect on the document and suggest possible amendments. The UN special representative is scheduled to meet with the two sides tomorrow to get their responses. Should there not be too many differences, Blondin Beye is likely to call for a face-to-face meeting between the government and UNITA teams.
