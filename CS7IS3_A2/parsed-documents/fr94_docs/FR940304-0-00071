FR940304-0-00071 FR940304-0-00019 Ischaemum byrone was first collected by James Macrae during the expedition of the Blonde in 1825 and named Spodiopogon byronis by Trinius in 1832. The specific epithet refers to Byron's Bay, now called Hilo Bay, where this specimen was collected. Steudel (1855) transferred the species to the genus Andropogon , and in 1889, Hackel redescribed the species, naming it Ischaemum lutescens , a superfluous name. In 1922, Hitchcock published Ischaemum byrone , the currently accepted name (O'Connor 1990). Ischaemum byrone of the grass family (Poaceae) is a perennial plant with creeping stems and erect stems 16 to 31 in (40 to 80 cm) tall. The uppermost sheaths (portions of leaves surrounding the stems) are often inflated and sometimes partially enclose the yellow to yellowish-brown racemes (flowering clusters). The hairless leaf blade (the flat extended part of the leaf) is 2.8 to 7.9 in (7 to 20 cm) long and 1.2 to 2 in (3 to 5 cm) wide; the uppermost blades are much smaller in size. Flowers, arranged in two or sometimes three digitate (originating from one point), elongate racemes 1.6 to 3.9 in (4 to 10 cm) long, consist of two types of two-flowered awned (having bristles) spikelets (subclusters of flowers). The fruit is a caryopsis (grain) about 0.1 in (3 mm) long. The only species of the genus found in Hawaii, Ischaemum byrone differs from other grasses in the State by its C 4 photosynthetic pathway; its digitate racemes; and its two-flowered, awned spikelets (O'Connor 1990). Historically, Ischaemum byrone was found on Oahu at an unspecified location, on the northeastern coasts of Molokai and east Maui, and along the central portion of the eastern coast of the island of Hawaii. Extant populations still occur on Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. Two populations on east Molokai are located about 2 mi (3 km) apart at the head of Wailau Valley and on Kikipua Point on privately owned land. Six populations on east Maui are found along approximately 16 mi (26 km) of coast on privately, State-, and federally owned land on Pauwalu Point, on Kalahu Point, near Hana, on Kauiki Head, and on the following offshore islets: Keopuka Islet, Mokuhuki Islet, and Puukii Islet. On Hawaii, the species is still found in two populations at Auwae and Kamoamoa on privately and federally owned land. The total distribution of the species includes 10 populations on 3 islands with approximately 1,200 to 2,200 individuals (HHP 1991m1 to 1991m10, 1991m12 to 1991m14), though the total number may be in the range of 5,000 individuals (R. Hobdy, in litt ., 1993). Because this species occupies lowland habitat, it is at high risk from development, alien weeds, and in the past, from alien ungulates. This species typically grows in Coastal Dry Shrublands among rocks or on basalt cliffs at elevations between sea level and 250 ft (0 and 75 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, O'Connor 1990). Associated species include Bidens spp. (ko'oko'olau), Fimbristylis cymosa , and Scaevola sericea (naupaka kahakai) (HHP 1991m5, 1991m7, 1991m9, 1991m11, HPCC 1991f). The major threats to Ischaemum byrone are competition from alien species such as Digitaria ciliaris (Henry's crabgrass) and habitat change from volcanic activity (HHP 1991m3, HPCC 1991f; Charles H. Lamoureux, Lyon Arboretum, pers. comm., 1992). Isodendrion pyrifolium was first collected on Oahu during the United States Exploring Expedition in 1841 and was named by Gray in 1852. The specific epithet refers to the resemblance of the leaves of this species to those of Pyrus (pear). In his monograph of the genus, St. John (1952) named the following species, all of which are considered in the current treatment of the genus (Wagner et al . 1990) to be synonymous with I . pyrifolium : I . hawaiiense , I . hillebrandii , I . lanaiense , I . molokaiense , and I . remyi . Isodendrion pyrifolium of the violet family (Violaceae), a shrub about 2.6 to 6.6 ft (0.8 to 2 m) tall, has persistent stipules (leaflike appendages on leaves) and alternate, stalked, elliptic or sometimes lance-shaped, papery leaves which measure 1 to 2.6 in (2.5 to 6.5 cm) long and 0.3 to 1.3 in (0.8 to 3.2 cm) wide. The solitary, bilaterally symmetrical, fragrant flowers have five lance-shaped sepals 0.1 to 0.2 in (3.5 to 5 mm) long with membranous edges fringed with white hairs and three types of clawed (with a narrow petiole-like base) greenish-yellow petals 0.4 to 0.6 in (10 to 15 mm) long with lobes about 0.2 in (4 to 5 mm) long. The three-lobed, 0.5 in (12 mm) long capsule opens to release olive-green seeds about 0.1 in (3 mm) long and about 0.08 in (2 mm) in diameter. This species differs from others in this endemic Hawaiian genus by its slightly smaller, greenish-yellow flowers and by the presence of hairs on the stipule midribs and leaf veins (Wagner et al . 1990).
