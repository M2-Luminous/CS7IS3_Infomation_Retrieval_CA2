FR940804-2-00163 FR940804-2-00087 7. Applicants therefore request relief from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) thereunder to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Funds to be offered and sold in connection with both mixed and shared funding. 8. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment advisor or principal underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a) (1) or (2). Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) provide exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to limitations on mixed and shared funding. The relief provided by Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(i) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(i) permits a person disqualified under Section 9(a) to serve as an officer, director, or employee or the life insurer, or of any of its affiliates, so long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying fund. The relief provided by Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(ii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(ii) permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying fund's investment advisor or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible pursuant to Section 9(a) are participating in the management or administration of the fund. 9. Applicants state that the partial relief from Section 9(a) found in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15), in effect, limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of the Section. Applicant state that those 1940 Act rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies within that organization. Applicants note that the Participating Insurance Companies are not expected to play any role in the management or administration of the Funds. Therefore, Applicants assert, applying the restrictions of Section 9(a) serves no regulatory purpose. The application states that the relief requested will not be affected by the proposed sale of shares of the Funds to the Plans. The insulation of the Trust from individuals disqualified under the 1940 Act remains in place. Applicants assert that, since the Plans are not investment companies and will not be deemed affiliated by virtue of their share holdings, no additional relief is necessary. 10. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act assume the existence of a pass-through voting requirement with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account. The application states that the Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Contract owners so long as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require such privileges. 11. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from the pass-through voting requirement with respect to several significant matters, assuming observance of the limitations on mixed and shared funding imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A) provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund, or any contract between a fund and its investment advisor, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(b) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(B) provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instructions of its contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in the company's investment policies, principal underwriter, or any investment advisor, provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(15)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii) (B) and (C) of each rule. 12. Applicants represent that the right of the Participating Insurance Companies to disregard voting instructions of Contract owners provided by Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) does not raise any issues different from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts. Under the rules, an insurer can disregard voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items. Affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies, principal underwriter, or investment advisor initiated by contract owners. The potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) that the insurance company's disregard of voting instructions be both reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations. 13. Applicants further represent that the Funds' sale of shares to the Plans does not impact the relief requested in this regard. As noted previously by Applicants, shares of the Funds sold to Plans would be held by the trustees of such Plans as required by Section 403(a) of ERISA. Section 403(a) also provides that the trustee(s) must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the Plan with two exceptions: (a) when the Plan expressly provides that the trustee(s) is (are) subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which case the trustee(s) is (are) subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and not contrary to ERISA; and (b) when the authority to manage, acquire or dispose of assets of the Plan is delegated to one or more investment mangers pursuant to Section 402(c)(3) of ERISA. Unless one of the two exceptions stated in Section 403(a) applies, Plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies. Where a named fiduciary appoints an investment manger, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or to the named fiduciary. In any event, there is no pass-through voting to the participants in such Plans. According, Applicants note that, unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts, the issue of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with Plans because such Plans are not entitled to pass-through voting privileges.
