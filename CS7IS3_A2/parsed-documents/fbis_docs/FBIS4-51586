He said the private sector's support is necessary because it bears some social responsibility. In fact, the nation cannot boast of cultural and educational development if it is not matched by economic growth. "Approaches to development do not mean economic methods alone but include culture and intellectual traditions, such as a climate of reading, which needs to be supported by the private sector," he said. He said this tonight in a speech at the start of a dinner held by the Pulau Public Library Board. Also present were Pulau Pinang Chief Minister Dr. Koh Tsu Koon and Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Dr. Ibrahim Said. Anwar, who is also minister of finance, said full advantage needs to be taken of economic growth to prove that the development concept we are following has a unique and distinct corporate philosophy. "Conceptual approaches to development in this country are different, and we need not borrow all the experience of the private sector in the West in order to create a national economic system," he said. In that connection, he said, the people want to see a Malaysia that is successful in keeping the growth rate at around 8 percent and inflation below 4 percent. He urged the public and private sectors to compete and cooperate and to reject an attitude of happiness with the growth we have already enjoyed, because such an attitude could hinder development efforts.
