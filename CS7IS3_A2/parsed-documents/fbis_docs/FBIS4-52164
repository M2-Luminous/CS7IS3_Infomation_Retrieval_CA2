Sakigake, the 15-legislator party, is headed by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura in the preceding coalition government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who lead his 37-member Japan New Party. The three-legislator Seiun, a breakaway from the JNP, splintered after Hosokawa reneged on his promise to merge with Sakigake. Now, the new parliamentary bloc has emerged as the fifth largest parliamentary group in the lower house after the 206-member Liberal Democratic Party, the 130-member Kaishin (Innovation), the 74-member Social Democratic Party and the 52-legislator Komeito. Takemura distanced his party from the coalition after Hosokawa decided to side with the chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, who is credited with sweeping his ally Tsutomu Hata to prime ministership in a policy reconciliation talk that led up to the April 25 Diet vote. Ozawa and Takemura have confronted each other over the wisdom of proposals to expand Japan's parts [as received] in UN peacekeeping missions, hike the rate of the consumption tax, and taking a tougher line over the suspected North Korean nuclear arms program.
