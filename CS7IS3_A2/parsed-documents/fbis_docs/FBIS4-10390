Our doors will, therefore, remain closed to any initiative in that direction. Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner said this morning that our country will not change its position over that Caribbean island despite Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's visit to our country on 15 and 16 April. Following a meeting with the president at government palace, Ramirez Boettner said Paraguay is only interested in commercial contacts within the framework of Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. "Our position continues unchanged. Paraguay has not changed its position over Cuba. We will receive him to talk about Mercosur and trade matters," said Ramirez Boettner. The foreign minister added that Robaina and his entourage will make an unofficial visit to the country because we do not have diplomatic relations with the island. Ramirez Boettner added that Paraguay is very interested in talking about Mercosur, particularly because Robaina will be arriving here after visiting the other three Mercosur member countries. Ramirez Boettner said he will depart for Marrakech, Morocco, tomorrow and will not be in the country during Robaina's visit. Robaina will be received by Deputy Foreign Minister Oscar Cabello Sarubbi. The foreign minister said Wasmosy will not receive the Cuban foreign minister either. "I do not think he (Wasmosy) will receive him because his visit is unofficial," the foreign minister noted. Robaina wants to talk about Mercosur so perhaps he will also meet with Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone. An interesting detail is that no government official is scheduled to meet Robaina at the airport.
