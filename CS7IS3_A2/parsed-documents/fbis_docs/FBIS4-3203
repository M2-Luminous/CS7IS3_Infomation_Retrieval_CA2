On the Harbin-Beijing No. 18 express train, in the Harbin Railway Bureau, in the Heilongjiang Grain Bureau, in Shenzhen, by the south China coast...people are trying to show they care by donating money. Before this, on 22 March, this newspaper carried an article entitled "Live Like `Father'" reporting on Xiang Shixin and his wife in Shenyang, who, though earning a moderate income, financially supported a youth in school who was neither a relative nor an old friend, also causing strong responses from readers. Similar stories have often been carried by newspapers recently, making people feel that a warm current of love and offering is flowing in the vast motherland, spreading to millions of households, and encouraging billions of people. In the 1990's, the fine social habit of "one helping another" is still striking deep roots in the Chinese soil. In the big family on our motherland, no matter where you live, what you do, or what ethnic group you belong to, everyone is the builder of the socialist undertaking, and has common interests, ideals, undertakings, and pursuits. When people are as close as brothers, love one another, and help one another, we will increase the nation's cohesive force and form a strong integrating force for invigorating the Chinese nation. In society, there is always a group of people who are comparatively poor or very poor, who are leading a comparatively difficult or very difficult life, and who sometimes even slip into a very dangerous situation and badly need the help of other people. "One helping another" is required by our socialist system, as well as a duty to be performed by every person who has a sense of social responsibility and a sense of righteousness. A majority of people in society are doing so. However, in a certain period, some people were influenced by mammonism and thoughts of extreme individualism, so they turned a blind eye to other people's difficulties, and turned a deaf ear to other people's call for help. When a hooligan insulted a woman, they stood aside to watch....When a child fell into the water and shouted for help, a man first demanded money....The terrible indifference and the extreme selfishness made them throw away the minimum social responsibility and morals needed for being a man. People of various social quarters expressed righteous indignation and condemnation on this situation and strongly hoped to change it. Indeed, as we diligently build the socialist market economy system, it has become an urgent and important duty for us to vigorously strengthen spiritual civilization construction in the whole society. If this problem is not solved properly, it will certainly affect social stability and hinder the smooth process of reform, opening up, and modernization construction. Spiritual civilization rests mainly on construction. Like material civilization construction, spiritual civilization construction must also begin from doing concrete things one after another, solidly and persistently. The deeds of PLA soldier Xu Honggan, the deeds of the Korean lady Bai Yulan, and the deeds of many other advanced figures tell us that, amid socialist spiritual civilization construction, the heroic and moving deeds by the broad masses show the truly commendable spirit of dedication, as well as historical initiatives. In our Chinese nation's history of civilization of several thousand years, respect for the elderly and care for the young, rescuing people in danger and helping the poor, taking up the cudgels for a just cause, and laying down one's life for a just cause, are the traditional virtues praised by the people. In the 70-year history of our party leading the people to engage in revolution and construction, care for others, taking pleasure in helping others, considering others first, sacrificing oneself for public interest, and "eight sides coming to the aid of one side when it has trouble" are outstanding habits which have won hearts and minds. In the new historical period, if we can develop our nation's traditional virtues, uphold our party's outstanding work style, borrow helpful experiences from foreign countries, explore behavioral and moral norms which have the features of the day, and combine all these organically into one, then we can create a world- renowned socialist spiritual civilization with Chinese characteristics. When we reflect on the reports of these moving stories, we find that mass media have played an important role. So long as we can give full play to the characteristics and strong points of public opinion work, encourage healthy trends, and criticize evil tendencies, we can increase the number of people who like to give and help, and we can decrease the number of those who are extremely selfish and care only about themselves, so that social atmosphere will continue to improve. Journalists have great room to maneuver in the area of guiding people with the correct public opinion and molding people with lofty spirit. This newspaper wishes to join hands and walk side by side with brother units, to continue to work hard.
