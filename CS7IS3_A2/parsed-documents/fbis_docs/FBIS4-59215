The disagreements revolve around the stationing of a Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge, a Palestinian director at the Rafah border checkpoint, and the size of the Jericho enclave. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has been informed of Israel's position. On 10 May, the working groups on refugee affairs will resume discussions in Cairo. The parties will stress the improvement of the refugees's living conditions and refrain from dealing with other aspects of the problem.
