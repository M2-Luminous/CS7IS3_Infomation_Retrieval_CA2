Mr. Ruan, reviewing last year's economic progress, said that the island province had produced a gross national product (GNP) of RMB [renminbi] 19.14 billion, 18.9 percent up over the previous year while the total industrial output value was RMB 9.3 billion or a 28.9 percent rise. The agricultural output value was RMB 8.45 billion or a 6.2 percent gain. Fixed assets investment was RMB 13.5 billion or a 55 percent increase and the actual use of foreign investment was U.S.$730 million or a 62 percent growth. The balance of bank savings deposits at branches of national banks operating in the island was put at RMB 33.5 billion by late last year, 22 percent up over earlier in the year. All these figures indicate healthy economic development in the province. The island, Mr. Ruan said, would grab the opportunity this year to quicken its economic exploitation. The planned GNP aimed for in Hainan this year is put at RMB 25 billion, 18 percent up from last year. The island will concentrate its work in several sectors to achieve this end. First, the rural economy will be strenuously exploited in a bid to increase the peasants' income and protect their interests. The planned agricultural output value set for this year is RMB 9.3 billion or a rise of ten percent over last year and township enterprises RMB 7.5 billion or a gain of 60 percent. Second, technological renovation of industrial enterprises will be speeded up, including the automobile industry, construction materials, natural beverages, pharmaceuticals, clothing and electronics. The building up of industrial bases will be accelerated to bring in domestic and foreign advanced technology. The expected industrial output value set for this year is RMB 12.1 billion, 30 percent up over last year. Third, domestic and foreign markets will be earnestly developed while tertiary industry will be exploited at an extraordinarily fast pace with tourism as its driving force in order for the island to get into the international market. Fourth, the investment pattern will improve with an emphasis on the building up of 24 key projects with a planned investment of RMB 7 billion this year. A number of projects including an airport, power plant and expressway will see their construction speeded up while work on the start of the Yangpu Economic Development Zone and the Haikou Bonded Area must be quickened to bring in foreign investment. Fifth, social order will be strengthened while various social undertakings will be carried out, a move creating a sound environment for domestic and foreign investors. Mr. Ruan stressed the importance of legislation in the market economy and the pushing forward of reform. A legal system must be established as soon as possible to keep pace with the market economy, putting basic economic relations, market behaviour and market transactions in order.
