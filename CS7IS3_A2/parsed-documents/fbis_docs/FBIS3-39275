Both parties have agreed, among other things, on the criteria to be used to determine Romanian citizenship of "indesirables" who have discarded their identity papers to avoid being turned away. In return, Romanian authorities have asked France to simplify the visa delivery procedure for Romanian businessmen. Officially, some 3,000 applications for refugee status have been submitted to the French authorities by Romanian nationals. However, "this figure does not give an accurate picture of the actual numbers of illegal aliens," say French authorities. For comparison purposes, 23,000 Romanian illegals have been repatriated from Germany in the last few months as part of an agreement comparable to the one concluded with France; Bucharest already has similar agreements with Sweden, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic. According to immigration figures of the International Migration Office (IMO), 9 percent of Romanians over 15 years of age want to leave Romania. In 1993, Western countries only took in 18,000.
