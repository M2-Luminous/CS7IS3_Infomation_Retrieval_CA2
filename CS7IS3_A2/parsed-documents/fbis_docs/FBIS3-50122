The representatives of the Democratic Convention [CDR] overcame their doubts and went to the meeting at Cotroceni [presidential palace] with the offer to form a new governmental coalition. The only nonnegotiable condition they put forward was that the coalition should distance itself from the extremist parties. It became equally obvious that this hand was turned down in more or less polite terms. Probably surprised by such an unequivocal offer, Ion Iliescu found no better solution than to repeat his vague remarks about the "political pact" to which he is inviting the parties, thus proving that he does not really want a solution to the crisis through sharing power with the opposition, but rather a political "hora" [Romanian folk dance] around the crisis. The end of the Cotroceni meeting looked like a display of all cards out on the table, with the recognition of the fact that the negotiations were a bluff. Less clear is why Ion Iliescu does not want to hear anything about the current suffering of the Romanians and the poor administration of the country in the years that have elapsed since the revolution. Does he really believe that everything is linked to some fatalistic notions and the hardships of transition? Now, when we are much worse off, not only compared to the Poles, Czechs, or Hungarians, but also to the Bulgarians, who are also in a transition process, we cannot find another explanation for such beliefs -- without feeling offended -- than that the president has lost all contact with reality. Then, it is also not at all clear why Ion Iliescu stubbornly ignores the disastrous opinion of the majority of the population about Vacaroiu's government and why he still does not fear an alliance of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] with the extremist parties, in the light of the international uproar around Zhirinovskiy's circus. Is is possible that nothing matters -- not even the country being brought to ruin by an incompetent and corrupt government and not even the reticence of the outside world -- when the interests of personal power are at stake? Ion Iliescu has let us understand that all he wanted was a pact through which all the political forces would side with those who are administering the catastrophe. His secret dream seems to be to turn political pluralism into a kind of ideological federation or national symposium, where everybody comes up with his ideas and throws them together into the pile, after which they pledge to no longer have any other objections. He seems to dismiss the fact that the role of political pluralism in the democratic world is to ensure a governing alternative and a competition of programs, not an amalgam of strategies. But then, we want to be original at all costs, don't we? Here comes up, in a new version, the old idea of a "front," within which one can argue over details, as long as the minority subordinates itself to the majority. At the level of the end results, things are rather clear. It is the cause that is more unclear. How can one explain the negative answer that came from Cotroceni? It is not easy to find an explanation to that, since there might be several. 1. Ion Iliescu is the spokesman (some say "the prisoner") of certain forces that do not want a change, but rather the consolidation of the restoration; this should be done quietly, and if one can no longer have the graveyard quiet of Ceausescu's days, at least it should be the quiet of resignation. 2. Ion Iliescu is convinced that he has become master of the situation and can now afford to ignore all suffering and discontent. 3. Ion Iliescu feels more secure amid the insults and flattery coming from the extremist parties than alongside certain parties that talk too much about truth, reform, and Europe. 4. Ion Iliescu cannot overcome his resentment toward the CDR leaders, who have often criticized him. Consequently, anything the Convention offers him, except applause, should be rejected. 5. Ion Iliescu cannot escape the limits of his Gorbachev-like thinking. In the end, regardless of what the cause may be, to defend the morass into which we are sinking is a dangerous game.
