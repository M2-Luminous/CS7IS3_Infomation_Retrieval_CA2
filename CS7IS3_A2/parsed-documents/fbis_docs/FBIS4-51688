Sales of passenger cars fell by 6.1 percent to 259,249, while those of trucks declined 7.4 percent to 111,801, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. Bus sales fell 21.5 percent from a year earlier to 1,705. Of the passenger cars, sales of cars with engine capacity of more than 2 liters grew for the first time in six months, rising 1.2 percent to 51,782. Sales of passenger cars with engine sizes ranging from 660 cc to 2000 cc fell 7.8 percent to 207,467, continuing the decline that started in April last year. All the major automakers except Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. saw sales dropping. Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest automaker, saw its sales in April fall 7.0 percent from a year earlier, while No. 2 Nissan Motor Co. registered a 16.3 percent decline, and Honda Motor Co. an 18.4 percent drop. In contrast, imported car sales jumped 45.0 percent from April last year to 24,253 vehicles, the association said. Fuji enjoyed a 55.3 percent rise in sales due to its "Legacy" model which was popular following the renewal of its type last year. In March, the decline in overall sales shrank to 3.8 percent, and hopes have spread in the auto industry that sales figures would recover, particularly with the reduction of the car consumption tax from 4.5 percent to 3 percent in April. However, the companies went too far in March in discounting auto prices ahead of the consumption tax cut and the fall in April was a natural response to the boost in sales during March, said an official at the association. "I'm afraid a recovery might be delayed until the latter part of this year," the official said.
