In what situations can Lithuania's armed forces be used? The document answers this question by saying that aggression by another state or military alliance, civil war in neighboring states or an armed conflict between them which might spread to Lithuania, an invasion by uncontrolled military units or other armed groupings, a large concentration of military force near the Lithuanian border, or international terrorism constitute such situations. True, Lithuania prefers primarily political and diplomatic methods to eliminate threats. The draft also points out that in strengthening its security Lithuania cooperates with other states and international organizations and bases itself on the universally recognized principles of international law. The army constitutes the basis of Lithuania's defense system. The section on cooperation with foreign states' military structures provides for participation in joint exercises, the training of joint peacekeeping subunits, and cooperation in guarding the state border.
