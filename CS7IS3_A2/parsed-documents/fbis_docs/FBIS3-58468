The first -- defended by those close to the prime minister -- is that "France has already sold a good half -- if not three quarters -- of the military equipment for which it could find a market in Taiwan. Just a few opportunities remained, helicopters, armored vehicles." The decision in favor of Beijing does not therefore mean the loss of future eldorados. In any event, the Taiwanese arms market is saturated for the next two years and a lot can happen at the diplomatic level in the meantime. It should also be remembered that Paris recently sold 60 Mirage 2000-5's and 1,500 missiles worth 30 billion francs [Fr] to Taipei. Plus 16 frigates worth Fr28 billion, the arms for which -- worth a further Fr10 billion -- were the subject of the final authorization from Paris for arms sales to Taipei, in October 1993. This authorization should not be in any doubt. The second interpretation is that Balladur has just pulled the rug out from under the French arms manufacturers such as the manufacturers of armored vehicles, Panhard or RVI [expansion not given], but above all the Matra missile manufacturer, which dreamed of equipping -- in addition to the Mirages -- the 150 U.S. aircraft also purchased by Taipei. There is great disappointment at Dassault. The aircraft manufacturer was hoping to be supplying a further batch of 60 Mirages in the long term. In addition, the France's support for Taiwan --while Beijing was arming Iran -- served to reassure other possible customers (Malaysia, Arab states). Finally, the contract for the 60 Mirages contains a cancelation clause "for technical reasons" valid for the first 18 aircraft, and this could now jeopardize the complete deal. News Greeted With Enthusiasm In the civil sector, French manufacturers are now rejoicing after having been denied their share of the Chinese economic boom for the past two years. The images of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl returning from Beijing in November with contracts worth Fr16 billion no doubt had a lot to do with the decision. Not a day has passed without the Matignon and ministers being besieged by industrialists, furious at not being able to profit along with their European competitors from China's economic boom. Last year, the Chinese gold mine brought orders for foreign firms worth nearly Fr600 billion! Since the signature of the final arms contracts with Taiwan, everything had been blocked: loss of the Canton underground railway market which GEC Alsthom had its eyes on and which went to the Germans, the blocking of contracts worth Fr2 billion for Alcatel CIT for telephone exchanges, and of the new nuclear power station at Daya-Bay which Framatome had hoped to win. In order to sell any aircraft, Airbus had to go through Deutsche Aerospace. Today it is celebrating: The 12 planes sold to Taiwan are nothing compared to the 35 now ordered by the Chinese and the 200 Airbuses they hope to sell by the year 2005. In all, according to the CNPF [National Council of French Employers], between Fr3 and 6 billion were lost in 1993 on major contracts in China. Which gives some idea of the enthusiasm with which French manufacturers greeted the news. "The Chinese market is far larger than the Taiwanese market," Alcatel Alsthom is pleased to report. Rather than shedding any tears over the nuclear power station and the Taiwan high-speed train, the group prefers to look to the future. As do the other French manufacturers who are counting on winning potential contracts worth tens of billions of francs in the automobile industry, railway equipment, environment, telecommunications, and buildings and public works sectors.
