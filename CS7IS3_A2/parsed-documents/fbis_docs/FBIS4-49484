However, the notice also stated that the media organizations may send different reporters. Our reporter interviewed on this matter a staff member of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch in charge of transmitting news-gathering applications to higher authorities. The person interviewed said: In the past, local reporters accepted invitations or sponsorships from mainland officials for gathering news in China on a voluntary basis and it was perfectly all right for them to decline the invitations. But this time, the problem is not just rejecting invitations, but also that they publicly "boycotted" the invitations and sent a signed statement to several departments of the Chinese Government. Under such circumstances, it would be very hard for the mainland authorities to give the green light to those who took part in the "boycott" to gather news wherever they want as if nothing had happened. Xi Yang was convicted according to law by the mainland judicial authorities for violation of the criminal law, which had absolutely nothing to do with normal news gathering in the mainland. It is inappropriate for some people to politicize what was obviously a legal issue, show no respect for facts or law, and "boycott" all kinds of news gathering in the mainland that they consider to be of a propaganda nature. The mainland Information Office made it clear that as you may "boycott" the invitations extended by some local authorities to gather news there, the local authorities can also reject your application for a news-gathering permit for the time being.
