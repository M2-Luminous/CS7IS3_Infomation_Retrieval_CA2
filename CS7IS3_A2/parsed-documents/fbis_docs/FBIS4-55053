What will you deal with in the ministry? [Sobotka] I do not know the specific scope of my powers yet. They are supposed to be defined at a joint session of the leadership of the ministry, after Minister Milczanowski returns to Warsaw -- that is, next week. I know from earlier decisions that my duties will include contacts with the parliament, legislation, and perhaps issues related to the budget of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW]. What else -- we will see. [Frydrychowicz] You are the first deputy minister of internal affairs appointed on the basis of the coalition's "system." I remember Minister Milczanowski saying that he would like to appoint a competent person to this post. You are not a lawyer; you never worked in the ministry. What, then, are your qualifications? [Sobotka] I was quite familiar with the ministry when I was a deputy -- it is my third term in office. I now, as well as previously, work in the Sejm Administration and on the Internal Affairs Committee. All the problems of MSW are focussed. I was also a member of the Political Advisory Committee of the minister of internal affairs. Important is also the fact that I served in the MSW Vistula Units. The problems that I will tackle at the ministry will not be of a strictly legal nature; my experience will certainly come in handy in the ministry. I suppose that this is what Minister Milczanowski took into consideration when he chose me as a candidate for the post of deputy minister. [Frydrychowicz] What will your tasks be in the ministry -- as a person sent there by the coalition, or, actually, by only one part of it? [Sobotka] I certainly have not come to MSW to watch over the ministry's head, which various people, unfavorably disposed toward me, have been trying to imply for some time. The scope of MSW activities is regulated by law. I will simply be one of Minister Milczanowski's deputies. Thus, I have not come to the ministry with special demands; I have come here to jointly steer it. The point is not to shape a separate policy of the ministry, but to participate in managing it and to bear joint responsibility for the fulfillment of tasks. [Frydrychowicz] Mass media stresses the fact that you were a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party [PZPR]. Will this experience be an obstacle for you in the fulfillment of the present function? [Sobotka] It will certainly not be an obstacle. There is nothing that I should be ashamed of in that period. The fact that in the final period of the functioning of PZPR I was a member of its leadership only enriched my experience in management. The fact that I participated in the work of the "round table," that is, in the activities that made it possible for Poles to reach agreement, is also quite significant. I suppose that I have often proved that I can quietly discuss the most difficult problems and resolve them. Therefore, I treat my experience gained in PZPR and later in its leadership as useful in my fulfillment of the present state functions. [passage omitted]
