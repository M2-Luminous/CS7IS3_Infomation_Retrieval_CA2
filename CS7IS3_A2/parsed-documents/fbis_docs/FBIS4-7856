[Sierszula] Why will this meeting be of an informal nature? [Klaus] I talked with Prime Minister Pawlak for only an hour, when President Clinton was visiting Prague. Now I remember that the informal meeting with former Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka was very successful, so I believe we should return to this tradition. [Sierszula] As a result of your activities, almost no one uses the expression Visegrad Group any longer, and, instead, the states of our region are called CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Agreement). However, do you think CEFTA is really functioning? [Klaus] CEFTA is operating to such a degree that its member states have been able to reach an agreement. What has been agreed on is functioning; however, one should think about whether we should go any further. Among other topics, this is what I would like to discuss with Prime Minister Pawlak. [Sierszula] Are you satisfied with the present state of relations between the Czech Republic and its neighbors, such as Poland and Germany? [Klaus] The relations are what they are. They result from the relations in the "micro" platform, from everyday contacts among various enterprises, companies, establishments, and people of culture. What is being done by the governments, prime ministers, presidents is only the tip of the iceberg, which is not the most important thing. Politicians should try to build up the contacts among states. Incidentally, I do not get the impression that these "microcontacts," which are said to be of paramount importance, between the Czech Republic and Poland, Germany, Austria, and Slovakia, are bad. [Sierszula] What do you think is currently the greatest problem in Polish-Czech relations? [Klaus] I do not think there are any fundamental, urgent problems that would call for an SOS meeting. I think our relations are developing normally. We are interested in building them up further. Sometimes they make our lives a little complicated, and the atmosphere is marred by various attempts to outrun each other in the race for NATO or the European Union. We should try to avoid this.
