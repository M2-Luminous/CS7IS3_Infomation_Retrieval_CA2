FR940630-0-00100 FR940630-0-00036 Revision to NOFA and Bonus Points Provision The Department received many comments on the proposal in the October 8, 1993 rule to provide in a notice of funding availability (NOFA) for the award of bonus points to applicants who have past experience and achievements in providing economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons. A few commenters stated that the award of bonus points for applicants who have successfully complied with section 3 was a good idea, but that the rule should place a limit on the number of points to be awarded to avoid abuse. Other commenters stated that bonus points should be awarded for past performance only if the applicant's current proposal, submitted in response to the NOFA, demonstrates a commitment to undertake section 3 efforts consistent with past performance. Two commenters stated that bonus points should be awarded on the basis of efforts made, and not results achieved, because many recipients make good faith efforts without achieving significant results. Three commenters stated that the proposal favored large housing authorities (over small housing authorities) that have active resident management corporations and resident councils. The commenters stated that as a result of these active resident groups, large housing authorities would more often be eligible for the bonus points and edge out small housing authorities for awards made under a NOFA. Six commenters stated that the bonus points proposal was inappropriate, and should be removed because it is unrelated to funding need, and further stated that it would be difficult for the Department to verify ``claimed'' past success under section 3. In response to these comments, the Department revised this regulatory section. Section 135.9 of the interim rule, which addresses this issue, provides the following. First, for competitively awarded assistance in which the grants are for activities administered by an HA, and those activities as described in the NOFA are anticipated by the Department to generate significant training, employment or contracting opportunities, the NOFA must include a statement that one of the purposes of the assistance is to give, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, job training, employment, contracting, and other economic opportunities generated from the expenditure of this assistance to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns. Second, this same statement must be included in NOFAs for competitively awarded assistance involving housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction, where the amount of the award to the applicant is anticipated to exceed $200,000. Third, this section provides that in the evaluation of applications for the award of assistance under the NOFAs discussed above, consideration will be given to the extent to which the applicant demonstrates that it will train and employ section 3 residents and contract with section 3 business concerns for economic opportunities generated in connection with the project/activity assisted. The evaluation criteria to be utilized and the rating points to be assigned will be specified in the NOFA. Absence of Listing of Existing Federal, State, and Local Laws and Regulations That Are Inconsistent or in Conflict With Section 3 Several commenters raised questions about the statutory requirement that implementation of section 3 (i.e., compliance with the preference requirements) must be consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with section 3. A few of the commenters requested that the rule provide a list of all existing laws and regulations that are inconsistent with section 3. Other commenters stated that the rule should expressly provide for the preemption of other laws that are inconsistent with section 3. Another commenter asked that the rule clarify who will make the determination of whether there is a conflict between section 3 and an existing Federal, State or local law. As discussed in this section, the Department does not agree that there is a need for a list of other laws and regulations inconsistent with section 3, or that there is a need to expressly preempt inconsistent laws.
