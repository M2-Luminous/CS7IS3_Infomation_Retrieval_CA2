Kuchin report; from the "Pacific Ocean" program] [Excerpts] Kamchatka mass media reported that the Far East Maritime Steamship Company had stopped allocating vessels for transporting containers to Kamchatka, and that Vladivostok had decided not to renew business relations with Kamchatka in the area of petroleum products delivery. Things have gone so far that Kamchatka cargoes are now being sold in the Maritime Kray to pay for debts incurred, without regard for who in Kamchatka owns it. This correspondent asked Kamchatka Oblast Governor Vladimir Afanasyevich Biryukov to comment on these reports. He said that as far as Kamchatka and probably other northern territories were concerned, such an imperious policy toward the outlying regions still dominated certain circles of the Maritime Kray. Vladivostok exploits its geographical location and its transportation links with the center of Russia, and it no longer considers the needs of these northern regions. This especially applies to the fuel and energy resources meant for Kamchatka. [passage omitted] However, it is only proper to note that talks with the Maritime Kray over the last few weeks give some hope that such events will not be repeated. The Far East Maritime Steamship Company is reluctantly allocating ships for the Vladivostok-Petropavlovsk route, but as for passenger routes, no one even mentions them; it is as if they have never existed. [passage omitted] The Maritime Kray shipowners find it more profitable to work with Bangkok, Manila, Singapore, and Pusan than with Russia's northern ports. [passage omitted] Vladimir Afanasyevich Biryukov added that the administration is continuing its talks with foreign partners on delivering petroleum products, some of which, sadly, are cheaper than Russian ones. [passage omitted] As for marine transportation links, let me add that those Kamchatka residents who decided to leave the peninsula for good have become hostages. The number of these people increases daily; no matter who you ask, they want to leave Kamchatka. Delays in the payment of salaries, stoppages of enterprises, high prices, unemployment, a high crime rate, and unbearable climatic conditions augmented by freezing apartments and the lack of hot, and often even cold, water forces people to make such sad decisions.
