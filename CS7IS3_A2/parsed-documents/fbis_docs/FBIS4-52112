"It is imcomprehensible that the ministry has prepared little for the implementation of the new law on farm produce distribution and price stabilization and thereby allowed a room for the recent farm goods market disturbance despite the lapse of more than a year since the legislation of the law," Kim said. The instructions were given at a meeting of senior presidential secretaries at Chongwadae. Chongwadae Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said the president stated it was not right for the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry to try to make up shortcomings of a law with an implementation decree. "If you had found shortcomings in a new law, the administration should have taken a lawful measure to rectify it in consulation, if necessary, with the ruling party," President Kim was quoted as saying. Earlier in the week, farm goods market brokers staged a two-day strike to paralyze major agricultural markets in protest against the new law which they claimed would undermine their interests.
