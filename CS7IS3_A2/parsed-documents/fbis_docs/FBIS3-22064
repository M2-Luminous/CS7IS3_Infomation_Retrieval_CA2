Boumaza: "Drugs: The `Kenna' Connection"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] [Text] A small Medellin will grow up provided God grants it life. The twists and turns that lead to the route that kif [North African variety of cannabis] takes, because, let's face it, there is a route, and speaking only of kif, that light but oh so dangerous "zatla," is obviously hard to track. This illegal product, illegal because it is extremely deadly, has ruined and is still ruining many people: those who use it and rich men or sharks whose teeth are growing increasingly longer and sharper. Guelma--In Guelma, as in all of Algeria's cities, drugs slip insidiously into circles of innocent youth; drugs "produce" lifeless bodies sapped of energy and, abetted by a drug habit, these will be lost forever. Do you need to be clever to know that the item in question, this curse, that all of our evils in this area come from the west, from Morocco, to be precise? This is unquestionably true, some would tell us, though now, once you are "trapped," you can no longer escape and you go to get some in that neighboring country, as, for example, the young Guelma resident did who went by taxi from Oran to look for 50 kg of kif and will be sentenced to three years in jail. Besides, we have learned from a well-informed source that among the numerous routes drugs take, these come from Oujda to Tlemcen, where they are distributed on the south side of the Atlas [Mountains], to south of the Sahara, and even in Libya. The "quota" coming from Oujda to Oran is sold in the northern part of the country, in Tunisia, and even goes to Italy. However, experts familiar with this milieu have told us of a network (a fairly complex one) that extends its tentacles through certain cities in the eastern part of the country, among others. In fact, Morocco is no longer cited but rather at least two villages, the first not far from Annaba, the second not far from Skikda, where the Indian hemp or poppy reportedly blows in the wind. We have also heard it said that the cultivation of this accursed plant is making life enjoyable for certain madmen quite close to Guelma, somewhere in the mountains that surround the town. This plant is said to have two different leaves, one being "chahba" or red, supposedly "female" and said to produce good kif, the other "kahla" or black, the male leaf. To make a drug out of it, the recipe is a simple one: once dried, the leaves are reduced to a powder; using tea (a liquid), you mix the powder in it to make a paste, which when pressure is applied to it using an iron, becomes hard. Then, with the steam from a couscous pot making it malleable as desired, it is cut into small portions to be sold. In the town of Guelma, several "wholesalers" of the stuff are running wild. Dealers, whose ages range from 16 to 26, take care of the retail trade. Each neighborhood has one or several suppliers of "zatla," "kemia," or "kenna" ("the sister-in-law"). According to what the buyer has in his pocket, there are differently priced lumps: 50, 100, 200 Algerian dinars, etc. Selling drugs in a cafe is not a business, we were told, it is selling your skin one day or the next. So sales are made in secret, anywhere at all, wherever you meet people; all you need to do is know one of the people involved to make contact with one of them. In any event, when night falls, several street corners and small squares become places where drugs are smoked, there are "mahchachas" which, in addition to a "joint" or a "sheikh" or a "kenna" are supplemented with wine, "rai," or "chaabi." Even in this rotten world, you cannot escape hoaxes, which then become the height of the ridiculous. Indeed, there is also ersatz "zatla," which is made with gum benzoin (jaoui), among other things. It is reduced to a power and mixed with tea, which produces, so you could make the mistake, a paste that is absolutely similar to the "sheet" of kif; it is only when you burn it that you discover the hoax. As for tranquilizers, the list of which is a long one, they are also good if they are not taken in private, neat; using medicinal herbs, whose names and usefulness God only knows, you make a "good drug" to fight off the dreariness of the days, of reality. There are tranquilizers and other psychotropic drugs called "6-15," "Nivatran," "Diazi," ``Nitrazipan," "Temesta," etc. So while our elders squabble over just achieving a supreme "high," young people "beat it," not in Babor Australia but in hell. Besides, the guides who take you there are no less numerous or intelligent. Chemists with worldwide reputations may be small-time handymen compared with these sorcerers who come up with many well-stuffed, diabolical "recipes." To see what this is like, let us quote some of them. They are not to be manufactured, of course. You take two or three medicines, such as Upsa 500, PH8, Diazipan, etc., which you pulverize, that you then mix with another one in the form of a syrup, Neo-codion, for example, preferably a mentholated syrup. Next, you put all of this into a small bag, which you compress using an iron. That is enough to come close to suicide or carry it out. It is a recipe that does not cost more than 100 Algerian dinars but is sold for between five to six times as much. Here is another method: some "henne" from Ghardaia because it is not flavored, together with honey, tea, or caramelized sugar. Once again this is ersatz "zatla."
