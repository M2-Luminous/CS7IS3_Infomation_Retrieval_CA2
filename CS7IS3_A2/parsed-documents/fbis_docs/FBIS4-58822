The party stressed that cooperation with the Zionist enemy "accelerates the collapse of the Arab bond and the common Arab concepts of security, economy, politics, and even culture and history." It warned that the Arabs will pay for this policy, as their dignity, rights, independence, economy, and identity will be violently crushed and confiscated by an enemy wearing the cloak of a cooperative friend. In a statement, Hizballah viewed the participation of an official Zionist delegation at a water conference in Oman as a move within the context of the Arab regimes' failure to take a position concerning the boycott of Israel. The statement said: "Showing readiness for cooperation with the Zionist enemy while it perpetrates the most horrible crimes against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples only encourages this enemy to continue its aggression and exonerates it for its heinous crimes. Oman's step is one of the wrong and fatal steps that some Arab regimes, urged and encouraged by the United States, began to take to bypass the facts and diktats of the historical conflict with the Zionists, to remove the evidence of the crime, and to open the region's doors to an onslaught of normalization that will subject all the region's capabilities to American and Zionist tutelage and domination.
