It is therefore not clear whether the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks will be held on 21 March as scheduled. Vice Foreign Minister Hong said: If the talks are not held as scheduled, the North Korean nuclear issue cannot but return to the starting point. Considering this, the government has continued to discuss the presentation of the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council with friendly countries, such as the United States.
