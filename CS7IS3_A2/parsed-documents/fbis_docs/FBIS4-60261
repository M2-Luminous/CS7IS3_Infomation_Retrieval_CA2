That is, all the political and social forces of the country have been consulted and have been associated with this effort aimed at setting up transitional institutions to reach a national consensus on the resumption of the electoral process of course, and to build the new Algerian society. I do not think it is appropriate to speak of government versus opposition. I think this concept is completely false. There is a state and a government that are trying to organize, to the best of their ability, the transitional period, and a political elite that has its own interpretations, something that is normal in a democratic regime. The aim is to achieve this consensus around the key points included in the transitional platform, which should guarantee the continuity of the Algerian state, the continuity of the republican order, the defense of individual rights and freedom, as well as respect for the elements constituting our national character and the rejection of violence as a means of obtaining power and keeping it. The democratic process has never been interrupted in Algeria. This is in fact why we can still see parties pursuing their activities freely. The press is also free. We should not forget that not long ago in Europe, these problems of transition were experienced by at least two countries. In Spain, the Moncloa Pact had to be signed to manage the transition toward a multiparty system and the emergence of a republican state. In Portugal, it took no fewer than four transitional governments, if I remember correctly, to form a constitutional government. The issue here is the transition from a system of partisan democracy to a democratic multyparty system. [Bouziane] Minister, how do you assess the relationship between Algeria and France? [Dembri] Good on the whole. We are pleased at this moment to see that there is a great understanding of the Algerian situation on the part of French political circles. Some worst-case scenarios are entertained by some editorials of the French press, but on the whole, it is obvious that putting the problems of Algeria within the Mediterranean framework at the moment is, beyond the confines of any relationship, good for joint development. This joint development will force us to look at the problems of the future in terms of solutions that we should find together to everything that concerns the economy and movement of persons and property, etc. [Bouziane] At the diplomatic level, Minister, we have recently noticed Algerian diplomatic activity particularly concerning Mali, with the signing of the National Pact, and Niger. What is the future of a settlement of the Tuareg problem in these two countries? [Dembri] Listen, we are doing what a neighboring country should do: aspiring to build a prosperous community. At the two levels of cooperation and security, we have built a Sahelian-Saharan community, which we hope to see integrated and homogenous. [Bouziane] Does this mean that Algeria will soon organize direct negotiations between the Niger Government and the Niger Tuaregs? [Dembri] This does not matter. There are three mediators in this conflict. There is the Burkinabe mediator, the French mediator, and the Algerian mediator. The meetings -- and a few of these will be held -- should take place on a rotational basis in the different countries involved. A meeting has already been held in Ouagadougou. Our mediators recently met the two parties to these negotiations. A meeting is secheduled to take place in Paris, I suppose, on 15 June, and we will try of course to contribute positively, as always, because we have to guarantee peace, security, and development in all this Sahelian-Saharan region.
