President of the Higher State Council [HCE], Chairman of the national conference, sisters and brothers. The multifold crisis that our country is currently experiencing is the result of the bankruptcy of the management, the political management of the country during the last decade. The violation of the basic rules of political management, whether consciously or unconsciously, for a long time has led to the deterioration of the state and its apparatus. For over a decade, improvisation, demagoguery, and manipulation have become part of the system of government. Moreover, the economic, social, and cultural reform process, which the country went through during the sixties and seventies, despite some setbacks, and which was an important gain for our people, has gradually become a subject of retraction through illogical and irresponsible acts and behavior. The weakening, unsettlement, and deterioration of government have led to its retreat and return to political, economic, social, and cultural backwardness, as well as to the widespread absence of security. The security situation that was prevalent on the eve of the declaration of the state of emergency in most of the provinces, particularly in the great residential complexes, was a source of concern for various reasons. The public security was threatened alongside the deterioration of the public authorities' capabilities and the prevalence of chaos and confusion in all sectors. Faced by this rapid deterioration of the political, social, and security atmosphere, the national forces -- aware of the fatal danger that was lurking over Algeria -- decided to halt this destructive process and declared a state of emergency. Despite the noticeable progress as a result of declaring a state of emergency to restore law and order, the forces of evil have not stopped. They have committed terrorist, barbaric, and destructive crimes, some of which I recall: the assassination of the government's representatives, war veterans and martyrs' sons; the assassination of ordinary citizens, men, women, mothers, children, young and elderly; the assassination of foreign nationals who came to our country to contribute to the economy of the country; the plundering and sabotage acts against financial institutes, post offices, and public and private enterprises; the daily robbing and stripping citizens of their money; sabotaging collective complexes; and setting fire and destroying administrative and economic public enterprises. These savage actions are being carried out by people who claim to be religious and use religion as a political means. They are being carried out by a small band of perverts and persons who have judicial records, who harbor hatred -- the enemies of the homeland -- whose hearts are still pained to see Algeria independent, and who act as if they are on enemy soil. They are receiving support from certain countries which are living under oppressive and backward regimes and do not conceal their intention to spread this type of regime to Algeria. To foil this subversive process, the public authorities carried out a series of actions to protect individuals and property and to put an end to this disease at its roots. The security forces, the state cadres, and the local communities -- and here we should not forget to stress their great sacrifices and their devotion, as well as their altruism in serving the country's sublime interests -- have implemented practical security measures to protect individuals and their property. These are particularly manifested in the following: undertaking the protection of installations of public economic establishments and public administrative departments; the protection of foreign missions, foreign establishments, and foreign employees who are present on the national soil; the protection of individuals, establishments, and public and private bodies; the consolidation of the local public security; and searching and putting an end to the perpetrators of criminal acts. The fact that some political forces have not condemned the subversion of the economic, social, and cultural institutions that independent Algeria has achieved at an exorbitant price and through great sacrifices, is regarded as an act of treachery, which the next generation will not forgive. History will judge all those who kept silent: Their silence is shameful. They kept silent while repugnant crimes were being committed against national assets and innocent citizens, namely state employees, the mojahedin, and the foreigners who came here to participate in the development of Algeria. Irrespective of the political differences between us, the people's gains assume the quality of sacredness and should not be at the center of political dealings and point scoring. In the light of these events it appears necessary and inevitable that the state should retrieve its self-respect and authority. As a matter of fact we cannot build democracy without a strong state based on stable structures which guarantee the continuity of the state and protect it from politically irresponsible by-ways and deviations. Proceeding from this [passage indistinct] which adopts scientific and rational methods which works in the interest of the citizens, and undertake their tasks in the best way possible. This is a condition for the continuity of the Algerian state. The planned reform aims at the following: a better balance between objectives; centralization or decentralization; greater protection for officials from oppression; consolidation of oversight by the state to avoid discrepancies in local management with regard to the laws and procedures which are in force by reviving the supervision bodies at all levels; in consultation with local representatives reviewing where necessary the administrative division of the municipalities and districts in an effort to give more effectiveness and a better response to citizens' needs; consolidation of organization and improvement of the financial management of local communities to achieve a better management of financial resources. The weakening of [words indistinct] of the state, capable of undertaking the major public tasks, and the absence of objective legalized standards and of a just and rational standard concerning the assumption of very senior posts have led to the emergence of nepotism, of favoritism based on region, and especially of building up an entourage, which led to loyalty to the state being replaced by loyalty to men. This led to evident instability in the very senior posts, thus obstructing the continuity of the state and its institutions. The current reform, which basically depends on restoring self-respect to the administration, aims at creating a total and immediate ban on nepotism, whether based on personal relationship or regionalism, and of the use of entourage. In conclusion, it should be said that the modern state which we want to build requires efficiency, ethics, and tireless work as we have to raise the challenge anew so that we will not remain isolated from the march of civilized progress. Our country still possesses human and material capabilities which allow it to build a modern and strong state -- a law-governed state -- which will move the wheel of political development forward and facilitate entry into a real democracy and an economic, social, and cultural development within the framework of a free and organized economy. It is time for all national forces in the country to unite our efforts to contribute to the work started by the public authorities to put an end to terrorism and establish law and order, and to contribute also in building a strong state guaranteeing success in the march toward political democracy and economic revival which will promote the prosperity of Algeria and make it a country where life is enjoyable -- an Algeria whose voice will be heard and respected by other nations. Through our unity and by placing Algeria above every consideration, we will overcome all obstacles and triumph -- God willing -- over anyone who diverts us from our path. May God bring us success for the good of our country. Peace and God's mercy and blessing be upon you. [applause]
