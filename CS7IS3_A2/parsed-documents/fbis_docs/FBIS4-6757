Habibie, Indonesian state minister for research and technology, by BUSINESS TIMES correspondent Yang Razali Kassim in Jakarta; -- date not given] [Text] BT [BUSINESS TIMES]: Your close relationship with President Suharto is no secret. Has he ever discussed with you privately the future of the Indonesian leadership and the question of succession? DR HABIBIE: No. Because President Suharto has always said that he doesn't want to groom a putra mahkota (crown prince). He knows exactly the mechanism and the rules of the game of Pancasila democracy. He always says it is the privilege of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to first decide and discuss, to express the vision of the nation and, based on that, elect one of the people of the Republic of Indonesia who can meet the requirements to be given the mandate to implement the vision of the nation. Q: There is a view that it is critical for Indonesia, during this transition, to settle the question of succession. Pak Harto [Mr. Suharto], having served very long and having done what is perceived as a good job, needs to have clear successor to sustain the good work. A: You are right that Pak Harto is very, very credible, based on the fact that he has been always at the forefront for the last 27 years -- 32 years, if he finishes his present term as President and Mandatory. Based on his performance, theoretically and practically, he is the most credible man. In the interest of the nation, we have to listen to his opinion because he is a national as well as an international leader. Now, because of that, if you ask me who will decide the successor to Mr Suharto, the answer is clear: the elected representatives of the people of the Republic of Indonesia who sit in the People's Consultative Assembly in 1998. They have to do the job. Q: In the event that Pak Harto decides to retire halfway through his term, what do you think will happen to the presidency? A: Knowing Pak Harto, and having assisted him the last 20 years, knowing his performance and his character, and his leadership, I know he will never stop something before his term ends. Never. Pak Harto is a pejuang, a fighter. He has said: "I'm born and I grow up as a fighter. My mentality is this: as long as the people, my beloved people of the Republic of Indonesia ask me to do a job. in what condition ever I will be, I will accept the instruction and the will of the people to implement the job, in whatever condition." So that's why there is no reason for him to stop halfway, unless it is the will of Allah. Q: And what if Allah wills that the President stop during his term? A: Then, according to the Undang-Undang Dasar (Constitution), the Vice-President will take over. I'm sure the whole Cabinet and the whole armed forces and all the political parties will take care that this nation will keep its unity and keep the nation going, until the election comes. Q: There is an impression that you are being prepared to be a future president. What is your reaction to this? A: The first question is: prepared by whom? Q: By President Suharto?/ A: No, Pak Harto is one vote. You should understand the mechanism of our democracy. I give that comment not as a politician but as a man who has survived among the politicians and because I am trying to understand the truth about politics. I have become a philosopher (laughter), because I am older now. Q: Are you ready to be the next Mandatory (President)? A: Me? That question may be put equally to anybody. Are you ready? Anybody must be ready. But the question is: what will be the result of the musyawarah mufakat (consultation and consensus) of the People's Consultative Assembly then? Because they are the only ones who have been elected by the people to talk, to elect on behalf of the people, a man to become the Mandatory of this nation. I don't know. But this question is for anybody in the Republic. Q: Whose advice do you listen to most? A: I receive much advice but I have to decide for myself. I was already warned by Mr Suharto in 1974. He told me: "You should be aware that one day you will know so many people, but you are alone." He warned me: "You have to watch." At that time, I did not understand. I believe that if you are the leader of a nation, you must be the leader also of those people who don't like you. If you are a leader only for the people who like you, then you are only a leader among friends. Now I understand Suharto. Before the election for the Vice-Presidency in 1993, I was interviewed by TEMPO magazine. I told TEMPO that my master was Professor Suharto. Because I learned from him. After that I met President Suharto and said: "I apologise for calling you my professor, my teacher, my guru." Pak Harto told me: "I am not your guru. I, Suharto, am the helper of your guru. Your guru is your own mind." Then he told me: "According to Javanese philosophy, knowing you because I have been watching you, your bathin (spirit) is very strong." I think not. But he told me so. Q: If you were given the chance to be President, would you continue the economic reform policies that have made Indonesia successful in turning around the once-battered economy to become what it is now? A: The answer is that anybody who will be elected later to become the successor has to continue the policy of national development growth. Anybody. The elected representatives of the People's Assembly will take care -- must take care -- that the national development growth is sustained. It's the only way to bring the nation to the same level as the advanced economies. Q: So if it were you, you would continue the economic reforms? A: Not (just) me, I say anybody. I don't want to be the reference point. Anybody must do that. And the whole system in Indonesia is built around it. Q: Why do we continue to hear domestic criticism of the aerospace industry and of your approach to economic development, or what is called "Habibienomics"? A: Such criticism comes from people who have mixed feelings and political interests. I give you an example. Our CN235 [aircraft] hit a mountain two years ago. At that time, there was a lot of speculation that I was to be the next vice-president. As it happened, it went on for almost three months -- people were criticising me daily. Daily. Saying bad things and so on. But later, when the black box came out, everything proved that I was right. I told them that it was human error. There was even an article from a lady, a professor in Bandung, who wrote an analysis that Habibie was a man against human rights, the rights of women. Terrible. All so emotional. Everybody. And now, what happened? Look at the Superpuma [helicopter] accident in Malaysia. Look, at the reactions of the Malaysian Defence Minister, the air force commander, the prime minister and the mass media -- all very fair. They did not criticise as the Indonesians did. You know why? Because the Malaysians were more objective and were not politically involved. All those reactions here (in Indonesia) were politically engineered to portray the bad idea that maybe Habibie was ambitious and wanted to become vice-president and so on. There were a lot of people who don't like that scenario. Q: Political engineering? A: I think so. In this case, political engineering -- making use of the fact that our society is heterogeneous. By the way, the majority of the people in the Republic of Indonesia, 99 per cent, are really not involved in political engineering for self (-serving) purposes. Why do I say so? Because daily, I get a lot of compliments from people. Q: What does President Suharto say about these criticisms against you? A: You know what he told me? He told me: "Don't listen to them. If you listen to crazy people and you get crazy, it's your own mistake." You can quote this. "You just do what you think is the best for your people, for your country. Then you can face God because you have done it to the best of your ability." That's the advice from President Suharto. Q: What is "Habibienomics"? A: There is no Habibienomics, there's no Wijoyonomics (after Professor Wijoyo Nitisastro, who played a major part in early Indonesian pro-market economic policy). But if there is such a thing as Habibienomics, it is because there was Wijoyonomics. In the first 25 years, we were not in a position yet to take care of human resource development. So, what I'm doing now is only possible because my colleague, Pak Wijoyo, has done it (his job of laying the basis for economic growth). And don't forget that Pak Wijoyo was active in the Cabinet in the first three five-year plans -- Repelita 1, 2 and 3. Okay? And Habibie has been active in the Cabinet since the second Repelita till now -- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that means whatever he has done. I was a part of the team. I was already doing it. There's only one difference: I am 10 years, maybe 12 years, younger. So nobody can say: "Habibie has done nothing in the 25 years." I was active. I was responsible for what has been done. I was lucky. I was then 37. So now, at 57, I have the experience of four Repelitas. So, it is wrong to say that Habibie was excluded, not involved in the decisionmaking of the last 25 years. It's not true that only Prof Wijoyo was involved. Q: Why then is Habibienomics made an issue by your critics? A: Political engineering -- to create political issues; sensationalism, misinformation, distortion of information, whatever. But I see no problem. If there is a "nomics", then I would say it's a Suhartonomics, or "Mandatory-nomics". Because he is the one who started it -- from Repelita 1 to now, Repelita 6. What I'm doing today is a part of the evolution of national development of Indonesia. Q: Some outside Indonesia, including in Singapore, wonder whether you are a nationalist and therefore more protectionist, not supportive of economic reforms? A: Oh yes, I will find that not only in Singapore, but here in Indonesia too (laughter). Because they want me to open up everything so that everybody can sell and kill my airplane manufacture. I said no.
