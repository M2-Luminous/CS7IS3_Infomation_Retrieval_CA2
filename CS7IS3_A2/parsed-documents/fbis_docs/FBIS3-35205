The conflict among the United States, Europe, and Russia over the ultimatum to the Serbs has overshadowed many political developments. While Europe continues to have doubts on the implementation of the recent NATO threats against the Serbs, Russia's protest against the ultimatum to the Serbs has given Europeans a good chance to avoid their humanitarian and political responsibility to deal with the Serbs' crimes. The Russian deputy foreign minister has said that his country will do its best at the United Nations to prevent action on this threat, adding that Russia's goal is to be sure that this threat will never be implemented and that an attack will never take place. On the same topic, Russian President Boris Yeltsin has sent a letter to the heads of the five Western countries warning of the dangers that an air strike on the Serbs in Bosnia would entail and said that this would lead to unforeseeable consequences. Meanwhile, in a fresh attempt, Russia has proposed an international peace conference for Bosnia next week and has informed the heads of the Western countries of this. However, this proposal has been rejected by Washington and a U.S. State Department spokesman said that lengthy preparations would be necessary for that. At any rate, the recent developments in the Bosnian crisis and its international consequences show that, basically speaking, Western and Eastern Europe are very vulnerable in this crisis and that failures in finding a fundamental solution to this crisis has posed difficult problems for the behind the scenes efforts in the crisis. The West is facing a great crisis of values and humanitarianism; and pressures from domestic and international public opinion are constantly increasing. Meanwhile, Russia, which heretofore influenced the developments in the Bosnian crisis by backing the Serbs of Bosnia and Serbia, has taken an active role now that there is a possibility of NATO intervention against the Serbs and is trying to create a security umbrella there vis-a-vis the West reminiscent of the Warsaw Pact. Otherwise, no one takes the NATO threat seriously; not because NATO is not taking any steps against the Serbs, but because any possible moves by NATO will not tip the scales in Bosnia in favor of the Muslims. Meanwhile, what is causing concern here is that many Western countries are favoring a military step, or at least a military threat, so as to decrease the pressures on them by domestic public opinion and worldwide Islam and to increase pressure on the Bosnian Muslims to accept a compromise and agree to the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The world of Islam should not be influenced by the political and propaganda commotion and forget its responsibility vis-a-vis Bosnia.
