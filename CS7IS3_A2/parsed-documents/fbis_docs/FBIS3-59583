This experiment, which has been strongly criticized by environmentalists, involved turning off the cooling water supply to a small portion of the Phebus research reactor, thus for the first time simulating a "maximum credible accident" (MCA) in a nuclear power station. The fuel in the 80- cemtimeter long and 12-cm thick tube was heated to the point where it began to melt. The scientists compared their experiment with the accident in which the Three Mile Island nuclear power station in Harrisburg narrowly escaped a catastrophe in 1979. This time, however, the faulty portion was 5,000 times smaller than in a conventional power station, and the surrounding reactor continued operating quite normally. The researchers at the French Institute of Nuclear Safety and Protection (ISPN), who had overall responsibility for the planning of this international project, are convinced that they would have been able to stop the experiment at any time in an emergency. However, German engineer Peter von der Hardt, the European Union's representative in Cadarache, maintains that safety precautions were so strict that no radioactive material could have escaped in any circumstances. The Phebus experiment began on schedule shortly after 1000 on Thursday morning with the preheating of the reactor. The whole procedure was transmitted live to the nearby press center, where scientists gave a commentary. A screen showed how the surroundings of a core immersed in a water tank began to glow blue -- the sign of radioactive radiation being generated in the reactor. While the major portion remained at the normal operating temperature of several hundred degrees Celsius, the lack of cooling in the actual inner test core ensured that its temperature continued to rise slowly. After one hour and a half, at 800 degrees Celsius, the fuel rods began to crack inside. Another two hours later, the housing was so hot that it reacted chemically with its surroundings, with the result that the temperature of the test object rose sharply from 1,400 to 2,200 degrees in the space of a few minutes. A measuring tube inside it burst, and the gas collection tank radioactivity meter registered the first fission products, thus ringing in the hot phase. In the subsequent hour, the temperature approached the fuel melting point. At 1500, sufficient molten fuel had accumulated, and the experiment was brought to an end. Von der Hardt confirmed, however, that it was not yet known for sure whether the results of the MCA experiment were applicable to existing nuclear power stations.
