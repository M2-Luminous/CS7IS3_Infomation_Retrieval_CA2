FR940513-0-00160 FR940513-0-00034 The Commission agrees that a statement such as the one suggested by NEMA and the other commentors would be helpful to the enforcement efforts of both the U.S. Customs Service and the Commission. Today's amendments, therefore, require that the following disclosure appear conspicuously at least once on the outer surface of all cartons in which lamp products covered by the Rule are shipped domestically or imported: ``These lamps comply with Federal energy efficiency labeling requirements.'' See ยง305.11(e)(4) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. G. Substantiation of Disclosures In the NPR, the Commission proposed requiring that manufacturers follow procedures to be specified in the final labeling rules to substantiate all required disclosures. It also proposed requiring that manufacturers comply with specific sampling procedures in selecting the product samples for the required substantiation testing. The substantiation and sampling procedure requirements are connected. The substantiation requirement is directed at ensuring that the disclosures are accurate and based on uniform standards. The sampling procedure requirement is directed at ensuring that the samples tested are representative of the product being produced. For other products, the Rule requires that substantiation of energy efficiency ratings (and water usage rates) be based on the test procedures specified by EPCA or DOE. 246 For those products, ยง305.6 of the Rule specifies that the sampling procedures adopted in the DOE test procedures must be used in selecting the product specimens to be tested. 247 246 16 CFR 305.5. The DOE test procedures for products already covered by the Rule are found at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B. 247 16 CFR 305.6. The DOE sampling procedures for products already covered by the Rule are found in 10 CFR 430, subpart B. EPCA, as amended by EPA 92, requires DOE to issue test procedures to determine certain performance characteristics relating to the energy efficiency standards specified in EPCA for general service fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps, taking into consideration the applicable IES or ANSI standards. 42 U.S.C.A. 6293(b)(6) (West Supp. 1993). EPCA authorizes, but does not require, DOE to issue test procedures for nonreflector general service incandescent lamps and medium screw base integrally ballasted compact fluorescent lamps. 42 U.S.C. 6293(b)(1)(B) (West Supp. 1993). The Commission sought comments in the NPR regarding what test procedures would be acceptable to substantiate the required labeling disclosures, and what sampling procedures should be followed in selecting the lamps to be tested. The Commission stated that, when DOE issues testing and sampling procedures for any of the lamp products covered by the lamp labeling rules, the Commission would consider whether to adopt the DOE testing and sampling procedures as the necessary substantiation for the required labeling disclosures. DOE has not yet issued testing or sampling procedures for any of the lamp products covered by the labeling rules the Commission adopts today.
