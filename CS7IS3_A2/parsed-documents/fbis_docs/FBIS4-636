This is because no matter which political party is in power at any given time, no meaningful development can take place in any country which is divided against itself. Shaykh Amartey made this observation at a rally of the Egle Party at Bawku in the Upper East Region. He drew the attention of the politicians and journalists to the fact that the more they fan national disunity the more they retard the nation's development. Shaykh Amartey announced that the National Electoral Commission has given approval to the party to change its name from Egle to the Eagle Party. He said the Eagle stands for Every Accountable Ghanaian Living Everywhere. [passage omitted]
