Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of State and top U.S. representative to contacts with North Korea, flew into Seoul on Sunday and met with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and other South Korean working-level officials. Hubbard accompanied Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on a leg of his Asian trip and flew in separately to Seoul to consult on the nuclear issue, Ministry officials said. He leaves for Washington on Monday afternoon. Pyongyang-IAEA negotiations on resuming inspections are dragging on beyond expectations and the two sides are likely to meet again sometime soon. If these talks go well and Pyongyang reopens inter-Korean dialogue, the United States is expected to hold high-level talks with North Korea for comprehensive discussions, including relations improvement.
