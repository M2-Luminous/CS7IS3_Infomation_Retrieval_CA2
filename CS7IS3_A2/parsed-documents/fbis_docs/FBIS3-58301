A short while ago Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou concluded his news conference following the end of the first day of the NATO summit. The 16 NATO leaders will shortly begin the traditional working dinner during which they will discuss details of vital problems. The prime minister said that during this dinner he plans to raise both the issue of Skopje and that of Cyprus. When asked if the issue of Cyprus was raised during the summit meeting thus far, since we had a proposal by Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis regarding demilitarization of Cyprus, Prime Minister Papandreou said that it was neither the appropriate time nor the proper climate to raise the issue at that time. Prime Minister Papandreou said that he will raise the Cyprus issue during the dinner that will begin shortly. It is also certain that during the dinner there will be a discussion of the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. Responding to a question during the news conference on whether Greece's views are different from those of the United States regarding the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, Prime Minister Papandreou said that it is an issue that is subject to interpretation. He also said that there is no plan for military intervention but there is a warning message to the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs that the time limit has expired and that this tragic game must end. The prime minister repeated that military intervention would be a dangerous adventure and questioned what would happen to the peacekeeping forces that are already stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The prime minister said that every opportunity will be given to the opposing factions to avoid military intervention and added that even the issue of a gradual lifting of sanctions imposed should be added to this difficult dialogue among the involved parties. At this point, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias intervened and added that sanctions should be lifted to help the peacemaking process. Papoulias said that there are new facts and added that it is not only the Serbs that should be blamed but the other involved parties, too. However, at this point we should stress what has been reported earlier, that in tomorrow's final communique on the Yugoslav problem, and specifically on the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, the 16 leaders will indeed warn that increased sanctions could be imposed against any side that supports violence and force. Responding to another question regarding the Franco-German plan, the prime minister said that he believes the positions he took during the summit express a united Europe. At this point, Prime Minister Papandreou said that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe will pay an official visit to Athens next month. He added that most allies have a certain reservation regarding the use of force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On the other issues, Papandreou described the NATO meeting as a very important one during which significant decisions were made. One of these decisions, the prime minister said, is the cooperation for peace, which is an attempt to accept the cooperation of countries that were members of the former Warsaw Pact and other CSCE member countries. He added that this is very important for Greece because this possibility includes Cyprus as well. [passage omitted]
