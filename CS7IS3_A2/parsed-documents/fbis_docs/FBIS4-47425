Soil specimens, 30x50x50 cm[.sup]3[/] large clods, were dug up according to standard procedure at five sites: four sites respectively 1.5-2.5-6.0-15 km south-east away from the factory in the direction of the dominant winds, the nearest site being a treeless hill, and one site 8 km north-west (against those winds) away from the factory. Generally, the total biomass and the numbers of animals were found to become smaller with decreasing distance from the pollution source. Noteworthy is the effect of industrial fallout on the taxonomic structure of the mesofauna: ants dominant 1.5-2.5 km SE, earthworms dominant 15 km SE, both species and myriapodes in about equal numbers 8 km NW, earthworms and myriapodes along with click beetles still found 6 km SE away. Presence and absence of these species can serve as indicator for establishing the boundary of the ``impacted'' zone around a copper smelting plant. Acidity measurements made in three successive soil layers yielded: pH 3.6-3.8 in the 0-5 cm deep top layers and pH 5.6-6.4 in the 15-30 cm deep lower layers at the sites nearest to the pollution source. Only the number of ants was found not to depend on the acidity of the top soil layer, that of all other species to strongly depending on it. The results of studies made concerning the phytomass in this region indicate that such a distribution of invertebrates in the soil is due to worsening of the soil quality in terms of phytocoenoses.
