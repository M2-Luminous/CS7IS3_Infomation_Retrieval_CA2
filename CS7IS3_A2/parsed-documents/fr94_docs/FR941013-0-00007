SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 24, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 93&hyph;06&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;8530 (58 FR 31902, June 1, 1993), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;17, and &hyph;17R engines, to require initial and repetitive inspections of the third and fourth stage low pressure turbine (LPT) blade sets for excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches, and the removal of blade sets found with excessively worn blade crossnotches. That AD is not applicable, however, to PW JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;17, and &hyph;17R engines that contain fan exhaust inner front duct segment assemblies that are installed in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6039, Revision 2, dated May 4, 1992, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039, and either (a) PW honeycomb third stage outer airseal Part Number (P/N) 801931, 802097, 797594, or 798279; or (b) Pyromet Industries, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N PI9336; or (c) McClain International, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N M2433; or (d) a turbine case shield assembly installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 2, dated May 4, 1992, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039; or (e) a third stage blade set that has third stage turbine blades that were installed in accordance with PW SB No. 5331, dated October 27, 1982. A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;05 was published in the Federal Register on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68572). That action proposed to continue to require repetitive inspections of installed third and fourth stage LPT blade sets for blade shroud crossnotch wear, and removal of blade sets found with excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches. These inspections are not required, however, for PW JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;17, and &hyph;17R engines that contain fan exhaust inner front duct segment assemblies that are installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 3, dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039, and either (a) PW honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N 801931, 802097, 797594, or 798279; or (b) Pyromet Industries, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N PI9336; or (c) McClain International, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N M2433; or (d) a turbine case shield assembly installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 3, dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039; or (e) a third stage blade set that has third stage turbine blades that were installed in accordance with PW SB No. 5331, dated October 27, 1982. That notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) also proposed to require, however, for all engines, installation of improved third stage LPT containment hardware at the next access to the third stage LPT air sealing ring, but not later than December 31, 1998; installation of the improved fourth stage LPT containment hardware at the next shop visit, but not later than December 31, 1998; installation of the improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing at the next shop visit, but not later than December 31, 1998; and modification and remarking with a new identification number third and fourth stage LPT vanes with a reduced platform leading edge dimension at the next shop visit, but not later than December 31, 1998. The installation of improved containment hardware would serve as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the following service documents: PW ASB No. A5913, Revision 6, dated October 15, 1993, that describes the third and fourth stage LPT blade set inspection procedures and replacement requirements; PW ASB No. A6110, Revision 1, dated October 15, 1993, that describes procedures for installation of improved LPT containment hardware; PW ASB No. A6131, dated August 24, 1993, that describes procedures for installation of an improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing; and PW SB No. 5748, Revision 5, dated August 3, 1993, that describes procedures for removing material from the inner platform leading edge on third and fourth stage LPT vane and vane cluster assemblies, and remarking these modified vanes with new identification numbers. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. The FAA received several comments that state that inspections and modifications are available that address the root cause of shaft fractures and blade failures, whereas the installation of the containment hardware does not, and should therefore not be mandated. The FAA does not concur. Currently available inspections and modifications only protect against known failure modes, whereas the containment hardware will diminish the severity of all failure modes, both known and unknown, by protecting the aircraft from damage due to uncontained engine debris. The FAA received several comments that state that the FAA should evaluate PW JT8D engine models separately to determine if all models require the proposed actions to be accomplished, or if some models can be exempted from compliance due to differences in design or demonstrated operational safety. The FAA does not concur. Design differences between the various PW JT8D engine models were evaluated and no significant differences, other than low pressure rotor speed in the higher rated engines, were revealed that could impact containment capability. The increased rotor speeds are protected for in the design of the higher rated engines with the addition of a turbine shield, and the historical event data does not indicate that these higher low pressure rotor speeds result in a greater number of uncontained failures. One commenter states that the FAA's economic analysis does not reflect the true cost of the containment hardware. The FAA does not concur. The intent of the economic analysis is to quantify the total direct cost to operators of the proposed rule. The analysis does, however, account for engines currently equipped with the required parts, and the price for the required parts quoted in the proposed rule is actually an average value that reflects costs for these engines. One commenter states that the FAA's economic analysis does not account for the increased fuel costs resulting from the added weight of the containment hardware. The economic analysis reflects the direct costs of performing the requirements of the AD. Since the FAA has determined that the AD is required to correct an unsafe condition found in engines of this type design, and, therefore, operators must perform the requirements of the AD in order to ensure the continued airworthiness of the engines they operate, a comparison of the costs of operating the engine with and without the required containment hardware would not be proper. One commenter states that the definition of shop visit stated in the proposed rule encompasses many types of minor or peripheral maintenance activities where installation of the containment hardware cannot be accomplished, thus causing a forced induction into an overhaul facility. The FAA concurs. The shop visit definition has been revised to address this commenter's concern.
