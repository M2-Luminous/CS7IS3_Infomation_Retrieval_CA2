"I am asking for a special urgent meeting of the Freedom Alliance as this action is materially affecting the security situation," said Gen Viljoen in a statement. Gen Viljoen said an AVF force in Bophuthatswana was withdrawn after South African Defence Force [SADF] Chief Gen Georg Meiring gave an assurance that the SADF would not be instrumental in toppling Mr Mangope. The toppling of Mr Mangope affected "hopes of an all-inclusive settlement, not even to mention participation in the elections," said Gen Viljoen. "I am also calling on the international community to use their influence in solving this new crisis."
