Video shows nuclear submarine in Arctic waters, investigating expedition with underwater apparatus, clips and stills of Komsomolets on the seabed, interviews with officials ``The Komsomolets is not the first nuclear submarine to suffer an accident but it is the first whose nuclear reactor has leaked.'' However, as has become known, thanks to research carried out by Russian shore-based scientists, the reactor does not pose a serious ecological threat. The aim of the latest expedition by the Committee for Conducting Special Purpose Submarine Work [KOPRON] -- which has kindly given our program exclusive rights to show its video material -- was to assess the situation concerning the warheads. If plutonium escapes into the sea it could cause serious ecological danger. ``The latest data from the chemical analysis taken from around the plutonium warheads is not comforting. KOPRON is being disbanded and so are the mobile structures carrying out active preparations for the conservation of warheads on the Komsomolets.''
