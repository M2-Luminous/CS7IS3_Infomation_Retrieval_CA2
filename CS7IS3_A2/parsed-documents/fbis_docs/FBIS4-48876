People will ask: Why has Clinton met the Dalai Lama at this time? Let us consult a White House statement: "The United States cares about these problems, especially at a time when the United States is examining the conditions for extending China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status." That is the reason! The U.S. Government once again wants to link trade with politics, treating Tibet's religious and cultural situations as a condition for extending China's MFN trading status. Concerning the issue of extending China's MFN trading status, the U.S. Government truly has an endless list of things to link to it. Yesterday it wanted to link it to China's lawful handling of the cases of Han Dongfang and Wei Jingsheng; today it wants to link it to Tibet's religious and cultural conditions described by the Dalai Lama; and tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, perhaps, it will want to link it to Beijing's lawful handling of some criminals who jeopardize the country's security and interests. The United States likes to comment unduly on the internal affairs of other countries, and give instructions and orders; it has frequently used MFN status to harass and bully other countries. This is a total violation of the basic norms of international relations as well as an embodiment of power politics. Not long ago, a British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee report attacked the human rights situation in Tibet, and said that the Foreign Office was "deeply concerned" about Tibet's "human rights" as well as "culture and religion," and that "the world cannot turn a blind eye to the Tibet problem." Was it because the Dalai Lama was "encouraged" by this British report that he immediately rushed to the United States to "report" to Clinton? Or was it because Clinton wanted to coordinate with Britain and summoned the Dalai Lama for a "discussion?" If that was the case, then what tacit coordination! Tibet is an inseparable part of China. Under the leadership of the CPC, it cast off its extremely backward feudal serf system and embarked upon a broad and bright road of freedom, happiness, and modernization; its society and economy has experienced earth-shaking changes, and its human rights situation has completely improved. Respect for and protection of religious freedom is a basic policy of the Chinese Government. Departments at various levels in Tibet have seriously implemented this policy and have won praise from the broad masses of monks and people. During the period of the National People's Congress in March, a Living Buddha from Xigaze's Zhaxilhunbo Monastery said at a news conference for Chinese and foreign reporters: "The policy of freedom of religious beliefs currently practiced in Tibet is protected by the constitution. In recent years, Tibet has spent 200 million yuan to repair its monasteries. At present, Tibet has more than 1,400 monasteries, which basically satisfy the Buddha-worshipping activities of the people in the localities." Whoever has visited Tibet can tell you that everywhere one can see long narrow flags with Buddhist Scripture written on them hung by believers, piled up Buddhist stacks, and -- both inside and outside the well-known monasteries -- crowds of believers who kowtow, turn the Buddhist wheels, and come for pilgrimage. Education and culture are developing very rapidly in Tibet. The state has invested more than 1.1 billion yuan in developing education in Tibet. The government pays all the tuition fees for Tibetan students, from the time when they enter primary schools to the time they graduate from universities. Some primary and middle school students of Tibetan nationality are also provided with clothing, food, and accommodations. The fine traditions and culture in Tibet have been protected and have been able to develop. The Tibetan language is used throughout the region, Tibet's cultural relics are thoroughly protected, and its traditional customs are widely respected. Modern cultures and facilities are constantly coming into Tibet, going to the households of many Tibetan compatriots. There is a world of difference between the new Tibet and the old one. No one can deny this. It has been more than three decades now since the Dalai Lama fled the country. With the purpose of splitting the motherland, he has ignored the facts, fabricated lies, attacked China's Tibet policy, slandered the human rights situation in Tibet, instigated and planned disturbances in the Tibetan region, and vigorously preached "Tibetan independence." He has not changed his deeds after being persuaded repeatedly; rather, he has intensified his efforts. Now he has met Clinton. Can we believe that he has not slandered and created rumors about Tibet's religious and cultural conditions in front of Clinton? How pitiful if a U.S. President were to pick up several chicken feathers (lies) from the Dalai Lama and view them as tokens of authority for attacking China, or as a reference for when he decides whether to extend China's MFN trading status! According to a REUTER report, despite repeated explanations and objections by the Chinese Government, the U.S. side still arranged for its President and vice president to meet the Dalai Lama. This indicates that the United States has drifted away from its commitment to regard Tibet as a part of China and has trampled upon the basic norm of "not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries" when handling international relations. It goes without saying that businessmen in the United States are generally optimistic about the Chinese market. They are demanding stronger economic cooperation with China and an unconditional extension of its MFN trading status. If those in power in the United States ignore the wishes of the commercial circles and the overall interests of their country, and take the Dalai Lama's lies as a reference when deciding whether to extend China's MFN trading status, then -- as asserted by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation -- "MFN status is two-sided; if the United States revokes China's MFN status, then China can also revoke the United States' MFN status. If a confrontation arises between China and the United States over MFN status, neither side will be a winner."
