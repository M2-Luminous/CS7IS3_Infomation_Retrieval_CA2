Economic Considerations.In regards to economic arguments for continuing the operation of ChAES one should note that when providing economic justification of continuing the operation the principle aspect is determining potential economic losses caused by possible heavy accidents at the ChAES.Taking into account the current economic conditions, liquidation of potential accident effects of an even substantially lower scale compared to the 1986 accident will result in disproportionately large direct economic losses. Under these circumstances it is hard even to estimate the blow to the national economy.It is worth noting that the absence of established in advance criteria of economic, organizational and technological acceptability and the risk of continuing the ChAES operation, which would provide an appropriate gauge for a skilled analysis of the factors under consideration, does not make possible an unambiguous assessment of continuing the ChAES operation.II. Safety Level ChAEs administration justifies sufficiency of the safety level mainly by the large number of safety improving measures taken after 1986. But in doing so the basic deficiencies of RBMK [the type of ChAES reactors] have not been eliminated, namely: the absence of a localization system for the upper (steam water) section of reactor pipelines; as a result, in the case of a certain accident (rupture of the PVK [expansion not given], separator drum and/or steam lines to the GZZ [expansion not given]) an indeterminate amount of radioactive heat transfer agent can be released into the environment. In addition, such accident leads to a loss of the heat transfer agent and can result in drying the fuel core with all accompanying consequences;) the reactor vulnerability to ruptures of technological channels (according to calculations performed by the Chief Designer the localization system was designed for rupture of not more than two to three channels, and independent experts surmise the possibility of the mechanism of a chain-like increase of the number of TK [expansion not given] ruptures after a rupture of one channel); such accident is analogous to the 1986 accident; vulnerability of the steel zirconium joints in technological channels to temperature fluctuations and their uncertain behavior in the case of thermal shocks (for instance, a false or prearranged operation of the SAOR [expansion not given] system); low quality and reliability of the equipment, especially of shutoff and control valves and the ``SKALA'' computing control system (the service life of the latter had been used up long ago); the absence of protection of safety important equipment from negative environmental factors (temperature, humidity and impact loads), which makes this equipment vulnerable in accident situations; the absence of physical separation of power supply cables for standby equipment of safety and safety important systems and separation of power and control cable flows; inefficiency of the generator room fire-fighting system and vulnerability of design solutions related to placement of safety important systems in the generator room; a large number if welded joints in the first loop (KMPTs [expansion not given] and the absence of state-of-the-art diagnostic systems.In addition, the insufficient current safety level is substantially affected by the following factors: unsatisfactory level of the safety culture, which is indicated by a large number of additional failures and defects detected during scheduled simulated accident situations; miscalculations of the existing system of providing corrective actions based on results of investigation of incidents and accident situations; this was noted by the IAEA expert ASSET mission based on results of investigating the circumstances of the 1991 fire of the second unit. Human FactorFrom the standpoint of social factors and the problem of employment of highly skilled personnel, continuing the operation to 1997 will not eliminate the problem in principle it will only postpone it for some time.Under these conditions and taking into account predominant safety considerations when considering the problem of stopping the CHAES operation, one should consider the availability of a large number of skilled personnel within a different context, namely, as a positive factor which can solve the problem of manning new units of AES with VVER 1000 [reactor type] if a substantiated decision is made to stop the moratorium on their commissioning.Based on the above arguments, Minpryrody considers the substantiation of the possibility of continuing the operation of the Chernobyl AES insufficient and the Supreme Soviet decision regarding decommissioning of the Chernobyl AES inexpedient.``UKRAYINSKA GAZETA''. By publishing a selection of documents related to continuing operation of the Chernobyl AES we are hoping to inform our readers about the Acting Prime Minister's response as to the position of both sides, as well as to receive a clear Minpryrody answer as to what to do with our AES and how to do it.
