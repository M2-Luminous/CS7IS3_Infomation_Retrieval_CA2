The Slovene Christian Democrats, therefore, call upon all those who have violated fundamental moral and ethical principles to leave the Slovene political scene. As the second most powerful parliamentary party, the Christian Democrats wish to contribute toward appeasement, stability, and progress, because divisions cannot be the guiding star of the young Slovene state, which was also confirmed by the incident in Depala Vas and recent statements by President Milan Kucan in Nova Gorica. In cases of abuse of power, the Christian Democrats also expect the resignation of incumbent ministers. If it transpires that the president of the republic has also been involved in the recent events, the Christian Democrats will demand his resignation, too.
