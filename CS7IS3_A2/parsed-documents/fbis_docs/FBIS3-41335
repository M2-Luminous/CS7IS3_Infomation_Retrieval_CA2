This announcement was made today by the head of that office, Arturo Ochoa Palacios. He indicated that the illustrated stickers known as "Blue Star," pieces of paper with a blue star, were analyzed, and discovered to be saturated with drugs and poison. He explained that they are the size of a pencil eraser, and that each star is permeated with lysergic acid (LSD); although others contain one of the most deadly poisons, strychnine. The purpose of the distribution of these items among secondary school students is still unknown. Nevertheless, according to the official, "The information being given to students and teachers has been intensified, and flyers are being disseminated as well, to warn all educational establishments." He noted that some teachers have notified the PGR authorities that the stickers are also being sold as tattoos, appearing on brightly colored paper and resembling postage stamps, with sketches of cartoon characters. These stickers have been distributed wrapped in a fine metal sheet and, he added, constitute a new method of selling drugs to children and adolescents. He said that teachers have also reported symptoms caused by contact with these substances, such as hallucinations, intense vomiting, uncontrolled laughter, mood swings, and body temperature changes. Admitting that the distribution center is unknown, as is the length of time that these stickers have been circulating in Baja California, he concluded by saying: "The most important thing, however, is to advise parents and teachers to take precautions."
