He said this in his message to his Chinese counterpart Li Peng today on the occasion of the 20th anniversary (May 31) of the founding of the diplomatic relations between the two countries. "Links between Malaysia and China actually stretched a long way back into history, but it is only over the last two decades that our bilateral relationship has reached a new level of understanding and cooperation," Mahathir said. "The policy of friendly relations with neighboring countries has encouraged positive developments in our bilateral relations, particularly in recent years," he said. He added: "In the past five years or so, bilateral relations have increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation. "I am confident that this trend will be further reinforced in the years to come. Aside from the rapid increase in economic cooperation, trade and investment, cooperation in other fields such as tourism, cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts will further encourage better understanding and friendship between Malaysia and China."
