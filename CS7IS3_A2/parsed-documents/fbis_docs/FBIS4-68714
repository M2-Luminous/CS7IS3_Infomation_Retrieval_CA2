The details of the talks on ways of stimulating trade and economic relations between the two countries were discussed by a direct participant in the talks, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, at the request of a DELOVOY MIR correspondent. [Davydov] The first thing we ascertained during our conversations with Spanish colleagues and businessmen was the obvious lack of correspondence between our economic relations and the level of political relations and productive potential of Russia and Spain. This is particularly true of trade and investments, as well as the presence of Spanish business in our market. I must admit that we also had problems with the Spanish businessmen's pessimistic opinion of current processes in the Russian economy. They are still temporizing, in the belief that the right time for them to enter our market has not arrived yet, preferring to allow such countries as the United States and Germany, with their colossal financial potential, to take all of the risks at this time. We feel, on the contrary, that temporizing could lead to the loss of the whole Russian market, which is undergoing spirited development. Furthermore, this process will be stepped up after 1 July this year, when voucher privatization comes to an end and privatization for money begins. This would be a convenient time for the Spanish to find their own niches in our economy for the best use of their experience and technology. We were particularly impressed by the high standards of the production, processing, shipment, storage, and packaging of agricultural products in Spain. It was no coincidence that the Russian president visited one of the country's largest meat processing enterprises--Campofrio, which is also operating successfully in Moscow--on his last day in Madrid. Spanish businessmen do not know enough about the situation in our currency market either, including the domestic convertibility of the ruble. In view of all this, the Russian side invited Spain's Minister of Commerce and Tourism Javier Gomez-Navarro to visit our country with a group of businessmen for the purpose of taking a closer look at the situation and establishing business contacts. The main advice we tried to give the Spanish was this: "Do not get held up at the starting gate; start moving vigorously." Furthermore, they have to remember that Russian imports are being reduced: They decreased by 27 percent last year, and this tendency will continue. Today the state has already stopped all centralized imports: It is not buying anything. Of course, centralized exports still exist and represent around 20 percent of the total volume, but these will also be phased out by 1995. The state will be occupied solely in establishing favorable conditions for the development of export-import operations and helping domestic enterprises compete for sales markets. [Avdoshin] What was your impression of B. Yeltsin's meeting with the Spanish businessmen? [Davydov] The president's speech was quite brilliant, it seems to me, and all of the people present at the meeting were pleasantly surprised, first of all, by his awareness of the whole range of problems in Russian-Spanish trade and economic relations and, second, by his candor. He frankly discussed the difficulties we are experiencing, but nevertheless advised the Spanish to work more vigorously in our market. [Avdoshin] What kind of agreements were concluded on new Spanish credits for Russia? Reports in the local press have been ambiguous, particularly with regard to specific figures and amounts.... [Davydov] The whole thing is quite simple: The Spanish will extend 100 million dollars for the development of mutual trade and are willing to extend another 100 million through EC channels for various programs of aid to Russia and 425 million for the promotion of direct private Spanish investments in our country. These funds will be extended to private businessmen with specific promising projects. [Avdoshin] The press has also had much to say about our debt to Spain, which is supposed to be impeding the intensification of bilateral economic relations.... [Davydov] We said we would pay it off (it amounts to 900 million dollars) within the confines of the clubs of Paris and London. This is not a problem. Last year we fulfilled all of our obligations in the Club of Paris and we are fully determined to do the same this year. State budget allocations for this purpose amount to around 2 billion dollars. [Avdoshin] What was your personal impression of your contacts with Spanish businessmen? How would you assess the results? [Davydov] The results were indisputably positive. I have rarely encountered this kind of sincerity and eagerness to establish relations. Furthermore, all of this is occurring at a time when Spain has serious economic difficulties of its own! [Avdoshin] In his speech the president said that measures would be taken soon to establish more favorable conditions for foreign investments in Russia. What did he mean? [Davydov] This is envisaged in the amendment to the Law on Foreign Investment in Russia that was submitted to the State Duma for consideration. One of its provisions stipulates that foreign companies investing in Russia will be exempt from profit taxes for the whole period of investment recoupment and will then be taxed at the national rate. If we do this, the investment climate is certain to improve dramatically. The government feels that this would be advisable.
