The delegation also visited the Royal Jordanian Scientific Society. The visit seeks to examine prospects of Jordanian-Chinese cooperation in various fields. Senate Speaker Ahmad al-Lawzi noted the importance of this visit because Jordan believes that China's role in and concern about achieving peace in the region is one of the most important bases on which we depend. This is especially so since China is one of the five permanent UN Security Council members. Therefore, it is directly concerned with implementing UN Security Council resolutions that deal with the Middle East issue. Al-Lawzi called on the Chinese friends to exercise their real role based on the international legitimacy to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict. He noted the firmness of Jordanian-Chinese political, cultural, and economic relations as a result of both countries' eagerness to develop and reinforce these relations. The head of the Chinese delegation said that the Chinese leadership and people greatly appreciate His Majesty King Husayn's balanced stands on various international issues. [passage omitted] The Chinese delegation arrived in Amman this morning on a four-day visit to Jordan. The delegation was received by a number of Senate members, the Parliament's secretary general, and the Chinese ambassador in Amman.
