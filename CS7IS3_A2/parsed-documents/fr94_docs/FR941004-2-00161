SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is registered as a closed-end, diversified management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On August 21, 1992, applicant filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;2 under section 8(b) of the Act and under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on October 23, 1992, and the public offering of applicant's shares commenced soon thereafter. 2. On March 18, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved an agreement and plan of reorganization and liquidation providing for the transfer of substantially all of the assets of applicant to Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund, a closed-end, diversified management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. In exchange, the agreement provided for the issuance of shares of Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund and the assumption by Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund of substantially all of applicant's liabilities. In accordance with Rule 17a&hyph;8, the trustees of applicant determined that the reorganization was in the best interests of applicant and that the interests of applicant's shareholders would not be diluted as a result. 1 1 Rule 17a&hyph;8 provides relief from the affiliated transaction prohibition of Section 17(a) of the Act for a merger of investment companies that may be affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 3. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 was filed with the SEC on April 30, 1993, and the proxy statement/prospectus contained therein was furnished to applicant's shareholders. On July 28, 1993, at applicant's annual shareholder meeting, shareholders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the agreement and plan of reorganization and liquidation. 4. On July 28, 1993, the effective date of reorganization, applicant had 4,490,556 shares outstanding, with a net asset value per share of $11.68. On that date, Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund distributed to applicant's shareholders, in exchange for their shares, shares of Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund (or cash in lieu of fractional shares) of aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their respective interests in applicant. 5. The expenses attributable to the acquisition of applicant by Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund, including SEC registration fees, printing, accounting, and legal expenses, amounted to $155,211. These expenses were allocated between applicant and Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund pro rata in proportion to their respective assets, except that Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund paid all SEC registration fees. 6. Applicant has no remaining assets, outstanding debts, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant has no shareholders, and is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. 7. Applicant intends to file a certificate of dissolution in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
