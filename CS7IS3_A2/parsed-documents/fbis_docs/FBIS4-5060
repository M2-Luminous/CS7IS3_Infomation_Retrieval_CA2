Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), told a news conference Hosokawa should take tough action to get the bill through the Diet. His remark indicated he considers it unavoidable for the ruling coalition government to vote on the bill, even in the absence of opposition parties, observers said. Parliamentary debate on the budget has been stalled over demands by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party that Hosokawa disclose details of a 100 million yen loan he accepted from the scandal-tainted trucking firm Sagawa Kyubin Co. and purchases of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. made by the premier in the name of his late father-in-law. Nagano said the budget committee should resume debate on the budget quickly and transfer discussions on the scandal to other panels.
