FBIS4-60199 "drnes099_j_94027" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Wrapup of Reports on Clashes, Military Operations Wrapup of Reports on Clashes, Military Operations Operations, Brigade Defections Noted JN2205134794 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1217 GMT 22 May 94 JN2205134794 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A responsible military source at the Defense Ministry has stated the following: As the masses of our Yemeni people were rejoicing at the announcement issued by the joint meeting of the presidential council, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Council of Ministers to consider the day of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, the fourth national anniversary of the restoration of unity and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen, and the days that follows [21-23 May] as days for peace during which military operations against the rebellious secessionist gang in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership will be suspended in honor and appreciation of both the meaning of these two occasions and the sanctity of religious rituals and also in response to the calls by the unionists and a number of Arab leaders to give a new opportunity to the misled and helpless ones to return to the path of justice, unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy and to declare their rejection and confrontation of the secessionist conspiracy; and as our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, were abiding by both that announcement and the instructions of the higher political and military commands to suspend all military acts, they were surprised by the flagrant hostile escalation by the forces of rebellion and secession, who opened fire with a variety of weapons and launched air raids in criminal acts coordinated with the treacherous, invalid crime of secession only two hours after the chance for peace was announced. This prompted all Armed Forces units to implement what was stipulated in the announcement -- that military breaches by the gang of rebellion and secession will be replied to. They took measures to confront these hostile acts, thus the military confrontation continued even after the last veil fell off the faces of secessionists led by the rebellious traitor al-Bid. The heroes in our Armed Forces' air defense units managed to down one aircraft belonging to the gang of rebellion and secession in Habil al-Jabr on the Lahij-Abyan axis. Our Armed Forces units acting on that axis also seized 15 tanks, four BM-21 Katyusha vehicles, 15 vehicles and BTR armored personnel carriers, five fuel and water (?pickups). They also seized warehouses containing large quantities of military ammunition and hardware. At dawn yesterday, and only a few hours after the futile secessionist announcement and the emergence of the truth about the allegations and lies of the forces of rebellion and secession in the YSP leadership, several military brigades under the hegemony of the secessionist gang announced they were joining the ranks of the unity and constitutional legitimacy and their rejection of the destructive, treacherous calls for secession. The commander, as well as some officers, NCO's, and soldiers from the 22d Brigade announced their rejection of the crime of secession and that they were returning to the trench of defending unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. On the Shabwah axis, the heroes of our valiant Armed Forces were able to confront attacks by the secessionist, rebellious forces and inflicted heavy losses on them. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: If ye will aid [the cause of] God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly. [koranic verse]
