This was proposed at the provincial conference on reform of the labor system held in Anshan on 18 May. The provincial labor department proposed: This year we should regard reform of the labor employment system as the breakthrough point, carry out comprehensive supporting reform of the regional labor system in an all-around manner, accelerate the pace of implementing the all-member labor contract system; and make reform serve the whole region, enterprises of various ownerships, and all staff members and workers. Meanwhile, it is necessary to take active but prudent steps to make arrangements for enterprise surplus workers, help unemployed and job-seekers find jobs again, and implement the integrated social security system in all places. Through regional supporting reform, we should gradually establish an enterprise internal wages distribution method that meets the needs of the market economy, and implement the wage system under which the wage standards are determined by the markets and enterprises are allowed to distribute wages independently while taking supervision, regulation, and control from the government, break the ownership and regional limits, and promote the formation of regional labor markets.
