Establishing the modern enterprise system is a new question for study, and most people are still unfamiliar with this concept. Establishing the modern enterprise system is also the most important "campaign" now that economic structural reform in our country has entered the stage of "storming the fortifications" [gong jian 2396 1017], so we must work very hard to acquire and understand the knowledge in this regard. Carrying out reform in this area is a pressing task for us. If we say that our previous enterprise reform measures were primarily aimed at "destroying the old," then the establishment of the new enterprise system will mainly be aimed at "establishing the new." The modern enterprise system is not one or two specific systems in some areas, but a comprehensive institutional system which is related to all aspects of the external environment and the internal mechanisms of the enterprises. The system should clearly determine the character, position, role, and behavior mode of the enterprises. It should standardize the basic relationships between the enterprise and the investor, between the enterprise and the creditor, between the enterprise and the government, between the enterprise and the market, between the enterprise and society, between one enterprise and another, between the enterprise and the consumers, and between the enterprise and its workers. Moreover, the modern enterprise system is the result of summing up the enterprise reform experience in our country, It is the product of the development of socialized mass production and the market economy and is based on the integration of the creative practice from our country's enterprise reform with international and common practices. It is certain that our existing knowledge cannot enable us to thoroughly understand all its contents. For example, we may now hear quite a few specious comments on the modern enterprise system. Some people have said that the modern enterprise system was a modernized enterprise system, and the first requirement in a modernized enterprise system was to realize enterprise modernization. Other people have said that the modern enterprise system referred to the conduct of modern enterprise management. These were interpretations without real understanding and were just based on people's existing knowledge. In fact, being a model of the enterprise structure, the modern enterprise system is the reflection of the relationship of production, and it does not represent the modernization level of the equipment in the enterprises and does not refer to the modernization of enterprise management. If popular understanding remains at such a level, how can they establish the modern enterprise system, which is scientific and standardized? At present, the relevant central departments and the local governments are actively selecting the points for carrying out the pilot schemes for the establishment of the modern enterprise system. Various provinces are applying for a larger number of assignments of such pilot schemes from the central departments concerned. Enterprises are also vying with one another to apply for carrying out such pilot schemes from the provincial and municipal authorities. Such enthusiastic reactions show that an extensive consensus of opinion on the establishment of the modern enterprise system has been reached, and this is supported by localities and enterprises. In such circumstances, we should grasp the opportunity and properly adopt various forms to organize the local governments and the enterprises to study the basic knowledge about the modern enterprise system so that people may fully and more deeply understand the modern enterprise system. The government departments must make this study indispensable and must not just carry it out in a formalistic way. Such study is necessary for the enterprises; it is not an extra burden which disrupts routine operations. Our minds must be armed with the new knowledge acquired from the study; otherwise, we may lose our bearings and could even go astray in practice. While studying knowledge about the modern enterprise system, the government departments should more scientifically select the points for carrying out the pilot schemes according to objective standards so that reform in this regard may be carried out from the very beginning in a rigorous and regular way, as opposed to a haphazard way based on some people's wishful thinking. Through studying the knowledge about the modern enterprise system, the enterprises will understand why they can or cannot be assigned to carry out the pilot scheme and will thus reduce their unnecessary grievances about whether an arrangement is fair or unfair. Thus, enterprises that are not selected for the pilot schemes will also actively create conditions in order to carry out a pilot scheme as soon as possible and to march toward the modern enterprise system.
