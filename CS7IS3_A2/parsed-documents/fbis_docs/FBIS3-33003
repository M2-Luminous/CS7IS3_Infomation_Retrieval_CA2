In a brief statement read at the Narino Government Palace, Gaviria said his wish, if he is elected, is to strengthen the continent's political and economic integration. Gaviria decided to run for the OAS post in view of the requests made to him by different world leaders since December. Gaviria's candidacy is sponsored by the United States and has received the official backing of Peru, Argentina, Mexico, and Bolivia. In his speech, Gaviria said that "America is concerned about the future of the OAS." He added that "we all know that under the current circumstances, the self-same future of the inter-American system is at stake along with the election of the secretary general. This is where Colombia faces a big responsibility. If we have in our hands the tools, knowledge, and experience, we must place it at the service of the hemisphere." "I hope that my commitment can serve to unite at a time when the OAS faces the responsibility of outlining new paths within the context of a new, more just world order amid solidarity," he said. He also said he has great respect for his rivals (Bernd Niehaus of Costa Rica and Miguel Angel Burelli of Venezuela). He invited both of them to share their respective views in such a way that, rather than reflect a race, which he considered futile, it will show the wish to contribute to a peaceful future for the continent. The new OAS secretary general, who will succeed Brazilian Joao Baena Soares, will be designated on 27 March.
