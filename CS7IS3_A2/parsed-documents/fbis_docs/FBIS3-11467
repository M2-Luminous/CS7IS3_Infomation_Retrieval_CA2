[Castriota de Azambuja] Argentina and Brazil have permanent cultural and geographical links. There are many difficulties. The more we trade and develop our relations the greater the possibility of problems. It is very difficult to have diplomatic problems with Nepal or other nations with which we have little contact. Bilateral relations do not require a lot of imagination. It is determined by geography. There have not been any conflicts between our nations for over a century now. South America is almost the only region in the world where a 100-year-old map is still good because borders have not changed. We were adversaries in colonial times and rivals throughout the 19th century. We tried cooperation in the 20th century and we are now partners. The objective when we were rivals was to put hurdles in the other nation's path. We would make access, paths, and communications difficult. Now we are partners. There is a spirit of partnership [preceding words in Latin]. The purpose now is to see that the other party is doing well. It is also true that we began a difficult year and that our problems are real. Argentina can talk with the United States about joining NAFTA but cannot negotiate its entry by itself as long as it is a member of Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. The fact that Argentina is enjoying the prestige of being invited to join NAFTA does not hurt us. For the time being Brazil is not interested in NAFTA. We think that we must follow the path opened by President George Bush through the Rose Garden Agreement. This agreement is also known under the formula 4+1 and was conceived within the framework of the Americas Initiative. [Etchebarne] Would Brazil's proposal to create a free trade zone in South America also hurt Mercosur? [Castriota de Azambuja] The train of integration goes through Mercosur. Brazil's absolute priority is Mercosur's customs unification. Negotiations with other South American countries refers to a free trade zone, and Argentina has being invited to join Brazil in the negotiations. [Etchebarne] Will there be agreement on external duty levels? [Castriota de Azambuja] Of course. In June we will agree on an external duty level. The humility earned through defeats caused by the failure of policies implemented through the 1980's makes agreement between the two countries easier. Brazil thought it could be self-sufficient. That was the dream, the national objective. To import was almost tantamount to treason. We contracted several bad bets during the 1980's which destroyed the Brazilian dream. It was thought oil prices would increase. For strategic reasons we purchased oil from Iraq instead of from our neighbors. We bet heavily on African trade but the matter did not work out. Then we bet heavily on protectionism. [Etchebarne] What about relations with the United States? [Castriota de Azambuja] The United States has its own master plan [preceding two words in English] based on NAFTA, but Brazil cannot accept negative preferences. Mexico's digestion will not be easy. The country has serious problems, as the kidnapping of the Banamex [National Bank of Mexico] president shows. It seems Chile will be the next country to join NAFTA because it is the only country that has done everything it had to. The Americas summit in December will be important for defining our relations with the United States.
