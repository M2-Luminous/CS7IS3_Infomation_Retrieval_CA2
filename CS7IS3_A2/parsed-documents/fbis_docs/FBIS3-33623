There are internal and external factors that would not allow this to happen, and the Army officers themselves are aware that this should not happen. De Leon added that the activities in which some citizens might have engaged near the Government House before his announcement of the recent changes in the National Defense General Staff are routine and Guatemalans can be certain that there is absolute peace in this sense. Some day we will be able to dissipate from the minds of our fellow countrymen the idea of the traditional coup d'etat because the officers are aware of the democratic role they must play. The commander general of the Army has all the support of the High Command. Referring to the three changes that have occurred in the military leadership during his government, De Leon Carpio explained that those are institutional and not personal decisions of the president. De Leon Carpio added that these changes are in line with adjustments by a government that assumed power in a situation unprecedented in history because no president has accepted the challenge he faced -- to become president amid an institutional crisis, the legacy of former President Jorge Serrano. I accepted the command of a vessel about to sink amid turbulence. Now, however, I am satisfied that I have guided the vessel to more peaceful waters because I strengthened the institutions. The political difficulty has been overcome since the purge achieved by a referendum that made history. Entirely secure in the institutional since, we currently have political stability. The first change was the removal of General Jose Domingo Garcia Samayoa, who was the defense minister. This change had to take place given the fact that we were trying to strengthen the democratic system and the same chain of command that had been in place up until 25 May could not be maintained. The second change, which occurred 21 days later, was the removal of General Roberto Perussina, who had replaced Garcia in the said post. This decision was also based on the same logic. The third and most outstanding change took place on 18 February and involved General Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, who was replaced in the post of chief of the National Defense General Staff by General Marco Antonio Gonzalez Taracena. This change confirms the strengthening of the institutions. De Leon explained the situation once the institutional crisis was solved: I can say that I have settled and not merely sat in the presidency, and that I am willing to face the social and economic problems. In order to solve the main problems, we will have to implement a government agenda that considers the investment of 28 percent of the budget to fight poverty. In addition, we are facing a serious financial problem, and this is why we need to obtain resources through taxes. Regarding the current social crisis, I must clarify that this is a problem that I inherited, which does not mean that I will ignore it. In the beginning I concentrated on consolidating democracy and prepared, on a temporary basis, a 180-day program with a few resources to tackle some social problems. Now we must develop the government plan, which should not be subject to the interests of any specific sector. Although our policies might agree with the interests of some groups on certain aspects, they are definite, and our goals regarding the exchange, credit, labor, monetary, and other fields are clearly established. I have not bowed to political, military, or economic interests. In order to promote this work, I am inviting Guatemalans to help me create a national project with the participation of all sectors of this society. Regarding the controversy triggered by an apparent change in course, which came when he moved from human rights ombudsman to his current position as president, the president affirmed that his point of view regarding the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC] had not changed in the least. I have recordings in which I clearly present my position on the PAC's. I have kept the same point of view since I wrote the constitutional provisions on the issue as a member of the Group of 30 at the National Constituent Assembly. I upheld my position as human rights ombudsman and I now have the opportunity to continue defending it as president. My attitude remains the same. I believe the PAC's are groups of civilians being used militarily. They are a necessary evil because we are at war, a war whose main objective is to diminish the insurgent movements' power. I believe that the confusion began when a PAC member gave me a rifle when I visited a hamlet where there were hundreds of other patrolmen. The photograph of that instance circled the world and was misinterpreted. They did not report what followed. The peasant gave me the weapon and told me that it represented the surrender of all PAC weapons to their commander in chief once peace is signed in Guatemala. I must clearly state that there are some PAC leaders who are guilty of abuse. These men must be punished in accordance with the law. The case of journalist Jorge Carpio could be an example, if it can be proven that the attack during which three people died was carried out by one of these groups. The president also stated that hundreds of peasants all over the country and particularly in the east have voluntarily left the patrols. Many have gone on to organize peace and development committees. I have also ordered the gradual dissolution of the PAC's in areas where they are now unnecessary. I continue to uphold my values and principles. I believe there are patrol leaders who should be punished. Even so, I maintain what I said repeatedly when I was ombudsman: These groups must not be disbanded as long as we have an armed conflict. Those who want them disbanded are acting on personal interest or out of ignorance. A Government in Search of Peace Almost at the close of our interview, de Leon Carpio said that his main goal is to give his successor a nation in peace, even though he received it in war. Although he does not believe he can change the nation's structure, he said he wants to create irreversible conditions that will promote such changes. The truth of the matter is that Guatemalans are aware of the honesty in which we are handling the matters of state. There are no more obscure or secret transactions taking place, and, although there is still corruption in the Executive Branch, we are fighting to eliminate it, which in itself sets a precedent in Latin America. The one most important thing about my administration is that I am going to leave the country with a taste for participation, which is growing through honesty. I want to be remembered as the honest president who knew how to administrate the country properly. De Leon Carpio also addressed the course that privatization of state enterprises could take. On this he explained that it has been proven that the state is an inefficient administrator. It will be necessary to force it to compete. If our Constitution states that there must be no monopolies, we must find a way to eliminate them in a manner in which the end beneficiaries are the customers who use the services. I am ready to make whatever decisions are needed, even if that implies some sort of political cost. I am ready to privatize as soon as the time is right. Other presidents have been afraid to face this problem because it will be costly at the polls later on. I have no party. Therefore, it is easier for me to make these decisions. The workers must leave their fears about this policy behind. They have an example in FEGUA [Guatemalan Railroad Company]. This enterprise already went through the process. The ones who got the most out of it were the workers. Not only do they get their wages, but they are now working for a disciplined and visionary corporation with highly promising plans for the future. Privatization should not be misunderstood, because its goal is to improve the services and goods for the customers. Through this process, then, public schools and hospitals will be better managed. It is the people themselves who are the best ones to carry this out because they can organize family committees or trusteeships to get the best results. In so doing we will be implementing social supervision.
