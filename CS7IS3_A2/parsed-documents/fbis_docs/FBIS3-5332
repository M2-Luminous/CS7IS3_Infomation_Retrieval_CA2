But the editorials at the same time urged the Japanese Government to take decisive steps to slash Japan's swelling trade surplus. The major dailies denounced the Super 301 clause as violating free trade principles confirmed with the conclusion in December of the Uruguay Round of trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The ASAHI SHIMBUN interpreted Clinton's move as bowing to domestic pressure after the recent U.S.-Japan summit in Washington failed to achieve a breakthrough in the so-called trade framework talks. Given relevant promises made during the presidential campaign two years ago and strong demands from Congress to force open the Japanese market, Clinton could hardly avoid reinstating the Super 301 trade provision, the ASAHI said. The daily said, however, that using the threat of sanctions unless Tokyo makes concessions is "tantamount to waving one's fist" and a behavior Japan "cannot accept." "It is only natural that the Japanese Government voiced ardent opposition," the ASAHI said. The paper said the fact that Clinton explained his decision in a phone call to Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa indicates that Washington is not interested in setting off a trade war. The Hosokawa cabinet must demonstrate its political will to improve trade relations by drawing up an action plan to change Japan's economic structure, which the ASAHI said is the main cause for the nation's huge trade surplus. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN reproached Clinton for damaging bilateral relations by "pulling the trigger of the institutional gun, before Japan has even thrown back the ball." His reviving the clause is "extremely regrettable," the paper said in its editorial. Reinstating the clause as if the stalled framework talks had already collapsed is "a dangerous game" that could drive overall bilateral relations into a "dangerous abyss against the President's own intention," the MAINICHI said. The daily called for a plan to tackle Japan's total as well as bilateral current account surplus. The YOMIURI SHIMBUN said editorially that Clinton's move is "regrettable," but now Japan holds the "key" to solving the bilateral trade frictions. It urged Hosokawa to demonstrate "maximum leadership" in addressing the nation's trade imbalance "quickly and voluntarily." Deploring the revival of the Super 301 provision, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN pointed to the damage Japan would suffer in a trade war of sanctions and retaliatory measures. Clinton's move indicates that the United States this time will "not indulge" Japan's trade surplus, all the more as the end of the Cold War has eased pressure to play down trade conflicts for the sake of unity against a joint enemy, the economic daily said. To avoid further turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, Japan should not stick to its "determined no-policy" approach, the paper said.
