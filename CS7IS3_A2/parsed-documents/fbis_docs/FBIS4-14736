Sources among the presidential staff members told ITAR-TASS today that Leonid Kravchuk's decision was at variance with the Ukrainian law on the division of powers between the bodies of state authorities of Ukraine and the Crimean republic, which contains no provision for the setting up of a Ukrainian presidential office in the Crimea. According to the same sources, the decree violates a clause of Article 14 of the same law, under which Ukraine acts as a guarantor of the legal status of the Crimean republic. The decree setting up a Ukrainian presidential office in the Crimea met with a negative reaction also in the Council of Ministers of the Crimea and in the Presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet (parliament), according to the presidential staffer, Vladimir Demin. Demin also said that the Chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, Nikolay Bagrov sent a proposal to the Ukrainian president for suspending his decree. The Crimean president's staff members said the enforcement of the decree would lead to destabilisation of the political situation in the Crimea because it contradicts the agreement on mutual respectful relations between Simferopol and Kiev. Reliable sources told ITAR-TASS that the Crimean leadership is planning to make their viewpoint on the Ukrainian president's intention to set up an office in the Crimea in a message addressed to the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States of America, as guarantors of stability in the Crimea, and to the participants in the trilateral Moscow accords signed in January during President Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow.
