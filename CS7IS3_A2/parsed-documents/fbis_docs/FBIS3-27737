KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took issue Monday [31 January] with a remark by the chief government spokesman that it would be difficult to propose income tax cuts in tandem with an increase in the consumption tax. Hosokawa told reporters he did not understand what Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura meant when he said the two issues should be considered separately. Takemura made the remark Sunday at a news conference in Takamatsu, western Japan. He said many leaders in the seven-party coalition share the view that income tax cuts should be implemented first. The increase in the consumption tax from 3 percent would cover revenue shortfall. Takemura seemed to be feeling the political heat Monday since Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii complained to him, saying he wanted both topics dealt with as a single package. Fujii said Takemura's remark made it difficult for him to fulfill his responsibilities as finance minister. Takemura tried to allay concern, telling reporters Monday that what he meant to convey was that a general view on tax issues had emerged within the seven-party coalition. A government source, meanwhile, insisted on spelling out the timing and the scale of raising the consumption tax in the bill, saying to do otherwise would be irresponsible of the Finance Ministry. At Sunday's press conference, Takemura said that on Wednesday or Thursday the government plans to announce a comprehensive package of pump-priming measures to lift the economy out of the doldrums. Government sources said the business stimulating measures will total 15 to 16 trillion yen and include 7 trillion yen in income and resident tax cuts.
