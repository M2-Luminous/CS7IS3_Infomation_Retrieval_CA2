Volkswagen engineers have perfected a device which cuts the engine off and makes it possible to roll with a stopped engine. Here is how. The Volkswagen engineers have made an "astounding" discovery. When a bicycle rider wants to stop, he stops pedalling! With this in mind, the German manufacturer is about to launch the first assembly line vehicle whose engine shuts off automatically when not in use: the Golf Ecomatic. However, what is natural on a bicycle is much more difficult to achieve on a car. Ensuring Safety The first difficulty is to perfect an electronic mechanism capable of cutting the engine when the driver takes his foot off the accelerator, and of restarting it when he steps on the gas pedal again, while also providing a great number of related safety functions such as maintaining power steering, lights, or power brakes. The wiring must for example be switched to an auxiliary battery each time the engine starts to avoid any voltage drop caused by the starter's high power drain. However, stopping and restarting the engine are not enough to recover all of the vehicle's energy. Its wheels must simultaneously be disconnected from the transmission so that the driver can exploit the momentum like a freewheeling cyclist. To this end, a servomechanism developed in collaboration with the German equipment maker Pierburg, activates the vehicle's clutch as soon as the gas pedal is released. This servomechanism's power supply when the clutch is depressed is assured by an electric diaphragm pump which operates independently of the car's engine. Valuable in City Traffic This device does not interfere with the driving of the vehicle, which is operated like a regular car. The only difference is that when the driver takes his foot off the gas, the engine is turned off and the car continues on its momentum, noiselessly, without using up gas and without exhaust. This automation device is particularly valuable in large urban concentrations where the engine can be shut off up to 60 percent of the time, which very strongly affects pollution and mileage. This system reduces carbon monoxide emissions by 36 percent, hydrocarbons and nitric oxides by 25 percent, and carbon dioxide by 21 percent. Another interesting advantage is that fuel consumption is also reduced by one liter per hundred kilometers compared to a car without the equipment. But Volkswagen claims that an experienced driver can beat this record. How? Simply by knowing how to build up his momentum.
