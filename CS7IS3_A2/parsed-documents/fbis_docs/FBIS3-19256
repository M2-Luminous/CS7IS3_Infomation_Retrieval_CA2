Germany will not be able to cope with recession and mass underemployment for some time because it has reacted to new challenges with old recipes and is continuing to do so. It has been resting on the laurels of the economic miracle and has failed to adapt to the rules of the new growth industries even as the its old industries are getting rid of more and more workers while production figures remain virtually the same. These are the views of Leo Nefiodow of the Society for Mathematics and Data Processing in Bonn who traces the recession to the theory of long economic cycles, the so-called Kondratieff cycles, named after Nicolai Kondratieff who stated his concept in a 1926 article in the ARCHIV FUER SOZIALWISSENSCHAFT AND SOZIALPOLITIK [Archives of Social Science and Social Policy]. The Dynamics of Growth According to this theory the economy is not only governed by short or medium-term cycles but also by growth cycles lasting some 50 years. They are the result of basic innovations such as the steam engine, electrical engineering, the automobile, or information technology which penetrate all areas of society. They sustain economic growth for decades and alter the ways in which societies organize themselves. Economies which were best at adapting to new rules and formulas for success and at making use of these fundamental innovations were able to offer good social services because of their leading technological position and to support large armies--such as 19th century England with the help of the steam engine, cotton, and steel. But because Great Britain held on to the coal and steel success formulas after 1890 and failed to adapt to the new challenges of the third Kondratieff cycle (electrical engineering and chemistry) and the fourth cycle as of 1950 (automobiles and petrochemicals) it was overtaken by the United States and Germany, Nefiodow says. Doubling Every Six Years Now it is the Japanese who are technologically and thus economically ahead and will probably be forging ahead politically as well because they have made the best use of the causes of the reorganization process which the industrial nations have been going through since the seventies, i.e. information technology and its applications which is having an increasingly rapid and widespread impact on all sectors of society. In a world which doubles its knowledge every six years it is no longer a question of more information but one of administering information properly to quickly get at the information one needs, Nefiodow says. In Japan, this led to economic growth independent of energy use while the largest German industries--automobiles, mechanical engineering, and chemistry--are part of the now-exhausted growth industries of the bygone, i.e. fourth Kondratieff cycle. Siemens-Nixdorf alone is holding its own on the world growth market of information technology in which the Japanese occupy a good to very good position with 20 companies. Why We Are Behind Why has Germany missed the connection to the fifth Kondratieff cycle? Nefiodow thinks that an aversion to technology is to blame and above all the social, cultural, and societal customs and mannerisms which keep us from listening to and motivating each other and to work together--which are the major preconditions for an information society. Thus, the Japanese with their group ethic oriented toward the common good (for the company and its individual departments) were better able to adapt to the success formulas of the fifth Kondratieff cycle than the Europeans with their secularized, individualistic ethic. This means that German enterprises must restructure their hierarchies and their hierarchical thinking and create teams which work together to solve complicated problems; teams in which information flows and can be applied quickly, in which small-time despots do not lord it over their colleagues and do not permit disputes to turn into power struggles which keep on festering until retirement. Everyone, regardless of rank, should be able to make a contribution in accordance with his/her knowledge and aptitude. The fifth Kondratieff cycle no longer calls for obedient, exchangeable workers but well-informed, loyal, and creative team players capable of interacting openly and cooperating with his colleagues. Sixth Cycle Is Coming Nefiodow thinks Germany does not stand a chance of catching up with Japan during the fifth Kondratieff cycle. The government, he says, should stop subsidizing shipyards and coal mines--the growth industries of the initial Kondratieff cycles--out of the national debt and put money into the development of future growth markets instead. If and when the sixth Kondratieff cycle comes in the next millenium, it, too, will be sustained by basic innovations independent of energy use. Nefiodow believes that Germany should bet on this new long-term cycle whose outlines are already becoming apparent. The candidates of the sixth cycle are information, the environment, and health. Well Prepared This Time Around Germany is extremely well prepared for the development and exploitation of these huge markets because of the high level of expertise in metal processing, metrology, control engineering, chemistry, software, and systems technology and above all because of the high degree of acceptance by the population of environmental, health amd information issues.
