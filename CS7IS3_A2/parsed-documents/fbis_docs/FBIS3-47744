Admiral Larson held an international news conference in Hanoi after his meetings with Vietnamese leaders. The following is the report from a Vietnamese radio correspondent on the contents of the news conference: [Begin recording] [Correspondent] A committee to investigate MIA cases during the Vietnam War was formed in January 1992 and an office in Hanoi was opened. The committee has been in operation for two years. In the past two years, this committee of five American soldiers -- including Naval, Marine, and Air Force personnel -- conducted 26 joint searches with the Vietnamese side to seek information about American soldiers dying and missing during the war. From 6-28 March this year, the committee will form four search teams and four recovery teams with 84 people to conduct the 27th joint search -- the biggest search ever. Admiral Charles Larson, commander of U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region, paid a visit to Vietnam on 16 January in view of the importance of this search. He directly met with Vietnamese leaders to deal with the settlement of the MIA issue. He also directly met with American and Vietnamese, who have taken part in the searches and directly inspected the search sites. He was the highest U.S. military official to visit Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War. After two days, Admiral Larson held an international news conference on 17 January in Hanoi to disclose the results of his Vietnam visit and offer his opinions on the search activities in Vietnam. Speaking to correspondents, he said: [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] We have conducted 846 searches and 59 excavations in Vietnam since the formation of our special force in January 1982. And we have learned many things. I am pleased to say that our country sent 5,600 notices to MIA families over the last year in a program that provides information to MIA families. I am also pleased at the efforts of the five people working on the sites. This requires good leadership, planning, and great effort. I can promise that I will try my best to achieve the possible in the search for missing people. I come here to witness the cooperation and effort from both sides. I met high-ranking Vietnamese leaders, specialists, and archivists. [Correspondent] In response to a Chinese reporter's question about his assessment of the Vietnamese cooperation in this aspect, Mr. Larson said: [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] I would say two things: First, we have found ever-increasing cooperation over the past two years since the task force began its work here. Second, if this cooperation was not good, I would not be here and would not appear in this uniform to see those people whom I have met. My assessment is that there has been very good cooperation. [Correspondent] Answering a question about the U.S. plan to search for servicemen missing in action, Mr. Larson said: [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] It needs to take into account all issues. We will do all we can, ranging from the evaluation of information on American servicemen, who are reported to be alive, to disinformation and other efforts. So far, throughout various searches and all the things we have done, we do not find any evidence indicating that there are American servicemen alive in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. However, we cannot and will not rule out that possibility until we have checked all the information available. [Correspondent] A Radio Voice of Vietnam correspondent asked: Do you have any idea about the assistance the U.S. Government will give to Vietnam in resolving its humanitarian issues? Mr. Larson said: [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] I think that the humanitarian issue exists and that just like us, they view the humanitarian issue as a very delicate matter. I think that our two countries have realized this is an issue and the two sides are cooperating to resolve it. I am very pleased to see that my government has realized this and it knows how to undertake it. During his visit to Vietnam in December 1993, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Winston Lord took with him a large dossier which I had the opportunity to read this morning at the joint archive center. We hope that this dossier will be useful in providing some information to those families with missing relatives. We will try to do what we can to help Vietnamese families concerned and we hope that we will receive reciprocal assistance from the Vietnamese people. [end recording]
