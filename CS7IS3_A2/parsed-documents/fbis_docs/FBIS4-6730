One senior South Korean Government official said, "the IAEA has made a decision to accept the North Korean proposal and conveyed its intention to send its inspectors to North Korea so that they can be present for the changing of nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor." As a result, IAEA inspectors could arrive in North Korea sometime next week as the nuclear fuel rods will likely be replaced in early or mid-May. The UN Security Council, in a statement by its president, urged North Korea to accept additional IAEA inspections before the middle of next month. "The IAEA has told North Korea to ensure safety measures needed by IAEA experts during the nuclear fuel rod changing," the official said, indicating that the agency and Pyongyang are still negotiating follow-up measures to the rod replacement and problems related to further checks. In particular, the IAEA is said to be stressing the need for additional inspections of the 5-megawatt reactor and a radiochemical laboratory, which Pyongyang refused to allow last time, he said.
