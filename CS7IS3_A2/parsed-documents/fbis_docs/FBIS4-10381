FBIS4-10381 "drlat070_b_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Haiti Senate Bloc Resolution Demands Elections Senate Bloc Resolution Demands Elections FL1104140594 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 11 Apr 94 FL1104140594 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Monitored in progress] [Text] ...by 11 of 13 votes, thanks notably to the votes of eight senators elected in the contested partial legislative elections of 18 January 1993 and not acknowledged by the international community. Article 149 stipulates that in the event of a vacancy in the Presidency of the Republic for any reason, the president of the Court of Cassation is invested provisionally with the powers of president of the Republic by the National Assembly, duly convened by the prime minister. It stipulates also that new presidential elections will take place within 45 to 90 days after the beginning of the vacancy. In this precise case, the senators pointed out that the elections, which will be presidential, legislative, municipal, and local, could be held after the 90-day deadline in order to respect the constitutional electoral calendar. The parliamentarians who passed this resolution intend to send it to the Chamber of Deputies on 11 April and to inform the president of the Court of Cassation, Emile Jonassaint, of their decision. No senators from the National Front for Change and Democracy or the [Constitutionalist] Anticorruption Alliance were seen at the 10 April session, where political leaders spoke. The leaders of Mobilization for National Development [MDN, headed by Hubert de Ronceray], Haitian Party of God [the Reverend Richard Vladimir Jeanty], and Democratic National Rally Party [Constant D. Pognon] explained the resolution of the Coordinating Committee for National Mobilization [CCMN]. After the vote, the MDN leader expressed his satisfaction and made the following clarification before the microphone of Leontes Dorzilme: [Begin De Ronceray recording, in Creole] You must not confuse the stance of CCMN and that of MDN. The latter takes and always has taken a stand in favor of Justice Joseph C. Nerette, whereas CCMN has never cited any name. It merely demands the implementation of Article 149 with the formation of a provisional, ad hoc government. It does not specify any names. So, we cannot say CCMN is satisifed or dissatisfied with Justice Jonassaint or Justice Nerette. I would like to make this distinction: This problem concerns MDN and does not concern CCMN. [end recording] It should be recalled that the Chamber of Deputies has already approved a plan for the resolution of the crisis. This plan is backed by the United States and the United Nations and is not yet supported by the opposing bloc of the Senate headed by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, who is acknowledged by the international community. For his part, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has rejected this plan, which provides for the installation of a prime minister after the early retirement of the head of the Army, General Raoul Cedras, but sets no date for his return to Haiti. It must also be said that the resolution passed on 10 April states that the new provisional president will have to handle the international embargo against Haiti.
