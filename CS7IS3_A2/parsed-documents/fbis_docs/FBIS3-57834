Supreme party manager of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] -- is this a dream job? [Verheugen] Certainly not. In practice, the federal manager is responsible for all the flops, while the others claim credit for the achievements. [FOCUS] Your predecessors were not exactly treated leniently by your party .... [Verheugen] ...which is why I am rather surprised about the support that I have found. [FOCUS] How would you describe the state of your combative troops before the super election year? [Verheugen] We have at least reached a point at which the SPD is no longer giving contradictory signals. The leadership is standing shoulder to shoulder and is ready to act. There are no pending controversial issues. The party congress resolutions have been accepted by the individual minorities. [FOCUS] It is hard to believe that the SPD should have assumed the mood of victor so quickly? [Verheugen] Some risks will always remain. One risk is of being the favorite, something into which we have grown. I am warning my friends in the party: We are far from having achieved what we want. The election will only be won after we have polled sufficient votes. Another cause of insecurity is the situation in terms of foreign policy. After all, conservative politicians might like to see a lasting crisis in Russia, which they could use for domestic policy purposes. [FOCUS] How should Germany react to the situation in Russia? [Verheugen] We must not build up a new enemy image of Russia. Some people in the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] will try to exaggerate the citizens' security needs and turn it into an issue in the election campaign. How this works was shown by the CDU during the Cold War of the fifties and sixties. [FOCUS] It was then that it won majorities. What do you suggest? [Verheugen] What would be more important now is a policy that is coordinated with our Western allies and the European Union that would make it possible for Russia really to use its chance for democratic reform and economic renewal. We must continue to support the democratic forces, which do not only include Boris Yeltsin. [FOCUS] Not everybody takes a great interest in politics across national borders, which can be seen in the German discussion on Europe. [Verheugen] In this connection the SPD is sometimes closer to the chancellor than his own sister party. As far as the necessity for European unity is concerned, we share Helmut Kohl's view. Edmund Stoiber's hostile policy toward Europe is populistic, irresponsible, and dangerous. His only objective is to make the CSU win more than 5 percent in the European elections. Stoiber's claim that European unification was no longer up-do-date proves his absolute ignorance as far as the European security situation is concerned. The decisive guarantee for peace is that there is no relapse into a policy of national interests. Since Stoiber continues to spread his theses, an anti-Europe party is now being founded. [FOCUS] The SPD will also be fighting for every single vote in the coming 18 elections. What tricks do you have in store? [Verheugen] Solid ones. After all, I do not think that the people expect any gimmicks from the parties. We have to conduct an election campaign that is completely different from previous years. The only effect of the traditional sharp controversies and mudslinging would be for the citizens to turn their backs on the parties in disgust. First of all, we must regain the non-voter's interest in politics. This group constitutes more than 40 percent of the population.... [FOCUS] ... and they do not want to hear any more shallow promises. [Verheugen] Which is why we must give concrete answers to their questions. Honesty in the run-up to the election is imperative. This applies to finance, the labor market, social issues, the environment, and the personalities of our government team. [FOCUS] The SPD has so far not offered any details. [Verheugen] This will change once our government program is completed in late March. It will contain in great detail all the burdens that the people can expect, how much we can save, the areas where a fairer distribution is necessary, and what we intend to do to improve the labor market. [FOCUS] The election campaign will be tough this year. Can a fairness agreement between the parties prevent uncouth attacks? [Verheugen] We had that before, in 1980. But it did not work. A new attempt would have to be given much thought; but I do not rule it out. What we certainly need is for the parties themselves to promise to limit the mudslinging and to treat their political opponents fairly. [FOCUS] There are plans to abolish the television debates because extremist parties have filed court complaints against their exclusion. [Verheugen] As far as I am concerned, the discussions between the leading candidates of the parties are the climax of an election campaign, which is why I would not scrap these programs, even if representatives of the radical Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] or the Republikaner were to participate in them. We must force these parties to say what they really stand for. CDU headquarters would prefer the federal chancellor not to participate in such rounds. Still, I do not expect the leaders of the democratic parties to leave the field to Mr. Gysi or Mr. Schoenhuber, no matter how eloquent these gentlemen may be. [FOCUS] In previous television discussions in Bonn after the landtag elections only a select group of people would sit together. [Verheugen] And what was the result? After the Hamburg Burgess election the bizarre situation arose that the Greens, who won more than 10 percent of the vote, were not represented at all. It was then that I said that I would not do that again. However, there are signs of a change. The decision on a new plan will be made this week: According to the public radio and television stations all the parties that are represented in the Bundestag should participate in such rounds, that is to say including the Greens and the PDS. [FOCUS] In the United States the election campaign is dominated by the electronic media. When will German politicians stop appearing in local taverns? [Verheugen] An assembly in the back room of some cafe certainly does not make a lot of sense. However, particularly in the election campaign I would not like to do without talking directly with the voters. Of course we also need television. However, we are still limiting ourselves to conventional spots. We simply cannot afford to buy time on private stations. No party would financially survive an electronic election campaign. In the United States television commercials of up to 20 minutes are nothing unusual. [FOCUS] Such spots cost about 3 million German marks [DM]. [Verheugen] Exactly, and we have reduced our budget for the 1994 European and Bundestag election to just under DM100 million. Still, the U.S.-style election campaign on television is bound to come. As soon as one party starts it, the others will have to follow suit -- maybe as early as in 1998. [FOCUS] Nevertheless, this year you will have to think about the fragmentation of the party landscape in Germany. [Verheugen] I am greatly worried about the continuing split-up of our party system. It is threatening the predictability and stability of the democratic parliamentary system. Even now the classic three-party system has been smashed -- incidentally, with the effect that the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] has been drawn into a struggle for survival. [FOCUS] Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt sees the republic in danger, which is why he is pleading for an English- or U.S.-style majority voting system. [Verheugen] I would, generally, warn against meddling with the electoral law with the sole purpose of evading current political difficulties. One would always have to pay for it.
