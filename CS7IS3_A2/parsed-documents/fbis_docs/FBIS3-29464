Kocarnik and Zieleniec are members of the Czech delegation currently visiting Thailand and headed by Czech President Vaclav Havel. Zieleniec said that by signing the agreements, the two parties wanted to indicate that their relations were "more intensive and surpassed the phase of acquainting each other." At the Czech visitors' meeting with Thai representatives today, the discussion focused on a future cooperation between the countries associated in the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, and the Asian Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), of which Thailand is member. "The agreement on this sort of cooperation is very important for us, since Asian countries are known for their protectionism," Zieleniec said. Kocarnik informed journalists that the Thai partners were well acquainted with the economic situation in the Czech Republic, which they found "unambiguously the best of all" post-communist countries. "The premier (Chuan Likphai) even said he was sorry about the shortage of (Czech-made) Skoda cars which Thailand had imported," Kocarnik said. He added that Thai bankers intended to establish a bank in Prague which would promote mutual trade. Likphai gave today a ceremonial dinner to honour Havel. At the dinner, Havel briefly outlined possibilities of the Czech-Thai cooperation on third markets. Havel today toured some of Bangkok's monuments, including the statue of Emerald Buddha, Thailand's most adored Buddha. On Sunday [13 February] he is to visit the ancient city of Ayutthaia, former Thai capital.
