While launching the sweep operation in Pailin City, the KRAF made an appeal and gave an assurance in line with the national reconciliation policy of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, which stresses: 1. The Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] still recognizes all compatriots as Cambodian citizens like all innocent Cambodians in general who are currently living with the RGC. The RGC always cares about the fate of all compatriots. 2. The RGC guarantees its recognition of the ownership of land, houses, and all other property that the compatriots possess currently in line with the provisions of the existing laws of the Kingdom of Cambodia. But, the obstinate Khmer Rouge ringleaders did not heed this appeal. They instead launched attacks against the KRAF. In the combat for self-defense, the KRAF killed 35 hardheaded Khmer Rouge elements on the spot; seized a tank, 453 assorted guns, 70 metric tons of assorted ammunition, dozens of tons of war materiel, two bulldozers, a Toyota car, a 751-A cistern, (?a jeep), and 80-meter radio antenna.
