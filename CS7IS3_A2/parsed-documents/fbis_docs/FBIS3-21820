The government, however, through Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, continues to resist this transfer. Today, the Attorney General's Office said its Medellin representative requested the transfer of the five people charged with being lieutenants of the late drug trafficker Pablo Escobar Gaviria. A communique issued today by the Attorney General's Office states that, based on Article 35 of the Penal Procedures Code, the Medellin Cartel members must be accessible to the prosecutor in charge of their case, thereby allowing preliminary meetings and agreements. The government thinks differently however. [Begin Gonzalez recording] Regarding their transfer, I have stated that, in our opinion, it is not advisable to gather the remaining Medellin Cartel members in the same place. [end recording]
