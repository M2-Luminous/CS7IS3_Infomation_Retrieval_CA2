Abreu categorically rejected this possibility. Nevertheless, he said he would carefully review this issue. Denying the document that circulated in the United Nations, the foreign minister stressed: "There is not a single possibility for Uruguay to be a drug trafficking center." For his part, Jose Luis Ovalle, the Free Trade Zones national director, said this document is almost one month old. This information has been picked up from the press, he said, adding that the entire issue is inaccurate. Abreu also pointed out that during his visit to the United States to participate in the OAS General Assembly in which current Colombian President Cesar Gaviria was elected new OAS secretary general, he met his Argentine counterpart, Guido Di Tella, with whom he discussed the Martin Garcia Canal issue. During these talks, compliance with the agreements reached by the two countries on the Martin Garcia Canal was confirmed, Abreu said. Abreu added that Gaviria's appointment as OAS secretary general is good news and that his candidacy allowed the achievement of a Latin American consensus. Gaviria will step down this year and take over the OAS General Secretariat in August. Gaviria's candidacy was supported by Uruguay and the rest of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] partners. During Gaviria's campaign, Abreu conducted negotiations to enhance a Latin American consensus, a political goal pursued by the Uruguayan foreign minister for a long time.
