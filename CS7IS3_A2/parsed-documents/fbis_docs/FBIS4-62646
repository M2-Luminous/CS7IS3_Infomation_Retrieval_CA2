They expressed concern about the fact that in accordance with a presidential decree, all of the Russian procurator-general deputies had been dismissed and wanted to know the reasoning behind the decision. Russian legislators also voted on Wednesday to invite head of presidential administration Sergey Filatov to a plenary session of the State Duma to answer to their inquiries related to President Yeltsin's letter in regard of the law on the status of a State Duma deputy, which he signed earlier. They were dissatisfied with explanations which were offered by the chief of the Main Legal Department under the Russian president Ruslan Orekhov at a plenary session of the Duma last Friday.
