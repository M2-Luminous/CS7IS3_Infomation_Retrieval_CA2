"We've done some benchmarking by taking the most relevant competitors for the Chinese companies," said Trevor MacMurray, managing director of McKinsey's Hong Kong office. A comparison in the steel industry, for example, showed that the performance of the top three Chinese companies matched those of the top Asian competitors. Mr MacMurray predicted that some Chinese industrial names would make it big in the international arena in the next five to 10 years as they pursued aggressive overseas expansion. McKinsey, which is working on a pilot project involving four key state enterprises in Shanghai and backed by the World Bank has done benchmarking for the energy, telecommunications, consumer goods and financial industries. "Again, in the energy sector, the Chinese enterprises have good technical capability, particularly in exploration and production," said Mr MacMurray, adding that the problem the industry faced was the shortage of funds. He predicted that with the reforms of the state enterprises, China would ultimately have an industrial structure similar to those elsewhere, where the market was dominated by multiple players. At present, there were many state enterprises producing 30 or 40 products to serve a local region rather than focusing on a few products which they could produce efficiently. The state enterprise reform meant they would have to run their own distribution and marketing system, which would force them to understand the pricing structure of products. Mr MacMurray said a difficult aspect of the reform was the separation of the corporations' social obligations. "The social costs can well be over a third of the total costs of running the business. As you can imagine, it has a lot of social implications, so it's not easy."
