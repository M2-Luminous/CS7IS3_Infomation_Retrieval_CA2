It was attended by delegates from enterprises in various industrial sectors, the budget-funded sphere, and rural residents; leaders of a number of firms, joint-stock companies, and sectoral trade unions; as well as V. Goncharov, deputy chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia. Despite being officially invited, the oblast administration, which, incidentally, unilaterally terminated its involvement in the tripartite oblast commission for the resolution of labor conflicts shortly beforehand, ignored this representative assembly. But the question under discussion at the conference is highly topical: "The socioeconomic situation in the Kuzbass and tactics in the prevailing conditions." The situation in the region is extraordinary and is steadily deteriorating. One by one enterprises are coming to a standstill. The total credit indebtedness has topped 2 trillion rubles [R]. And production is continuing to decline. Thus production dropped 21 percent last year in sectors working for the consumer market. Workers' wages depreciated 20 percent a month. Miners alone have currently failed to receive R29 billion in wages and the figure is around R24 billion for budget-funded personnel.... The further stratification of society is proceeding at an accelerated pace. Some 18-24 months ago the income of the poor was one-third or one-fourth that of the rich, now it is lower by a factor of 26! And what about underlying unemployment? There are now 78,000 people on enforced extended leave or working a reduced working day. The conference participants adopted a set of demands to put to the government and the president. The main ones being that a program for socioeconomic transformations and a solution to the economic crisis be published within one month and that a mechanism be established to provide compensation for the damage done to the health of the oblast's population by environmental pollution. In view of the prevailing situation and the opinion of labor collectives, it was decided to declare a general strike in the oblast and elect a coordinating council of labor collective representatives.
