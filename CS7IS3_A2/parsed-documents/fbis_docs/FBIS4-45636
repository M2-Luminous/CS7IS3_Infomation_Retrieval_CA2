In any case, the Inter-departmental Commission for Ecological Safety of the Russian Security Council has moved to include without fail an article in those documents, laying down that the processed wastes should be returned to the countries from where they had arrived," Chairman of the Commission Aleksey Yablokov stated here today. There are several legislative acts in Russia today, regulating the processing of foreign radioactive wastes on its territory. For instance, the law on the protection of the environment prohibits the import and storage of such wastes on Russian territory. However, Russia's inter-governmental agreements with Finland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and the former German Democratic Republic stipulate that wastes from nuclear power plants, built in those countries with the participation of the USSR, should be processed in Russia. No such document was signed with Hungary. Yablokov said that Russia could, in principle, continue the job of processing radioactive wastes, but only at the request of foreign states, on a commercial basis, and with their obligatory "repatriation". There is a special plant at Chelyabinsk-45, but it is able to process wastes only from nuclear-propelled submarines and VVER-type reactors. The construction of the Krasnoyarsk-26 plant, designed to process wastes from RBMK (Chernobyl-type) reactors, has still not been completed. More than two trillion roubles are needed to finish the project. Yablokov said that the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy was planning to meet a part of this sum by concluding an agreement with Hungary. However, the money that it will get from this is obviously not enough, the specialist said. Yablokov also believes that "it is high time to revise the closed nuclear cycle concept", used until now. According to this system, enriched uranium and plutonium from nuclear power plants were used to make nuclear warheads. But since they are no longer needed, radioactive materials could "simply be kept for several tens of years" in special storages. They would lose much of their radioactivity by the end of that period and could be safely buried.
