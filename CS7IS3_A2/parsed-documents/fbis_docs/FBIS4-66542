Katyal] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--Any move of the type, contemplated by Pakistan at the U.N. Human Rights Commission, for the despatch of a fact-finding commission to Jammu and Kashmir would be totally unacceptable to India, a senior External Affairs Ministry official said today. India had launched a major diplomatic operation to counter Pakistan's plan and, as such, there could have been no ambiguity about New Delhi's stand. But a categorical statement was considered necessary to reinforce the argument about the futility of such a move. At this stage, a clear picture of the measure of support--or opposition--to Pakistan's move is not available. But there are two significant indications--Russia will oppose the resolution and China will remain neutral. The points made by the official were known, too, but a reiteration was intended to convey a message, loud and clear. The draft resolution, circulated by the Pakistan Government among some diplomats in Islamabad, contained its version of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, with an overdrawn picture of excesses by the security forces and alleged repressive measures by the State administration, and called for a visit there of a fact-finding mission. This was also the purport of the resolution Islamabad wanted to move at the U.N., (but was not pressed in the absence of assurances of adequate support). India, according to the official, was opposed to the proposed Pakistani move because of its dubious character. There was nothing to be investigated, he said, as Jammu and Kashmir was not a closed State, and a large number of visitors, including tourists, jurists and media personnel, had been there. The Government would be prepared, according to him, to discuss the plan for visit to the State by any group provided its purpose is transparent and objective honourable. The draft resolution, in his view, had a political purpose (behind the cloak of human rights)--to maximise the advantage gained by Pakistan through its instigation and support of terrorist violence in the Kashmir Valley. "We oppose the resolution in letter and spirit," he said. The resolution was seen as marking a deviation from the Shimla Agreement, that committed the two sides to a bilateral approach, and running counter to the process, that had begun with the resumption of the Foreign Secretary-level dialogue. India, he stressed, was for continuing negotiations as was evident from its action in submitting six proposals to Pakistan for a smooth working relationship. Pakistan had embarked upon a major diplomatic drive to secure support for its move. It had sent formal notes, held extensive briefing sessions, despatched special envoys to various capitals. It had sought to make full use of the sensitivities of the industrialised countries on the human rights issue.
