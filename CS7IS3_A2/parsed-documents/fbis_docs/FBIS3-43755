Van der Westhuizen confirmed this week that the ACDP had approached Local Government and Planning Minister Tertius Delport, known as a hardliner in President F.W. de Klerk's cabinet, to join the party's leadership. Delport has denied he was about to resign from the National Party [NP] to join the ACDP, saying it was a community-based party that could play a positive role in local government elections. Delport [word indistinct] on "like minded parties to join forces against the African National Congress" [ANC] [word indistinct] Westhuizen, whose house is being used as the headquarters of the new party, [words indistinct] in mobilising anti-ANC blacks since 1986 when he was an official of the MI front organisation Adult Education Consultants (known as AdEd), which spent more than R[rand]150-million of taxpayers' money on secret projects aimed at undermining the ANC and its internal allies. Before that, Van der Westhuizen and Delport were colleagues at the University of Port Elizabeth, [UPE], at the time an Afrikaner Broederbond [Afrikaner brotherhood] stronghold. Van der Westhuizen said the new party had no links with his MI past. "I haven't even talked to those guys for many years," he said. AdEd Consultants was set up in 1986 by Dr Louis Pasques, a Pretoria educationist awarded the Star of Africa in 1987 by ex- president P.W. Botha for "service to state security". It spawned a host of other front organisations across the country. One of these was the close corporation Laborel in Johannesburg, of which Van der Westhuizen was the frontman. A hallmark of many of Pasques' organisations was the use of the word "Christian" in their names, hiding their political motivation behind purportedly charitable and religious work. Most of these fell under the South African Christian Cultural Organisation (SACCO), also founded by Pasques. SACCO's secret and state-funded activities were exposed by the MAIL & GUARDIAN last year. The purpose of these "Christian cultural organisations" was to lecture "moderates" in the coloured and black communities on the "total onslaught on the country". Although most of the organisations did some legitimate work to hide their covert activities, they were largely sponsored by the South African Defence Force from secret state funds. As AdEd consultants' research manager, Van der Westhuizen was directly involved in its covert work. According to a letter written by Pasques in June 1986 and addressed to Dr Das Herbst of the Ministry of Defence, Van der Westhuizen and his wife were behind a youth organisation in Port Elizabeth which was established with the express purpose of opposing the ANC-aligned UDF [United Democratic Front]. Van der Westhuizen was also personally involved in giving political instruction to 200 members of Inkatha secretly trained by the SADF [South African Defence Force] in Namibia in 1986. AdEd also helped Allan Hendrickse's Labour Party win three by- elections through weekend seminars in Cape Town in 1987. SADF - printed certificates were awarded to Labour Party organisers who successfully completed the electioneering course. The idea behind the seminars was apparently to boost the coloured vote to give legitimacy to the discredited tricameral system. Front companies were at the time used by MI to create, train, support, assist and advise "moderate" black organisations which they believed would undermine the ANC. These included the black consciousness AmaAfrica organisation of the reverend Ebenezer Maqina in Port Elizabeth. AmaAfrica was directly involved in violent attacks on ANC supporters. The friendship between Van der Westhuizen and Delport goes back to the mid-1980s when both were lecturing at the University of Port Elizabeth. Delport was dean of the law faculty while Van der Westhuizen was a senior lecturer in political studies at UPF. Questions about the extend of Delport's involvement in secret government projects at the time remain unanswered. He is implicated in documents released last year by Transkei military ruler General Bantu Holomisa, but no direct evidence of his involvement has been produced. Delport's name is mentioned in a letter written by Brigadier CP ("Joffel") van der Westhuizen dated June 13 1986, marked "top secret" and addressed to the chief of the army. The letter deals with a plan relating to "stability and state security" in the Eastern Cape, and concludes that an alternative must be found for unsuccessful efforts to activate "pro-RSA [Republic of South Africa] resistance movements". A "Professor Delport, Dean UPE Faculty of Law", is identified by Van der Westhuizen as one of three people who were "partly" aware of the plan. The other two are military men -- General Gleeson (SADF Deputy Commander) and General Van Deventer (Ciskei Ambassador). This week Drickus Botha, a former Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] employee who was also an official of AdEd, denied that he and Delport were involved in "Operation Grammet", launched in Port Elizabeth in the mid-1980s and described by an insider as "war games". The exact nature of Grammet is not clear. Botha until recently headed an AdEd front organisation in Pretoria, registered as MMD Makealaars. Another former Armscor employee, Peet du Preez, has been implicated in Operation Grammet. He could not be contacted for comment. The ACDP which was launched in December by Van der Westhuizen, says it is strongly federalist and believes that participation in the transition is the most effective way of achieving its goals. since its inception it has embarked on a membership drive, trying to attack what it believes to be a massive constituency of undecided Christians. It was launched in Natal this week. According to reports, Delport was disillusioned with the NP's weak stand on federalism and local government and was seeking a new political home. He was due to attend a meeting of the ACDP recently, but pulled out at the last moment. In his press statement on Monday, Delport emphasised that voters who supported the same principles as the NP, but who for historical or other reasons were not ready to support the party, were not political enemies of the NP. He said he had no intention of resigning from the NP and stated his unequivocal support for the NP and its leader, F.W. de Klerk. In political circles the establishment of the ACDP is seen as a panic reaction by NP-supporting whites now that it has become clear that the party is unable to make significant inroads into the black community. Many NP members believe the decision not to change the party's name as part of a strategy to actively recruit black members was a fatal mistake. De Klerk, according to observers, did not want to allow a name-change out of fear of losing existing white support. He believed the NP could still solicit strong black support. This belief was echoed by the NP's election chief, Olaus van Zyl, who at an NP press conference in Pretoria on Wednesday argued that his party would still make huge inroads into black communities once its message became clear. However, a survey carried out in November and December last year by the Human Sciences Research Council [HSRC] indicates the opposite. Black support for the NP has dropped steadily from July 1992 and is currently at about one percent. Comment the HSRC pollsters: "The fall from the NP's seven to eight percent level of support in late 1992 to the October-November 1993 level suggests a loss of around a million African votes -- by far the biggest element in the NP's decline over the period." The survey confirms serious doubts within NP circles about the party's ability to stop the ANC from achieving a landslide victory at the polls. NP officials are worried that the ANC may win an outright two-thirds majority, which will allow it to rewrite the transitional constitution without opposition. Some cabinet members support the idea of an alliance with homeland parties like the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], Gazankulu's Ximoko [Whip of the Nation] Party and QwaQwa's Dikwankwetla [strong] Party. The problem is that these parties, with the exception of the IFP, command very little popular support.
