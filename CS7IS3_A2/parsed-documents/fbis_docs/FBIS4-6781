FBIS4-6781 "dreas079_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 North Korea Hwarang Exercises Denounced Hwarang Exercises Denounced SK2404090494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0810 GMT 24 Apr 94 SK2404090494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique on April 22 announced a plan of "Hwarang" war exercises involving the puppet Army, police and "homeland reserve force", more than 1.3 million strong, according to a radio report from Seoul. The 5-day exercises will begin on April 25 with Inchon and Kyonggi Province adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line as the theatre. The facts clearly prove once again that the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique is trying to find a way out of the crisis in the provocation of a war against the North, following in the footsteps of the preceding military fascist dictators. The fact that the plan of a massive war game was declared right after the powder-reeking trip to Seoul of the U.S. defense secretary fully reveals that the criminal tour was aimed at egging the puppet clique on to provoke another war against the North.
