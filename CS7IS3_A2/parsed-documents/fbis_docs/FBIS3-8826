The Austrian Government has invested a great deal of energy and effort to ensure that peace is reached. We genuinely hope for peace rather than war. We hope that human rights, mentioned in the draft constitution, will become reality: the right to life, to freedom, to free movement, to differing views. Asked to comment on the deployment in Bosnia-Herzegovina of Russian troops as part of the UN contingent, Dr. Silajdzic said: I was in Moscow three days ago. I was open about my concern at the way the Russians have become involved. Several weeks ago Zhirinovskiy visited the aggressor's territories and made nationalistically charged speeches. Soon afterwards Russian troops arrived in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Government was not consulted. The Russian troops have been deployed at locations in Sarajevo as well. We fear that Sarajevo will be divided. We fear a new war there. We shall do our utmost to ensure that a new Berlin wall is not erected there. We are, nevertheless, concerned. Asked how stable the foundations of the new Bosnian-Croatian trust are and if they could be undermined again in view of the fact that until recently the two people have been engaged in a bloody war, Silajdzic said: Everything is possible. The crucial point is that a stable cease-fire, especially in Sarajevo and Mostar, has come about as a direct result of the current rounds of negotiations. This gives us encouragement and strength to persevere. We hope for the best, Prime Minister Silajdzic said among other things.
