FR940318-0-00009 FR940318-0-00002 (E) 12-channel pipettor (Titerek). (F) 50 μL pipettor (Pipetman P200). (G) Pipette tips. (H) 0.5 percent homologous red blood cells (RBC's) in PBS (use RBC's from the same species being tested). (I) Plate-sealing tape. (J) Mirrored plate reader. (ii) Microtiter hemagglutination antigen (HA) titration. (A) Perform standard hemagglutination test (HA) on mycoplasma antigen to determine titer of antigen. ( 1 ) Dispense 50 μL of PBS into each well of 3 rows of a 96-well microtiter plate. ( 2 ) Dispense 50 μL of stock antigen into the wells of 2 rows. ( 3 ) Perform serial two-fold dilutions (50 μL) using a 12-channel pipettor. The dilution series will be from 1:2 to 1:4096. ( 4 ) Add 50 μL of 0.5 percent homologous RBC's to each well of all 3 rows. The row with no antigen serves as an RBC control. (B) Incubate at room temperature (approximately 30 minutes) until the control RBC's give tight buttons. The HA titer is read as the last well to give a complete lawn (hemagglutination). The desired endpoint is 4 HA units. The well containing the 1:4 dilution should give a complete HA while the 1:8 dilution should show less than complete HA. (C) Dilute stock antigen to 4 HA units for the HI test. The dilution required to give 4 HA units is calculated by dividing the stock antigen HA titer by 8. (Example: 1:320 HA units 8 = 40, dilute stock antigen 1:40.) (iii) Hemagglutination inhibition assay. (A) Label one column (A to H) of a 96-well, U-bottom microtiter plate for each sample, each positive and negative control sera, antigen backtitration, and RBC control. (B) Add 40 μL of PBS to the top row of wells (row A) of the plate. (C) Add 25 μL of PBS to all remaining wells of the plate. (D) Add 10 μL of each test sera to well A of each column (making a 1:5 sera dilution). (E) Serially dilute 25 μL from well A through H using a 12-channel pipettor. Discard the final 25 μL. Row A = 1:5...row H = 1:640. (F) With an Oxford doser, add 25 μL of 4 HA unit antigen to wells B through H. Well A serves as sera control. (G) Prepare an antigen backtitration by adding 25 μL of PBS to each well of one column. Add 25 μL of diluted antigen to well A and serially dilute 25 μL from wells A to D. This prepares 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16 dilutions. (It is recommended that the antigen control backtitration be performed before the diluted antigen is used in the assay. Dilution problems could be detected and corrected before the inappropriately diluted antigen is used in the assay.) (H) Leave a column of wells blank for an RBC control. (I) Agitate gently and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. (J) Add 50 μL of 0.5 percent RBC's to all wells. Note: Do not agitate after RBC's have been added (agitation may result in false positive reactions by causing the RBC's to fall, resulting in ``false'' buttons). (K) Cover the plate with sealing tape. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes or until control RBC's give a tight button. (L) Read the reaction on a mirrored plate reader. (iv) Results. (A) The titer is reported as the reciprocal of the last dilution to give a tight button of RBC's. The final dilution scheme includes the antigen in the dilution calculation and is as follows: B=1:20, C=1:40, D=1:80, E=1:160, F=1:320, G=1:640, H=1:1,280. (B) For the assay to be valid: ( 1 ) The positive control sera must give a result within one dilution of the previously determined titer. ( 2 ) The negative control sera must be negative. ( 3 ) The backtitration of the antigen must be 1:4 or 1:8. ( 4 ) The RBC control must give tight, non-hemolyzed buttons. ( 5 ) Sera controls (well A of each test sera) must not have non-specific agglutination or hemolysis. If negative, report as ``negative with non-specific agglutination or non-specific hemolysis'' or ``unable to evaluate due to non-specific agglutination or hemolysis'' or treat the serum to remove the non-specific agglutination and repeat the test. (See paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section.) (v) Treatment to remove non-specific agglutination. (A) Purpose. Treatment of serum to remove non-specific agglutination that is interfering with HI assays. (B) Specimen. Serum. (C) Materials. Homologous RBC's (chicken or turkey), 50 percent solution PBS, centrifuge, incubator, 4C (refrigerator). (D) Procedure. ( 1 ) Prepare a 1:5 dilution of test serum by adding 50 μL of serum to 200 μL of PBS.
