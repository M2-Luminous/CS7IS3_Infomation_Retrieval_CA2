Dubinin said the collection rate of taxes fluctuated around 60 percent at the moment, which is obviously insufficient. The Finance Ministry put forward a number of proposals to increase the tax influx to the state budget. In part, the proposals involve taxation bodies' registering all accounts of enterprises, including hard currency ones, and collecting taxes directly from the accounts. At the same time, Dubinin pointed out that the tax basis shrank due to an economic decline. He said taxes collected in the first quarter of 1994 were equal to seven percent of the gross domestic product against 10 percent last year. In March, the situation was stabilized at last year's level, he added. Dubinin supported further improvement of the existing taxation system which needed adjustment rather than reformation. "The existing set of taxes may be reduced, but not changed for another one," he pointed out. Dubinin put a special emphasis on the fact that the federation items had been granted the right to impose their own taxes, a right which it would be "very unreasonable to take away from them."
