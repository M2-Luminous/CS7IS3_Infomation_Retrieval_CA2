We offer for readers' attention the strategy of a way out of the crisis formulated by the Organizing Committee of the People's Party of the Republic of Tajikistan and the Executive Committee of the Tajik Association of Furtherance of the Cooperation and Progress of the Peoples of Central Asia (TASS PNTsA). This strategy was formulated on the basis of specific features based on a scientific historical analysis of all the conditions of the real life and a recognition of the cultural, national, and historical traditions and customs of the peoples of Tajikistan and the use of what is best from the experience of the world community. It proceeds from the fact that there are real opportunities--the scientific and technological potential, the major industrial base, competent personnel--for overcoming the crisis in the republic. The Organizing Committee of the People's Party of the Republic of Tajikistan and the TASS PNTsA Executive Committee believe that it is possible with prudent and professional government to considerably replenish the domestic market and increase the export potential and that it is still possible to halt the outflow of the Russian-speaking population and the interconnected processes of the impoverishment of society and the decline in production. It is essential to this end to undertake in practice economic reforms and privatization in order that they serve the emancipation and recovery of the economy; to transfer ownership, of the land included, to those who are capable by honest labor and economic enterprise of enriching society and themselves; by means of economic, political, ideological, law enforcement, and all other measures permitted by law to eliminate the omnipotence of bureaucratism in the organs of power and administration and to put a stop to the orgy of crime and corruption; to ensure glasnost for decision-making on questions of the formation of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the National Security Service, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and also of the use of material resources; to actively contribute to the preservation and strengthening of the all-around ties of the Republic of Tajikistan to the independent states, which have taken shape over many decades, and to the establishment of equal, mutually beneficial relations with countries of all continents. The denationalization of property and privatization could serve to revitalize production, preserve the existing and create new jobs, lift the restrictions on the growth of wages, and realize the right of the participants in the economic process to the results of their labor. The first step on a way out of the crisis should be the restoration both of the intrarepublic market and the common economic space. All production and service structures may function normally only with mutually acceptable agreements on prices and tariffs providing for guarantees of their fulfillment and penalties for those who violate them. Everyone should grasp the obvious fact here that for a way out of the crisis and the all-around recovery of production, the imposition of world prices on the domestic market would be the final blow to the economy and the reduction of the population to total poverty. The organs of power and administration must draw up and implement specific (in terms of sector and time frame) and long-term programs of the enlistment of producers in the market economy. Required for this are the reorientation of the production structures and the infrastructure connected with them toward commercial success, consideration of the requirements of the consumer, an expansion of the market, the emancipation of the distribution mechanism, advisory and research services and technical assistance, long-term bank loans on justified terms, and the introduction of the progressive taxation of profits from the products of monopoly enterprises, for which free prices are established, and also a system of taxation that does not fetter enterprise. State support for small and medium-sized business and the development of new forms of ownership in the countryside are needed likewise. On the whole, it is impossible to accomplish the economic tasks without a solicitous attitude toward the production potential created by many generations. It is essential to this end to restore to an economically and socially justified level the working capital of the state-owned enterprises, which has been reduced in recent years; establish maximum prices of energy and products of the structure-forming sectors; determine the criteria and procedure of the computation of production costs; put an end to the flawed practice of the establishment of "free prices" of products in short supply, imported products included, merely with regard to the growing demand for them, but without consideration of their prime costs and transport and merchandising outlays. The program of enterprise privatization should provide for the competition of privatization scenarios (projects), including guarantees of an increase in product competitiveness, and conditions of the employment and remuneration of the work force. Employees who have actively contributed to its privatization may enjoy preferential terms for the purchase of stock. And the enterprises should be authorized to sell their products themselves, bypassing the commodity markets. With any diversity of forms of ownership in the Republic of Tajikistan, the land, water, major hydraulic engineering works, mineral resources, and enterprises of defense significance shall for the transitional period be property of the state. The highest representative body--the Supreme Council--should ensure the firmness of the proposition that no law may be adopted and no tax may be imposed without its consent. Evaluating the present position of the unions of the republic, we believe that they are failing to display due persistence and scrupulousness in the defense of the interests of the working people and the unemployed, and in assuring high employment and higher pay, with regard to the galloping rate of price rises for consumer goods and services, and also on matters of an improvement in work conditions. The traditional collective contracts between the employers and the unions have become an empty formality. A reform of the unions would be expedient under these conditions. Structural policy, whose purpose is the development of the consumer sector and an increase in export potential, should be flexible and "sparing" in order to preserve the structures whose elimination or reduction would cause a sharp increase in unemployment. Power engineering and the branches of the economy without which effective structural changes are impossible require serious government support. Investments here should be tax-exempt, and the public sector should for the transitional period be determined as a percentage. Agrarian policy is determining in the surmounting of the food and raw material crisis, in an improvement in society's dietary ration and the environmental situation, and in the recuperation of the social position of the countryside. A diversity of forms of land ownership should be established in the countryside to ensure that agrarian policy really serves these goals. It is essential to free the high-income kolkhozes and sovkhozes from administrative-economic interference, and they should be reorganized only in accordance with the wishes of the employees, farmers, and other structures. It would be expedient to submit for public consideration the question of the differentiated (in terms of the natural and climatic zones of the republic) transfer of the land to the peasants, but without the right to purchase or sell it for 20-25 years. The state is called upon to ensure the parity of the price of food and agricultural raw material on the one hand, and goods for the inhabitants of the countryside and agricultural production on the other. The social policy of the transition to a market economy should prompt the citizens to socioeconomic activity, preventing the formation of dependent sentiments among the able-bodied part of the populace. A system of material and spiritual support for those who objectively are incapable of ensuring by their own labor satisfaction of a minimum of consumption and cultural requirements should be created in the republic. Henceforward, until the economy has recovered and the social position of the populace has strengthened, the state is required to regularly (not less than quarterly) index wages, pensions, allowances, lump-sum payments, and grants and the public's savings bank deposits. Pensions should be paid on the basis of fair differentiation--with regard not simply to length of service but also to previous labor contribution and services to society and the republic. Mother and child, particularly in environmentally unfortunate areas, are in need of serious social protection. The economic costs of the transitional period and the manifestly insufficient attention of the state authorities have predetermined the extremely calamitous position of institutions of public education, health care, and research. We consider urgent an increase in government appropriations to these spheres, thanks to a reduction in the swollen administrative machinery of the organs of power and administration and thousands of contrived positions in the national economy included. A society in which institutions of public education, health care, research, and culture and their employees are tied to the residual principle of distribution cannot be morally healthy. Employment policy, being geared not only to a solution of problems of the training, retraining, and improvement of the employees and jobs for the able-bodied part of the population which is not in work, should serve as a factor of the relaxation of social tension, a reduction in the level of crime, and a strengthening of public morals. For this reason, it is essential together with the measures that are being implemented currently for the creation of jobs in the republic to legislatively offer the enterprises the opportunity to provide with jobs young people, mothers, the handicapped, and retirees who did not work earlier. The resources allocated for social programs shall be tax-exempt. Inasmuch as, by virtue of a number of factors, the problem of jobs for all the unemployed cannot be resolved in the republic itself, the Republic of Tajikistan should acquire the status of a developing state. This would give the unemployed the right of travel from the republic (on a contract basis for work in foreign countries, with their remuneration by international standards). Foreign economic policy should serve as an appreciable support in the recovery of the economy and the social sphere of Tajikistan. But foreign economic relations should not be of any ideological focus here. It is expedient to undertake national-state building in multinational Tajikistan on the basis of a balance of the real interests of the republic and the oblasts of Tajikistan. We support a clear separation of the legislative, executive, and judicial authorities, with the unconditional supremacy of the law. We believe together with this that realization of the commonly accepted right of the peoples to self-determination should not conflict with civil rights or stimulate trends toward national-state exclusiveness or a one-sided orientation in foreign policy and a weakening and severance of economic and spiritual ties to the states that are members of the CIS. The spiritual potential and cultural wealth of the Republic of Tajikistan are of world significance and an integral part of general civilization. But Tajikistan's integration in the world civilization process is impossible without the imperative of social reforms in the sphere of education, science, culture, and health care. The state is required to materially support the employees of these spheres and the scientific-pedagogical and artistic intelligentsia in their struggle against the onerous and humiliating consequences of the economic crisis and the uncontrolled transition to market relations and adopt effective measures to stabilize the situation and consolidate all political parties and public organizations of the republic and adopt constructive measures that will contribute to the speediest development and formation of a democratic secular state.
