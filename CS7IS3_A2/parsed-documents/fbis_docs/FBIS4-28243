The accord was reached at an annual meeting held in Tokyo between the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). Japanese and U.S. industry leaders, however, remain apart over whether to include a 20 percent foreign market share goal in a new bilateral chip accord. Hidehiko Yoshida, chairman of the EIAJ's Users' Committee of Foreign Semiconductors, told a news conference that the Japanese chip industry will disseminate the usefulness of personal computers by citing examples of popular use in the United States. Both parties also agreed to a design-in promotion campaign, a mutual dispatch of trade missions and publicity of success stories in Japan involving U.S. chipmakers, said Yoshida, senior executive vice president of Toshiba Corp. "Japanese semiconductor users continue to look forward to working with businessmen and engineers of foreign-owned companies in charting future cooperation between our highly competitive industries," Yoshida said. Other Japanese chip industry officials said Japan and the U.S. have also agreed to cooperate in solving environmental issues involved in chip use and standardizing semiconductor-manufacturing equipment. The U.S. demanded that the 20 percent foreign share goal in Japan's chip market be continued in a pact to replace the current one that expires in 1996. The U.S. industry claimed such a goal can be a useful benchmark for measuring the openness of the Japanese market, the officials said. But the EIAJ's Yoshida countered the argument, saying figures are not necessary if the Japanese side makes efforts to expand use of foreign chips.
