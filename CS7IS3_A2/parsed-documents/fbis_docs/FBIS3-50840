This was announced by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], in an appearance this morning on Radio Progreso's "First Thing" program. [Begin Ross recording] Forty eight hours ago, the CTC National Secretariat agreed to begin this process. We must remember that Comrade Fidel stated in the National Assembly [ANPP] that none of the measures we need to take can be implemented if we do not have the understanding, consensus, and support of the workers. This is precisely our goal, to have the workers... [changes thought] and also the worker's opinions. Fidel said that the measures could not have a technocratic nature, but would be political measures grounded on technical aspects, of course. Our workers are very wise. Their wisdom includes the economic. What has happened is that at times they have not been heard, nor has what they have suggested been done. That is the reality. We wish to fulfill that request and allow them more participation because the workers need to be the spinal column of everything done in the country on the economy. Everything done in terms of the economy affects the workers. [end recording] Ross emphasized that the forthcoming meetings are another sign of the trust the Revolution has in the workers, adding: [Begin Ross recording] For example, we are going to ask the opinion of 485,000 labor leaders on how to heal national finances. Do we change the currency or not? What to do with those who have great amounts of money, with those who have earned on the basis of their hard work, production efforts, and have accumulated that money? What to do with the money of those who, through theft, wheeling and dealing, hoarding, have accumulated it? We must add that there are 1.5 million workers who are paid between 100 and 121 pesos. There are 2.5 million who are paid between 121 and 186 pesos. Those earning 100 or 121 pesos cannot have accumulated money. [end recording] Finally, Ross pointed out that between now and 28 January, there will be in-depth training of the labor cadres at base level, to ensure that the process of discussing the national financial status with the workers becomes a successful process with practical results, ensures awareness, and particularly, is based on national economic problems.
