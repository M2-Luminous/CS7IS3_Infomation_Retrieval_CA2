The sources said that this request came in a message which an Algerian envoy, namely presidential court director Mohamed Sa'idi, delivered to President al-Asad from President Zeroual last week. The Syrian sources said that the message dealt with conditions in Algeria and bilateral relations, and offered condolences to President al-Asad on the loss of his son, Basil al-Asad. The sources expects a summit to be held between President al-Asad and Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to discuss regional issues, relations between Iran and some Arab states, the peace process, and issues of common concern. However, the sources did not say whether the meeting will be held in Damascus or Tehran.
