Speaking at a news conference for Russian and foreign journalists, Chernomyrdin stressed that "the course of continuing and deepening reforms that was adopted in 1993 remains unchanged, and the government will not retreat from it". The head of the government said: "Crisis phenomena are subsiding much more slowly than was expected. January of this year is being marked by an exacerbation of financial problems and a serious acceleration of inflation". At present, the average weekly increase in prices is over 4 percent, and the volume of output is only 85 percent of the December level. The prime minister said that there would be an enlarged session of the government sometime during the first 10 days of February, at which there would be detailed discussion of "what has been successful, what has been unsuccessful, and why and what needs to be done as a priority task in 1994".
