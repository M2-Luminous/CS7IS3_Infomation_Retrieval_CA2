He said this during the plenum concluding the process in the province. Also present at the plenum, which is underway right now at the municipal CTC's [Cuban Workers Federation] theater, is Pedro Ross, member of the Politburo and secretary general of the CTC, who has asked the provincial union secretaries to report on the main proposals made by the provincial workers at their respective Parliament in the Workplace assemblies. [Begin Ross recording] At that assembly, they even said that yes, we must sell the rum at a high price, and we must sell cigarettes at a high price, because after all, we do have profiteers and we have people who buy... [pauses] that if we set the price at five pesos, such people would buy up the entire (?supply). We should therefore sell the cigarettes at 20 pesos. So, then, if we wish to stop the profiteers, and if I am a revolutionary and wish to help the Revolution, and yet want to (?smoke) an extra box of cigarettes, I won't let myself... [pauses] (?instead of from the) profiteer, I will buy it from the Revolution, because that money will be used for the Revolution. That is one of the things the workers said. And I cannot sell bottles of rum freely [por la libre]. Openly, the cost is some 15 pesos. If we really wish to save and contribute, we need to place the bottles of rum so that if I, or other revolutionary people, wish to drink a bottle of rum, we will have a place to get it where rum will cost 120, or even 130 pesos -- just like what they sell it for in the streets -- because that is the only way to stop the profiteers. [end recording] Regarding the delicate matter of rationing the work force, Pedro Ross explained that to date, the only sectors authorized to take such a step are tourism and transportation, and that it will never be valid without the presence of the union. I reiterate, friends: The plenum at the end of the Parliaments in the Workplace assemblies in Santiago de Cuba Province is underway right now, here, with Politburo members Esteban Lazo Hernandez and Pedro Ross Leal in attendance.
