FBIS4-58553 "drnes087_v_94004" FBIS-NES-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Pakistan Russia Offers To Supply `Secret' Helicopter Technology Russia Offers To Supply `Secret' Helicopter Technology BK0405130994 Islamabad THE MUSLIM in English 4 May 94 p 1 BK0405130994 Islamabad THE MUSLIM English BFN [Text] Islamabad, May 3 -- At long last Pakistan has been able to make a breakthrough in acquisition of sophisticated defence equipment from Russia for which it has been striving hard for decades in its bid to diversify its defence procurements. In a major development, to begin with Russia has offered for the first time to supply to Pakistan a well-guarded secret helicopter technology of co-axial rotors and a helicopter with no tail rotor blades. Russia has entered the competition for supply of five helicopters to Emergency Relief Cell of the Cabinet division along with 30 other companies. Top on the list of Russian helicopters is the State-of-Art K-32-T helicopter which not only has a reputation of being the safest and the most economical helicopter but it also holds the world record of landing at the height of over 24,000 feet with two-men crew. What puts this helicopter a class apart from the rest of the helicopters is that it has no tail rotor blades which improves its flight safety upto 40 percent and cuts down maintenance cost by 30 percent. Russia has also offered M-18, M1-17 and MI-171. Tenders were opened in the committee Room of the Cabinet Division on April 30 with 30 companies participating in the bid. Tenders were opened in the presence of the D G [Director-General] Emergency Relief Cell, Additional Secretary Cabinet Division, a representative of the Army and the other officials. Emergency Relief Cell of the Cabinet Division had invited tenders for the purchase of five helicopter -- three utility version and two VIP version. Emergency Relief Cell had acquired six UHIH aircraft from the USAID in 1970 for flood relief operations. With the expiry of their life-span their replacements were urgently required. The participants of the bid included the manufacturers, leasing companies and one-time go-getters for quick money. Serious offers came from the manufacturing plants, from Bell Helicopter Textron USA, Eurocopter, the manufacturers of Puma Helicopters from France, ULAN-Ude the manufacturers of MI-171 helicopters of another manufacturing plant of Russia. Conspicuous by their absence from the tender bid were the largest helicopter manufacturing plant of Russia Helicopters namely Kazan manufacturing plant. Apparently this was aimed at reducing competition for sister manufacturing plant of ULAN-Ude. This was evident from the fact that ULAN-Ude offered an MI-171 helicopter of utility version at US dollars 2.9 million and VIP version at US dollars 3.2 million as against the offer of US dollars 1.5 million by Kazan plant to Pakistan Army. Prices offered for these helicopters from the original manufacturers ranged from 15 million US dollars for Western helicopters to US dollars 1.75 million for Russian helicopters. Though the go-getter companies also offered helicopters at a low price, the competence of these companies to actually deliver the helicopters from Russia is seriously doubtful as the laws of the Russian Federation do not permit such companies to export helicopters for sale, the companies are only permitted to lease. Though the prestigious helicopter manufacturing companies from the Western countries are in the run for the tender, what makes Russian offer unique is that it has been viewed in the defence circles prior to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's visit to Moscow sometime in near future. Defence sources have confirmed that Russia has been playing quite tough with Pakistan on the possibility of defence compensation between the two countries over the last two years. Nothwithstanding the public pronouncements made from time to time by the Pakistani functionaries for acquiring Russian-made fighter-bombers SU27 and MIG 29, Russia had not until very recently invited Pakistani experts for evaluations of these bombers. Although Pakistani experts have completed evaluation, no further progress has been reported. It has also been learnt that the scheduled visit by the experts of the Pakistan Army was cancelled by their Russian hosts at the eleventh hour last month.
