Voronin, chief nuclear and thermonuclear weapons designer, under the ``Interlocutor of the Day'' rubric by Mikhail Rebrov; date, place not given: ``Atomic Bombs Are Not for Use in Political Games'' -- first four paragraphs are introduction] [Text] Calling Card Stanislav Nikolayevich Voronin was born into a working-class family in 1930 in the city of Yaroslavl. After graduating from school he went to the Leningrad Ship-Building Institute. He began working at the All-Union Experimental Physics Scientific Research Institute (Arzamas-16) in 1954 as an engineer-designer and was involved in developing and testing nuclear munitions for several generations of land-, sea-, and air-launched missiles. He has won Lenin and State Prizes. In 1969 he became a deputy chief designer. Since 1991 he has been a chief nuclear and thermonuclear weapons designer. He is married with two children. Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, everyone is hearing about the future of Ukraine's nuclear weapons today. There are very different opinions on this. INTERFAX reports that [Ukrainian] President Kravchuk recently said that ``given the complex economic situation Ukraine regards nuclear weapons not as weapons but as a material asset.'' What comment can you make on this statement? Voronin: Some of the chief designers of nuclear weapons and munitions -- prominent scientists Yu.B. Khariton, Ye.N. Avrorin, Yu.A. Trutnev, and R.I. Ilkayev; directors of Russia's Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 federal nuclear centers V.A. Belugin and V.Z. Nechay; and Ministry of Atomic Energy specialists have sent a letter to the citizens and governments of Ukraine, Russia, and other countries exposing all the trickery over the nuclear weapons and over the question of whether they are weapons or commodities.... Rebrov: You recently visited Ukraine, Pervomaysk among other places. What is going on there? Voronin: An inspection of the state of the nuclear weapons in this and other areas revealed a number of major irregularities in the handling of the nuclear munitions. Not only as far as their storage is concerned, but also in terms of maintenance. What is being done there constitutes a flagrant breach of the most basic regulations and norms for handling nuclear weapons. You want me to be more specific? OK. Some of the warheads have been taken off alert status and cannot be put back. That's impossible. Warranty periods [garantiynyye sroki] have expired, there are no spare parts, and the servicing procedures envisaged by operating instructions are not being carried out. This work must be carried out without fail at least once every three years. The munitions have been stored in a temporary storage facility, that is in places where they should only be kept during the servicing procedures. This storage facility is jam-packed at the moment. There is no proper access to the weapons, nor are there places for technical servicing, and consequently there is none of the proper supervision. This is all very serious. Rebrov: It has been reported that a rise in temperature has been recorded at these storage facilities.... Voronin: Yes, of 1.5-2 degrees. That is understandable. Every munition emits heat; plutonium is, after all, always hot -- this is not critical. It is something else that is frightening: There are lots of weapons in the store, the radiation background is rising, and the time that technical personnel spend there has to be restricted.... It is always dangerous to stockpile nuclear munitions. And if there are flagrant breaches of technical maintenance requirements to boot, it is doubly dangerous. Fire, explosion.... This is plutonium, after all. A highly dangerous material. I won't tell you what could happen if it touches the ground. It has a half-life of 24,000 years.... Rebrov: And how long have these munitions been there without technical servicing? Voronin: Five years.... The articles contain moisture absorbers and bulk fillers [poglotiteli vlagi i obyema]. They also require periodic checks. A change in the oxygen content of the environment can cause the important uranium components to oxidize. These processes occur tens of times more intensively than in air.... And there is also the formation of fine dust. It can spontaneously ignite. What is more, the hydrogen content is rising in the hermetic container. It may approach critical level. And an explosive mixture spells the danger of detonation. The increased concentration of hydrogen also has an adverse effect on electronic instruments. Rebrov: It is not only at Pervomaysk that this alarming, if not dangerous, situation has arisen.... Voronin: Regrettably, no. A similar feckless attitude is being manifested toward cruise missiles and other munitions. The recurrent irregularities are becoming frightening. Just think: Missile complexes fitted with nuclear munitions are not carrying out the repair and inspection work for which documentation makes provision. And what about failure to comply with transportation regulations! We asked for two weapons to be sent to us for control disassembly [kontrolnaya razborka]. The talks were difficult, but it did nonetheless prove possible to persuade them of the -- let me stress -- urgent advisability of doing this. We are still waiting. The weapons have still not turned up. It now turns out that they are held up at customs and have spent two weeks in a siding somewhere without any supervision and guard. In a word, these violations -- and the list goes on and on -- are causing slipups, increasing the danger in handling nuclear munitions, and may cause accidents whose consequences and scale will be comparable to or even exceed the disaster at Chernobyl. And this is a disaster not only for Ukraine and Russia. All neighboring states and those states in Europe and the Near East which, owing to various meteorological phenomena, may find themselves in the zone of radioactive contamination need to ponder this. Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, is Ukraine able in your opinion to cope autonomously with such an alarming situation and such a complex problem? Voronin: What do you mean by ``cope with?'' The rigorous system for maintaining and ensuring the security of nuclear weapons that operated for many years in the former USSR and is still functioning in Russia has been destroyed in Ukraine and is not operational. I say this in all responsibility as a chief designer. I do not want to go into the reasons, I do not want to conduct a political debate; I am only talking facts. And the facts are that the prevailing situation is being aggravated by the fact that the nuclear munitions on Ukraine's territory lack physical protection and guard in keeping with present-day requirements. Rebrov: What about disassembly? The Ukrainian leadership is relying on Western aid.... Voronin: Let me tell you this: Atomic bombs are not for use in political games! Some politicians are indeed saying that nuclear munitions can be dismantled in Ukraine. This is an ill-intentioned attempt to mislead the public. Ukraine has neither the specialists with the requisite qualifications nor the production units nor the experience of disassembling weapons. Incidentally, handling munitions whose warranty periods have expired and which have been kept in extremely dubious conditions is a highly dangerous job. I would like to believe that we will reach a sensible solution once we have cast aside all political ambition and speculation. In exchange for the warheads Ukraine will receive fuel elements for its nuclear electric power stations. But who will pay the ``Russian workers'' for their hypercomplex and dangerous work? Have you asked yourself that? It is thoughtless to count on foreign specialists. No sensible professional, if he is a responsible inhabitant of the planet, would undertake to dismantle a nuclear munition developed in another country, using unknown technology. Rebrov: What is the situation today? Has there at least been some progress -- the problem has, as you said, gone beyond Ukraine and Russia? Voronin: There is no particular optimism. However, nor is there particular reason not to be optimistic. The warheads must be removed immediately. We have proposed a schedule. And that is not so easy either. The transport and the plants where the disassembly will be carried out must not be overloaded. Time is moving on. Haggling is inappropriate in such a dangerous situation. There has so far been no reaction from Ukraine. Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, there have been various adjustments and amendments to the agreements that have been reached.... What is behind them? Voronin: All that is irresponsible bluff. That is why scientists and designers from two Russian nuclear centers have provided the peoples and governments of all the world's countries with an analysis of the situation and urged them to do everything they can to avert a potential catastrophe. Rebrov: When we met with you in Arzamas-16 in October you spoke about the problem of the safety of the nuclear weapons, and now we have this situation.... Voronin: I said and I can repeat that we have not been marking time while working on developing nuclear munitions. Year in, year out the level of security has risen. We have succeeded in developing new detonators that do not explode in the event of fire or when struck and do not operate even if you crush them. In other words, we have succeeded in making detonators less sensitive to heat and mechanical factors than the explosives used in the weapons. The configuration and design of these munitions are devised in such a way as to ensure that no nuclear explosion occurs in the event of any catastrophe or accident. But what I am saying does not apply to the munitions now in Ukraine. Rebrov: You said that ``you have not been marking time.'' What about now? Voronin: Do you mean: What are we doing now? Have we come to a standstill? Have I gotten your drift? Allow me to ask you this: Has the world already become nuclear-free, and have all states with nuclear weapons stopped producing and improving them? No! Then why should Russia act differently? Isn't our security guaranteed by the might of the country's defense potential? I think that I have answered your question. Rebrov: In that case are tests necessary? Voronin: They are. Can you develop new weapons and not test them? I would like to talk about guarantees of the safety of such tests. We have developed a technology for underground explosions whereby no emissions occur. This is a tricky problem, but it has been resolved. And I think that information about it should not be kept secret but brought to the notice of the public, to everyone who talks about tests without knowing or understanding the crux of the matter. Regrettably, the inspections that have been carried out at test facilities -- not long ago but recently -- have not acted as an argument; nobody reads these reports. Hence the tendency to blame atomic specialists for everything. Moreover, if we are talking about tests, you have to take a far broader view and not just confine yourself to weapons. Talk to our scientists and, in particular, to Academicians Khariton and Trutnev. Both Yuliy Borisovich and Yuriy Alekseyevich will give you a detailed insight into the problems of physical science. It is not ``marking time'' either; today physics is tackling the kind of processes that cannot be reproduced under laboratory conditions. Imagine, pressure of billions of atmospheres, temperatures of tens and even hundreds of millions of degrees, velocity measured in 100-millionths of a second.... Not to mention fantastic densities, the purity of the substances obtained, etc. No science can develop without experiment.... Rebrov: Blowing up munitions that have been uncontrolled in terms of technical servicing, observance of storage norms, etc is probably of interest to nuclear designers? Voronin: Indisputably. That is why I would like to stress that we should not tilt at windmills but confront the real danger. It does exist, and its source is well-known. Rebrov: One last thing, Stanislav Nikolayevich, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has frequently written about the social tension at Arzamas-16. Has there been any change? Voronin: We are grateful for the support, the newspaper's article played a positive role, and there has been kind of progress, but.... Regrettably everything has been held up. And I do not rule out the possibility of another social explosion.
