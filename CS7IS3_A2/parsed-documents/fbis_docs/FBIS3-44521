Sino-British relations deteriorated in 1993 because of the wrangle over and the break in the talks over Hong Kong elections, and the Beijing government has altered the original idea of cooperating with the British side to fulfill the goal of a "smooth transition" and has instead adopted the strategy of cooperating with the Chinese people in Hong Kong to safeguard stability in the transition period. The Chinese side has not completely closed the door to talks. As long as Governor Patten revokes the draft election bill which has been tabled in the Legislative Council, it will be possible to restart the talks. However, the Chinese side does not place great hopes on this. In 1994, Beijing will speed up the PWC's work. First, it will announce a new group of PWC members as soon as possible. According to sources close to those organs in charge of Hong Kong and Macao work, as far as new PWC members are concerned, there will be a small number of "moderate democrats," such as Cheung Ping-leung of Meeting Point, presidents of post-secondary colleges, will be appointed, and efforts will also be made to gradually recruit people from religious circles, the social service sector, and the grass roots. As far as the economic sphere is concerned, the Beijing government will strive to persuade Hong Kong businessmen to invest more in tertiary industry (the service sector). Tertiary industry in the mainland is still far behind that of most developing countries, and its output value only accounts for 27 percent of overall GNP, which is lower than the world average. In the new year, the Beijing government will vigorously develop tertiary industry and increase employment opportunities and national income. Its development pattern will be in line with 1993's State Council document No. 20--The "Basic Thinking on the Development Plan for Tertiary Industry Throughout the Country." Because of insufficient capital, one of the foci of attracting foreign capital is to strive for the participation of Hong Kong businessmen in tertiary industry. According to the policy on tertiary industry drafted by the Foreign Investment Administration of the State Council Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Beijing government encourages businessmen from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other foreign countries to develop vast stretches of land. The State Council will relax restrictions on some provincial and city economic development zones and strive for the participation of large, listed [on the Hong Kong stock exchange] real estate companies in the development of vast stretches land. However, certain restrictions on real estate investment must be imposed on Hong Kong businessmen, and one of the restrictions is to strictly examine and approve investments in luxury houses, villas, resorts, and golf courses. Moreover, Hong Kong businessmen will be encouraged to take part in the reconstruction of old city areas and to invest in ordinary commodity houses. Various local governments will also "impose strict control" over land supply. Last year, land use rights sold by Shanghai Municipality were reduced to three square km (20 square km in 1992), and the supply of land in Shenzhen City also dropped to 32 hectares in 1993 from 45 hectares in 1992. In the new year, various localities will still impose appropriate controls on the supply of land. The Beijing government is still opening the retailing industry and tertiary industry to Hong Kong businessmen, but some official restrictions have been imposed on running supermarkets. The main points of the restrictions are: Businessmen from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries are not allowed to run supermarkets and wholesale businesses alone. In the five special economic zones and five cities and municipalities, Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Dalian, Sino-foreign joint ventures are allowed, to run one to two supermarkets and to run retailing businesses on a cooperative basis with special approval. In the new year, the largest area invested in by Hong Kong businessmen will be communications and transportation. Apart from investing in railways and ports, Hong Kong businessmen can also build solely invested wharfs reserved specially for owners of goods, run airport terminals and airlines through joint ventures, and so on.
