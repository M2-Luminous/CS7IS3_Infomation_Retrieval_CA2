He stressed, however, that it appears that the operation to rescue the pipeline cannot be carried out without regard for the embargo on Iraq or by ignoring the United Nations. Cetin was replying to questions at Ankara's Esenboga Airport after seeing off the Thai foreign minister. Cetin pointed out that the problem does not concern the United Nations alone and that the Iraqi side should not be ignored. He added: This must be done on common ground with Iraq. As far as we understand, Iraq will not export the oil and no resources will be transferred to Iraq. Consequently, we are continuing to explain that this is a special operation. After our contacts with the United Nations, we will contact Iraq once again if necessary and try to reach a solution for the issue. Replying to a question, Cetin said that no conclusion has been reached during the talks in New York about whether Iraq's share of the revenues from the oil in the pipeline will be placed in the UN compensation account. He said: In light of these negotiations, we will either say that an agreement has been reached and act accordingly, or we will say that the differences of opinion will be discussed again. In other words, the process is under way. I believe that it will continue. Turkey is right. I do not believe there is a way back from here.
