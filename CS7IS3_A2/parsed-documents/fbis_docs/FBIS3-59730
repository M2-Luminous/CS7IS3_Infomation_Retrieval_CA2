Units can be upgraded by replacing the former type CPU with the new modular CPU. Compared to the conventional mounting method in which package-sealed LSI chips are lined up on a printed circuit board, instruction execution is four times faster, and only 1/5 of the former mounting space is required. The new multichip module consists of six CMOS LSI chips--a processor, 32k byte data cache, 32k byte instruction cache, and memories (3 chips) to store processor microcodes. The source voltage for each chip is +3.3V. A design rule of 0.5&mgr;m has been used for all chips. The processor consists of a CISC section (which does not contain microcodes) and a RISC section. Each section will handle 32-bit and 64 bit architecture. The CISC and RISC sections have register files in common. The CISC section is directly interchangeable with the already existing K series. The instruction set of the RISC section is unique. A super scalar design has been adopted, and three instructions can be executed at the same time. Instructions are executed at 30MHz. When using the conventional mounting method in which package-sealed LSI chips are lined up on a printed circuit board, instructions are executed at about 15MHz. At this time, the critical path of the processor limits the instruction execution speed of the multichip module. However, it is estimated that the module will be capable of 60MHz operation in the future. Flip Chip Mounting Technology Adopted The module is 44.6 x 67.4mm in size. This is reportedly 1/5 the size of the conventional printed circuit board mounted version. AIN is used as the modules substrate material. Wiring layers formed of Cu thin film, and insulating layers formed of polyimide create a 5-layered construction, and the LSI chip (bare chip) is connected using the flip chip design. Cu wiring is 12&mgr;m thick, and spaced at a pitch of about 30&mgr;m. The number of flip-chip connections is 5000-6000 for the entire module. Most of these--about 3000--are for the CMOS processor chip. Connection spacing (pitch) is an extremely narrow 0.21mm, and a solder-to-solder connection is used. The size of solder bumps formed on the LSI chip is about 100&mgr;m. The electrodes on the substrate side are first gold plated and then covered with solder. After the module has passed testing, the gap between chip and substrate is filled with resin by [potting]. Power consumption by the entire module is 18W. The module has a heat sink, and sufficient heat dissipation is achieved by forced air cooling (at the rate of about 1 meter wind per second). This design allows the heat to leave the LSI chip through the solder connection and AIN substrate, toward the heat sink. For this reason, many solder connections also serve as heat dissipation paths.
