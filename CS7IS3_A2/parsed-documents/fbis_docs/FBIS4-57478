In his opinion, the desire to avoid conflict serves only to delay change. So the man is Rubens Ricupero, a practicing Catholic whom many Brazilians first got to know under unusual circumstances: a foot-washing ceremony during Holy Week. His first statement upon being named minister of finance brought good news. "Spending is banned," he said, repeating the famous phrase by former President Tancredo Neves. Chances seem good that the ban is genuine. "As an admirer of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Ricupero will find it very difficult to lie," says Deputy Delfim Netto. "Lying is not a sin in Marxism, but to Saint Thomas it is a capital offense." Hours before being sworn in in the vast reception hall on the third floor of Planalto Palace, Ricupero told Nely Caixeta, EXAME's editor in Brasilia, what was going through his head. Here is some of what he said: The Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2 Plan: "It is the first plan in Brazilian history to be concerned with ensuring smooth operations during the first year of the following administration. We want to have everything solved by 1995, but without the structural reforms now pending, it will be difficult to ensure the success of the plan." Inflation: "Without stability and balance in the public accounts, there is no salvation. Why is it that in Latin America, we are the only ones who have not managed to eliminate inflation? Is it because we have a kind of genetic flaw or is it because our institutions and, basically, the Constitution render us incapable of making decisions?" Privatization: "This is an issue we cannot avoid. The fact is that in coming years, the government-owned firms are going to require very big investments. But the government has no way of investing because it stopped saving a long time ago." Wages: "The idea of a wage trigger makes no sense whatever because it means betting that the plan will fail. Look at those proposals for raising the minimum wage to $100. Who is going to pay the salaries for the municipality of Sao Raimundo Nonato in southern Piaui? Deputy Paulo Paim?" Elections: "It is in the interest of all the candidates that the stabilization program be successful. Anyone gambling on the idea that the worse things are the better is going to inherit a probably ungovernable country. It will be a Pyrrhic victory." Employment: "First of all, it is necessary to eliminate inflation, because employment is the result of investment. We also must reduce the costs imposed by legislation and create incentives to generate well-paid jobs." "Personal crusade": It is ideas like those that have made Ricupero's appointment a welcome one. "I have confidence in the minister, and I hope he will be able to implement the economic plan," says Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries. "He is a serious man and a competent politician." For his part, Ricupero claims that his intention is to continue with the plan, work with the team set up by Fernando Henrique, and combat inflation. "The plan will work if every citizen and every member of the administration views it as a personal crusade," he says. The minister's objective is to clear the path as soon as possible for the adoption and consolidation of the real. Issues such as privatization, for example, will probably not receive his immediate attention, although Ricupero agrees that the government-owned firms need to change hands. While the economic team holds internal debates on the best time to introduce the new currency and the mechanisms it will adopt for stabilization and conversion, Ricupero is preparing to negotiate with the National Congress. On the immediate agenda is approval of this year's budget and of the provisional measure creating the real. The minister also wants to breathe new life into constitutional reform, which is threatening, as it blunders from one obstacle to the next, to turn into one of the biggest fiascoes in the history of the legislative branch. By the beginning of January, when he relinquishes his post to the minister appointed by the next administration, Ricupero hopes to leave office with the new currency consolidated, the budget coordinated, and inflation down. Replacing a minister like Fernando Henrique will not be an easy task for this descendant of Italian immigrants who was born in Bras, Sao Paulo, and likes to listen to chamber music by Mahler or Brahms. After all, his predecessor was able to leave office to the sound of applause even though the figures reflecting his time in office were not favorable. The country was growing by 4.5 percent per year when Fernando Henrique took over the ministry, but has now slowed to 2.5 percent per year. During that same period, annual inflation jumped from 2,700 percent to 7,200 percent. "If I, Delfim, or Simonsen had gotten the country into that situation, we most certainly would have been flayed on the public square," says Deputy and former Minister Roberto Campos. Delfim Netto agrees, saying: "What is most incredible is that the National Confederation of Industry and Brazilian Federation of Banks approve." Affable, a good storyteller, and regarded as the best official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he impresses his listeners with his knowledge of contemporary Brazilian and foreign problems, especially those in the area of international trade. He has served abroad for a total of 20 years. Like Fernando Henrique, Ricupero possesses a solid humanist background. In Brasilia, where he lives in one of the two mansions still owned by the government on the Peninsula of Ministers on South Lake, he follows the custom of another former minister of finance, Marcilio Marques Moreira. On Sunday mornings, he attends the mass celebrated at the Sao Bento Monastery. Alongside his wife Marisa, a teacher to whom he has been married for 33 years, he sings Gregorian chants in Latin. To obtain an interview with the minister, reporter Angela Coronel of EXAME's Brasilia office had to go to great lengths. Angela attended the Maundy Thursday Mass at the monastery at Ricupero's side. She then accompanied him in the procession that followed. Finally, an interview was arranged, and as they parted, Ricupero said: "This country needs God." Impulsiveness: Ricupero seems to be the typical official cut out for government service: one of those people who try to acquit themselves well on any mission, whether as the country's representative at GATT in Geneva, as ambassador to Washington, or -- it is hoped -- as minister of finance. He regards as pointless the warnings that he will have to get along with a president of the republic who is given to impulsive behavior. "Our thinking coincides," he says, citing as proof his support for Itamar during the episode in connection with the conversion of salaries to URV's [real units of value] in the judicial branch. He saw nothing wrong in the president's demonstrated willingness to stand up to the Supreme Court justices. "There is something in Brazilian culture that makes people dread facing up to conflicts," Ricupero says. "It is that desire to avoid conflict which caused us to be the last country to abolish slavery and which is hampering changes such as those represented by constitutional revision." Although using different words, Ricupero is thereby endorsing one of the most revealing ideas held by the former prime minister of Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher, regarding the art of governing: the idea that consensus is the negation of leadership.
