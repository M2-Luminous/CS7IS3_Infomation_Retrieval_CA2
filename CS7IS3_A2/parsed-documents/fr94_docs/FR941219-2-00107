FR941219-2-00107 FR941219-2-00067 (C) Repayment of the Loan is waived with respect to the amount by which the Loan exceeds GIC proceeds. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Employer is a diversified manufacturer of aluminum composite panels, rigid foam P.V.C. panels and polystyrene foamcore boards. The Employer has offices and/or production sites in St. Louis, Missouri; Benton, Kentucky and Richmond, Indiana. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which includes a cash or deferred arrangement under section 401(k) of the Code. As of December 31, 1993, the Plan had 93 participants and total assets of approximately $1,098,635. Participants are currently entitled to direct the investment of their account balances among seven investment funds which are managed by Scudder Investor Services, Inc. On February 12, 1988, prior to the implementation of participant direction, The Boatmen's National Bank of St. Louis (the Bank), 1 as trustee for the Plan, made the decision to invest a portion of the Plan's assets in a collective investment fund maintained by the Bank and invested primarily in guaranteed investment contracts. The GIC is held as the sole asset of sub-fund G&hyph;11 of the the collective investment fund. The GIC provided a rate of return of 8.65% per annum and a maturity date of March 1, 1993. 1 Boatmen's Trust Company (Boatmen's) succeeded The Boatmen's National Bank of St. Louis as the Plan's trustee in 1990. 2. On April 11, 1991, Executive Life was placed into conservatorship by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of California. The Employer represents that, pursuant to the conservatorship, payouts under the terms of Executive Life's GICs were suspended. 2 In February, 1994, Boatmen's, in its capacity as Plan trustee, elected to participate in the rehabilitation plan for Executive Life. Although, through the rehabilitation process, the Plan has received $147,386.00 from Executive Life, the amount of any additional payments to be received over the next several years is undetermined. Consequently, Boatmen's has frozen that portion of participants' accounts which is attributable to the GIC. This freeze has prevented Plan participants from exercising the rights they would normally have under the Plan to request distributions and investment transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GIC. 3 The Employer represents that the Loan would preserve the Plan's rights with respect to the GIC, give participants and beneficiaries the ability to exercise their right to request investment transfers, and provide immediate liquidity which would facilitate benefit distributions. The proposed Loan will be made in one lump-sum payment in the amount of the maturity value 4 of the GIC, plus post-maturity interest through the date of the Loan, credited at the rate paid on the Collective Employee Benefit Trust Fund ``S''; 5 , less any amounts previously received pursuant to the rehabilitation process and the total amount of periodic advances already made to the Plan. The Employer represents that the Loan is non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur any expenses in connection with the transaction. 2 The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GIC are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this regard, the Department is not herein proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GIC issued by Executive Life. 3 Following the cessation of payments by Executive Life with respect to the GIC, the Employer made the decision to make periodic advances to the Plan to permit the Plan to make distributions to participants and beneficiaries entitled to distributions as a consequence of termination of employment. The applicant represents that, as of November, 1994, the periodic advances to the Plan totaled approximately $50,618.00. The applicant also represents that the terms of those periodic advances satisfy the conditions of PTE 80&hyph;26 (45 FR 28545, April 29, 1980). This conditional class exemption permits a party in interest to make an interest-free loan to an employee benefit plan, and the repayment of such loan. Specifically, the exemption states, in relevant part, that effective January 1, 1975, the restrictions of section 406(a)(1)(B) and (D) and section 406(b)(2) of the Act and the taxes imposed by section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(B) and (D) of the Code, shall not apply to the lending of money from a party in interest to an employee benefit plan, nor to the repayment of such loan in accordance with its terms, if no interest or other fee is charged to the plan, the loan is unsecured, and the loan proceeds are used only for the payment of ordinary operating expenses of the plan, including the payment of benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan. In this proposed exemption the Department expresses no opinion as to whether the periodic advances satisfy the provisions of PTE 80&hyph;26. 4 The maturity value is defined as the total amount deposited under the GIC, plus interest at the guaranteed interest rate, through the date of maturity. The applicant represents that the maturity value is $297,210.76. 5 The Employer represents that the annualized rate of return on the Collective Employee Benefit Trust Fund ``S'' for the period from October 1, 1993 through September 30, 1994 was 4.0%. It is represented that, this fund, an investment vehicle offered by Boatmen's Trust Company, invests in a diversified portfolio of money market instruments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and demand notes, as well as other fixed-rate and variable-rate fixed income securities. 3. Repayment of the Loan is limited to payments made to the Plan by or on behalf of Executive Life, or its successor, or any other responsible third parties. No other assets of the Plan will be available for repayment of the Loan. If the payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Loan, the Employer will have no recourse against the Plan, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount. In the event that GIC proceeds exceed the amount necessary to repay the Loan, the excess will be distributed to the Plan for the benefit of participants and their beneficiaries. The Employer represents that it will maintain records of the proposed Loan for a period of seven years, and such records will be open for inspection at all times by the Department or any Plan participant. 4. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1) The transaction will preserve the Plan's ability to allow participant-directed investment re-allocations; (2) The Plan will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction; (3) Repayment of the Loan will be made only from amounts paid to the Plan by Executive Life, its successor, or any other third party; (4) If the payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Loan, the Employer will have no recourse against the Plan, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount; and (5) Repayment of the Loan will be waived with respect to the amount by which the Loan exceeds the amount the Plan receives from GIC proceeds.
