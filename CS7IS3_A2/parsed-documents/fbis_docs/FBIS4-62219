The general said that the murder was committed for a mixture of commercial, political and criminal reasons. The general pointed out that during the investigation law enforcement bodies established a whole group of people suspected of committing a number of other crimes. Kolesnikov said that as soon as the investigation is over, the investigators will expose misinformation on the case published by the press, especially in part concerning accusations against regional law enforcement bodies.
