I can say that at present, more than half of the gross national product in Russia is produced outside the state sector. In the remaining 100 days, we will implement the unprecedented efforts that are already under way to put up into auction in the final stage of the voucher privatization of super-efficient and super-profitable Russian enterprises. According to our plan, the 12 million people in Russia who have not yet used their privatization vouchers will receive new opportunities to do this in the period before 30 June. We plan to hold more than 4,500 regional voucher auctions in all Russian regions, with no exception. More than 200 enterprises will be put into all-Russian voucher auctions before the end of June this year. Moreover, and this is particularly important for us, we are talking here about unique enterprises well-known not only in Russia but also around the world. Among them are unique enterprises of the fuel and energy complex -- for example, a large program for privatization of oil enterprises. Whole groups of Lukoil enterprises will be put into voucher auctions in the next few months. And Lukoil is the largest oil producer in Russia, the fourth largest enterprise in Russia. [Word indistinct] Neftegaz, the Gazprom association, and the Berezka association will be put into voucher auctions before the end of the year. Large and efficient motor vehicle works, as well as many enterprises of the military-industrial complex, will be put into voucher auctions. All this has become a reality today. And all this has been reflected in official documents, inter alia in documents, according to which, as many as 50 efficient enterprises will be put into voucher auctions in Moscow alone in the next one and a half or two months. I have signed an instruction that approves the schedule for holding these voucher auctions in the very near future. There is yet another enterprise that will be sold at voucher auctions and that I simply must mention here. This is the largest Russian enterprise, the Norilsk Nickel concern. We have reached an understanding with the concern management that in the framework of the voucher privatization the major block of shares of Norilsk Nickel will be for sale in the open market for all citizens. I think there is no need to elaborate on Norilsk Nickel. Suffice it to say that in 1993 the volume of hard currency proceeds of this enterprise alone amounted to $1 billion. Until very recently there has been nothing of the kind in the framework of the Russian privatization program. All this gives us grounds to say unequivocally and confidently that privatization has entered the home stretch and will be fully completed before 30 June. [passage omitted]
