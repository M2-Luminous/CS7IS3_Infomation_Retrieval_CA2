Vatulyan and I.M. Syunyakova (Rostovon Don); received May 8,1992; UDC 539.3] [Abstract] Dynamic contact problems of isotropic and anisotropic theory of elasticity for massive and weightless dies lying on the surface of a medium simulated by either a layer or half-plane have been studied in sufficient detail. This type of problems are topical in foundation construction, vibroseismical prospecting and when designing various critical structures operating under complex dynamic conditions. But taking into account the actual plate depth and anisotropy of the foundation call far a different approach based on the method of boundary integral equations. The article examines the problem of steady state oscillations of a massive die connected to a foundation that is an orthotropic half-plane with an uneven boundary; in a particular case the die can be embedded into the half-plane to a certain depth. The derived special basic solutions make it possible to formulate boundary integral equations (BIEs) for the finite portion of the half-plane boundary. The use of a classic version of the boundary elements method with the simplest approximation of contact stresses makes it possible to reduce the resulting BIE system to a linear algebraic system. Results of calculations for various frequencies depending on the number of elements used. Figures 2, references 8.
