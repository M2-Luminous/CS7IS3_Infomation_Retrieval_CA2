FR940429-2-00078 FR940429-2-00062 The Rehabilitation Act and regulations promulgated under it are to be interpreted broadly. Gilbert v. Frank, 949 F.2d 637, 641 (2d Cir. 1991). In view of the foregoing, I conclude that, similar to Title VII and the National Labor Relations Act, once a complaint is filed, OFCCP may seek relief on behalf of individuals found to have been subject to handicap discrimination even if they have not filed a complaint. 4 4 In light of this conclusion, I need not address the contention that no complaint is necessary to confer jurisdiction on OFCCP to investigate and take enforcement action on behalf of individuals. I note, however, that at least one court, citing 41 CFR 60&hyph;741.25, has stated that OFCCP is charged with conducting periodic reviews to assure that government contractors have complied with their non-discrimination and affirmative action obligations. Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina v. United States Department of Labor, 917 F.2d 812, 815 (4th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 2013 (1991). III. Individual Discrimination Claims In an individual discrimination case under Section 503, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing a prima facie case by showing that the complainant was a handicapped individual who was qualified for the job, applied for the job, and was rejected. Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs v. United Parcel Service, Inc., Case No. 87&hyph;OFC&hyph;17, Dep. Ass't. Sec. Dec., Nov. 22, 1991, slip op. at 8. Actual ability to perform the job is the only test for determining if an individual is qualified. The Department of Labor, OFCCP v. Texas Industries, Inc., Case No. 80&hyph;OFCCP&hyph;28, Ass't Sec. Dec., June 7, 1988, slip op. at 14. In determining if a handicapped individual is qualified to do a job the employer must gather all relevant information regarding work history and medical history. Mantolete v. Bolger, 767 F.2d 1416, 1423 (9th Cir. 1985); 5 Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, Case No. 84&hyph;OFC&hyph;8, Acting Ass't Sec. Dec., Mar. 30, 1989, slip op. at 24 (WMATA). 5 Commonwealth argues that Mantolete is not valid precedent in this case because it is a Section 501 case which involves stringent information gathering requirements for federal employers, the case did not render judgment for the plaintiff, the applicable regulations are more stringent with respect to accommodation, and the good faith defense rejected in Mantolete is recognized under Section 504. Com. Resp. at 66&hyph;67. These allegations are rejected. That the case did not render judgment for the plaintiff is insignificant if the case is cited for a legal proposition established therein. Although there are differences among Sections 501, 503 and 504, there are common elements in each section which are intended to be interpreted uniformly. See Mantolete, 767 F.2d at 1421 (no reason that Section 501 definition of qualified handicapped individual should differ from Section 504); Texas Industries, slip op. at 29 (Congress intended that Sections 503 and 504 be uniformly administered). The good faith defense has been effectively rejected by the Third Circuit which held that the Rehabilitation Act is directed particularly at unintentional conduct. Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, 926 F.2d 1368, 1384 (3d Cir. 1991). Cf. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, C. 22 U.S. 405, (1975) (good faith no defense to back pay award for violation of Title VII). While risk of injury may, in some cases, justify the refusal to hire an otherwise qualified handicapped person, mere elevated risk of injury, without more, is not sufficient. 6 Mantolete, 767 F.2d at 1422; WMATA, slip. op. at 23. The issue is whether hiring the complainant posed a reasonable probability of substantial harm. Mantolete, 767 F.2d at 1422; WMATA, slip op. at 23. Further, where a contractor applies physical or mental job qualification requirements which tend to screen out qualified handicapped individuals, the job requirements must be job related and consistent with business necessity and safe performance of the job. 41 CFR 60&hyph;741.6(c)(2). Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs v. PPG Industries, Inc., Case No. 86&hyph;OFC&hyph;9, Dep'y. Ass't Sec. Dec., Jan. 9, 1989, slip op. at 14. The contractor has the burden of demonstrating compliance with this standard. PPG Industries, slip op. at 14. 6 Any qualification based on risk of future injury must be examined with special care since almost all handicapped persons are at greater risk from work-related injuries. Bentivegna v. United States Department of Labor, 694 F.2d 619, 622 (9th Cir. 1982). A. Gregory Gray. The ALJ held that Complainant Gray was not covered by the Act because ``Congress did not intend to include correctable and temporary impairments in the definition of `handicapped individual' [but] intended to apply the handicap definition to more severe or permanent impairments.'' R.D. and O. at 14&hyph;15. The ALJ also held that Mr. Gray's condition did not significantly limit his employment opportunities, indicating that he was not ``substantially limited'' within the Act's definition. OFCCP excepted to the exclusion of Mr. Gray from coverage under the Act on the grounds that correctable conditions are covered, and that substantial limitation in any major life activity, not limited to employment as the ALJ held, establishes coverage.
