We are for accord and civic peace but not at the expense of the working people and not at the expense of depriving common people of their rights, Mikhail Nagaytsev, chairman of the Moscow Federation of Trade Unions [MFTU] said opening the rally. According to him, on the eve of May Day about 2.5 million people signed demands circulated by the MFTU, which will be passed to the government. Among them are demands to introduce articles to the legislation of the Russian Federation on the accountability of those guilty of delaying salary payments, to adopt a state employment program for the population, and to step up the work of law-enforcement bodies in the fight against crime and corruption. A resolution adopted by the rally -- in which about 25,000 people took part according to Nagaytsev -- notes that a solution to the present crisis, which is leading to the country's impoverishment, is possible only if the level of unemployment is halted, there is state support for Russia's producers, and tariff agreements are fulfilled. War and labor veterans and members of the Russian Communist Party took part in the rally in Manezh Square together with representatives of 42 trade union organizations from Moscow city and oblast, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh, Smolensk, Kostroma, Tula, Kaluga, and other towns.
