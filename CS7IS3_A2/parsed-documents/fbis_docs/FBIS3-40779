Tired of its image of being tagged on to miscellaneous political alliances that have failed to yield electoral advantage, the party is finalising a high-profile programme of independent mass mobilisation. According to sources, the CPM foresees that there will be a great churning of political forces in the country in the near future, as the most backward sections struggle to emerge on the forefront of politics. The emergence of the Dalits organised under the Bahujan Samaj Party has been an eye-opener for the CPM. Hence the party will continue to pursue political alliances whenever and wherever necessary, based on specific issues, but will not endure any more its role of being a "shrinking tail." The CPM will launch a large-scale countrywide mass programme to educate the people about the perils of the new economic policy and the changing social realities. CPM leaders said that circumstances and the Congress had kept the attention of the opposition focused on the problems of communalism, national unity and integrity, and stability, while pushing through the economic reforms package. While the economic liberalisation programme could not be reversed and in states like West Bengal where the CPM was in power, the administration had no option but to enter into the spirit of the competitive era, the effort of the CPM would be to increase awareness among the people on the disastrous impact of the new economic policy. The struggle to fight the worst fallouts of the new economic programme would be taken up at the state and national levels, CPM sources said. The central committee meeting, after analysing the results of the elections in the five northern states, concluded that caste politics was bound to dominate the scene in the near future. The emergence of the Dalits as a political entity under the Bahujan Samaj Party was watershed in Indian politics. The committee saw that the alliance of the Dalits and the minorities was not a conscious, deliberate, calculated political move, but was the reflection of a growing awareness and empowerment among the weakest and most oppressed sections. In the near future what was likely to happen was increased conflict and violence within the same caste groups between those who suffered from a sense of being oppressed against those who were identified as the oppressors, the CPM's leadership anticipated. Chalking out a political agenda that can encompass the multitude of problems the CPM faces in its struggle to revive its languishing political fate is growing to be a difficult and complex task for the central committee. The party is adopting an attitude of playing it by the ear, of evolving its tactics as its mass contact programmes get underway, to give it the kind of flexibility it needs to trace a path through the confusing political and economic scenario.
