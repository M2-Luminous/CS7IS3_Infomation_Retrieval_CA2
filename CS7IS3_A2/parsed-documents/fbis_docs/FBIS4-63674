Rummo and Kranich were authorized by the ELDP council and the Liberals faction in parliament to continue in the present government pending the outcome of the Pro Patria congress scheduled mid-June in Tallinn. The decision was made already Thursday [19 May] but the party council and the Liberals faction agreed to make it public only after the coalition council session early this morning. The ELDP proposes that Pro Patria's coalition partners -- the Estonian Rural Centrist Party [ERCP], the Estonian National Independence Party [ENIP], the Estonian Social Democratic Party [ESDP] and the ELDP -- should get together and work out their stand on the nomination of a new prime minister as well as other possible Cabinet reshuffles. The ELDP says its proposal stems from its "concern that the government should remain operational and the coalition survive." The other coalition partners, ERCP, ENIP and ESDP, announced at the end of last week they don't plan to recall their ministers from the government. Pro Patria member, Foreign Minister Juri Luik told reporters today he has no intention of leaving the Cabinet before the Pro Patria congress.
