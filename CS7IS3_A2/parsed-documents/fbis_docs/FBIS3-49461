What do you want to say to Bill Clinton? [Klaus] The security issue will be a dominant feature of these talks. Nevertheless, the Czech side would like to point out the inseparability of security and other issues and to emphasize the connections between security policy and general economic and social policy. We would also like to discuss how the Czech Republic views its future and cooperation with the United States. [Krasnicky] People in Hungary and Poland are reproaching you for preferring bilateral talks with U.S. officials at the Prague meeting and not a joint course of action by the Visegrad Four states.... [Klaus] These opinions reflect certain disappointment that the Americans chose Prague as the place to hold their meetings with these four countries. I would not look for anything more profound in this. As far as cooperation among these four countries is concerned, we have said thousands of times that we favor cooperation in all spheres where it is suitable. We are placing extraordinary emphasis on the greatest test of cooperation. This test is not summits and meetings between presidents and prime ministers but the free trade zone. Here the Czech Republic is in the lead, while some other countries that would be glad to have highest-level summits are, compared with us, applying the brakes in intensifying the free trade zone. At the same time, this cooperation is in our most vital interest. [Krasnicky] Our neighbors are interested in joining NATO. Their motive is obvious. Are you also concerned about Russian neoimperialism? [Klaus] First, I would like to say that it was Czechoslovakia that told a somewhat surprised Poland and Hungary that we want to join NATO. This is a historically proven fact, and nothing in our conceptual decision has changed, except that in the Czech Republic today we are making less pointed statements. Second, we respect Partnership for Peace as an intermediary step, and our task is to make maximum use of this concept for partnership. The U.S. plan envisages the conclusion of individual treaties between NATO and the individual countries. These treaties will not be formulated unequivocally and will be able to differentiate more between the individual participants. There will be sufficient scope here for the Czech Republic to use this institute if, of course, it is adopted by NATO on 11 January. [Krasnicky] What about the Russian threat? [Klaus] Let us in no way underestimate it. However, I would not separate this threat from the whole issue. The Russian threat is not a military one. It is the threat of mastering--or of not mastering--the early postcommunist phase. This threat has social, economic, political, and, only at a certain point, military dimensions. At the same time, I concede that the Czech Republic is a little further toward the West than, for instance, Poland. This issue is more sensitive for the Poles than it is for the Austrians, for example. In this issue, I would place us more alongside Austria than Poland.
