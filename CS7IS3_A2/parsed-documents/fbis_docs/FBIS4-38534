Ossetia, Ingush Presidents on State of Emergency LD0106001794 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1545 GMT 31 May 94 LD0106001794 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Russian BFN [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- Satisfaction with the Federation Council's endorsement of the Russian president's decree extending the state of emergency in the area of conflict in North Ossetia and Ingushetia was expressed in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent by the presidents of both republics, who are members of the chamber. In the opinion of North Ossetian leader Akhsarbek Galazov, the refugee problem can only be resolved if people who are to live together understand that this is necessary. He also thinks that the refugee problem must be tackled throughout Russia. Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said the new decree was "better than previous ones, since it was more down-to-earth." Specifically, it indicates that the procedure for moving people into abandoned dwellings must be submitted by 15 June. "But there is one danger: the decree may not be implemented," he added. Concern that the decree may not be implemented was also voiced by Issa Kustoyev, chairman of the Federation Council's committee for constitutional legislation: "the disease has been allowed to develop unchecked and over billion rubles allocated to settle the problem have been swallowed up, yet there are still homeless people, and they are still starving." According to him, not a single question has yet been solved, although "decree after decree repeats that the provisional administration as a special form of rule must control the situation." A deputy who had visited the area of the conflict on more than one occasion, noted that the deputies' monitoring commission which it had been decided to set up had to check to see that the provisions of the presidential decree were being implemented.
