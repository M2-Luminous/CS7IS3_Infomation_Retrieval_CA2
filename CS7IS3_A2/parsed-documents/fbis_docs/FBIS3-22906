The Red Army and several Islamic guerrilla groups met several weeks ago at the Tehran headquarters of the Iranian intelligence service, the Arab-language AN-NAHAR said, quoting intelligence organs in several European countries. The dispatch from Paris said Iran is hoping to disrupt the Middle East peace talks because it fears isolation should they be successful. Tehran also appears to believe that one aim of the talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is to destabilize Iran, according to the paper. The Islamic groups attending the meeting included Hizballah, a Lebanon-based militant Shi'ite faction, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, an extremist group operating outside the PLO, the report said. The meeting was also attended by high-ranking officials from the Iranian intelligence service and Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. The paper said Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has trained the Japanese Red Army in al-Biqa' Valley in Lebanon and the Iranian Embassy in Beirut has helped Red Army members travel between Iran and Lebanon. The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series of hijacking and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972 massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.
