Yesterday, the subject of a clash between Yabloko and the NRP [New Regional Policy] was the placing under Duma jurisdiction of the Control- Budget Committee, whose functional possibilities are very highly assessed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts. The Control-Budget Committee (CBC) was created under the Supreme Soviet 18 months ago for financial oversight of the government. Resulting from the September 1993 events, it ended up, in accordance with the president's edict, under the jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers itself. Early in 1994, the government, yielding to the urging of the Duma's budget committee (with Mikhail Zadornov as chairman), restored the CBC to parliament. The Duma lent legitimacy to this action by a decree under which the CBC is supposed to exercise the functions of keeping tabs on the budget. Thus, before a special law on an Accounts Chamber [Schetnaya Palata] is passed, the CBC happens to be in charge of vetting the spending of budget funds (credits, grants, and subsidies), as well as the finances of nonbudget funds. This enables the CBC soon to become a serious Duma tool to influence the government. Zadornov (Yabloko) is planning to use the committee as a foundation on which to build an Accounts Chamber. The Duma, however, has already elected the chamber's chairman -- Khachim Karmokov ("Independent Regional Policy"). Notably, the group's leader, Vladimir Medvedev, was dissatisfied with the actions of Mikhail Zadornov who managed, at the time of voting, to avoid mentioning in the CBC decree the Accounting Chamber's powers. At the same time, the chairman of the CBC structure (under the decree) cannot be confirmed unless presented and approved by the Budget Committee. This amounts to the Zadornov committee's monopoly in matters of budget control until an Accounts Chamber law goes into effect. Remarkably, Medvedev believes that Zadornov has deliberately dragged his feet on passing this law.
