But only three Mirage 2000 DA will be delivered, instead of the six planned. Following two tame and unmemorable debates, the National Assembly on 10 November 1993 passed the 1994 defense budget presented and defended by Defense Minster Francois Leotard. The Socialist and Communist deputies voted against. As will be recalled, the military equipment budget authorized new spending of 94.9 billion French francs [Fr], 7.8 percent less than the initial 1993 budget, but with the addition of Fr5.5 billion carried forward into 1994 and transfers amounting to Fr2.6 billion, the grand total comes to Fr103 billion. This is shown in the attached table [see below] extracted from the report presented on behalf of the Finance Commission by UDF [French Democratic Union] deputy Arthur Paecht, one of its members. At Fr103 billion, it amounts to a 5.7 percent increase over the appropriations actually made available in 1993, taking into account the cancellation of some credits during the year (9 billion) and the carryforward of others into 1993 (3.5 billion). The rapporteur made two important observations about the defense package: - The Fr103 billion includes nonrenewable appropriations. As a result, there may be some risk that the budgetary reference point used for programming purposes will still be only Fr94.9 billion; - Comparisons between 1994 and 1993 are virtually impossible, owing to uncertainties affecting the two budgets: on the one hand, carryforwards, cancellations, and external operations in 1993; on the other, carryforwards, transfers, and external operations in 1994 -- and all with the assumption there will be no freezes or canceled appropriations during this fiscal year. A category-by-category analysis of this budget leads to the following observations: Space: At Fr4,147 million, the appropriation for space programs (budget + carryforwards) is up 13.8 percent, with the increase inuring mainly to the benefit of the Helios optical reconnaissance and observation satellite, the first of which is scheduled for launch in 1994. In addition, the Syracuse II (telecommunications satellite) program will benefit from the decision to launch a fourth satellite. Research on radar (Osiris) and electromagnetic (Zenon) observation satellites will continue. Nuclear: The total Fr22.9 billion in appropriations requested for the nuclear deterrent force (research, development, and fabrication) represents an 8.8 percent reduction, due to completion of the Mirage 2000N program and the stretching-out of the M5 ballistic missile program. The [new-generation] nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine program (SNLE NG) will continue as before. The "Triomphant" is expected to enter into service in 1996, the "Temeraire" in 1998, and the "Vigilant" in 2001. The segment of the minister's speech devoted to resumption of nuclear testing raised a number of eyebrows. We will quote from it at length: "...As for resumption of testing, the question is not whether we must do so but when: This will be determined solely in terms of the need to protect our vital interests and our independence. Thus it is not the moratorium which is at issue, but rather its perpetuity... Many speakers have called for resumption of testing in order to acquire simulation capability. The necessity of this, for France and for other countries as well, is incontestable." Air Force: It can expect an overall equipment budget of Fr24.3 billion (up 3.7 percent). The Rafale Air Force program is being stretched out by six months (the consequences of this delay are analyzed on page 10 of this issue). As planned, 12 Mirage 2000 D and 10 Mirage F1CT will be delivered in 1994. However, only three Mirage 2000 DA will be delivered rather than the six planned. The SCCOA (System for Command and Control of Air Operations) program will be stretched out by several months. The program to purchase Tucano training aircraft from Brazil is scaled back slightly (18 aircraft instead of the 20 planned). The other programs, including the Mirage 2000-5, will proceed as previously scheduled. Army: Its equipment budget comes to Fr23.9 billion (up six percent). A total of 44 Leclerc tanks will be ordered instead of the 66 planned, and (as planned) 34 of them are scheduled for delivery. The other programs (light armored vehicle, Eryx and long-range AC3G antitank missiles, multiple rocket-launchers) are retained. The "Tigre" and NH-90 helicopter programs will proceed as scheduled. Navy: Its equipment appropriations -- Fr24.5 billion -- are up 4.4 percent over the total available in 1993. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was delayed six months in 1993 as a result of canceled appropriations. It is now scheduled to go into service in mid-1999. The Rafale Navy program is also pushed back six months. The state will order only two Rafale Navy aircraft in 1994 instead of the four planned. Five Atlantique 2 aircraft will be delivered in 1994. Other programs will proceed as previously scheduled, including the NH-90 transport helicopter, a cooperative venture between the Army and three European partner countries (Germany, Netherlands, Italy). The special rapporteur expressed the hope that the total cost of this program, still in the development phase, can be determined very precisely along with its financing modalities. Gendarmerie: Its budget is Fr2.2 billion. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Equipment Outlays for 1994 (in millions of French francs) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chapters |1994 Appropriatio-|Carryforwards |Total | | |ns | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |56-60 Research--S-|3,515 |460 |3,975 | |pace | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |56-70 Research--N-|13,577 |395 |13,972 | |uclear | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |56-80 Research--C-|15,219 |425 |15,644 | |onventional | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |52-70 Investments |1,609 |330 |1,939 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |53-70 Fabrication |3,274 |206 |3,480 | |(joint services p-| | | | |lus gendarmerie) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |53-80 Fabrication |49,850 |3,328 |53,178 | |(Army-Air Force-N-| | | | |avy) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Infrastructure |6,915 |424 |7,339 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Military Supplies | |-70 | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TOTAL TITLE V |93,961 |5,500 |99,461 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Title VI |945 |0 |945 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TOTAL EQUIPMENT |94,907 |5,500 |100,407 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transfers (commer-|+2,593 |0 |+2,593 | |cial accounts) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MILITARY EQUIPMEN-|97,500 |5,500 |103,000 | |T BUDGET | | | | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
