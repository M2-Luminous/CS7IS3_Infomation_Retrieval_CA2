It has now been revealed how Democrat MP Somkhit Nuanphian knew so much about a proclaimed U.S. blacklist of Thai politicians suspected of involvement in the drug trade. "He told me he got that information when he worked for the KGB," said Democrat Thanin Chaisamut, referring to the Central Intelligence Agency's rival in the former Soviet empire. Thanin appeared serious. Asked if Somkhit remained a Soviet spy, Thanin replied, "Not any more. The Soviet Union has crumbled." Somkhit triggered the Opposition's outburst when he followed up on Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's statement that many Thai politicians were blacklisted due to suspicion that they were involved in narcotics smuggling. During a tumultuous House debate, opposition MPs demanded Somkhit, who was not in the chamber, to reveal names and disclose the source of his information. Thanin said he tried to avoid Somkhit. "I don't walk with him any longer. There's nothing except that I'm afraid I'll be caught in the cross-fire if somebody tries to silence him," Thanin said.
