President Li Teng-hui and ranking government officials will greet Ousmane and his wife at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. With a land area of some 1.27 million square kilometers, Niger is the largest among the 29 countries with which Taiwan maintains official relations. It is rich in uranium deposits, and is one of the few countries in Africa that has a self-sufficient economy. Osmane, who won Niger's first popular presidential election in March 1993, will sign a joint communique with President Li reaffirming Niger's support for Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations. The Republic of China [ROC] first set up diplomatic relations with Niger in 1963. But ties were suspended for 11 years after Niger recognized Mainland China in July 1974. The two nations re- established formal ties in 1992. An agricultural cooperation program that calls for Taiwan to help Niger grow rice is expected to be finalized during President Ousmane's visit. Accompanying Ousmane in his first Taiwan trip will be Niger Foreign and Cooperation Minister Abdourahmane Hama, and Trade, Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdoulaye Souley.
