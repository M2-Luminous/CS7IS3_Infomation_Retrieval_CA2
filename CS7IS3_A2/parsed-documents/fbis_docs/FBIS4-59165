Elements from the so-called Islamic Movement supported the Mas'ud Barzani elements to control the offices of the Jalal Talabani clique. In response, the Talabani clique attacked a number of men of religion in the region, killing five of them. In Irbil Governorate, clashes flared up on the outskirts of Salah al-Din summer resort, where Mas'ud Barzani's headquarters are located. Other clashes took place in Kuysanjaq and the (Katlajan) complex. Elements from the Mas'ud Barzani group opened fire with machine guns and rocket launchers on Jalal Talabani's house in Shaqlawah. Reports from Irbil say that a state of fear and panic is prevailing among the leaders of the saboteurs. They fear that the situation in Irbil might explode because the situation there is difficult to control due to the existence of most of the forces and offices of Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabi there. Thousands of the residents of districts and cities there fled their homes to the mountains and valleys in fear for their lives. Elements from the cliques of saboteurs are taking advantage of the situation there to loot homes and shops.
