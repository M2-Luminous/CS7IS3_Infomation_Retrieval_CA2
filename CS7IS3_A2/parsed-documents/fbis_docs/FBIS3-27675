Taiwan is required to hold tariff reduction talks with member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a condition to gaining membership in the world trade body. Taiwan hopes agreements reached at this round of negotiations will set the tone for its subsequent negotiations with other GATT members. Vice Economics Minister Sheu Ke-sheng [Hsu K'e-sheng] and Assistant US Trade Representative for GATT Affairs Dorothy Dwoskin are the chief negotiators for the two sides. Sheu [Hsu] heads up a 170-person delegation. According to sources at the talks, the United States is likely to request that Taiwan agree to the bilateral elimination of tariffs on 2,172 products. Last year the United States asked Taiwan to lower tariff rates on industrial and agricultural goods to 10 and 20 percent, respectively. The US side is also likely to claim "initial negotiation rights" regarding tariffs on an additional 2,786 of its export items to Taiwan, the sources said. Other topics to be discussed include nontariff obstacles and Taiwan's monopoly system.
