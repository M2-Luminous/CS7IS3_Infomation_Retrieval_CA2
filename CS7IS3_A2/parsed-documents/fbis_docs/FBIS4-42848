Even inside the National Assembly, everything had been strictly ordered: Journalists were banned from the corridors, elevators had been locked, etc. It would appear that these precautions were "imposed" by the FBI [as published], which was represented in force at the National Assembly. Bill Clinton spoke to parliament for half an hour yesterday afternoon. He was the third head of state to be accorded this honor, following in the footsteps of President Wilson in 1919 and the king of Spain last year. It is true that the National Assembly is expected to play host to more heads of state since [Assembly Speaker] Philippe Seguin took the initiative. Yesterday, almost all the deputies were present to hear the President of the United States speak, and they gave him sustained applause. [passage omitted] Philippe Seguin had welcomed President Clinton and recalled "the magnificent heroism and immense sacrifices" that had enabled "the liberation of General de Gaulle's France" and "victory over a common enemy." The Assembly speaker then stressed the need to be vigilant: "Today, as in 1919, everything seems possible, the worst and the best of things. On the one hand, we are witnessing the return of the hates and conflicts that had been buried in history and which are now coupled with the previously unknown threats regarding the environment and the proliferation of weapons. On the other hand, in southern Africa and in the Middle East, hopes have sprung up of a peace that we thought was unattainable, while the cause of liberty seems to be scoring many points." Mr. Seguin continued: "We are living what could be described as a new postwar period, one of those rare and ephemeral periods where history hesitates between peace and chaos, between justice and strength. The hope is there, amid many different dangers, of a new, fairer, and more peaceful world order." We therefore have to work at building "a new world order," he said, with a view to "organizing a fair and equitable international society." The Assembly speaker concluded his speech by saying: "Let us have no doubt about it, this fresh impetus will find France and the United States side by side, as at every decisive moment when freedom and world peace were at stake. The shared commitment of our nations has been sealed by this brotherhood in arms and hearts which, from the battlefields of Virginia to the beaches of Normandy and the liberation of French soil, symbolizes the common destiny of our two peoples."
