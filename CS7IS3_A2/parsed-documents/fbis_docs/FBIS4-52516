Hata replied the tasks must be done and will draw international criticism if they are not. The business leaders were Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Masaru Hayami, president of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) and Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Hayami asked Hata to follow the reform-oriented policies pursued by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and appealed for a national election under a new electoral system after summer.
