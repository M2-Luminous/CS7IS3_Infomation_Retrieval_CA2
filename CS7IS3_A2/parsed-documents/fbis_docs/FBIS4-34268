In the case of the National Constituent Assembly, minority blocs sought a court injunction to get the Assembly to respect their right to vote on the 13 agreements of the package closed by Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin item by item. The assembly had decided the 13 amendments will be voted on as a single package. Radical [Radical Civic Union, UCR] and Justicialist [Justicialist Party, PJ] leaders will appeal Judge Raul Dalla Fontana's decision to allow the complaints of provincial parties. The Supreme Court will now decide if the courts can consider Constituent Assembly decisions. The parties that signed the pact [UCR and PJ] want the court to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Constituent Assembly decisions cannot be considered by the courts. If the court dismisses the complaint it will hurt Eduardo Duhalde, whose followers have filed a petition arguing that regulations approved by the Grand Front, Modin [Movement for Independence and Dignity], and UCR alliance are unconstitutional. If the court decides it cannot consider National Constituent Assembly decisions it will also be unable to discuss the Buenos Aires Constituent Assembly regulations and Duhalde will be unable to change the regulation that bans him from seeking reelection.
