Hosokawa on Friday abruptly announced he would step down, saying "new suspicions" that investment of some of his personal funds may have been unlawful. The sources said Masatoshi Miyama, Hosokawa's former financial secretary, entrusted the publisher with the investment of 60 million yen with intermediation of Tanaka's former secretary. The secretary denied his involvement in the financial transactions in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The publisher could not be reached for comment. According to the sources, around 1981 Miyama asked Tanaka's former secretary, an acquaintance of Miyama, for advice on investing funds and Tanaka's secretary introduced the publisher to Miyama. At that time, Hosokawa was a House of Councillors member in Tanaka's faction in the Liberal Democratic Party. The next year, with Tanaka's backing, Hosokawa successfully ran in the Kumamoto gubernatorial race. The publisher was an investment consultant and was engaged in an illegal money-lending business, the sources said. At first, the publisher was entrusted with more than 1 million yen and was later entrusted with the 60 million yen, part of the money Hosokawa raised through sale of land inherited in 1982, they said. In 1991, when Miyama quit Hosokawa's office, he reportedly told the office that the investment of the 60 million yen was not a success and that only 10 million yen worth of shares were left. Hosokawa received some 202 million yen in 1982 as his portion of the sale of an estate in Suginami ward in Tokyo after he and two of his relatives inherited the estate following the death of their grandmother Chiyoko Konoe in September 1980. After paying inheritance taxes and lending 64 million yen of the money to one of his political fund-raising organizations, Hosokawa entrusted the remaining 60 million yen to Miyama, the sources said. The opposition camp has demanded Miyama be summoned before the Diet to testify on Hosokawa's finances. The premier has repeatedly rejected the call. Hosokawa told a news conference Friday that "from 1981 and for several years, my office let a certain person use the fund, and he gained personal profit from it. That person is an old personal friend of mine." "He specifically requested that money be entrusted to him, because he would manage it for profit. But there were some problems in the process of the management of that particular fund." He declined, however, to elaborate further on the specifics of the new suspicions, saying an investigation by his political office was still underway.
