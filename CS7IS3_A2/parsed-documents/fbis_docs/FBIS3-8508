These resolutions condemn the brutality, acts, and violence of the Serbian regime against the Albanians of Kosova. Welcoming the approval of these two resolutions, the government of the republic of Kosova has issued a public communique stressing that Belgrade has been shown to be responsible for violating the basic freedoms and rights of the Albanian people. Thus, the UN resolutions express the will of the civilized peoples in the world to object to every violation of human rights in Kosova and undertake actions in this regard. The government of the republic of Kosova is of the opinion that the will expressed by its people is the only basis for a final solution. The communique asks the UN to increase its efforts to be present in Kosova to help prevent conflict and guarantee the return of democratic institutions to normality.
