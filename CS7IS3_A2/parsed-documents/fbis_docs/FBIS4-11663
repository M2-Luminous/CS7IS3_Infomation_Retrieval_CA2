FBIS4-11663 "drnes062cc_94005" FBIS-NES-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Islamic Affairs ICO Issues Statement on Palestinian Land Day ICO Issues Statement on Palestinian Land Day LD3003215494 Riyadh SPA in English 1939 GMT 30 Mar 94 LD3003215494 Riyadh SPA English BFN [Text] Jeddah, March 30, (SPA) -- The general secretariat of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) [ICO] has reaffirmed the Islamic nation's solidarity with the just struggle of the Palestinian people to restore their firm, unequivocal national rights of self-determination and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital on Palestinian soil, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. This came in a statement issued today by the OIC Secretary General Dr. Hamed al-Ghabid on the occasion of the Palestinian Land Day on March 30. He said this occasion comes at a time when Palestinian people are suffering from the escalation of killing, oppression and persecution by Israeli authorities since the Hebron massacre. He pointed out that Tuesday's carnage which claimed the lives of six Palestinians and wounded scores others at the Jabalia refugee camps and was committed by Israeli occupation forces is a new proof of continued Israeli hostilities and non-commitment to the establishment of just and comprehensive peace in the region. He said this confirms the necessity to secure immediate international protection for the Palestinian people as the current situation triggered by Israeli inhuman practices warns of a near explosion and an escalation of violence and threatens to destroy the peace process. Dr. Ghabid expressed the OIC's strong condemnation of the killing and repression carried out by Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinian people. He urged the international community to shoulder its responsibilities and force Israel to halt its criminal acts immediately and secure international protection for the Palestinian people.
