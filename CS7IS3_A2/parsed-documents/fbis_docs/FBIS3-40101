The Principles of the Adjusted Economic Policy on Tobacco The adjusted economic policy on tobacco will be suited to our socialist market economy development, by giving consideration to the interests of the three parties of tobacco farmers, local governments, and tobacco enterprises, in order to ensure that the real income of peasants for a normal harvest year does not drop, and to essentially maintain the existing tobacco-product tax level, while basically not raising cigarette-enterprise production costs. II. Strict Control of Tobacco Production To control unchecked tobacco production, all provinces and autonomous regions, when purchasing tobacco, will conscientiously implement the provisions in the State Council National Document No 7 (1993) on "all taxes on tobacco exceeding state planned procurement being paid into Central revenues, and the purchasing prices of tobacco sold to the state that exceeds plans or is unplanned floating downward 20 percent," with taxes on all tobacco that exceeds state-assigned annual procurement plans being calculated according to the average tax per dan (50 kg) of flue-cured tobacco for the year in the province (autonomous region), and paid into Central revenues. When arranging particular procurement plans, we will implement the principle of supporting excellence, in order to gradually cut back on the area planted to tobacco that is not suited to tobacco cultivation. III. Adjusted Tobacco Procurement Prices As flue-cured tobacco standards are now in a stage of transition from 15 to 40 grades and, in line with the principles of market demand and price based on quality, tobacco procurement prices are correspondingly adjusted to the two separate flue-cured tobacco standards of 15 and 40 grades (See attachments 1 and 2). The former state-set tobacco production support charge will be incorporated into the tobacco procurement price. IV. The Adjusted Tobacco Product Tax Rate The tobacco-product tax rate is based on the adjusted tobacco-procurement price, being lowered from 38 percent to 31 percent in line with the principle of essentially maintaining the current tobacco-tax level. The Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation will draw up the particular regulations on the adjustment of taxpayment links. V. Deregulated Tobacco Allocation Prices In line with the needs of establishing a socialist market economy and based on our current realities, we are deregulating tobacco-allocation prices. The specific means of application will be drawn up by the pertinent commercial department of the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. These regulations will take effect for 1993's new tobacco listings, with white-rib tobacco, perfume tobacco, and sun-cured tobacco implementing the adjusted plan for flue-cured tobacco. As Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi province (autonomous region) tobacco is in the latter stage of procurement, the respective provincial (autonomous regional) People's Governments will decide whether these provinces (autonomous region) will implement in 1993 the new flue-cured tobacco procurement prices and tobacco product tax rate.
