The non-proliferation of nuclear mass destruction weapons, which Washington has put at the center of its foreign policy, is increasingly ill-fated. The failed attempt to make North Korea rejoin the NPT [Non-Proliferation Treaty] and to include India and Pakistan in a regional conference emphasizes the lack of concept that the current disarmament policy suffers from. This was expressed, amongst others, by India's Prime Minister Rao during his visit to Washington, when he criticized that moral leadership is claimed by those who demand from others what they themselves are not prepared to do. Although the U.S. Administration is calling on the nuclear have-nots to join a discriminating non-proliferation regime, it is by no means planning to scrap the United States' nuclear weapons altogether. The Geneva UN Disarmament Conference may be seeing preliminary talks on the renunciation of the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states; however, talks on extending the nuclear deterrent in the sense of Klaus Kinkel's non-proliferation policy failed because the nuclear states rejected an expansion of multilateral defense obligations. Bilateral talks are no longer about arms testing but "only" about deploying operative arms systems. Clinton's advisers know very well that a nuclear condominium in South Asia and the Far East makes non-proliferation more difficult. However, sobered by the experience in Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti, the Pentagon is preparing a counter proliferation initiative -- although modestly funded at a mere $450 million -- in case the non-proliferation talks fail. Just as Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative was to protect the United States from a strategic first blow, Clinton's program of Counter Proliferation is taking a unilateral course of its own. According to a few critical voices in the U.S. Congress, this could lead to an unpredictable nuclear race, as a result of which the world would face more than the 15 states that are known as possessing nuclear weapons today. The annual meeting of the UN Disarmament Commission in New York was aiming at a clear signal toward an unconditional and unlimited extension of the NPT in April 1995. But instead, reaching a consensus was prevented because there was no clear definition of the objectives of disarmament. This gives rise to the question whether the current non proliferation regime is fit to survive. Although the nuclear states basically share the view of non-nuclear states that non-proliferation is inseparably linked with nuclear disarmament, the codifying of an international agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons arsenals, which has been demanded by several states, and the direct coupling to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons still fail to take place.
