Speaking on his return to Beijing after receiving treatment for a back problem in Britain, Sir Robin said he was present at last week's British cabinet committee meeting on Hong Kong and would relay the views expressed there. He added that he would not go into details but would restate London's commitment to the Joint Declaration and Basic Law. [Begin McLaren recording] I hope I shall be seeing various senior Chinese officials, now that I have returned, and I should be able to explain to them how the British Government sees the way forward.
