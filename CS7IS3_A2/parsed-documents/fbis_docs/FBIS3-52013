On one side is Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola's PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and on the other is at least a part--the so-called ethical wing--of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. The PDT's president, Deputy Neiva Moreira (Maranhao), is trying to conceal the fact by saying that "so far there is no localized effort in that direction," but the president of the PMDB, Deputy Luiz Henrique (Santa Catarina), says that the two parties "will sit down to talk before the end of the year [1993]." What is most surprising about the deal is Brizola's willingness to give up an old precondition. According to reports, the governor of Rio de Janeiro is willing not to impose his own candidacy for president of the republic as the basis for any discussion. "The problem with these alliances is that they zero out all political aspirations," commented Senator Pedro Simon (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), the government's leader in the Senate. He admitted that his party was indeed going to talk to Brizola "before this year is out," but he feels that any political alliance that might result should unite all of "social democracy and also include the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]." Simon commented that the only party that could not be included would be the PT [Workers Party], since it already has a candidate (party president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva). "The PDT also had Brizola at one time, but now he is willing to talk," the senator continued. He emphasized that in order for any agreement to be possible, all parties would have to sit down at the negotiating table as equals or, in this case, without having already picked their candidates. Courtship--Some PMDB and PDT congressmen say the courtship between the two parties was the idea of Neiva Moreira, the PDT's president; Luiz Salomao (Rio de Janeiro), party leader in the Chamber of Deputies; and Deputy Vivaldo Barbosa, all on the PDT's side. The cupid on the PMDB's side was reportedly Jarbas Vasconcellos, mayor of Recife. In the PDT, both Neiva Moreira and Salomao deny having taken the first step toward the agreement. Moreira insists that Brizola is the party's candidate for president of the republic and that the governor is not even free to decide whether or not he will head the party list if there really is a political alliance of some kind. "That decision is made not by him but by the party," he emphasizes. Salomao says the idea is not his, but he adds enthusiastically that "in view of the crisis in the PMDB, if we do not try to attract the wing of the party that interests us, it will wind up in the arms of the PSDB." Salomao feels that the problems facing the PMDB at the moment may lead to a rapprochement with the party's so-called ethical wing. Or, as the PDT leader prefers to put it: "We are not interested in the PMDB's Sarney wing or its Quercia wing; what interests us is the Simon wing." Although no one is openly claiming responsibility for the flirtation between a rather significant wing of the PMDB and the PDT, there is consensus on at least one point: the initiative came from the PDT. The PMDB's president points out that such an agreement already exists in some states. "But for the time being, there is nothing that goes any further than that; I have simply received from Neiva Moreira, Vivaldo Barbosa, and Luiz Salomao a statement of their desire to hold official talks between the PMDB and the PDT," he says. Luiz Henrique claims, however, that the possible rapprochement with the PDT is in no way related to the crisis being experienced by the PMDB. Targeted by accusations that several of its most prominent members are involved in the budget scandal and split into several wings, the PMDB cannot agree on a consensus candidate. Even so, the president feels that if part of his party is arousing the interest of the PDT, that is "because of the party's size and importance." Luiz Henrique made it a point to emphasize that there is no agreement between the two parties. "They took the initiative of talking, and that is very good," he said. According to the president of the PMDB, the flirtation between the two parties began less than two weeks ago. PDT Even Calls on Silvio Santos To Ensure Growth Sao Paulo--The PDT leadership in Sao Paulo is trying once again to resurrect the party in that state and trying to induce businessman and TV host Silvio Santos to join in order to run for governor in the upcoming elections. The PDT's new secretary general in Sao Paulo, former Deputy and former Osasco Mayor Francisco Rossi, says Governor Leonel Brizola has given him the job of conducting the talks with Silvio Santos in order to attract him to the party. "We are working against time because Silvio still belongs to the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the deadline for changing party membership is 8 January," Rossi points out. Silvio Santos will meet with his staff on 3 January to make a decision. For its part, the PDT is already announcing the start of a campaign to attract 1 million new members in Sao Paulo. At the moment, the party cannot even say how many members it has in the state. It has only one federal deputy from Sao Paulo--its regional president, Liberato Caboclo--and one state deputy, Hilkias de Oliveira. "But the party will be different after the next elections," promises Rossi, who was a member of the PDS [Democratic Social Party] and the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] before joining the PDT in September. Rossi says he talked to Silvio Santos 20 days ago. "The talks are still under way, and the only difficulty is that deep down, he still has some hope of being the PFL's candidate for president," Rossi admits. "He says that politics is not part of his life at present, but he does not rule out the possibility that it might be in the future," the PDT leader says. Parallel with that, the Sao Paulo PDT is talking to businessman Antonio Ermirio Votorantim, superintending director of the Votorantim Group. "Antonio Ermirio is also leaning toward being a candidate, but he had a bitter experience in the race for state governor in 1986," says Rossi. "In any case, people on the street are constantly calling on him to be a candidate, and as far as he is concerned, that is more important than any opinion poll. Besides, he has great admiration for Leonel Brizola," Rossi adds. In its efforts to attract Silvio Santos and Antonio Ermirio, the PDT will have to match forces with the PFL. Both men are also being considered by the PFL as possible candidates for governor of Sao Paulo, according to the president of the PFL's executive board in Sao Paulo, former Minister Antonio Cabrera. Elephants--This is not the PDT's first attempt to strengthen its position in Sao Paulo, where its share of the vote has historically been small. On several occasions it has invested in former politicians of declining prestige in the attempt to reorganize itself. Successive examples of this were former Deputy Roge Ferreira, his political heir Adhemar de Barros Filho, former Lieutenant Governor Almino Affonso, and former Deputy Airton Soares. None of them was able to put the party on solid ground or even to get anyone on the new slate elected. Brizola received less than 2 percent of Sao Paulo's vote for president of the republic.
