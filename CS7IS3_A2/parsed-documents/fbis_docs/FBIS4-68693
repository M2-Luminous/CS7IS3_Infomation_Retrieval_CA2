The newspaper's correspondent center in Nizhniy Novgorod has already received a large number of telephone calls and letters. The readers ask whether, during a period of economic instability, it is really possible without state support to engage successfully in such an expensive matter as the construction of housing. And who is this Vyacheslav Rasteryayev? I admit that, prior to my acquaintance with the affairs of the Nizhegorodskiy Dom company, I myself was a big skeptic in this regard. But now I am convinced that such structures have a real future. It is precisely these structures that will create a healthy and massive housing market. The creator, brains, and chief motivating force of Nizhegorodskiy Dom is Vyacheslav Rasteryayev. He is 43 years old. Born in Tver. After graduation from the Moscow Motor Roads Institute, went to Gorkiy. And he has been working there for more than 20 years. He was a foreman and chief of an SMU [construction-installation administration], managed the city's water canal, and worked as the deputy chairman of the rayon and city Soviet. Why did he undertake not the trading of Snickers, but the erecting of housing? "The construction conveyor belt began to fall apart as a result of the sharp slump in centralized investments," Vyacheslav Alekseyevich says. "The collectives that had become accustomed to sensing the constant concern 'from the top' were left without work. But I had communicated with construction workers for my entire life, and I was convinced that I could rectify the situation. But at first I decided that it was necessary to seek new approaches to the formation of sources of construction. Namely, to work with the population, because people do have money. " Having proved by deeds its probity, Nizhegorodskiy Dom acted as the initiator of the construction of the first municipal bank in Russia, which would operate only with the population, but would direct the attracted monetary amounts to the construction complex. The idea was supported by the city administration, which also acquired the controlling block of several large-scale enterprises. That is how the Nizhegorodskiy Kredit municipal investment bank appeared, and Vyacheslav Rasteryayev was elected, ex officio, chairman of its board of directors. The new bank immediately became the most popular one with the people of Nizhniy Novgorod. First, because people had become accustomed to trusting their authorities. And, secondly, it is simply advantageous to deal with it! The Nizhegorodskiy Kredit bank has approximately 20 types of deposits, and they all operate for the benefit of the local residents. Take, for example, the housing-accumulation deposit. By using it, it is possible without hurrying, over a 15-year period, to accumulate enough money for an apartment. It is aimed basically at parents who are thinking about their children's future. After concluding a contract with the bank, the depositor of the housing-accumulation deposit, through his accounting office, transfers two to three minimum wages every month. Today the minimum wage is approximately 15,000 rubles. For a family in which everyone is working, it is not difficult to pay 30,000-40,000 rubles a month. Then, when the child is grown, he is assured of having housing. Incidentally, whoever wants to can transfer even more, and then, naturally, he will get the apartment more quickly. Figures give convincing evidence of the popularity of the municipal bank among the people living along the Volga. During the past four months more than 4 billion rubles were attracted from the population. And the monetary stream is building up. Currently the bank takes in from the people of Nizhniy Novgorod 120-140 million rubles a day. All this money will soon be converted into comfortable apartments. "Currently we are beginning to carry out a new idea," V. Rasteryayev says. "It is the housing municipal loan. Its bonds, of three types, are planned for a three-year period. The first is at a rate of 700,000 rubles per square meter of housing space. If, for example, you want to purchase a one-room apartment over a one-year period, you purchase the necessary number of bonds that correspond to the metric area at that price. But if you need an apartment the next year, that bond will cost 550,000 rubles. If, however, someone is in too much of a hurry and he can be patient for three years, then he must pay for each bond, and, consequently, for each square meter of his future housings, not 700,000 rubles, but only 480,000. The bonds in this loan will also participate simultaneously in the drawing of apartments." "But what about inflation?" "We have gotten away from this insidious concomitant of our day reducing the construction periods. Whereas the 'usual' construction workers will erect homes in two years, we will build them in six months. We achieve this by working in two or three shifts, with the smooth operation of the entire construction conveyor belt. There is also no problem with materials. We always have them on hand. And any kind that is needed, whether they come from Finland or Italy, or even from Chuvashia." Chuvashia was mentioned, of course, not accidentally. It turns out that it is more advantageous to bring in and install reinforced concrete from the neighboring republic than it is to buy it from the nearby Nizhniy Novgorod enterprises. The quality of the shipped-in concrete is better, and the concrete costs less. But many of the local suppliers of building materials continue to operate the old way: the more metal and concrete they bang around, the better. Rasteryayev has a different principle: reduce the amounts of metal, the expenditures of electrical power, cement, and other materials; reduce the construction periods; and take a serious attitude toward cost accountability. Because most of the construction builders have gotten so close to this line that people will no longer be able to buy housing because it is so expensive. Rasteryayev was nominated as a candidate in the recent election to the Nizhniy Novgorod city Duma. "At first I had my doubts about whether I needed this," he recalls, "but, after thinking that, instead of me, the person elected to the Duma might be some sweet-talking temporary person who would not help the city in any way, I gave my consent to run." And he won, as the expression goes, with a clear advantage. At the first organizational meeting of the Duma, Vyacheslav Alekseyevich was elected chairman of the commission for construction, architecture, and land relations. Rasteryayev has already proven to his constituents that he had good reason for becoming a deputy. He proposed a unique self-reproducing mortgage scheme. The city will allocate, for example, to its municipal bank 14 billion rubles. By using that money it can build 500 apartments this year. Naturally, the expended money will not return rapidly to the city treasury. Rasteryayev proposed doing this: these 14 billion "work" in the bank and grow to 40 billion. From that amount the city will get back its 14 billion, and with the remaining 26 billion it will be possible to build, with a consideration of inflation, 350 apartments. The city will distribute these apartments -- to doctors, teachers, people in the military -- and will transfer the lists to Nizhegorodskiy Dom. The company will offer the potential tenants the opportunity to buy those apartments by installment payments, for example, over a 25-year period, with a payment of one to two minimum wages a month. The average cost of an apartment is currently approximately 40 million rubles. Over a 25-year period that amount will be converted to a negligible amount. At the same time the mortgage fund will be constantly augmented by the tenants' payments, guaranteeing a stable work order for the construction workers. And there is monitoring, since the bank is a municipal one. Thus, by investing the money once, it is possible to force it to work for a long time. Rasteryayev's scheme was reviewed and approved by the city administration. Now it is up to the Nizhniy Novgorod Duma to have its say. This is a matter for the near future. But Nizhegorodskiy Dom already has something with which to please its fellow city dwellers during the current half-year. In a month a 200-apartment building will be able to accept new tenants. In June the largest recuperation center in the Volga region, and perhaps in all of Russia, will be turned over. It has a swimming pool, saunas, practice rooms, and medical offices. The doors of several bank branches are also opening. Work is actively continuing to build three major housing projects simultaneously. "In order to break through the dam of the depression, it is necessary to create a building boom in the country," Vyacheslav Rasteryayev states. "Only a construction flywheel can get the country's economy moving again."
