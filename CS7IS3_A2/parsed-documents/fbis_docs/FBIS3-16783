Workers of Atomic Stations in Kursk Continue Hunger Strike"] [Text] Leaders of the Central Committee of the Atomenergoprom trade union, "Electroprofsoyuz," as well as chiefs of the "Rosenergoatom" concern told journalists in a press conference in Moscow yesterday that a dangerous situation has currently taken shape at virtually all nuclear stations of Russia which carries "a real threat to the country's security and, unless urgent measures are taken, may result in emergency situations in the regions entailing grave social and ecological consequences." According to Vladimir Kashkin, deputy chairman of the Central Committee of the Atomenergomash trade union, the situation results from nonpayments and the lowering of the rate of payment for electric power on the part of the "Single Power Supply System of Russia" joint-stock company. Owing to the absence of monetary funds, atomic electric power stations [AES] could not buy nuclear fuel and did not carry out in good time the scheduled repairs, reconditioning, maintenance, and reconstruction. The remaining stock of nuclear fuel at most AES's around Russia is enough for them to operate at nominal capacity for not longer than one month. Specialists think that a forced shutdown of AES generators would result in nuclear stations' becoming, instead of producers, major consumers of electric power to remove residual energy from nuclear fuel, and would serve only as storages for highly radioactive materials. Vladimir Kashkin also stated that an extremely tense situation has taken shape in the collectives of nuclear stations, including nuclear safety personnel, over delayed wages. Mass protest actions against the government's economic policy have already begun. For example, five workers of the Kursk AES continue their hunger strike announced on 11 March. According to Kursk AES director Vladimir Gusarov, the strikers demand that debts for the already supplied electricity be settled, and that wages for December, January, and February be paid. They also insist on meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to prevent a social explosion in work collectives. The press conference organizers announced that owing to explosive developments, the coordination committee on joint actions, set up three days ago at a joint conference of Atomenergoprom and "Elektroprofsoyuz" trade unions representatives, forwarded yesterday an appeal to the Russian president, prime minister, and chairmen of the Federal Assembly chambers. It says that "the work collectives' patience is not limitless." It also contains a demand for an urgent discussion in the government of issues connected with ending the crisis in power engineering, and for the passing of Russian Federation laws "On Atomic Energy" and "On Electric Power Engineering." [Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0400 GMT on 19 March adds, in a report from Murmansk: "The Kola nuclear power station has four power units. Two of them have already been closed down. The planned close-down of the third power unit is scheduled for 22 March. Naturally, such a sharp reduction of power supply to enterprises in the oblast will immediately affect the economic situation in the region, because the nuclear power station provides 60 percent of all the electricity produced in the Kola Peninsula. The Murmansk Oblast enterprises will certainly feel the power shortage, but first of all the supply of power will be stopped to neighboring Karelia and Leningrad Oblast. The nuclear power station has no guarantee that the fourth power unit will not be closed down as well."]
