The slow progress in economic activity resulted in a 1.2-percent reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) for the first time since 1987, according to a report by the Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco). The report revealed the manufacturing industry decreased by 1.5 percent last year, while the commerce, restaurant, and hotel sectors declined by 1.2 percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 29 March 94 p 28) The production of important raw materials by Pemex Petrochemical, a subsidiary of Mexican Petroleum (Pemex), shrunk by approximately 14 percent last year due to the closure of obsolete plants and the difficult situation of internal and external markets. Ethylene and polyethylene production declined 12 percent while ammonium and methanol fell 20 percent and 15 percent respectively. Pemex Petrochemical concluded that concerning synthetic fibers, the importation of clothes, fabric, and textiles has reduced internal production, thereby affecting the demand for raw materials produced by Pemex.

The official said Mexico had a positive trade balance of $78.9 million. The Chilean diplomat explained bilateral trade was boosted by the Economic Supplementary Agreement, which became effective in January 1992. The official concluded Chile exported $130.8-million worth of goods to Mexico during 1993, while it imported more than $200 million worth of goods.

Among the deregulated products are fuels like gasoline, diesel fuel, natural and liquefied gas, and 20 primary petrochemicals. According to Secofi, the prices of these products will be regulated by the law of supply and demand. Secofi sources have concluded this decision was made based on the fact the opening of the economy guarantees availability of products for internal consumption. Meanwhile in Washington, the World Bank approved a $450-million loan to Mexico on 31 March. The loan will be used to improve quality and efficiency of elementary school education in 10 of the poorest states of Mexico.

The business leader said it would be erroneous to close the gap between population growth and economic dynamism by using "populist policies."

Last year the GDP grew by .4 percent, while the population grew by 1.9 percent.
