Following ultimatums on the membership of the government, the Coordinating Council of Democratic Russia announced today that it will act "as an opponent to the course of the government headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin." The statement says that Russia is leaving the course of reform. The leaders of Democratic Russia believe that this is borne out by Yegor Gaydar's refusal to join the new government. "Gaydar's departure is in line with events and confirms the general tendency toward curtailing the course of reform in the country," the statement says. The leaders of Democratic Russia are threatening to organize statements in the press, and also to hold mass acts of protest against the government's policies. The first meeting of Moscow's public has been set by the leaders of Democratic Russia for 22 January.
