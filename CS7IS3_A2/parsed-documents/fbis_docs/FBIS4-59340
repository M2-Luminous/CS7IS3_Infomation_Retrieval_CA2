What are the real reasons for the crisis? [Al-Wazir] The main reason is the financial and administrative chaos, which began before unity and has continued to aggravate since. There is indiscipline in the expenditure of public funds, and all departments are in disarray. The economic situation is in extremely bad shape. In addition, there is no interest in work, and all parties are pursuing unsound policies. Moreover, the political leadership has failed to make officials abide by the law and work rules and pay attention to public interest, so it has reached the point that personal interests guide the officials. Everyone takes care of his personal interests and ignores the interests of the homeland. [Yasin] There are people who speak of other reasons. They say that the political leader give high military posts to their relatives and fellow tribesmen. [Al-Wazir] This is also part of the disorder that prevails in all civilian and military departments. [Yasin] Is petroleum one of the reasons for the crisis, because every party wants to get that revenue and because they have failed to distribute it to the two parts of the country? [Al-Wazir] This is totally untrue. The unhealthy malpractices are the main reason. The state's funds are treated as funds that belong to no one. [Yasin] Certain individuals hint that regional and international circles are playing a role in the incidents and in influencing the fate of unity. [Al-Wazir] I do not believe this is this case. In fact, if there is any foreign plotting, the influential rival Yemeni factions gave them the opportunity. [Yasin] How then do you explain Vice President 'Ali Salim al- Bid's tour of the Gulf countries after the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, a tour which he made without consulting with the Yemeni president? [Al-Wazir] The situation was bad in Yemen, and the vice president says his tour was designed to improve Yemen's ties with neighboring countries. Prior consultation was not possible at the time because differences had not yet been settled. [Yasin] Do you believe that this tour was normal behavior since it came directly after the signing of the Document? [Al-Wazir] The vice president has given his justifications, which show concern for Yemen's ties with its neighbors. [Yasin] Mystery surrounds the U.S. role as a mediator in the Yemeni crisis and also Washington's position on Yemeni unity. How do you view this role? [Al-Wazir] Many people say that the United States is not opposed to Yemen's unity because it wants stability in Yemen. They say it wants this to promote stability and quiet in the region as a whole, to guarantee the continued flow of oil and because Yemen can be used as an alternative oil shipping point if problems recur in the Gulf. [Yasin] Certain parties propose a confederation as an alternative to a complete merger and as a way out of the crisis. What do you think? [Al-Wazir] This issue takes us back to the question of Yemeni society and whether unity is feasible for it. I maintain that there is no society where unity is more feasible as for the Yemenis. This society does not have the problem of any minorities, whether religious, ethnic, or linguistic. However, historical experience has shown that no one area can rule the others and no one individual can dominate all others. In other words, when there is a central government, fragmentation and secession occur. Retaining local rule in certain aspects would guarantee the continuation and success of unity. Therefore, local elections, for example, are considered to be an excellent thing by the Yemeni president, who approved them; all that remains is to implement them. But in my view, local elections would bolster unity; and this does not mean federalism. [Yasin] This clause is outlined in the Pledge and Accord Document, but it was not implemented. [Al-Wazir] It is funny that every party claims it supports the Document and accuses the other party of refusing to implement it. Only one part of the Document has not been implemented. I believe that the Yemeni president is capable, understanding, and flexible. If he wants to end the crisis he can do so, as he has the finesse and flexibility. By using his strong position he can steer things toward implementation of the Document. [Yasin] But the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is asking for guarantees before implementing the Document. What are these guarantees and what is the possibility of providing them? [Al-Wazir] The YSP is demanding the implementation of specific clauses in the Document, as this would insure the return of Vice President al-Bid to Sanaa. The required guarantees are the implementation of the initial clauses relating to security in order to make Sanaa secure for residence. [Yasin] The concern over security is linked to the assassinations of dozens of YSP members. Why are those responsible for the assassinations not punished? [Al-Wazir] Ask those who refuse to investigate these crimes. [Yasin] But you, as a Yemeni who follow events, may have an idea of the reason for this refusal, especially since there have been 156 assassinations. [Al-Wazir] I believe that establishing security is very important to promoting the democratic process, which can only thrive in an atmosphere of security and stability. Dialogue, unlike violence, provides a chance for understanding. If it is difficult to implement the initial clause of the Document--that is, handing over those accused of the assassinations--the parties can start by implementing the other clauses of the Document and leave the first clause for the future. I propose that the parties start by implementing local rule and put off the clause on assassinations, which is difficult. [Yasin] Why is it difficult? [Al-Wazir] Because they have not started to implement it, which indicates that it is difficult. [Yasin] I would like to ask about the other political forces in Yemen, particularly the al-Islah Party, the third partner in the government. [Al-Wazir] The al-Islah Party is a prominent party and is trying to contain the crisis. However, the efforts of all parties should focus on implementing the Pledge and Accord Document, because it is the key to solving problems and achieving social justice, which is absent in Yemen. Yemen is now divided into an abject poor class and an unfairly rich one. Other problems are rife in Yemen, like the lack of security and deterioration of education. Moreover, the media is concentrating on useless aims. There are other problems that the al-Islah Party, the General People's Congress, and the YSP should resolve; and they should revive the principles and goals for which blood was shed to establish the state of Yemen. If they fail to do this, the long struggle would be in vain. [Yasin] What about your party? [Al-Wazir] The Islamic Unification and Action Party, as is clear from the name, is an Islamic party based on monotheism and it acts to establish a state on the basis of true Islam. The ideology of the party is that there is no contradiction between traditionalism and modernism. We call for coping with the age while not disavowing tradition and heritage of our predecessors. The party also calls for Arab and Islamic unity. [passage omitted]
