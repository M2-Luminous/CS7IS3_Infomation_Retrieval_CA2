We did this to strengthen collaboration among various government agencies and the private sector [words indistinct] infringements, piracy, and counterfeiting, and since then, the 13 government agencies and the two NGO's [nongovernment organization] who compose the IACIPR, had mounted a concerted and aggressive effort in pursuing the committee's mandate and functions. [passage omitted] From the perspective of local investors, authors, trademark owners, and producers, IPR protection is indispensable for the development of domestic industries that do more than copy foreign models, but show the creativity and the ingenuity of the Filipino. Provided with adequate protection and incentives, the Filipino inventor can develop the critical technology needed for the rapid development of our industrial and agricultural sectors. [passage omitted] Under the 1992 Inventor and Invention Incentives Act, R.A. [Republic Act] 7459, inventors enjoy income tax exemptions for the first 10 years from the date of the first sale of the invention and they are exempted from business license fees, among others. Through your IACIPR, you will strengthen the protection of their inventions against piracy and counterfeiting so that they will earn rightful profits for their inventions and recover their investment. We plan to do the same thing for our artists, writers, performers, composers, and musicians whose talents have not only enriched our lives but have gained worldwide recognition for the Philippines as well. That, this administration has given priority to the development of culture and the arts. [sentence as heard] We have adopted the national development plan for culture and the arts to promote a renaissance in Filipino culture. Institutions critical to the plan are now in place, part of which is the national endowment fund for cultural and artistic programs. The government is also taking steps to develop the local movie, television, and music industries into export industries, and we hope to turn Metro Manila and Subic and many other places later on into the Hollywood of the Philippines and of the Asia-Pacific region. To promote cultural renewal it is important that the intellectual creations of Filipino artists and musicians be recognized and protected. In the state of our composers, for example, we should give value to their intellectual creations and their works by paying them adequate royalties every time their music is performed for profit and it is only just and fair that all establishments using their musical compositions should start thinking about paying the royalties due our composers and musicians. [applause] I am pleased to announce that upon my instructions the Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has submitted a study on how to effectively enforce nationwide the music copyrights of composers and authors. From the perspective of foreign investments, especially those that hasten the phase of technology transfer, our interest is to build up the confidence of investors in the country's capability to protect their intellectual property rights the minute they bring their own technology and products into the Philippines. We must also contend with international development that impacts on foreign trade and investments. For example, major markets for our export products such as garments, furniture, and sugar, require that we protect their IPR or otherwise face trade sanctions. This can adversely affect the achievements of our export and investment targets. IPR, therefore, is clearly indispensable if we are to achieve the goals of Philippines 2000. Towards making the Philippine business environment more attractive and competitive in the race to attract foreign investments, the Philippine Government remains committed to evaluating its present flaws of IPR in consonance with our multilateral and bilateral commitments. As you well know, last 15 February 1993 [year as heard], the Philippines, together with 117 other countries accepted the conclusions of the Uruguay Round [UR] of the multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, or GATT, because it will bring about substantive benefits to our economy. The recently concluded UR negotiations have further strengthened the multilateral trading system by bringing in agriculture and services into the GATT, achieving lower tariffs, removing nontariff barriers, improving GATT rules and discipline, including dispute settlement and ensuring a more adequate protection of IPR's. In the area of IPR's, the benefits we can derive from the UR are the greatly reduced risk of unilateral trade action such as the Section 301 actions of the U.S. Omnibus Trade Law and strengthen dispute settlement procedures. But availing ourselves of this benefit is not without cost. In the area of IPR we have to accede to tighter rules for protection and accept the possibility of cross-retaliation which means that continued violation of commitments in the services of IPR areas, for example, can bring about a retaliation in the goods area if authorized by the new world trade organization. The UR provisions of the trade [-related] aspects of intellectual property or TRIP's have set terms and standards on IPR that all the members of the GATT will have to adopt in their respective laws. Most of these norms and standards, however, are already found in Philippine laws. In Asia, we have one of the most comprehensive legal systems dealing with intellectual property. As early as 1947, the Philippines legislated a patent of trademark system based on American law. In 1972, P.D. [Presidential Decree] 49, a decree on intellectual property was issued containing almost all the modern principles of copyrights, including the grant of copyrights to computer software. Likewise, the rights of performers, recording companies, and broadcasting companies known as property rights, were recognized and protected. But unlike other developing countries, especially in Asia, our acceptance of the TRIP's agreement does not involve a basic change in our existing intellectual property protection system. It would merely introduce changes to update our laws in line with the rapidly modernizing world. In considering the many benefits and advantages the Philippines would gain in accepting the UR agreement, I am clearly in favor of Philippine accession to the substantive provisions of the 1971 Berne Convention. Early today, I signed our country's instrument of accession, thereto, an endorsement letter to the Senate requesting it to ratify the same as soon as possible. [applause] I would like to assure you that we will also take decisive action to amend our laws to adopt to TRIP's standards. These bills are now being rushed and the DTI will ensure their filing with Congress shortly. While intellectual property rights laws in the Philippines are comprehensive enough, much more is to be done to improve their enforcement and we would like to thank Stanford Research Institute or SRI International for undertaking an in-depth study on the problems of the adjudication process of IPR cases. I have taken note of and I am very much alarmed by the serious delays and inefficiencies which the existing adjudication procedures inflict on IPR holders whenever they seek redress for their grievances. I assure you that we will give serious considerations to measures that you have proposed to clear the procedural bottlenecks that you have identified. We now see a convergence between government plans and those of SRI in certain proposed measures to solve the problems in the adjudication process. We have already considered the need to set up special courts to hear exclusively IPR cases. I do not have any objection to this proposal. In fact, I would like to take this opportunity to direct your IACIPR Chairman Secretary Navarro to coordinate with the executive secretary, Teofisto Guingona, of the referral of this proposal to Chief Justice Andres Narvasa of the Supreme Court. We will request him to act on this favorably. Please take note also that the administration-sponsored measure revising the jurisdiction of the courts was approved last week by the Senate-House bicameral conference committee. The threshold of the amounts involved for the regional trial court, or RTC, to acquire jurisdiction with respect to civil actions involving real property, maritime, [word indistinct] cases, and etcetera has been increased substantially. This will unload the dockets of the RTC's and enable then to dispose of their backlog expeditiously. We also hope to raise the penalties of infringement of IPR and simplify the procedures for the prosecution of IPR violators through legislation. Finally, allow me to commend the IACIPR for its impressive performance during its first year of operations in battling piracy and counterfeiting [applause] [passage omitted]
