"The Kaliningrad region is an anomaly in the Baltic Sea region because of the huge army and navy forces concentrated in this area," af Ugglas was quoted as saying by the Lithuanian ministry.

The Lithuanian ministry said efforts to raise the issue of Kaliningrad's demilitarization on an international level and to integrate the region into international cooperation processes would significantly contribute to enhancing security in the Baltic Sea region.
