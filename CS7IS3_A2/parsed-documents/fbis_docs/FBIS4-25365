Tsai] [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan's private visit to Mexico underscores development in ties between Taiwan and the Central American country, Deputy Secretary-General Raymond Tai of the presidential office said Tuesday [7 June]. Lien arrived in Mexico City Sunday afternoon for a three-day visit after concluding his official visit to El Salvador and Guatemala. In a regular news conference, Tai noted that Taiwan should strengthen trade and cultural exchanges with Mexico, which forms the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada. The NAFTA agreement became effective January 1. Taiwan and Mexico suspended official ties in 1971, however, trade ties between the two countries have been on the rise since 1989. Two-way trade totaled U.S.$700 million in 1993, with Taiwan enjoying a surplus of U.S.$260 million. Taiwan opened an economic and cultural office in Mexico City on May 1. Tai pointed out that the premier made the private visit to Mexico at the invitation of Mario Vazquez [word indistinct], president of the Association of National Olympic Committees and former chairman of the U.S.-based UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL news agency. Vazquez, a media tycoon who controls 80 publications, radio stations, and television stations in Mexico, made a whirlwind visit to Taipei last August and met with President Li Teng-hui for two hours, he elaborated. During the meeting, he said, Vazquez invited President Li to visit Mexico. Li, however, was unable to visit that country during his state visit to Nicaragua and Costa Rica last month due to his tight schedule, he added. Asked whether Li will visit Mexico in future, Tai quoted the president as saying that he is willing to visit any country for the sake of Taiwan's interests. Tai reiterated that Mainland China should understand that Taiwan's cooperative ties with foreign countries aim to benefit both sides of the Taiwan Strait rather than disrupt the mainland's diplomatic ties with other countries. Taiwan will continue to seek an active, positive role in the international organizations, Tai stressed, adding the government is obligated to promote economic and cultural ties with foreign countries and find trade opportunities for its traders.
