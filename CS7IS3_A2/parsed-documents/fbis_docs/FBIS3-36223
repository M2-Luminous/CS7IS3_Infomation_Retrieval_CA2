He said that over the past three weeks the Finance Ministry had been trying hard to cut down spending and find new sources of income. The Central Bank's and Finance Ministry's common task is to make use of available resources and capital through economic levers. Although the Central Bank's emission mechanism helps cover expenses, it has an inflationary effect and so will therefore be used as little as possible, said Gerashchenko. Speaking about the government's pledge to repay the debt of 4 Tn rubles to the defense industry, agricultural complex, and state-run enterprises in the first quarter of 1994, Gerashchenko said that these payments must be made over a longer period. Right now the most essential payments should be made, he continued. The repayment of those debts which are not so urgent should be delayed to avoid an outburst of cash in the first quarter of 1994. Gerashchenko described Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin as someone who realistically approaches difficult problems.
