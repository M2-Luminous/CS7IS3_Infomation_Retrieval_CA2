The editorial says the historic letter of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song consummates the theoretical and practical matters for finally solving the rural question, the most difficult question in socialist construction, by dynamically accelerating rural construction along the road indicated by the rural theses. The editorial quotes the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying: "If we consolidate the position we have already taken up and launch a new battle by making more strenuous efforts, we will win a historic victory in the solution of the rural question, the most difficult question in the building of socialism." The work, it notes, is a militant banner that instills into the minds of our agricultural working people and other people the conviction of the might of the chuche-based system of the socialist rural economy and the invincibility of the Korean-style socialism and that powerfully encourages them in the work for consolidating and developing them; it is a highly important guideline in effecting a new revolutionary turn in our rural economy and in all sectors of agricultural production. The work is a famous work that has further developed and enriched the revolutionary theory of the working class on socialist and communist construction with new and unique contents, the editorial points out, and goes on: It is of weighty significance in the development of the revolutionary theory of rural construction that the great leader in this work gave a comprehensive exposition of the principle, ways and time of the conversion of cooperative property to all-people property. The theories of creating conditions for the switchover of cooperative property to all-people property, conducting it with the county as a unit, and correctly defining the forms and ways of the switchover and other theories propounded in the work light the path of finally solving the rural question without the slightest deviation. The great leader's work is a powerful weapon in refuting the sophism of the imperialists that socialism cannot find a solution to the rural question and smashing all descriptions of opportunist tendencies of removing the revolutionary principle of the working class in rural construction. The editorial calls upon all the party members and other working people to make a deep-going study of the profound idea and theories laid down in the work, fully grasp them and develop in depth the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, in compliance with the requirements of socialist rural construction on a new, higher stage.
