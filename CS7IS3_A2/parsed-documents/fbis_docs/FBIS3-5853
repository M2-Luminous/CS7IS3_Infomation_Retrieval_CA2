To find out why, the ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll in late February, asking pollees to answer freely as to why they do or do not support the Hosokawa administration. An analysis of the poll results was then made. According to the analysis, the high support rating seems to be backed by a feeling of disgust and revulsion toward the Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] long reign and an expectation for the new administration. Although the prime minister himself is very popular, a negative appraisal of LDP politics seems to be linked to a high support rating for the Hosokawa administration rather than a positive appraisal of the administration. On the other hand, complaints against the prime minister, such as his "indecisiveness," and criticism of some of the administration's specific policies, such as the "national welfare tax" and the "rice issue," were given as primary reasons for nonsupport. In the latest poll, the support rating for the Hosokawa administration was 57 percent. Among 1,231 respondents who indicated support for the administration in response to a free-to-answer-question on reasons for their support, 18 percent accounted for the majority with these respondents saying they supported the administration because "it was not an LDP administration." There were other remarks which indicated a deep-rooted distrust of the LDP. For example, some respondents said: "I do not like the LDP at all because it is corrupt and causes too many problems, so I am fed up with it," while others said: "I am tired of the long [LDP] reign." The next group of supporters, also at 18 percent, gave "expectation" for the administration as the reason for their support. Among their remarks were: "Although there are many problems at the moment, I hold expectations for the future"; "Politics will change"; "It is likely to bring about a new wave in politics"; and "Maybe Japan will change." Thus, it seems people still hold deep-rooted expectations for the new administration after over six months have elapsed since its inauguration.
