Following this, about 40 North Korean workers asked for political asylum from the Russian Government. Of these 40 North Korean loggers, four were officially granted political asylum by the Russian authorities, and many others were unofficially granted residence permission. A relevant official in Vladivostok said on 23 March: About 40 North Korean workers asked for political asylum from the Moscow authorities through human rights committees, lawyers associations in Russia, and the Russian Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs. With the help of lawyers and Korean residents in Russia, they claimed political and economic hardship, pointing out the situation of human rights being infringed upon at the logging sites, and asked for political asylum. The official revealed that "the North Korean loggers, who were granted residence permission after asking for political asylum from the Russian authorities, are four in total, including a certain Kim and a certain Yun whose permission was granted in November 1992, and two other Kims, who were granted permission early this year. He added that "many North Korean workers were granted residence permission unofficially, in addition to the number of those officially announced by the Russian authorities." Since the situation of human rights being infringed upon at the North Korean logging sites has become an international issue, the Russian Government took it as a policy to grant political asylum to the loggers if there is no specific reason for rejection. However, since so many workers asked for asylum recently, the Russian authorities are temporarily withholding granting it. On the other hand, the North Korean side claimed that those who asked for political asylum are all criminals, and strongly demanded that the Russian Government not grant them asylum. This Issue Will Be Discussed Soon. Concerning the situation in which a large number of workers who escaped from the North Korean logging sites in Russia asked for political asylum from the Russian authorities, the ROK Foreign Ministry revealed that "it is aware of such reports but failed to receive any concrete reports as to how many cases there were." The ministry added that it will discuss the issue of dealing with them with the Prime Minister's office, the National Unification Board, the Agency for National Security Planning, and other relevant organizations.
