The "latest defrosting is marked by the meeting in Harare between South Africa's Minister of Justice, Kobie Coetsee, and his Zimbabwean counterpart, Emerson Mnangagwa." An earlier meeting between President Mugabe and President F.W. de Klerk resulted in the "revival of the extradition treaty between the two states." Now Zimbabwe is urged to "heed South African pleas for the release of five prisoners" who are "suspected South African agents, who were captured and convicted for their role in destabilising Zimbabwe during the height of the armed struggle." These men "deserve the same right to amnesty as the hundreds of men and women who have been freed from prison since De Klerk's decision to seek a solution around the negotiating table rather than on the battlefield." Right Wing, Buthelezi Play Kamikaze Politics -- Allister Sparks writes in an article on the same page that the right wing and Inkatha Chief Buthelezi are engaging in "Kamikaze politics," and "self-destruction with a vengeance." "Sure the right wing can launch a campaign of sabotage and terrorism. They can make things extremely uncomfortable and do great damage to the new South Africa. But in the process they will set themselves up as the targets of vengeance and loathing for years to come. No minority group can survive that for long. If ever there was a formula for national suicide, this is it." Chief Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is also following this hardball strategy pursued by the right wing. Sparks believes the "true explanation" for this is that "his ego is such that he cannot face the prospect of fighting an election he is likely to lose, and so he wants out. From the beginning Buthelezi has wanted to secure for himself a third position equal in status to that of Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk. He now knows this is unattainable and he cannot come to terms with the idea of playing second fiddle to anyone." BUSINESS DAY Criticism of COSATU Undemocratic Support for Single Ballot -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 February in a page 10 editorial asks "someone who understands democracy" to "pay a call" on Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) headquarters. "Lessons in the workings of a democratic system, and a word or two about political tolerance, are sorely needed." The COSATU leadership "clearly does not understand" that the "single ballot it supports so fervently is undemocratic. It clearly cannot appreciate that people could oppose the single ballot on democratic grounds without aligning themselves with any party political cause. And it ignores the fact that the DP [Democratic Party] an the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] also support the double ballot -- two parties which can hardly be said to be in bed with the right wing. COSATU deeply resents anyone taking a view opposed to the ANC/COSATU `line'." SOWETAN Danger of Sidelining Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 9 February in a page 8 editorial warns there are "dangers" which can be prompted by sidelining the Freedom Alliance (FA). Although the FA "does not have the will to fight," and there are many civil servants in the homelands who "are not happy to sacrifice everything for the ambitions of their political masters," there are "elements in the FA who have the ability to terrorise the people of this country." Therefore, "it makes sense to forge a deal now before the country is plunged into civil strife. This should be done without compromising the sovereignty or integrity of the new South Africa."
