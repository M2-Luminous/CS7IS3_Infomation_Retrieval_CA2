The arsonist, surnamed Dong, who had been dismissed by the company for theft, pleaded guilty and was executed. However, more and more people are beginning to wonder: Why did the arsonist take such an extreme action of revenge? Why did so many innocent people lose their lives when the accident occurred? A person in charge of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions pointed out penetratingly: The fires in Mawei and Shenzhen have fully exposed some problems in the labor-capital relations of foreign-invested enterprises, such as the intensification of labor-capital contradictions, the indifferent attitude toward production safety, and so on. These problems are attracting extensive attention from various circles of society. Labor-capital relations are also called labor relations. They refer to the various kinds of relations between the possessors and users of labor, which involve the interests of the laborers, such as working conditions, wages and other remuneration, labor insurance, and so on. It cannot be denied that foreign-invested enterprises have provided more jobs and have established a new mode of labor relations for us. On the whole, most foreign-invested enterprises can operate according to the law, and their labor-capital relations are relatively stable. However, recent surveys show that there really are problems in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of staff members and workers in some foreign-invested enterprises. This is even more conspicuous in some medium and small-labor intensive enterprises invested by ROK, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and Japanese businessmen. The problems are manifested in: --The system of using laborers. Some foreign-invested enterprises privately and indiscriminately recruit laborers (including child laborers), dismiss them at will, do not sign contracts with staff members or workers, and replace contracts with "factory rules" of a domestic disciplinary nature, so that the employment of the staff members and workers is not guaranteed. Even if contracts are signed, the contracts are not standardized. They contain only "responsibilities" and do not contain "rights and interests," or they contain inappropriate clauses which are imposed on workers. In Shantou, Zhuhai, and Fuzhou, more than 70 percent of foreign-invested enterprises have not signed contracts with workers. The Chinese and English versions of the contract of a certain major restaurant in Shanghai are entirely different, so that the restaurant can use the contract "to deal with" the staff members and workers at any time. --Wages and other remuneration. It is only right that the income of staff members and workers of foreign-invested enterprises should be higher, but, in reality, this is not true of all such enterprises. According to a survey on 75 foreign-invested enterprises in three special economic zones in Guangdong, the number of enterprises whose minimum wages for workers are below the minimum wage standard set by local governments is 41, accounting for 55 percent of the total. The minimum wages of 17 of these enterprises are below 200 yuan, and the lowest are only 140 yuan. Some enterprises have illegally lowered, reduced, delayed the payment of, or absorbing the remuneration for the workers' labor. They, for example, have made it a rule that two days' wages should be reduced for making a mistake in punching time cards and one day's wages should be reduced for going to the toilet without a permit, and so on. A Macao contractor of the Zhuhai Huahui Toy Plant fled outside the border after embezzling and absorbing workers' wages amounting to 1.4 million yuan. In 1992 alone, foreign-invested enterprises in Shenzhen delayed the payment of workers' wages amounting to more than 3.2 million yuan. --Labor time. A considerable number of foreign-invested enterprises have asked workers to work extra shifts or extra hours. These workers universally work 10-12 hour days, and they seldom have days off. Their overtime pay is very little, usually 0.5-1.0 yuan an hour. In several foreign-invested enterprises in Guangdong, the workers have had no holidays for 11 months running, and the workers sometimes work as long as 36 hours at a stretch. Some foreign businessmen have purposely set very high quotas for the workers and have set very low payment for each piece of a product. As a result, the workers are compelled to work long hours -- some have fainted at their machine tools because they could not cope with the excessive workload. Some foreign-invested enterprises simply ignore the new work hour system which was promulgated not long ago. --Labor protection. Some foreign businessmen have increased labor intensity, shifted high-pollution and obsolete industries to the mainland, and ignored safety and sanitation. Consequently, the labor conditions are very poor, and incidents leading to injuries and deaths often occur. In a 400-worker company solely owned by a foreign businessman in Xiamen, 40 workers have had their fingers squashed in four years since the company was established, because the machines of the company have no protective devices. Many medium and small enterprises do not have ventilation devices or toxic gas discharge devices. Their working environment is dark and damp, and more and more workers have suffered from occupational diseases. Some enterprises (such as the Gaofu Company) have located their workshops, storehouses, dormitories, and canteens all in one place. Even passageways are full of goods, the gates of plants are locked, and production is carried out in sealed-off areas. In the event an accident occurs, the staff members and workers cannot escape. --Insurance and welfare. Some foreign-invested enterprises have evaded their due responsibility for the social security of staff members and workers. In some localities, the insurance coverage of foreign-invested enterprises is very limited. Some of these enterprises have refused to provide pensions, medical insurance, and accident insurance for workers and have not duly provided welfare services for workers. In particular, women workers, who account more than half of the total number of workers in foreign-invested enterprises, are seldom given reasonable maternity leave, and some have even been dismissed during their pregnancy or after giving birth to a child. A Taiwanese businessman once said with a straight face: "Do you not talk about `to each according to his work'? How can I pay her if she wants to give birth to a child and does not work?" --Personal rights. Some foreign-invested enterprises do not respect staff members or workers. Their ways of management are rough and brutal, and they even mete out corporal punishment to workers, beat them, curse them, and insult them. Some enterprises have established rules forbidding workers to drink water or to go to the toilet during work hours. They even illegally make body searches of workers. Since the legitimate rights and interests of staff members and workers have been repeatedly infringed upon, the number of labor-capital conflicts and labor disputes have increased. Is This Simply a Management Issue? The reason why these problems have emerged in the labor-capital relations in foreign-invested enterprises is that, on the one hand, the capital side of some enterprises have concentrated on seeking higher profits, have made serious mistakes in their short-term behavior, are not willing to make necessary inputs in labor conditions, have ignored the relevant laws and regulations, and have one-sidedly stressed "employment relations," thus causing various hidden troubles and undesirable effects. On the other hand, local governments have a biased understanding of the investment environment, have paid much attention to introducing foreign capital, equipment, and technology while neglecting management, and have excessively tolerated acts of infringement upon the rights and interests of staff members and workers of the Chinese side, thus making it difficult for the judicial departments to smoothly carry out their work. As a matter of fact, foreign-invested enterprises must abide by local laws and regulations no matter which countries they are located in. Only this conforms with international norms. The crux of the issue is whether our legal system concerning labor is sound. Some comrades from the Ministry of Labor have said: China has been implementing the reform and opening up policy for more than a decade and has obtained remarkable results in introducing capital, technology, and advanced management techniques. However, the building of the legal system where work is concerned has failed to meet the needs of the development of the situation. The departments concerned have formulated and promulgated a series of rules and regulations on labor management involving foreigners, but most of them only have administrative effects, not legal effects. Moreover, these rules and regulations were drafted in the 1980's, and they embody provisions which safeguard the rights and interests of the investors more than those of the staff members and workers of the Chinese side. In particular, since some great changes have been made in the labor system of state-owned enterprises, provisions on foreign-invested enterprises have evidently been inappropriate. The fact that legislation has lagged behind has led to a lax enforcement of the law. Some localities have simply used rules and regulations only as a reference, and foreign businessmen have made use of the loopholes. Besides, the strength of trade unions in foreign-invested enterprises is still quite weak. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, of the more than 80,000 foreign-invested enterprises which have been put into operation or production, about 8,000 have set up trade unions, accounting for only 10 percent of the total. Director Tian of the Grass-roots Work Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said that most of the foreign-invested enterprises where labor-capital disputes occur do not have organized trade unions. Some foreign businessmen have regarded trade unions as their opposites and have stood in the way of the establishment of trade unions. Some trade union cadres have been dismissed for defending the rights and interests of staff members and workers, and others are in an "underground" state. The workers from some foreign-invested enterprises in Shenzhen and other cities have spontaneously organized "associations of fellow townsmen" and "federations of workers." However, whenever major labor disputes occur, these non-trade union organizations often adopt radical measures which exacerbate the labor-capital relations. The sense of self-protection is also very weak among the staff members and workers of foreign-invested enterprises. Most of them come from rural areas, and their cultural quality is not high. They are eager to make money and do not know how to defend their own interests and dignity. A female worker was slapped twice by her boss for no reason at all. The next day, the boss gave her 50 yuan wrapped in red paper and the other female workers watched with admiration. Several workers in Shekou were compelled to work overtime in midsummer. They fell ill and were dismissed at once, and each was given only 100 yuan for working in the heat of summer. These workers shed grateful tears. We cannot but feel "pity for their misfortune, and angry at their lack of protest." What Should We Do? In the course of making this report, we deeply feel that harmonious and stable labor-capital relations are important conditions for ensuring social stability and the healthy development of investment made by foreign businessmen. Of course, foreign businessmen should be allowed to make money, and the legitimate rights and interests of laborers should also be sufficiently guaranteed. We should not make use of foreign capital at the expense of the rights and interests of staff members and workers. It has been learned that numerous foreign investors not only have paid much attention to the rich labor resources in China, but have also have paid greater attention to labor management in foreign-invested enterprises and hope that labor management can be put in the orbit of the legal system as quickly as possible. It appears that strengthening labor management according to the law in foreign-invested enterprises will not drive away the "foreign gods of wealth" (only those who are eager for quick success and instant benefit will be driven away), whereas unprincipled accommodation will inevitably harm the interests of the state and the rights and interests of the staff members and workers and will eventually affect the improvement of the investment environment. According to comrades from the Ministry of Labor and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the pressing task at present is to speed up labor legislation. In view of the characteristics of foreign-invested enterprises, it is advisable to formulate the "Law on the Labor Management of Enterprises With Investment Made by Foreign Businessmen" as quickly as possible. Otherwise, work in this respect will be in a dilemma in which there is no law to go by and no rule or regulation to follow. There should be a clear and unified definition for minimum wages, a labor contract, labor protection, social security, basic rights and interests of workers, and so on, and there should be a sound monitoring mechanism. We should strengthen the functions of trade unions and urge foreign-invested enterprises to set up trade unions so that trade unions can truly become bridges between the labor side and the capital side. Besides, we can also use as reference the experience of the Beijing Jeep Company Limited and institute the system of holding collective talks (reaching agreements) so that labor-capital relations can be normalized and standardized. Local governments should also combine the work of attracting foreign capital with labor management and in examining and approving contracts or projects. They should include in these contracts or projects sections on the legitimate rights and interests of staff members and workers of the Chinese side. Since the number of foreign-invested enterprises is increasing in various localities and their scales are expanding, they should also further ensure that safety and sanitation monitoring work is carried out in order to avoid the recurrence of tragedies like the fire in Mawei. They should spread publicity and education on the legal system, enable foreign businessmen to understand the relevant Chinese policies and laws on labor, help staff members and workers strengthen the sense of self-protection, draw lessons from the crimes of the woman worker surnamed Dong of the Gaofu Company, and establish a sense of the legal system. Some people predict that, with the gradual deepening of reform, the gap between the income of workers of state-owned enterprises and that of workers of foreign-invested enterprises will narrow day by day. This will play the role of checking and balancing labor management throughout society.
