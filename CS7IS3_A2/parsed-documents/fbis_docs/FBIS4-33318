The Sandinist Assembly, recently elected during the party's congress, met yesterday for the first time and proceeded to discuss the results of the elections, to select members of the Ethics and Judicial Commission, to elect a permanent Electoral Commission, to appoint three secretaries to the National Directorate, and to establish five work commissions. Likewise, the assembly discussed issues such as a public debate on the results of the Sandinist congress and the thorny controversy of the media's support to Sandinism, especially the case of BARRICADA. The new members of the Judicial and Ethics Commission include Miguel Angel Casco, Orlando Tardencilla, Onofre Guevara, Jose Pasos, Gladis Gomez, Yadira Centeno, Jorge Samper, Bruno Gallardo, Gloria Hernandez, Erwin Izaba. The Electoral Commission includes Julian Corrales (president), Jeannete Chavez, Zadrach Zeledon, Ruth Herrera, and Jose Luis Villavicencio as principal members, and Edwin Castro as well as Josefina Ramos as alternates. As has already been reported by BARRICADA, Monica Baltodano, Lumberto Campbell, and Victor Hugo Tinoco were elected secretaries of organization and education, communications, and international relations respectively. Likewise, the Sandinist Assembly approved the creation of other commissions such as an agriculture commission, a youth commission, a women's commission, an Atlantic coast commission, and an economic-social commission. Upon concluding the event, FSLN Deputy Secretary General Tomas Borge said that with respect to the media issue, it had been decided to "assess the situation" within the National Directorate, and to present a proposal afterwards before the Sandinist Assembly. With respect to the debate to take place after the congress, it was confirmed the debate would be "free, open, and within the framework of the organizations members of the FSLN." The absence of National Directorate member Henry Ruiz was quite obvious. Ruiz has abstained from participating in any of the meetings of the newly elected national directorate. Calls for Penalties and More Media Control The issue of the public debate over the congress results, and the role of the media was included as part of the agenda under "other issues." Discussions began when Modesto Mungia, an assembly member and Managua District Three leader, stated that the media could be useful as instruments to continue "examining" the problem of divisions within the FSLN. On the other hand, Felix Contreras pointed out that not only is the legitimacy of the congress under attack, but that "groups are organized to further split the FSLN." As an example, he pointed to a recent call to all Sandinists professionals to participate in an assembly scheduled to take place next Tuesday at the UCA [Central American University]. William Grisgbi urged the National Directorate to "state its position on the scope of action of journalists, and responsibilities as assemblymen." Grisbi was referring to the controversy involving BARRICADA Director Carlos Fernando Chamorro and Danilo Aguirre, EL NUEVO DIARIO deputy director. Nelson Artola, a San Ramon municipal leader asked "Who owns BARRICADA?" and immediately urged the FSLN to appropriate the media. "We must penalize those comrades who are manipulating the results of the Congress, and we should do it with a steady hand and voice," Elias Chavez suggested. In the meantime, National Directorate member Luis Carrion pointed out that "Neither the Assembly or the National Directorate should become media directors." In his opinion, overseeing mechanisms such as a directors council similar to the one operating at BARRICADA must be encouraged. Nevertheless, Carlos Fonseca Teran insisted that "the problem lies in the clear intent to tarnish the congress' results." In this respect, the harshest criticisms were directed at Sandinist Assembly member Danilo Aguirre, who is also EL NUEVO DIARIO deputy director. Monica Baltodano, also a National Directorate member, urged all to "grab the bull by its horns," and that all those whom -- it would seem -- are attempting to "give a free rein to their ideas" should be called in and urged to speak clearly. The controversy seemed to lose steam when BARRICADA Editor Carlos Fernando Chamorro addressed the assembly and indicated that this newspaper had been one of the few to cover the debates prior to, as well as following the congress. He also contended that the debate had been treated as taboo by the other media associated with Sandinism. "Let's put the subject of the other media that did not cover the debate on the carpet," Chamorro pointed out. Nevertheless, former BARRICADA sports director Emmett Lang restarted the controversy when he asked "what was the problem with suggesting Carlos Fernando's departure if he has already occupied the position for the past 14 years." Lang immediately added that "I am aware that because of this suggestion I will be attacked in tomorrow's edition of BARRICADA."
