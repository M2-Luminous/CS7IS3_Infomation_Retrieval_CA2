In a statement to TANJUG Bogdanovic warned that Brcko was a "fabricated Gorazde" aimed at cutting off the corridor between the Serb lands and linking the newly-formed Moslem-Croat Federation with Croatia in the north. In the last few days the Moslem Army has been concentrating its forces in the Brcko area to attack the town and cut off the corridor which links the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic. This was openly admitted Monday by the commander of the Moslem Army Rasim Delic who said that Brcko was the "key to the Bosnian war". Despite this statement many Western media, who had formerly showered the world with untruths about the destruction of the Moslem enclave of Gorazde (eastern Bosnia) and the number of civilians killed there, are now fabricating similar untruths about the Serbs massing forces to attack Brcko, as if the town was not in their control. At the same time, it is insisted, particularily in U.S. Adminsitration circles, that NATO should carry out air strikes on the Serbs if they go into action. After all the mistakes the international community has admitted to having made and after so many victims and destruction, the world should realize that the war which has been stirred up in the former Yugoslavia and in the Balkans is in nobody's interest, Bogdanovic averted. Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday in his talks with Special U.N. Envoy Yasushi Akashi that the Serb side was offering a ceasefire in the Brcko region and that it would be implemented unilaterally even if it is not accepted by the Moslems. Karadzic also agreed to the deployment of U.N. observers on the Serb and Moslem sides in the area to prevent an escalation of the crisis.
