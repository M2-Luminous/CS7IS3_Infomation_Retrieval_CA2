Wu Yi said: The reform of our foreign trade system is an important component of our economic restructuring and has been implemented at a rapid pace for quite a long time. Following bold reforms at three stages over the past 15 years, we started a new round of reform this year, with the unification of exchange rates at the core. The core of this round of reform is that the state is to implement a unified foreign exchange settlement and selling system in foreign trade export enterprises, set up a unitary and managed renminbi floating exchange rate system on the basis of market demand and supply, and abolish foreign trade enterprises' task of turning over foreign exchange to the higher authorities with or without compensation. Viewed from the experience and practice of foreign trade development and reform over the past years, we really grasp the key when introducing the new round of foreign trade reform measures, particularly the reform of the exchange rate system under the current situation. Compared with the past reform measures, these measures have made a major breakthrough in such respects as unifying policy, lifting restrictions on operation, bearing responsibility for profits and losses, and promoting fair competition, all of which will effectively solve some of the deep-seated problems that have been disrupting our foreign trade development for a long time, thus helping our foreign trade system run in accordance with standard international practice, helping foreign trade enterprises take part in the international division of labor and exchange in a broader and more profound way, developing an open economy, and linking and supplementing our domestic economy with the international economy. Wu Yi said: In the future, our foreign trade and economic cooperation must develop according to a new "large-scale economic and trade" pattern, that is, linking foreign trade and economic cooperation with foreign investment; merging barter trade, technology trade, and service trade into a single whole; integrating commodities, capital, technology, and labor; and combining industry, agriculture, technology, and commerce with one another in trade. In the third volume of his selected works, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that our total foreign trade volume would reach $200 billion by the end of this century, and we must fulfill that task this year, which is six years earlier. Not long ago, Premier Li Peng proposed that by the year of 2000, our total foreign trade volume must reach $400 billion, which would double this year's figure. This is quite an arduous task. With the end of the Cold War, the competition of comprehensive national strength will occupy a leading position. In the 1990's, worldwide economic competition will become more intense, and a "commercial war" awaits us which has a strong smell of gunpowder, but no smoke,. Faced with this historical opportunity, the success of the reform of our foreign trade system relates not only to whether or not a new foreign trade system can be established, but also to whether or not a socialist market economy system can be established at an early date and can run normally. At present, first, we must handle well the relationship between the reform of our foreign trade system and the task of expanding exports to earn more foreign exchange. Second, we must handle well the relationship between reform and maintaining the order of foreign trade operation, Third, we must handle well the relationship between the reform of our foreign trade system and other reforms. Fourth, we must handle well the problem of converging the old and the new systems in the process of transformation. In short, in deepening the reform of our foreign trade system, we should set the task of boosting exports as the most important one, and should try every possible means to advance it to a new level so as to promote the full development of foreign trade and to make new progress.
