Most South Africans are surely puzzled as to why this should be the case. We certainly are, given that the matter is by no means as cut and dried as it is made out to be. In the first instance, we should cast our minds back to how it was that this date was agreed to in the first place. What happened was that all the parties at the World Trade Centre, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] included, agreed to a resolution which stated that the election date should be set ONCE there had been sufficient progress in negotiations. However, the ink was barely dry on this when Messrs Ramaphosa and Meyer started agitating to have the date set -- DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE AGREED-TO PRECONDITIONS HAD NOT BEEN SATISFIED. In other words, there had not been sufficient progress in negotiations. Indeed, the joint stonewalling by the Government and ANC -- in refusing to even consider the IFP's proposals on the form of state, on the negotiations process and on violence -- resulted in an impasse which was "resolved" by way of the mechanism of "sufficient consensus." The date was set, and on 2 July the IFP walked out of Kempton Park in protest. In other words, 27 Apri? was not a democratically determined (ie, all-inclusive) election date. Not only were the preconditions agreed to beforehand totally ignored, but those parties which objected to this procedural abuse were simply overruled. To these parties, 27 April never therefore assumed the false status to which it was subsequently elevated. 27 April was merely another symptom of the characteristic World Trade Centre craziness which urged that dates be set BEFORE substantive agreements were properly reached, instead of AFTERWARDS. The fact is that those parties which created the 27 April problem and who now believe the date cannot be changed, are living in cloud-cuckoo land. Reality #1 is that the prime objective before all parties should be to create an all-inclusive constitutional settlement without which the elections and subsequent "democracy" may well be severely threatened. Surely it is self-evident that the prime issue is reaching an agreement, and that the implementation of this must come next? To put the cart before the horse is both stupid and dangerous. Reality #2 is that certain parties have already been conducting their election campaign for many months. They have had road shows, have conducted massive advertising campaigns, and have done all that parties do by way of presenting themselves to the electorate in order to win votes. Other parties, however, have not even started yet. This may suit the Government and ANC which now have a huge head start, but since everyone agreed early on in the negotiations process to a levelling of the playing field in order to allow parties to participate in fair and free elections, it stands to reason that this agreement be adhered to. The big question, of course, is whether this is possible. Not in terms of political will, but constitutionally. Reality #3 is the simple fact that there is absolutely no valid reason why the date cannot be changed. The term of office of the present government expires in September this year, at which stage an election must be called. In other words, there is no legal or constitutional impediment to elections being held in May, June, July, August or September. It changes absolutely nothing other than the date itself. We all know the ANC and Government are reluctant to change the date, but equally, we all know it can be changed should there be a need to do so. The question is -- are the Government and ANC more concerned with behaving as they have done to date, in forcing through their deal regardless of the consequences, or are they prepared to be reasonable? Nothing stops the date being changed other than obstinacy, a stubborn refusal to be fair and a desperate attempt to gain power at all costs. It is surely time for a rethink -- if they're the democrats they profess to be, there should be no problem in being reasonable. After all, we've waited more than three hundred years for this momentous occasion -- does a month or two really make that much of a difference?
