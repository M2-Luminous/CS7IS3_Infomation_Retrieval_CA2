FR940617-0-00036 FR940617-0-00005 Section 2. Acceptable Equipment. Unless otherwise specified by the Owner (and agreed to in advance in writing by REA), the Bidder agrees to furnish under this Proposal only equipment which is currently covered by a letter of acceptance issued by the Chairman, Committee ``A'' (Telephone). [Note: for convenience of borrowers and others, domestically manufactured products are included in REA Bulletin 17551&hyph;100.] The Bidder agrees also to furnish only materials, equipment and software which are new and of most recent issue and manufacture, as of the date of the bid opening, or of near future release for which the Bidder can assure timely delivery. Section 3. Changes in Project. The Owner, with the approval of the Administrator, may from time to time during the performance of the Contract effected by the acceptance of this Proposal, make reasonable changes, additions to or subtractions from the Specifications which are part of the Proposal as conditions may warrant. However, if substantial changes in the Project shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be granted if the Bidder shall make a written request therefor to the Owner within thirty (30) days after any such change is made. Further, if the cost to the Bidder shall be increased or decreased by any such change or addition, the Contract price shall be increased or decreased by a reasonable amount in accordance with a contract amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder and approved by the Administrator. No claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Bidder shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition. The Delivery or Completion of Installation times specified under Columns 5, ``Delivery'', and 6, ``Completion of Installation,'' in Article I, section 1, can only be changed by a Contract amendment approved by the Bidder, the Owner and REA. Section 4. Taxes. The bid prices herein set forth do not include any amounts payable by the Bidder or the Owner on account of taxes imposed by any taxing authority upon the sale, purchase or use of materials, supplies, equipment or software to be incorporated in the Project(s). If any such tax is applicable to the sale, purchase or use of materials, supplies, equipment or software hereunder, the amount thereof shall be stated separately on all invoices and paid by the Owner. Article II Delivery and Installation Section 1. Time of Completion of Installation. The time of delivery of materials, equipment, and software and of Completion of Installation are of the essence of this Contract. The Bidder shall deliver the materials, equipment, and software required hereunder for each Project upon the time intervals established under Column 5, ``Delivery,'' in Article I, section 1, after the Administrator shall have approved this Contract in writing, and shall prosecute diligently and complete the installation of materials, equipment and software for each Project in accordance with the terms of this Contract and Specifications to the satisfaction of the Owner and the Administrator within the number of calendar days specified under Column 6, ``Completion of Installation,'' in Article I, section 1. The times for such Delivery or such Completion of Installation shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires, strikes, floods, changes in the Specifications as herein provided, and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible. However, no such extension of time shall be granted the Bidder unless within thirty (30) days after Bidder becomes aware of the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension of time the Bidder shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner. Further, no delay in such time for delivery of materials, equipment and software or Completion of Installation or in the progress of the work shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner, except that the Owner shall be responsible for and shall pay the Bidder on demand all additional, supportable costs and expenses incurred by the Bidder due to delays to the extent such delays are caused by the Owner's failure to perform its obligations under this Contract unless the Owner's failure to perform is caused by forces beyond its control.
