Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that strengthening the unity between the Army and the government and between the Army and the people is essential to the success in reforms and economic growth, and to China's political and social stability as well. Both the Army and the people should make concerted efforts to promote ideological and cultural progress, he said. Committees of the Chinese Communist Party and governments at all levels must pay close attention to agriculture and rural work, particularly grain and cotton production, he said in a group discussion about the government work report with deputies from Hebei Province to the National People's Congress. Liu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee, described agriculture as an issue closely related to China's long-term stability. "At present, we must arouse farmers' initiative for production and help them achieve relatively comfortable living standards," he said. To this end, it is imperative to relieve farmers' financial burdens and enable them to gain tangible benefits, he added. The leader said that many major state-owned enterprises are military factories, adding that the government is formulating new measures to help these factories manufacture civilian goods and solve their problems in operation. Liu Huaqing also asked local governments to educate the local people in patriotism and collectivism in the course of speeding up reforms and opening wider to the rest of the world.
