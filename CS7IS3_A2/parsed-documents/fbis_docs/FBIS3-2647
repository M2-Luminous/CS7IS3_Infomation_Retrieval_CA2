It can benefit both sides if China and the United States, two big countries, can strengthen cooperation in various domains, whereas mutual hostility and a drain on strength is not good for either side. China does not constitute any threat to the United States. China and the United States and the peoples in the two countries have traditional friendship, and even during the Cold War period, they could be friends. Why cannot they get along well after the Cold War? If the United States cancels China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status because of the human rights issue, it will strip away the good feeling toward the United States among the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army [PLA], China's policy toward the United States might become conservative and hard-line, and China might even adopt an uncooperative attitude toward some important international issues which concern the United States. A hard-line, conservative, and uncooperative China is obviously not in the strategic interest of the United States. Strengthen Contact for Mutual Understanding What is worth mentioning is that although China and the United States have gone round and round in the strange circle of human rights for several years, the armed forces of the two countries have already made a gratifying step in contact. In September last year, the United States adopted a new "contact strategy" toward China. Under the guidance of this strategy, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Freeman visited China at the end of last year, resuming high-level military contacts and interaction with China. Recently, the president of U.S. National Defense University has also visited China. Military contacts and exchanges between China and the United States can help foster mutual understanding between the two armed forces, and help the two countries to strengthen bilateral military cooperation. According to the press, the Clinton administration has reached some consensus on relations with China. The consensus includes: China is a country to be reckoned with in the world; and the Chinese military has a recognizable role to play in China's foreign policy formulation, and only through contacts can the United States influence the PLA, continue to urge China to develop in the positive direction, and continue to make China, which will be economically and militarily strong in the future, a friend of the United States. U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Freeman said recently that although this kind of "contact strategy" cannot solve the issue of human rights and trade between China and the United States, it can ease the tense situation which might arise between the two countries regarding security issues. Secretary of State Christopher said recently that if China makes positive efforts in the areas of abiding by the International Human Rights Declaration, releasing political prisoners, stopping interference in the Chinese-language broadcast of Voice of America, then, the United States will consider discussing extension of China's MFN status every several years. Officials in the U.S. Department of Commerce and Treasury Department advocated a permanent settlement of the MFN status for China. However, the United States should understand and sympathize with China's concrete conditions, and should not just exert great pressure. So long as China and the United States can understand each other and make mutual concessions, bilateral relations will be smooth, and if both sides can step back half a step on the issues which cause controversy, relations between the two countries will have broad room for development. Bill of the Cold War Era Should Be Scrapped Judged from the current situation, the practice that the United States extends China's MFN status every year is one which costs the U.S. Government and people money; it affects confidence and long-term planning among American businessmen and industrialists who want to invest in China, and lets some congressmen and human rights organizations pull the U.S. Government by the nose in the area of relations with China, thus, putting the government to a very passive position. Even if the MFN status is extended every several years, by then the White House might be troubled by various interest groups when the decision has to be made. Therefore, the best method should be neatly settling the issue of China's MFN status once and for all. To extend China's MFN trade status once and for all, the United States should abolish the Jackson-Vanik amendment. This bill of the Cold War era was formulated for the Soviet Union which had no freedom of migration and had non-market economy system, and it is now outdated. China has always allowed freedom of migration, and China has announced it would walk toward market economy. Even the countries which have been blacklisted as terrorist countries by the United States, such as Syria, Libya, and Iraqi can easily enjoy MFN status, so why cannot China, which is opening up and is converging to the track of world economy, enjoy MFN status which is being enjoyed unconditionally by almost every country? Should Grant China Permanent MFN Status Dr. Michael Svens, a researcher specializing in East Asian problems with Rand Corporation, pointed out in a recent speech in Washington that, he believed the Clinton administration will continue to extend China's MFN status this year. He said that if the United States cancels China's MFN status, conservative forces inside China will emerge. Many experts in American academic circles have the same viewpoint. They advocated that human rights and trade issues should be handled separately. If Sino-U.S. relations are built on the narrow basis of human rights, once a problem arises in the area of human rights, the whole Sino-U.S. relationship will be in danger. Looking at problems from a macro-viewpoint, the United States must not cancel China's MFN status in the future, even more, it must also permanently extend China's MFN status. Only by so doing can China and the United States walk toward a bright and splendid 21st century hand in hand. Both the Chinese and U.S. Governments have now this hope and wish. Christopher's visit to China is very important in terms of whether the United States can do this. (10 March, Washington)
