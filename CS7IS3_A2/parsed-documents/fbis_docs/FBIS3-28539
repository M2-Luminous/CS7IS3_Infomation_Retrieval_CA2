Han leaves on Wednesday instead of Sunday, bound for the U.S. capital first instead of Canada for critical consultations with U.S. leaders before heading to Canada and Mexico. Part of the trip's purpose is to strengthen economic relations with all three parties of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to tap South Korea's market entry possibilities. At the same time, the trip precedes the Feb. 21 "deadline" when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors meets to discuss North Korea's non-compliance with nuclear inspections. Ministry officials said Han will raise the issue of the current tone of U.S. press reports accenting inter-Korean tension and the possibility of a clash. He plans to request prudence on Washington's part so that reports are not premature on policies yet to be adopted or issues under sensitive negotiation. The American press has been playing up what it sees as growing calls for punitive action against North Korea for refusing nuclear inspections, such as U.N. economic sanctions. Seoul remains concerned that any rash action against the closed Stalinist state might provoke a violent clash between the two Koreas, which have already experienced the fratricidal war of 1950-53. The foreign minister will be in Washington from Feb. 9-13 and plans to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and new Defense Secretary William Perry, among others. The foreign minister is expected to stop over at the United Nations to discuss sanctions against North Korea with Secretary- general Butrus Butrus-Ghali. While in Canada Feb. 13-16, Han will meet with Prime Minister Jean Chretien. In Mexico, he is to meet President Carlos Salinas and hold foreign ministers' talks with Manuel Tello Macias during his Feb. 16-19 stay.
