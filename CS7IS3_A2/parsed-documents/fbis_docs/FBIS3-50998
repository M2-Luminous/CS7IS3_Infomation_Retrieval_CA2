An explosive device went off during the predawn hours at the PRD offices in Juan Diaz. As this video shows [video shows policemen gathering evidence from explosion site, iron door open, PRD office glass door], the device was apparently placed outside the building, and the blast only reached the front light of the building and smeared the walls and side wall with a gray substance. Specialized units of the Explosive Department of the National Police appeared at the explosion site. They gathered the first evidence to determine what kind of explosives was used, although it is presumed it may have been industrial-type explosives. PRD members blamed progovernment parties for the attack and termed the blast as a threat. [Begin recording] [Ricardo Vega, member of the PRD Political Commission] Evidently it seems that this is a clear expression of threats affecting an electoral process, which we hope would be clean. This is the first attack perpetrated against a PRD office, and we believe this is the beginning of an escalation of attacks that will occur amid the electoral atmosphere. [Baltazar Aizpurua, PRD prosecutor] We know and are sure this is the result of the goverment's desperation over the victory the PRD will obtain on 8 May. [end recording] This is the first attack against a political party--less than four months away from the elections. The Electoral Tribunal described the attack as reprehensible. [Begin Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado recording] We have not confirmed the point yet; that is the fundamental point I want to make. Second, I want to state strongly that it is reprehensible, from every point of view, that Panamanians have not learned yet to settle our differences civilly, like brothers and members of a single national family. No matter from where the attack comes, it is inconvenient and unfair to use our hands to hit each other instead of using them to progress.
