Cash, which is needed for service trips, is not included in the above current needs and is supplied by banks in accordance with the established order; -- should store cash at their counters within the established limits. Procedures for cash limits and control over their observance are determined by the National Bank of Ukraine; -- are entitled to keep at their cash counters sums in cash, which exceed the established limits, only for payments of wages, social welfare bonuses, stipends, pensions, and only for periods, not greater than three work-days, including the day of cash supply by banks.

Limits for cash balance for juridical persons should be set by commercial banks servicing them based on settling data submitted by them. In case of such settling data lacking, the said limits are set by commercial banks on their own. Commercial banks effect cash supply only on presenting to them relevant substantiation, and exercise control over cash application, as has been specified. 3. Juridical and natural persons, who are engaged in procurement of agricultural products, wild fruits and berries, herbs, waste paper and fabrics, glass containers and scrap from the population, as well as juridical persons, who carry out mortgage operations, are entitled to get cash to the full extent of their settling with the population.

Control over advance sum spending (payments for fuels) is exercised by the commercial banks. Sums, which are due to citizens for products, which they sell, may be remitted to their savings accounts only of their own free will. 4. Banks should provide to juridical persons, who are engaged in insurance activities, means to pay insurance sums (insurance compensations) against insurance agreements of voluntary and compulsory insurance, on a non-cash basis, except: -- sums, payable to citizens in cash upon expiration of their insurance agreements or the agreements' preterm termination; -- compensations payable to citizens in the form of insurance sums and insurance indemnities. 5.
