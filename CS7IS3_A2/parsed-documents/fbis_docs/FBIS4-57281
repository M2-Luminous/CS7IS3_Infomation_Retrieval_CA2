In a little over 24 hours the Assembly approved in the second and third debates the Parlacen constitutive treaty, which was signed by the Central American presidents on 2 October 1987. According to the treaty, Panama will have a representation of 20 deputies in Parlacen, each of whom will be elected for a five-year term by direct vote. They will also be allowed to run for second terms. The treaty establishes that presidents and vice presidents of Central American countries will join Parlacen when they complete their mandates. It is estimated that Panama will have to contribute $1.7 million to enter the regional organization. Parlacen will pay the deputies' salaries. Parlacen will serve as a deliberative body to analyze political, economic, social, and cultural matters common to the region and the security of Central American nations. Assembly President Arturo Vallarino said the current trend toward the establishment of world blocs makes it necessary for Panama to join a regional forum where its problems will be discussed.
