He said he had no knowledge about the charge, and that it may only be a remark made to a news agency. Regarding Cambodia seeking arms aid from other countries to improve the capability of its armed forces, Thailand must consider this issue very carefully. The defense minister said the worst thing United Nations member countries could do is to provide any Cambodian side with support that could worsen the conflict and fighting among the factions. Also, providing arms to the Cambodian Government is against the Paris peace accord that was signed, and which was jointly sponsored by France, the United States, and Indonesia. The agreement aimed to reduce the use of arms that had prolonged the fighting and delayed the establishment of peace. The Thai Government wants to see national reconciliation work in Cambodia. Therefore, the Cambodian people should settle their conflict peacefully. The fighting in Cambodia has adversely affected the Thai people living in the areas bordering Cambodia for more than 13 or 14 years. Their property have been robbed and they have to live with the insecurity, concluded the Thai defense minister.
