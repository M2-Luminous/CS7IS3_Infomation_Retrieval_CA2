Fielding questions from reporters, the premier said that whether the meeting with Kono takes place is entirely up to the LDP. "If the LDP wants to hold the summit, I am ready to respond immediately," said Hosokawa, in an upbeat mood following the passage of the package through a House of Councillors committee earlier in the day. The vote was 18 for and 16 against. The package is designed to redesign the mechanism for electing members of the House of Representatives of the two-chamber diet, while changing the political fund-raising system by channeling donations to politicians through their parties' coffers. Kono, meanwhile, ruled out holding a meeting with Hosokawa on possible modifications of the package. He told reporters at the LDP headquarters, "at present, there remains no room for us to advance suggestions" to the coalition side. On Wednesday, negotiators from the coalition and LDP failed to narrow a gap over the LDP's three demands, including the one calling for raising from 274 to 280 the number of lower house seats to be contested as single-seat constituencies in a 500-seat chamber.
