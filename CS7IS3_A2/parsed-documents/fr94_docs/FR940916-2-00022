FR940916-2-00022 FR940916-2-00020 Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center; Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. ACTION: Determination of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Grant Award with Radian Corporation. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center (PETC), announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (D), it intends to make a grant award to Radian Corporation for a one-year effort entitled ``Electric Utility Engineer's FGD Manual.'' ADDRESSES: U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Division, P.O. Box 10940, MS 921&hyph;143, Pittsburgh, PA 15236&hyph;0940. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John N. Augustine, Contract Specialist, 412/892&hyph;4524. Comments or inquiries should be made within fourteen (14) days of the date of this announcement. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Grant Agreement Number: DE&hyph;FG22&hyph;94PC94256. Title of Research Effort: ``Electric Utility Engineer's FGD Manual.'' Awardee: Radian Corporation. Term of Assistance Effort: Twelve (12) months. Cost of Assistance Effort: The total estimated value is $370,000. Objective This grant agreement provides financial assistance in the development of an ``Electric Utility Engineer's FGD Manual.'' This manual will provide engineers with up-to-date technical information on calcium-based FGD systems. The manual will be most helpful to engineers who are new to the field of flue gas desulfurization, but will also be useful as a reference guide for more experienced engineers. The manual will be a comprehensive survey of the calcium-based FGD technologies available and will aid utilities in their purchase, operation and optimization of FGD equipment. The information contained in this manual will be useful to the utility engineer involved in installation of an FGD system at either a new or existing generating unit. The information presented in the manual will allow the utility engineer to design and select an FGD system that will achieve the required SO 2 removal efficiency; operate reliably; provide a high level of operation flexibility to change conditions; benefit from the most recent operation experience of existing systems; and have the lowest practical capital and annual costs. Criteria to Justify Noncompetitive Financial Assistance The award of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance is justified pursuant to applicable criteria under 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), criterion (D). The applicant has exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully, based upon unique technical expertise gained during design, specification, purchase and operation of flue gas desulfurization systems for 25 years. Radian Corporation has been involved in more than 150 FGD-related projects at 70 different power plant sites. Radian Corporation has been involved in the production of technical guidelines and manuals covering a variety of FGD-related topics. Richard D. Rogus, Chief, Contracts Group I.
