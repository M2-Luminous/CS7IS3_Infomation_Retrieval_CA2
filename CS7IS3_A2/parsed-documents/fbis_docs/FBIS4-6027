Security Council president, nor would it dare any military provocations in the face of joint South Korean- U.S. security arrangements. Addressing the opening session of the 43rd annual conference of the Pacific-Asia Travel Association [PATA] at the Korea exhibition center, Kim predicted South Korea would join the family of developed nations "as a new member before the 20th century is out," stressing the country's march "into a better tomorrow will never falter." "The Korean people are full of confidence and energy despite North Korea's nuclear arms development and its capacity for all other kinds of irrational behavior," he added. Welcoming delegates from 40 countries, Kim noted the Asia-Pacific is taking center stage: "Nations in this region are now pulling together to forge an era of concord and cooperation, putting to rest their past enmity and confrontation. In response, the Republic of Korea has also been striving to promote the shared prosperity of this part of the world, working especially through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. "The Republic of Korea has realized almost miraculous development and has overcome numerous adversities stemming in particular from the tragic partitioning of its land. In a single generation, it has managed to turn itself into an Asian model of democracy and a market economy. Especially since I took office, our country has wiped out the vestiges of our dark past while... promoting internationalization... and creating a society free of misconduct and corruption, a healthy society in which freedom and justice flourish. Our economy is regaining vitality, and a new dynamism is pervading all sectors of society." Kim, saying tourism is helping to narrow the economic gap between developed and developing nations by promoting cooperation, expressed hope that the Seoul PATA conference would provide "a major impetus to international cooperation to underpin this new era of openness, as well as open up new horizons for the travel industry in the 21st century."
