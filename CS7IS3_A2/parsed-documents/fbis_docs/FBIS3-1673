People have been most concerned with issues of tariff reduction in agricultural products. Even though they failed to respond completely to the U.S.-proposed list of 387 agricultural products earmarked for tariff reduction, the ROC has agreed to reduce tariffs on 277 items. The tariff reduction rates will be more than 20 percent. It has been learned that, under strong U.S. pressure, tariff reductions on imported apples will be the largest. Tariff reductions on certain sensitive agricultural products, including fresh pears, peaches, plums, and processed fruit juices, will be relatively low and will be reduced gradually over six years in order to lessen their adverse impact. The Council of Agriculture indicated: To counterbalance future massive tariff reductions on agricultural products -- especially imported fruits including apples, whose imported quantity is large -- and fresh fruits that are produced by major exporting countries at low production costs, the ROC will shift from the existing practice of levying tariffs on fresh fruits in accordance with their price levels to a new practice of levying tariffs in accordance with their imported quantities, or levying mixed tariffs by integrating the existing and new practices. The ROC has formally notified the U.S. delegation that we are shifting from the existing practice to a new practice of levying tariffs on fresh fruits.
