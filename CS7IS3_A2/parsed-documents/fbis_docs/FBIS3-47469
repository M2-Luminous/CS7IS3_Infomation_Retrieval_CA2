"There should not be unilateral measures under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade," the official said. He criticized Kantor for making "inappropriate" comments in the middle of Japan-U.S. trade framework negotiations. Kantor told Japanese reporters in Washington on Wednesday that revival of the clause is "an option" for the United States.
