He said the conflict that provoked the mobilization of hundreds of metalworkers will be resolved before 30 May. Estabillo said: "We do not have 1,700 people thrown into the streets as some newspapers said." The governor recognized, however, that "there is a problem, but it is limited to two or three companies." He said: "Workers and managers are discussing the situation. The government is mediating, doing its best to find a solution." The governor added that the metalworkers "did not respect the order of compulsory conciliation decreed by the Labor Ministry," after the Ushuaia Branch of the UOM [Metalworkers Union] decided to stage an indefinite strike. [passage omitted] Estabillo recognized: "The climate in the province is tense" because the factory sector is very important -- it employs nearly 5,500 people, adding that "other supporters gradually joined the demonstration." Regarding the case of workers who took over a factory, Estabillo said: "This incident involved the Crown company following the dismissal of 15 workers." The governor urged workers to respect a court ruling. Estabillo said that despite the important increase in production of color television sets -- from 300,000 sets in 1990 to 1,600,000 last year -- there is a crisis in the industry due to "commercial factors and the increased demand during the run up to the world soccer competition, which is not up to entrepreneurs' expectations." Estabillo said: "Entrepreneurs have complained about the policy permitting the unrestricted import of electronic products, which is producing strong competition for national industries in Tierra del Fuego." The governor added: "Industrial retooling takes time and effort," stressing "the political willingness of the economy minister to change the tax burden on Tierra del Fuego entrepreneurs." The governor denied asking the Border Police to intervene, assuring that "the situation is being controlled by the provincial police."
