Strengthening ideological work, nurturing and raising a new generation, fighting for the realization of the socialist modernization projects, these are arduous, but also glorious and important tasks to be accomplished at the propaganda and ideology front. Since last year, we have seen some exemplary personalities emerge in Henan Province, such as Zhang Huanli [1728 3883 4409], Xu Honggang [1776 3163 0474], and Yao Cihui [1202 2945 2585]. Their shining achievements of unselfishness, their energetic pursuit of progress, and their ideological brilliance in arduously pioneering new undertakings reflect the main theme in the spirit of our time. In their unselfish contributions toward the prosperity of the country, in their efforts to restore and support an atmosphere of morality, in risking their lives for the just cause, they are the backbone of our nation and models for human conduct. All the people of China's central plain are proud of them. Emergency of such personalities is inseparably linked to their being nurtured by the party and nourished by the people. Essentially, this is indeed the strategy of "grasping with both hands [simultaneous pursuit of two tactics]" that has been unswervingly implemented by the party committees at all levels throughout Henan Province since the 14th CPC National Congress, as it is also the rich fruit, brought to fruition in intensified ideological-political work. It also tells us that ideological-political work in the new historical era is still a mighty force. As long as it is conducted in all earnest, it will certainly bring good results. Adhering to the party's basic line, building up a strong, modern socialist country, translating into reality the guiding ideology set forth by the provincial party committee, namely of "uniting in vigorous advance, bringing prosperity to Henan Province," and realizing its strategic objective of "one high, one low," entails as the one most pressing problem the need to raise talents in the next generation. The more exemplary personalities, such as Zhang Huanli, Xu Honggang, and Yao Cihui, will emerge, the more cohesive will our society be, and the better shall we be able to inspire a larger number of people to unselfishly contribute to our cause. Strengthening ideological work and nurturing and shaping the new socialist generation, is an urgent demand that evolves from the general tasks of the party in the new era, as it is also a project of vital importance for generations to come. Whoever truly hopes for the accomplishment of the four modernization projects must devote all his energy to the nurturing of talents in the next generation. Whoever is sincerely concerned about the fate of state and nation, must double his or her efforts in ideological-political work, to ensure and promote the healthy upbringing of the new generation. Of foremost importance in intensified ideological work is instilling a lofty spirit in people. The lofty spirit mentioned here is the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, as Comrade Mao Zedong had advocated long ago. It is the spirit of "having ideals, a moral conscience, culture, and discipline," as repeatedly emphasized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. It is also the 64-word pioneering spirit in Comrade Jiang Zemin's summing up of the new era. It manifests the excellent work style of the communist person, as it also is indeed the traditional morality of the Chinese nation, passed on through generations. It is coalescence of valuable experiences gathered by our party in the protracted struggle of the past, as it has also fresh characteristics of our new era. It is a powerful spiritual pillar in the construction of socialism with Chinese characeristics. One fundamental task of ideological work is to show itself capable of applying this kind of a spirit in the shaping of the new generation, in spurring them on to exert themselves and fight for the basic interests of the Chinese nation, and to make unselfish contributions. In strengthening ideological work, attention must be paid to its goal-oriented nature. In the last few years, there has been some relaxation in ideological work, and some curtailing of such work, in some places and agencies. Money worship, hedonism, and extreme subjectivism have grown up and spread, and have seriously polluted the people's mentality. To cope with this situation it is necessary to launch ideological-moral education among the masses, especially among the youths, an education in which patriotism, collectivism, and socialism are core content, to launch an education of arduous struggle and of building up the country through hard work and thrift, an education of professional ethics, of social morality, and education in the fundamentals of the national condition, also education in the rule of law. In all these areas, particular emphasis should be placed on the concepts of ideal and belief. Realizing the four modernization projects is the common ideal and common belief of all nationalities of the Chinese nation at the present stage. Whether there exist this ideal and this belief, whether this ideal and this belief have been unshakably established, is not only decisive for the work and life attitude of the individual concerned, but also for his capability of deciding between good and evil. In his statement on the "four necessary qualities," Comrade Deng Xiaoping places ideal at the top. It is absolutely necessary for us to guide the people, especially our youths, toward the formation of correct ideals, beliefs, world outlook, outlook on life, and value concepts, and to have them oppose and reject the intrusion of every kind of decadent and degenerate ideology. Most important task in the strengthening of ideological work is the education of our youths. Focal point in nurturing the new socialist person, whether viewed in its immediate aspect or in its more remote impact, is the education of our youths. We must pay attention to the particular characteristics of youth, differentiate between different targets, and adopt diverse methods. We must be apt at opening up channels, pay attention to the development of democracy, respect the human individual, understand the human individual, show concern for and provide encouragement for the human individual. We must adopt a method of attracting widest participation by the masses, a method of having the masses themselves teach themselves, the method of discussions in complete equality, the method of criticism and self-criticism. We must educate and help our youths toward gaining a lofty spirit, so that they may become reliable successors in the cause of socialist modernization. Strengthening ideological work is a matter for the entire party to be concerned with. It is not to be merely undertaken at the propaganda and ideological front, but is to be undertaken by the party committees at all levels and by the basic party organizations in enterprises and industrial units, in the villages, schools, and neighborhoods. The various administrative agencies, as well as labor unions, All-China Women's Federation, and the Communist Youth League also bear heavy responsibility in this respect. All discipline and law enforcement agencies are certainly also not excluded here. We all must jointly shoulder the heavy historical task and exert ourselves in the struggle effort of nurturing the next and every succeeding generation of socialist new persons who shall possess ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.
