In France, Aerospatiale and Matra are dueling over a conventional cruise missile with a range of 400 km. But Aerospatiale is also working on a long-range supersonic nuclear air-to-surface missile (ASLP) whose first launchings will take place in 1996-1997. Aerospatiale Missiles and Matra Defense are competing to produce an air-to-surface cruise missile with conventional warhead that will be offered to the French Air Force as an "anti-infrastructure" missile for use against tactical, strategic, or even "political" targets as an "inhibiting warning shot." Each firm has already received a 20-million-franc contract for preliminary studies. But they have also invested their own money in this new missile, development of which could begin in 1994. Matra Defense is proposing a missile derived from the subsonic air-to-surface Apache and known as the Apache-C, while Aerospatiale is putting its money on an adaptation of the medium-range nuclear air-to-surface missile (ASMP), whose nuclear warhead has been replaced by a conventional payload in this new version known as the ASMP-C (see AIR & COSMOS Nos. 1429 and 1432). The ASMP-C would be lighter (885 kg) than the Apache-C (1,230 kg) and would also carry a smaller payload (240 kg compared to 400 kg). But Aerospatiale's missile (propelled by a ramjet with integrated-powder booster) is supersonic and thus from two to three times faster (Mach 2.2 to 2.3) than the subsonic turbojet-propelled Apache (Mach 0.8). In other words, the ASMP-C would take only seven minutes to cover the maximum range of 400 km, compared to 32 minutes for the Apache-C. According to their manufacturers, both missiles (with varying degrees of stealth capability) are equally accurate in the final phase (to within one to three meters). Actually, the "conventional" ASMP retains the rear and middle sections of the original air-to-surface missile with no modification. Only the forward tip is replaced by a "hardened" payload from the AS30L and a guidance system with computer and infrared homing head adapted from the one used on an air-to-air missile developed by the SAT. According to the project's chief engineer--who asked to remain anonymous--the only genuinely new component is in fact the onboard computer (adapted for ground attack), whose specific image processing software was developed jointly by Aerospatiale and the SAT. Those firms are awaiting notification early in 1994 that they can begin a program for demonstrating the feasibility of the missile's guidance system in both the inertial and then the self-guided phase and in its different attack trajectories (flight profile at high and/or low altitude). This will be done using digital simulations and demonstrations on a three-axis bench under the direction of Aerospatiale in cooperation with the LRBA [Ballistic and Aerodynamic Research Laboratory]. In particular, it will be necessary to test a computer mockup (with parallel architecture and prewired operators) and a prototype homing head (mechanical scanning) with a liquid nitrogen-cooled infrared detector (3-5 microns). According to the project manager, plans call for testing the guidance system on the ground for a year before testing it in flight (on an aircraft) for 1.5 years. But, he says, "if we were given authorization tomorrow for a demonstration program with ground targets, we would be ready to launch guided missiles within 18 months!" The reason is that the ASMP-C could benefit from synergy with the "mid-life modernization" program covering the ASMP missiles that went into service between 1986 and 1991 (there are over 80 of them). That program, which will last for several years, should begin in 1994, and according to a recent Senate report, it will keep the ASMP's operational until 2007. According to Aerospatiale, the ASMP-C could therefore be developed more quickly and less expensively than the Apache-C, whose development cost is estimated at "less than 1 billion francs" by Matra. According to the project manager, "Aerospatiale's missile would be easier to develop because it employs a simpler propulsion system (ramjet) and does not require mid-flight correction." The Apache-C, on the other hand, uses dual-mode guidance with an infrared camera for the final resetting of Thomson-CSF's Promethee radar. Aerospatiale also feels that its missile, "like any ramjet missile, would be less expensive to manufacture than the Apache in equal quantities and at the same rate of production." Aerospatiale estimated earlier that for a limited production run (from 200 to 300 missiles), the ASMP-C would cost 10 million francs per unit, whereas Matra placed the cost of the Apache-C at 6 million francs (see AIR & COSMOS Nos. 1429 and 1432). Aerospatiale is also proposing to use the ramjet air-to-surface missile as the basis for an entire family of airborne supersonic missiles with a range of 400 km. That family would consist of the ASMP-R--an anti-AWACS aircraft/radar missile equipped with a dual-mode (active and passive) radar homing head produced by Dassault Electronic--and the ASMP-M, which would be equipped with the radar homing head used on the Exocet Mk2 and the same warhead as that used on the ANS [supersonic antiship missile]. The French Navy seems interested in that supersonic antiship (actually multirole) missile, and it is thought that Germany might even join (again) in its development. The technical dossier is to be submitted to the DGA [General Delegation for Weapons] at the start of 1994! The ASMP-C can be launched from various platforms (aircraft, ships, submarines, or vehicles) and modified (by lengthening the fuel tank) to increase its range (+800 km from a high-altitude launch) in a slightly heavier version (about 1,050 kg). Matra is also proposing a version of the Apache-C with a longer range (+600 km). Concerning the current Apache (air-to-surface with a range of 140 km), Matra has announced that test flights of complete missiles (propelled, guided, and with submunitions ejected) will begin at the CEL [Landes Testing Center] in mid-1994 using a Mirage-2000 from the Flight Test Center. The company points out that the missile will be certified for the Mirage-2000D in 1996 and available in mass-produced quantities at the start of 1997. In-Flight Launchings in 1996-1997 of the ASLP Nuclear Cruise Missile The project to develop the ASLP, a nuclear-armed supersonic cruise missile, has not been abandoned. This despite the recent British decision to withdraw from the strategic nuclear air-to-surface missile project, which France was hoping to develop jointly with Great Britain as a replacement for Great Britain's 80 to 100 WE177 airborne atomic bombs and France's ASMP medium-range air-to-surface missiles. AIR & COSMOS has learned that the DGA gave its approval early in December for continuing exploratory development work on the ASLP. That work has been in progress since 1987. The chief engineer for Aerospatiale's nuclear missile program--who wishes to remain anonymous--confirmed to us that the government agency had asked the firm to begin a four-year exploratory development program to produce complete missiles and to conduct the first flight tests with that platform (without a nuclear warhead) in 1996-1997. On that subject, a recent Senate report authored by Senator Jacques Golliet expresses the feeling that "flexibility of the airborne component is particularly well adapted to the strategic situation and to changes in the threat at the operational and political levels." And further on that subject, Golliet notes that "many factors (ramjet performance, accuracy, stealth, multirole capability, suitability for strategic or prestrategic missions, and a desire to upgrade the Rafale) argue in favor of developing and having ready by around 2005 or 2007 a successor to the ASMP that will have a longer range and carry a nuclear warhead ranging from a few kilotons to 300 kT." The report also recommends "rounding out the components of our nuclear potential by the addition of a cruise missile equipped with a low-powered or variable-energy nuclear warhead or even one with dual capability: both nuclear and conventional," like the U.S. Tomahawk. Aerospatiale has already designed an ASLP version carrying a conventional warhead. According to the project's chief engineer, "it would be possible by around 2010 or 2015 to have a cruise missile that is completely autonomous (requiring not even GPS correction) and accurate to within a few meters, with a range four or five times greater than that of the ASMP." The ASMP has a range of from 150 to 300 km, depending on launch altitude.
