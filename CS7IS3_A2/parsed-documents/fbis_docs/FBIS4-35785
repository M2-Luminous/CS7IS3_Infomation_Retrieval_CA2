In a statement released today, the Arab League stressed that the continued Israeli buildup in southern Lebanon runs counter to Israel's claims that it seeks a durable, just, and comprehensive peace with the Arab countries and contravenes the rules of international law and the international resolutions, particularly Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon and the establishment of Lebanon's sovereignty over all its territories. The statement stressed that Israel's continued hostile practices against the Arab people in the occupied Arab territories neither serve the peace process nor help build confidence, at a time when the region's peoples need to devote their attention to stability, security, and overall development. The Arab League Secretariat called on the Security Council and the United States and Russia, the cosponsors of the Middle East peace process, to force Israel to immediately halt its military operations against south Lebanon and to put all possible pressure to compel Israel to implement Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
