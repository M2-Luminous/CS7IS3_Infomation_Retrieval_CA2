By proposing to his allies yesterday to set up a kind of grand conference to end the war, the president of the Republic is no longer even trying to find a diplomatic explanation for the Western countries' passiveness. It is simply a question of distracting the public's attention while General Mladic deals the death blow to Gorazde. The Serbs will certainly not allow themselves to be intimidated. Gorazde is merely the latest of the "safe areas" theoretically placed under UN protection which has had to suffer a military onslaught. For several months, they have totally destroyed the credibility of the United Nations, whose resolutions have been just so many pieces of paper. But, from their viewpoint, the Serbs have just done even better. Taking up a challenge which the former USSR had always avoided, for obviously much higher stakes, they have demonstrated that NATO was brandishing a stick and not a sword. The two raids by the U.S. Air Force on Gorazde last week in fact conveyed a very ambiguous message. By making do with destroying a few vehicles instead of carrying out a large-scale strike, the F-16 planes clearly indicated that the allies preferred negotiation to war. The same signal of weakness was given by the French Naval Air Force in 1983 when, after three weeks of consideration, it avenged the 58 who died in the Drakkar outrage by bombing empty barracks. Bill Clinton's embarrassed statements yesterday confirmed the failed action in Gorazde. For the U.S. President, the aim is "to prevent the conflict from spreading." The leader of the world's only superpower is merely finding reasons for doing nothing. It is true that it is very late. The Atlantic alliance could perhaps have halted the Serbs if it had intervened immediately after the start of hostilities against Slovenia and Croatia in June 1991. NATO's planes would not have found it difficult to silence the artillery which, in November 1991, pounded Vukovar, and it would have been even simpler, a few days later, to sink the gunboats which were bombarding Dubrovnik, that jewel classed as part of mankind's heritage by UNESCO. But why did the Europeans try to restore order in Somalia or restore peace in Cambodia, if they are too timid to try to put out the fires on their own continent? And why are the Americans so anxious to preserve NATO if the soldiers of this alliance have no other function than to march on parade days? Finally, why worry about the rapid return of the Russians to the diplomatic and military game when they are content to be in a vacuum? The fait accompli which is now being accepted in the Balkans is likely to topple other dominoes soon. By bowing to the Serbs' takeover by force, the Europeans are exposing themselves to a return to the law of the jungle in the near future.
