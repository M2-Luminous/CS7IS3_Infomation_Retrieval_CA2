The new method utilizes the separation of variables to solve the problem of electromagnetic plane wave diffraction by a homogeneous spheroid and is considerably more efficient from a computational standpoint than the method devised by Asano and Yamamoto. The expressions for scattered radiation intensity are elaborated within the framework of a rigorous solution for both severely oblate and severely prolate spheroids. Numerical results obtained for ice particles with different shapes and wave lengths of 10.6 ï¿½m are discussed. On the basis of the adduced calculations, it was concluded that the average light scattering indicatrix is smoother for oblate than for prolate particles. As a rule, the albedo of the oblate particles was somewhat greater than for prolate particles of the same volume. Changing the imaginary part of the index of refraction for the substance of the particles has virtually no bearing on the behavior of the normalized functions of the scattering indicatrix, but does affect the magnitude of the particle albedo. The polarization of the scattered radiation varies markedly with changes in particle shape. However, in some cases, prolate spheroids could be substituted for infinite circular cylinders. The findings of this study provide a basis for conducting optical atmospheric sounding experiments that would make it possible to determine the degree of sphericity of the scattering particles and their spatial orientation.
