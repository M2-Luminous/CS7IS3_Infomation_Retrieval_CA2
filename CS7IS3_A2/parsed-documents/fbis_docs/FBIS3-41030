The Ukrainian Parliament Will No Longer Stymie the Nuclear Disarmament of the State"] [Text] Kiev -- It was simply a crushing victory for Leonid Kravchuk. Once again he mixed his supporters and opponents together in the Supreme Council to produce new political loaves in the way that a good housewife kneads dough. Leonid Makarovich listened carefully first to the microphone on the left which promised him the Nobel Peace Prize and then to the microphone on the right which threatened him with Article 56 of the Criminal Code for treason on a specially large scale. And all this for a three-page statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia delivered in Moscow on 14 January. Meanwhile the stove had been lit and the loaves knew that they would have to leap into it. Ukraine's nuclear weapons are -- thanks to the economic policy of the last two years -- the only commodity which the West has dreamed of buying here, buying in order to destroy them. However, the Supreme Council was required not to sign but, on the contrary, to erase something, to strike out its so-called "warnings" over an article in Protocol Five of the START Treaty as enshrined by decree in November 1993 so that the document was not at odds with the three-page statement of the presidents which had already been agreed upon. The situation was lent special piquancy by the fact that the "Moscow pact" -- neither the statement itself nor the appendices to it containing specific figures and deadlines for Ukraine's nuclear disarmament -- did not need ratification at all. And the debates in parliament guaranteed their participants profound moral satisfaction only. Leonid Makarovich bore the blows of fate in worthy fashion. He forgave his attackers: "I understand it is a difficult decision for you to make..." He encouraged those who thought like him: "I received a letter from Clinton at lunchtime. He writes that he is doubling economic aid to Ukraine." True, the real issues remained off stage: The questions of interest to the technicians and professionals like Kuchma of how modern solid-fuel SS-24 missiles are going to be scrapped if the technology for recycling them does not yet exist in the world; who will solve the problem of utilizing weapons-grade plutonium; what to do with the abandoned missile silos, and so forth. A purely political rather than a comprehensive approach to nuclear disarmament can only result in either blatant deception of the whole world or upheaval within the Ukrainian state system. But the president was as good as his word: He exerted his influence and led people toward a compromise. With just a couple of minutes to go before the end of the working day parliament was persuaded that it was being taken into account, established a quorum, and pushed the "yes" button. Unconditional ratification of START I was carried. The new decree was prepared by the president himself as a legislative initiative. True, during voting the third paragraph -- on accession to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1 July 1968 -- got unexpectedly dropped: Someone remembered that deputies had not actually seen the document themselves, which was inconvenient.... Therefore Ukraine has not subscribed to it, although it now wished to!
