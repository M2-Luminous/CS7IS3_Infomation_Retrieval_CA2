The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, termed as "untrue" the claim raised by a spokesman of the Armenian president on Wednesday that Iran had made its comments on the crash even before the completion of the investigation by a team of Iranian experts. Based on the report filed by the fact-finding team of experts, the Iranian Foreign Ministry issued its statement last Monday, saying Armenian troops in Karabakh had missiled down the Iranian aircraft killing all 32 passengers and crew members aboard. Mohammadi said that at present some details relevant to minor aspects of the crash were being followed up. Over the past two days, the ISLAMIC REPUBLIC NEWS AGENCY has contacted Armenian officials in Yerevan and Armenian diplomats in Tehran to inquire about their views on the statement of the Iranian Foreign Ministry concerning the crash but none of them have yet made any formal comment on the issue. The C-130 which was bound to Tehran from Moscow with families of Iranian diplomats on board exploded in mid air and crashed in Armenian held Karabakh moments after it contacted the Yerevan control tower at 19:10 hours GMT.
