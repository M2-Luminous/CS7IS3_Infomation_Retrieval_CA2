The poll appeared in the 20 January Paris PARIS MATCH. Overall, and accounting for differences between leftist and rightist voters, 49 percent of the respondents (compared with 44 percent in the December poll) said they had a good opinion of Mitterrand as president of the Republic. Some 44 percent said they had a bad opinion of him, compared with 48 percent in December. Seven percent did not know. When asked about their opinion of Balladur as prime minister, 60 percent said it was good, up 4 percent since December, and 29 percent said it was bad, down 5 percent since December. A total of 11 percent did not know. Respondents were also asked if they were satisfied or dissatisfied with the way France is governed. Overall, 33 percent said they were satisfied, up from 27 percent in December, and 62 percent said they were dissatisfied, down 3 percent since December. Five percent did not know. The same poll asked respondents to name the candidate for whom they would be more likely to vote if new legislative elections took place. Some 3 percent chose the extreme left, up 1 percent since December. Eight percent opted for the Communist Party (PC), the same as in December. Similarly, the percentage of those who would vote for the Socialist Party (PS) and for Generation Ecologie remained stable at 21 and 5 percent respectively. The same was true for the Greens at 5 percent. Slightly more respondents would vote for the Union for French Democracy (UDF) (15 percent compared to 13 percent), and slightly fewer (29 percent compared to 31 percent) would vote for the Rally for the Republic (RPR). Finally, 12 percent--compared to 13 percent in December-- would vote for the National Front (FN). The 12 January Paris daily LIBERATION reprinted the results of a popularity poll conducted by the Louis Harris organization on 7-8 January among 1,005 voters on behalf of the PROFESSION POLITIQUE DE CETTE SEMAINE. Some 55 percent of the respondents said that the Balladur government is "going in the right direction," a 5 percent increase in the last two months. Some 38 percent thought the opposite, a 3 percent drop. The most popular was Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua with 34 percent favorable opinions. He was followed by Minister of Social Affairs Simone Veil with 53 percent and Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe with 51 percent.
