FBIS4-10525 "drlat072_b_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Haiti Socialist Deputies Oppose Senate Article Socialist Deputies Oppose Senate Article FL1304211594 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1045 GMT 13 Apr 94 FL1304211594 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] The leader of the socialist bloc in the Chamber of Deputies dissociates himself totally from the resolution passed by the Senate office led by Senator Sansaricq. The socialist bloc remains committed to the parliamentary plan regarding the unblocking of the Governors Island agreement, says Deputy Duly Brutus: [Begin Brutus recording] We remain faithful to the plan which we ratified in the Chamber of Deputies in the Haitian parliament. We are waiting for the Senate's position with Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis; on the other hand, we feel that we must continue negotiating a solution to the Haitian political crisis. [In Creole] The socialist bloc does not relate to this position on the application of Article 149 of the Constitution. We believe the time is not right to take such a step, mostly because we think that the parliament has made some progress on the international level. It would be a pity if today we were to take some false steps that would cause the parliament to lose the credibility it has on the international level. [end recording]
