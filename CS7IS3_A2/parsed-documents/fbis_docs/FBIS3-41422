Foreign and domestic studies show that airborne pollutants from China account for 30 percent to 50 percent of the acid rain that falls upon Korea and Japan, and Seoul signed environmental protection pacts with Tokyo and Beijing in June and October last year, respectively, to improve environmental cooperation with its neighbors. No Chae-sik, president of the Korea Environmental Technology Research Institute, has proposed to President Kim Yong-sam that there be strict examination of pollutants from China as research by domestic and foreign scholars shows that China accounts for 30 percent of Korea's air pollution. Sim Shang-ku, senior research scientist of the Environment Research Center in the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), says recent research by Japan's Central Research Institute for Electric Power Industries shows that at least 50 percent of the materials causing acid rain in Japan are from China. The Japanese institute published the results of its research on Chinese pollutants in November 1992. It traced the roots of sulfureted ions, which cause acid rain, observed at 20 measuring points in Japan and found that 50 percent of the ions were from China, 15 percent from South Korea and the remainder from Japan. Professor Kim Chong-uk of Seoul National University's Graduate School of Environmental Study said in a paper last year that the sulfurous acid gas produced in Beijing and two other cities and 14 provinces on China's east coast has a great effect on the Korean peninsula. ``About 92 percent of the sulfurous acid gas from China becomes acid rain while the remaining 8 percent affects the earth in the form of gas,'' he wrote. ``Shandong and Liaoning Provinces, where factories are clustered, especially affect this peninsula very much.'' If the wind blows from China, the acidity of the rain falling on Paengnyong island off the west coast reaches PH 5.0, he said. South Korea is studying exactly how much sulfurous acid gas and acid rain is coming from China, and how much damage they cause. Seeking precise data, the National Institute of Environmental Research will begin a three-year examination of air pollutants blown from China and acid rain, using planes, from spring. [sentence as received] Professor Yi Kyong-chae of Seoul City University says that acid rain appeared only in Seoul and some industrial areas until three to four years ago. But these days, acid rain also falls in rural areas, including Kwangneung in Kyonggi Province and west Kangwon Province. ``Unless the government devises countermeasures against acid rain caused by pollutants coming from China as soon as possible, most of South Korea's pine trees will suffer irreparable damage,'' Yi says. The reason for China's acid rain is that 76 percent of its total energy comes from burning coal, which contains a lot of sulfur. In 1991, China discharged 16.22 million tons of sulfurous acid gas into the atmosphere, about 15 times as much as South Korea. China made rapid economic progress in 1992 and 1993, and the consumption of coal, of which it has an enormous amount, soared. Seoul National University's Graduate School of Environmental Study expects that until 2022, when China's per capita gross national product (GNP) will reach 4,000 U.S. dollars, the amount of sulfurous acid gas will keep increasing. In contrast, the sulfurous acid gas generated in Korea has been dropping since 1990, when desulfurization facilities and clean energy were introduced by industry. As time passes, the damage Korea suffers from Chinese pollution will grow, according to researchers. To reduce the pollution from China, the Environment Ministry has held three Northeast Asian environment conferences, but China appears reluctant to do anything about its emissions lest economic growth suffer and says that it lacks the capital and technology to deal with the problem. In Europe, where 50 percent of airborne pollutants migrate across national boundaries, 33 countries signed the convention on transboundary air pollutants in 1979. Canada and the United States concluded an agreement to sharply reduce air pollutants causing acid rain in 1990.
