Lieutenant General Mantiri, chief of general staff of the Indonesian Armed Forces [ABRI], said ABRI has never recognized the SBSI because its legal existence is not recognized by the government. Therefore, ABRI will take strong action against anyone involved in the destruction and looting of property without fear or favor and in accordance with existing laws. Commenting on rumors that racist violence and riots also took place in various parts of Jakarta, Lt. Gen. Mantiri said the rumors were not true. The rumors may have been deliberately spread by irresponsible elements to create anxiety among the public.
