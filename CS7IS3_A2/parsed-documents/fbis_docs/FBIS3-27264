At present, the situation of wheat production in our province is grim. In more than 12 million mu of wheat fields across the province, the condition of wheat seedlings is generally poorer than that last year. The area of category-one seedlings has declined by 12.6 percent over the same period last year, 10 million mu of wheat lack fertilizer, and the area of wheat hit by drought throughout the province has reached 40 million mu. If appropriate measures are not taken, a sharp decline in grain output will emerge in summer this year. The meeting pointed out: Now is the crucial season for wheat field management, so various localities must seize this opportune moment, mobilize the masses, and rapidly set off an upsurge of wheat field management to bring about a change in the condition of wheat seedlings. The meeting also called for all localities to pay serious attention to major contradictions in light of the prominent problems that exist in various kinds of wheat fields. The fields that still need plowing, irrigating, and top-dressing should be done properly, the practice of rigid uniformity should be avoided, and efforts should concentrated on enhancing the efficiency of field management.
