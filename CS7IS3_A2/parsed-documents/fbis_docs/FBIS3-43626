The alert was given by an economic magazine, LE STANDARD. In an article in today's issue, written by its editor and director, Gaston Mutamba, the newspaper reported that the reservation of bank notes has started again in certain cases. The banks can no longer offer any liquidity at their counters. Our colleague also stressed that people are no longer making cash savings because, according to him, businessmen have hurriedly reconstituted their cash stocks. Also, the skyrocketing inflation and speculation force them to take precautions by getting rid of the national currency for the benefit of foreign exchange. This is a serious situation, Gaston Mutamba revealed. He observed that the Central Bank is no longer in a position to print new bank notes because it owes foreign printers about $50 million. It can also be read in LE STANDARD that the Central Bank could remedy the situation by printing bank notes locally after importing the necessary materials, but the problem will remain wholly unsolved. Our colleague asked where the necessary dollars would be obtained since the country has not got sufficient foreign exchange. An imminent shortage of bank notes is therefore feared in the official channels of the economy, the LE STANDARD official said. For him, this shortage could have occurred earlier if the two Kasais had accepted to do transactions with the new currency.
