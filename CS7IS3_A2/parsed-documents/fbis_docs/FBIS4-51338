According to weather forecast, the regions on the upper and middle reaches of the Huang He and the northern part of North China should particularly pay attention to flood prevention during the flood season this year. Regions experiencing droughts at present, while combating drought, should also watch out for possible floods during the flood season. Zou Jingmeng said: During the flood season this year, the natural disasters caused by droughts and floods could be more conspicuous than last year, and droughts could be more serious than floods. As both serious droughts and serious floods are likely, we must be fully prepared for them and strive to keep losses at a minimum. Concerning weather service activities during the flood season, Zou Jingmeng said: At present, the weather departments at all levels have been on combat alert. Weathermen will work around the clock to closely monitor weather changes and strive to offer a good weather service during the flood season. To ensure a good weather service during the flood season, the China Meteorological Administration has already called on the leaders of the weather departments at various levels to go to work on the front line, clearly divide work, strictly perform their duties, implement the system of responsibility at various levels, and be well prepared in terms of mentality, organization, technology, equipment, and personnel. Zou Jingmeng particularly emphasized that the weather department should provide weather service for the prevention of floods both in major rivers and reservoirs and in urban areas, so as to protect the people's lives and property.
