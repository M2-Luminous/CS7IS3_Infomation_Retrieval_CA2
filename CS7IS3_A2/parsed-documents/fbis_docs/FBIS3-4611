The ministry announced that under the revamp, a general information office will replace the existing public information policy office to better handle informative programs on state affairs. The general information office will also sample public opinion for speedy reflection in government policies. Moreover, the existing Press Administration Bureau and Broadcasting Administration Bureau will be merged into one Press and Broadcasting Bureau tasked with supportive administration instead of regulation-oriented programs. Under the plan, the Advertisement Promotion Bureau will be renamed as the Media Industries Bureau, and the Public Relations Bureau as the Public Opinions Bureau. The reorganization further envisages turning the Korean Overseas Information Service [KOIS] into a sort of national image center. As offices charged with collecting, analyzing and distributing various information at home and abroad, an information material division will be set up under the public opinions bureau for domestic data. For data from abroad, an overseas information division will be established at the KOIS. In addition, the national film production center will be reorganized into the national video production center, focusing on production of cable television and video programs instead of solely making motion pictures. "Under the reorganization, our ministry's administration-oriented programs have been slashed sharply and instead we will have new duties to effectively support the development of new media and to help the nation better cope with market opening," a ministry official said.
