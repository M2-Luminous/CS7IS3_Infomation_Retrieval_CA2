He is making a working trip round the Transcaucasus. As you know, at a meeting of military department heads of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh with the mediation of Pavel Grachev, a protocol was drafted on the first stage of a settlement -- cease-fire and disengagement of the sides. By the end of May, it was planned to introduce about 1,800 Russian peacemakers into the conflict zone, but the protocol was not signed by the Azeri side, which insisted that practically simultaneously with the disengagement of the forces Armenia should start freeing the Azeri territories it seized in the course of the conflict. This is the problem Pavel Grachev has to discuss at his coming meeting on 11 June in Baku with Azeribaijani President Heydar Aliyev.
