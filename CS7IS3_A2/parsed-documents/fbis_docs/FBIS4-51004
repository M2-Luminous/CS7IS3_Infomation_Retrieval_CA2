Many leading computer companies have set up international procurement offices here to facilitate purchases of Taiwan-made computer products as those products have become more competitive internationally, business sources said. In the past, IBM has always been the leading foreign buyer of computer products in Taiwan. Last year alone, it bought US$382 million worth of Taiwan-made computer products, and the figure is expected to further grow this year, an executive at the IBM Taiwan corporation said. Apple Computer Inc., which will double its purchases here to US$400 million-US$500 million to make it the largest foreign buyer of computer products this year, mostly will purchase family-use computers, monitors, motherboards, notebook computers, and semiconductors, said Cheng Hung-yu, manager of the Apple Taiwan branch. Apple's Taipei Procurement Office will also be expanded to handle purchases in Mainland China and Hong Kong, Cheng added. Another active foreign buyer, Hewlett Packard, will also increase purchases here, purchase manager Chan Chiu-ming said. Hewlett Packard bought US$60 million worth of Taiwan computer products in 1992 and US$90 million in goods last year. The figure is expected to set a new high of US$100 million this year, Chan predicted. In addition to monitors and rectifiers, Hewlett Packard will increase purchases of motherboards this year, Chan said, citing the flexibility and advanced know-how of Taiwan computer makers as the main reasons behind the increased purchases. And although Compaq has only bought less than US$100 million worth of Taiwan computer products in each of the past three years in that figure may swell markedly to US$300 million this year, Sun Yung-hsiang, managing director at Compaq Taiwan branch office, said.
