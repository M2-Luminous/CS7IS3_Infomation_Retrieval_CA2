Does the country indeed face financial collapse in the next few months, as certain foreign observers and also some Ukrainian politicians claim? [Kravchuk] The situation is grave, even very grave. There is inflation, the crisis in industry, the slump in production.... This is all true, so to speak. I will mention a few of what I see as the main reasons for our economy's plight. When Ukraine was part of the USSR, the main emphasis was placed on the development of heavy industry -- mining, metallurgy, the chemical industry.... That is, on sectors that do not directly benefit people but consume the bulk of energy. And when the prices of energy sources quintupled for us in the last 18 months, this was naturally bound to affect the entire national economic system. On top of that there are the problems with the financial and banking system. After all, it essentially never existed here. The Ukrainian national bank was just a subsidiary of the USSR bank. Another factor has certainly been the cadres problem. Cadres have proved unprepared to swiftly restructure our entire economy as an autonomous, independent system. Not with a view to isolation, but with a view to being able to resolve by our own efforts the qualitatively new tasks facing us as a sovereign state. [Prokopchuk] Isn't this the explanation of the lurches, uncertainty over the choice of path, and sabotage of the transformations on the part of the old management apparatus, which has barely been renewed at all? [Kravchuk] I would not speak of sabotage as such. That is an exaggeration. But the inconsistency of our actions on the road to the market is clear. And the replacement of three governments is confirmation of that. We are now on our fourth. All the previous ones quit under pressure of the situation, on the initiative of the Supreme Council. This rapid replacement of governments is also not a good thing and has also had an adverse effect. The main miscalculation has been the attempt to combine the principles of the administrative-edict economy and the market economy. Seeing that the switch to market relations is not proceeding as rapidly as we would like, our managers have clung to familiar levers. Nothing sensible has come of this. And only now, in my view, is the government adopting the correct course -- an anti-inflationary, market course. But with mandatory control on the part of the state. Since at present property largely remains in state hands. In short, there are shifts. Over 20,000 enterprises -- small, medium, and large -- will be privatized this year. [Prokopchuk] But Western specialists' forecasts are not so rosy. It is openly being said that the Ukrainian economy will inevitably collapse and that Ukraine is doomed as an independent state. Do you share this view? [Kravchuk] I want to answer your question with another -- To whose advantage is it for Ukraine to be independent, who generally wants this? There had long been balance in the world and in Europe, and tested and proven ties in the economy and politics had been established. Then all of a sudden the geopolitical situation changes sharply. Along with other new states, Ukraine appears on the map of the world -- a sizable country possessing nuclear weapons, a country with a decent industrial potential and fertile soil. Today it is experiencing difficulties and economic crisis. But it is capable of becoming rich. Calculations show that if normal agricultural production and processing are organized, Ukraine can provide not only itself but also other countries with piles of foodstuffs. Tell me, who benefits by this? So hundreds of complex questions arise. Our neighbors also have political interests -- access to Europe, access to the sea, access to Crimea.... That is, a whole system of views emerges which as I see it boil down to the fact that today a great many people are interested in ensuring that Ukraine does not make it as an independent state. There is the foreign policy factor of press from both East and West. [Prokopchuk] What about domestic political forces? [Kravchuk] Naturally, there are also domestic forces that do not want Ukraine to make it as a sovereign state. Some are angry with the authorities, whom they describe as partyocratic and communist. There are the national-patriots. They are angry with Kravchuk and others. But, in opposing the president, they are essentially opposing their own people. Although they pay a lot of lipservice to the people's interests. There are also forces openly oriented toward the interests of other states. Admittedly, many people allude only to Russia, believing that "Ukrainian" interests predominate there. However, I do not share that view. Russia naturally has more "Ukrainian" interests than other countries, and there is still a very great deal of work to be done to harmonize the interests of Ukraine and Russia. But to claim that Russia alone is an opponent of our interests, as many people try to make out, is a mistake. We simply have not yet found the key to resolving questions with Russia. That is my profound conviction. In short, both domestic and external factors are extremely complex, and we will have to make great efforts to avoid provoking grave confrontations. But I think that thanks to our consistency and flexibility, thanks to the fact that we have sought and have found compromises, we have managed to retain good relations with our neighbors and retain good friends abroad. Thanks to our considered actions in resolving internal political problems, in particular interethnic problems, and thanks to our people's wisdom we have not evoked confrontations inside our state, although some people badly want this. We live in peace. And this is the most important point. [Prokopchuk] Now let us touch on purely economic problems. How was it possible to repay half the debt to Russia? [Kravchuk] First, we began to make savings and we reduced consumption. Second, we began to make real repayments, realizing that you cannot live in debt. Now, if we manage to solve the problem of compensation for nuclear weapons and succeed in resolving other questions, in particular the question of the Black Sea Fleet, I think we will cope with the problem of debts to Russia. Debts are not the most important thing today. Every state has them. No one makes a tragedy out of this. A debt can always be repaid, there is the basis and prospect for this. The most important thing is to learn to work in the new conditions and to create competitive output and technologies which will make it possible to integrate intensively with the world economy and the economy of the Commonwealth countries. [Prokopchuk] What is the situation regarding payment for the transit of Russian freight on Ukrainian railroads and Russian gas and oil? There are rumors that Russia has already been given all Ukrainian compressor stations and other pipeline facilities as a contribution toward repaying the debts. [Kravchuk] Those are just rumors. They play into the hands of those who are interested in robbing the state. The question of transit was raised by our acting Prime Minister Y. Zvyahilskyy during talks in Moscow ahead of the Ashgabat meeting. Solutions were found. Russia reduced gas prices, and we reduced transit prices accordingly. The same happened with Turkmenistan. [Prokopchuk] Private capital and big investors who would help fill the empty shelves and remove social tension are not shunning Ukraine only because of the political instability. They are deterred by the absence of guarantees regarding the export of their share of the profits and the absence of a law on land assigning to the owners of an enterprise the land on which it stands.... Ukraine, bankers claim, is dying for want of investment. [Kravchuk] We adopted foreign economic laws back when I was chairman of the Supreme Council. At that time we had our laws assessed by experts in a number of countries with a developed market economy. But when one of our governments received the right to issue decrees, it slightly rejigged these laws. A number of important provisions that were to investors' advantage were removed. We are now rectifying this situation. At any rate, today our foreign economic laws are no worse than those operating in other countries. They give the right to unimpeded evacuation of profits, properly defend the investor's capital, and provide him with guarantees and tax breaks. But our presentation of these laws is painfully low-key and useless. Another point. If we had a convertible national currency and if we managed to curb inflation, investors would be keener to come here. That is, today the laws are not the problem. [Prokopchuk] Many people believe that the slump in production in Ukraine and therefore the decline in the population's living standard result from the severing of economic ties with Russia. But former Vice Premier B. Pinzenik claims that this is not the cause but the effect of the fact "that we have artificially blocked the way to the Russian market with quotas, licenses, duties, and taxes and, now we have lost this market, have nothing with which to purchase Russian energy sources." What is your view? [Kravchuk] What happened happened. But now we have removed many of the "barriers." But it cannot be said that the "barriers" were erected only by Ukraine. When Russia first sent us the list of its goods liable to export duties and the list ran, I think, to over 2,000 items, I said: What kind of "free trade" is this? (Incidentally, our list of goods for which special export procedures were introduced at that time consisted of only 300 items.) Why did the Russians not lift the ban on free trade in their oil, gas, and timber? Moreover, who was the first to start to erect borders between Ukraine and Russia, who was the first to adopt that decision? Russia. But I bear no grudge. Every state has to defend itself and its interests. I am merely in favor of ensuring that there is no distortion or lack of objectivity. And that mutual interests are taken into account and everything is resolved on businesslike, partner principles. Why is the European Community prospering? Because there if citrus fruit prices in Italy and Spain are at a given level, they are the same in France as well, and if somebody wants to change something, they assemble for a general council for a mutually respectful review of quotas, taxes, and duties. But what happens over here? Russia introduces its own prices, its own wages without consulting with anybody.... We cannot do this because we are in different leagues. Russia has a positive balance, it has colossal natural resources, and it can permit itself things that neither we nor other CIS countries can permit ourselves. The upshot is that, given the low purchasing power of our population and the low prices compared with those in Russia, a flood of Ukrainian foodstuffs, anything that can be transported and carried, poured into Russia. Our stores and depots were stripped bare. So we were forced at the end of the year to double or triple food prices in order to halt the plundering of the country. Today you can buy a ticket to Moscow or other Russian cities without any problem -- the flood of peddlers exploiting this "equal, mutually advantageous" cooperation, the "consideration" of mutual interests, and the operation of the "unified regulatory system" has dried up. This mechanism does not exist; there is only talk about it. Just why do those who shove microphones at Ukrainian citizens at markets in Bryansk and Smolensk not tell the truth about the reasons for these pilgrimages but only screen the "unadorned," strictly personal (and "correct," of course) viewpoint of their interviewee? [Prokopchuk] Leonid Makarovich, why in your view has the ruble zone not worked out? And what is your prediction for the future of the CIS? [Kravchuk] I said from the very beginning that there would be no ruble zone. Because we have the wrong view of the ruble zone and how it should be understood. In history there have been dollar pools, sterling zones.... But then each of the states belonging to the said zone had its own currency and aligned it with the main currency. The dollar, for example. But what did we want from the ruble zone? A single ruble -- the same for all the states? That is not a ruble zone, but a ruble state. Russia must not be blamed here; I would have acted the same way as the Central Bank of Russia. If I print the money (and this is the greatest asset) I also have to track the money supply, the correctness of mutual settlements, prices. If this is not done Russia will die, it will be overtaken by stronger inflation than we have. To live in different states and set your own prices, wages, and taxes while all using the same ruble is unrealistic. I talked about this in Moscow when we were discussing the problem of the Economic Union. At the time many people took exception to what I said. But within a month we had confirmation of what I was asserting. Russia has ultimately forced out of its zone almost all those who nurtured hopes of finding a home in this zone. And Russia is right. It is pursuing primarily its own interests and attending to the stability of its own monetary system, the prevention of inflation, and the strengthening of its own economy. And this is natural. This is how we, and others, would act. Charity begins at home. As for the fate of the CIS, we are witnessing, as I have already said, the improvement of our Commonwealth's structure. It is hard to predict today what the specific directions of this improvement will be, but the fact that the Commonwealth is necessary is beyond doubt. There are two main strands: The member countries' common problems must be solved within a CIS framework, while questions of relations between individual states must be resolved on a bilateral basis. These two strands were indeed in evidence during the meetings and talks in Ashgabat. Can the Commonwealth, in the long term, become the same kind of association of states as the European Union? Maybe, but it will take time. The internal complexities in every CIS member country are a brake on the processes of the broader and more active improvement of the CIS itself. But in the long term, I repeat, we can achieve the same kind of union as the EEC. [Prokopchuk] If it isn't a secret, how are the Massandra accords on the Black Sea Fleet and other issues being implemented? [Kravchuk] There is movement. First and foremost in understanding the other side. I proceed on the basis that we have already adopted three documents relating to the Fleet -- the Yalta, Dagomys, and Massandra accords. When we were adopting them we moved first forward and then backward. In any event, taking these documents as a whole, they can serve as the starting point for steps forward. It was this that I suggested to President B. Yeltsin. But the Russian side is seeking to use only the Massandra document. And does not wish to take account of the two previous documents, which nobody has rescinded. On the one side you have a protocol of intent, on the other -- signed agreements. You cannot pick and choose only the things which you find advantageous and convenient to yourself. It is necessary to examine everything as a package, on the basis of mutual acceptability, not to exploit the situation and some short-term advantages; it is necessary to take the long-term view. If today some people think that a change of borders is possible, they are deeply mistaken. Agreement on something specific is indeed possible -- there have been examples of this in history. But times need to be different for this. It is necessary to follow only the path of discussion, the path of accords. To try to resolve something by force means to unleash conflict. Incidentally, it's not all as simple in the Crimea as people sometimes like to suggest. [Prokopchuk] Incidentally, it is 340 years since the Pereyaslavl Assembly [which voted for Ukrainian union with Muscovy]. [Kravchuk] Yes, we lived together for 340 years and now we cannot resolve the problems which have built up and accumulated.... I believe that we will have closer ties than before, natural ties, not diktat -- older and younger brothers, dominant and subordinate peoples. We will cooperate as equal partners. We must move toward this kind of relationship calmly, smoothly, handsomely, with the understanding that we are Slav peoples and are ordained to live together, side by side, forever. The only thing is that today no stupidities must be committed. By Russia or Ukraine. People must not state that Ukraine as such does not exist, and Ukrainian independence is in general a "historical mistake." Nor do I share the other side's statements that all the difficulties which we have come up against today are "Russian intrigues," that it has been the "dirty Muscovites" ["moskali"] who have been strangling us all his time.... For some reason some people are very keen to cause trouble between us. This is why it is necessary not to commit stupidities or ignore today's realities. [Prokopchuk] By ratifying START I and the Lisbon Protocol with a number of substantial provisos did Ukraine not doom itself to a further, tighter credit blockade and uncompromising political pressure from the United States and other nuclear states? [Kravchuk] The Supreme Council decree includes provisos which are perfectly normal and natural, as they say. Yes, Ukraine is entitled to compensation for its nuclear weapons, Ukraine must have reliable guarantees of its security, Ukraine needs assistance to eliminate its nuclear weapons. But the fact that the Supreme Council did not vote to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is a major mistake by our parliament. I have said and will continue to say this, I will insist that the only correct path for us is to join the treaty. We cannot change the already adopted course toward nuclear-free status. You can build any illusions you like, even about creating our own nuclear industry, but they are only illusions. It is clear to everyone that we do not need the weapons we inherited from the USSR. And nobody will ever use them. Everybody knows that, even if such an insane idea was to come into somebody's head, it is practically impossible today for Ukraine to launch the missiles. Any of these 176 missiles can be launched only on orders from Moscow. This is clear to everyone, but nevertheless attempts continue to be made to turn us into a bogeyman. In signing the trilateral statement and the annex to it in Moscow on 14 January, Ukraine won a political, economic, and human victory. The United States, Russia, and the entire world community shared it with us. Nobody will now say that Ukraine is standing still on the nuclear disarmament road. The road to START II and even START III is now open. Mankind has gained real hope of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. There is something else I also wish to stress. Most of the demands formulated in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's provisos relating to ratification of the START I treaty were met. In the documents which were signed the United States and Russia stated that they respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence, that is, they are becoming guarantors of our security. After acceding to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty -- and I am confident that our parliament will now adopt such a decision -- Ukraine will be safeguarded against nuclear attack. And, equally importantly, we will receive compensation for the uranium in the strategic missile warheads which will be sent to Russia, plus financial, scientific, and technical assistance in eliminating our nuclear weapons. As for the part of your question relating to a tougher credit blockade, in December there was indeed a real threat of isolation. But now broad political and economic cooperation prospects are opening up for us. [Prokopchuk] And a final, purely personal point, Leonid Makarovich, if you will permit me. Since you also became head of government there has been an obvious increase in your workload. Do you manage to carve out time for your family and grandchildren? And in general what is your life like outside work? [Kravchuk] My grandson Andrey is 13 and as tall as me; he's an early developer. And my granddaughter Mashenka is six. She's so sweet and interesting. When they are with me it's the only time I get completely away from all the worries and problems. You have to answer their endless questions, you see. When we get involved in their games I myself also become like a child. I can play hide-and-seek with my eyes blindfolded; when they crawl around on their knees, I crawl around on my knees; when they jump, I jump. Those are the times I really relax....
