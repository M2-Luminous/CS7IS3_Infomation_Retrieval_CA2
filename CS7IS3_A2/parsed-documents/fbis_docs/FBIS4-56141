Bratinka, who will be in Italy Thursday [26 May] and Friday, argued that a sufficient number of institutions and forums existed to tackle bilateral and other questions, while the CEI, of which Italy is a founding member, should be used to coordinate regional development potential through concrete projects, for example, in the areas of transport and telecommunications. A positive example of this, the Czech diplomat said, was the effort currently underway to create a Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA) and added how the CEI should be expanded to include other countries in Central and Eastern Europe but, at the same not, not become institutionalized. The Czech deputy foreign minister went on to state how Italy's presence in the CEI was an "utmost priority" and how, for his country, there was great appreciation for the potential for cooperation with Italy and for Rome's role as "our lawyer" before the European Union [EU]. Evidence of this, Bratinka added, was last year's Italo-British initiative in favor of initiating a cooperation policy between the European Union and countries in Central and Eastern Europe. In this framework, the Czech diplomat urged a greater presence of Italian investments in his country -- they currently account for 3.4 percent of total foreign investment -- observing "I expect Italy's share to rise to 10 percent", given the "golden opportunities" which await Italian investors in the Czech Republic. During his two-day visit to Italy, Czech deputy foreign minister will review, with his Italian talking partners, a whole range of questions, including bilateral treaties, Italy's ratification of the EU association agreement with the Czech Republic, the situation in the former Yugoslavia, United Nations questions, NATO's "Partnerships for Peace" initiative and the nomination of a new Czech ambassador to Rome, a post left open for some time now. The CEI was born from the original "Quadrilateral Initiative", formed in 1989 between Italy, Austria, Hungary and the then Yugoslavia. It was then expanded to include Czechoslovakia and later Poland, thus becoming the "Pentagonal" and "Hexagonal" initiatives. Between 1992 and 1993, following the division of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, the initiative's membership rose to ten -- with the admission of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- and it became the Central European Initiative.
