However, nationwide figures are not yet available. The capital's imports and exports rose 120 per cent from January last year to $183 million. Imports were about $50 million, up 116 per cent. The municipal government said yesterday that the Shougang Company (Capital Iron and Steel Complex) increased its exports by $8.01 million, a bigger rise than any other firm in the city. Shougang is one of China's largest corporations and Beijing's leading earner of foreign exchange. Exports from the Beijing Machinery Equipment Import and Export Corporation rose 620 per cent, but their exact volume was unavailable. Foreign-funded firms in Beijing exported goods worth $40 million in January, 31 per cent of the city's total. And barter trade, mainly with the former Soviet republics, increased 78 per cent to $4.23 million, municipal officials said. State-run trading companies, the mainstay of the capital's foreign business, increased their exports by 68 per cent. These corporations export goods such as grain, silk, arts and crafts, and chemicals. Exports from the country's State run enterprises, including those in Beijing, shrank last year because of the sluggish international market. Most of them turned their attention to more profitable domestic business as the national economy grew 13 per cent over 1992. Analysts said the unification of the foreign exchange rates on January 1, which formally devalued the yuan, might help exports recover. But it was too early to say whether Beijing, or the rest of the country, could sustain the export momentum. "We have to wait and see whether the current foreign exchange rate will remain stable for the whole year," said an expert who asked not to be named. "If the yuan is further devalued as inflation soars, the exporters might face prohibitive purchase prices at home and a demand from foreign importers to slash export prices."
