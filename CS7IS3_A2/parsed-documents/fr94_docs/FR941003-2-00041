The Universal Purchase States may accept the maximum charges listed or develop their own maximum fees, as indicated under section II.D. of this notice. D. Maximum Charges for Administration of Vaccines in Universal Purchase States States that have programs under which the State purchases vaccines for all children in the State (Universal Purchase States) have the flexibility to accept the maximum charges developed by HCFA or to develop their own maximum charges. We believe it is necessary that Universal Purchase States are provided sufficient flexibility in developing charges in order to ensure that there is equal access to immunizations for all children. In these States, we believe the State may wish to set one overall charge cap in order to encourage adequate provider participation. Furthermore, it is our understanding that providers should experience no cost differences between VFC program eligible children and all other children inasmuch as the provider never incurs the cost of the vaccine.
