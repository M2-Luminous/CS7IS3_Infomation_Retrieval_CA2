The imports of North Korean goods into South Korea decreased by 42 percent to $10.882 million, and the South Korean exports of goods to North Korea increased by 230 percent to $1.669 million.

A responsible official of the Trade, Industry, and Energy Ministry said, "The decrease in the inter-Korean trade is largely attributable to the aggravation of the North Korean nuclear issue and the North Korean shortage of foreign currency resulting from its economic difficulty." He added, "Local businesses are virtually suspending inter-Korean trade this month."
