Accepts Russia's Mediatory Attempts as the Part of Activity of International Organisations" -- TURAN headline] [Text] Baku, 19 May (TURAN) -- "The U.S. back the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty of the states," said the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Richard Kauzlarich, at today's press conference in Baku. "The U.S. do not intend to stay aside from the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. The warring parties have to realize that the conflict must be settled as soon as possible. One will not be able to achieve any other purposes without that," said Kauzlarich. The U.S. Ambassador said that "they say that we must point to the culprit of the conflict. We think that it will not help to settle the conflict." Answering to the question concerning the international mediation in settlement the Karabakh conflict, Richard Kauzlarich noted that the U.S. accept the mediatory attempts of Russia only within the international organisation's framework, in particular CSCE. He said that all the members of CSCE should be involved to the process of observers' sending to the conflict area. American ambassador noted that mediatory success can be provided only in case of the actions not only of some countries, but of international organisations. In respect with the CSCE activity, Kauzlarich said that this organisation, during last two years practically had not chances to realise its peacemaking potential. "During this period both parties turned away from the attempts of CSCE," said the ambassador. He also noted that in case of signing the oil contracts with American companies, Azerbaijan can hope on obtaining the status of most favour in trade with U.S.A.
