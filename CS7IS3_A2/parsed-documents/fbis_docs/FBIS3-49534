The specific reason for the ministry's concern is that this office drafted and disseminated in foreign diplomatic circles information on the so-called Komarno initiative that takes matters out of context and, according to our ministry, is nonobjective and misleading. The Foreign Ministry said Slovakia did all it could to meet specific obligations it had accepted on joining the Council of Europe.
