He said that "we are not for the division of the world into huge commercial blocs," and that, consequently, this trend should not be fomented. According to Figueroa, experience shows that markets are subject to "up and down cycles," and that no clear, marked trend has emerged in either direction so far. In this regard, he recalled that the universalist strategy defined for the development of the export sector, in addition to being more efficient from an economic point of view, has the advantage of reducing the country's economic vulnerability. In this regard, he noted that the fight against protectionism is one of the axes of Chilean foreign policy. Figueroa said the emphasis on unilateral economic liberalization "made us more competitive and played a decisive role in our joining the international community." He said, however, this policy does not exclude supplementary efforts to open new markets. Diplomacy for Development In another speech he delivered on 14 March, Figueroa outlined his portfolio's role in this phase. He emphasized that Chilean foreign policy should attach priority "to diplomacy for development." The foreign minister said this policy provides for external action, which is not undertaken because of "mere goodwill" but "as a function of Chilean interest." He added that foreign policy must accompany the country's development process, emphasizing that the internationalization of the economy calls for the Foreign Ministry's support in coordination with the other ministries. "It would be absurd and even self-defeating if we demand a monopoly of the country's external action." Agreements In another speech during the entrepreneurs' meeting, Figueroa reiterated that Chile's unilateral strategy should be supplemented with "progress in multilateral and bilateral negotiations." He said that even though the Uruguay GATT talks has been a significant step forward, "we are not fully satisfied with its results." In this regard, he emphasized that the policy of "multiple insertion" that the Foreign Ministry is proposing will have a priority area in Latin America and will seek to develop close ties with Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and "take advantage of the potential of existing agreements." Figueroa added that for the same reason, they "enthusiastically welcome" the U.S. Administration's interest in negotiating a free trade agreement. He also emphasized that Chile became an APEC (Economic Cooperation in Pacific Asia) member this year, highlighting that it is one of the most innovative aspects of Chilean foreign policy. He also mentioned Chile's interest in strengthening its relations with the European Union. Finally, he underlined the role that Chile can play as a supplier of services and as the entryway to Latin American markets, based on "the network of our relations with our neighbors and our free trade agreements," also highlighting the role as a port of access to the Pacific Ocean that Chile can play with respect to other Latin American economies.
