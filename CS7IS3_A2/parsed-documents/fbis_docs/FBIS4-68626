The share of non-state property increased in all branches of the national economy; and the share of production (services) by non-state enterprises also increased. Certain data on the activity of non-state enterprises are presented in the table. The particular characteristic of privatization in 1993 in industry was the transition of several hundred large and middle sized enterprises to the non-state form of property; this is shown by the rapid growth of the share of industrial production by non-state enterprises, from 17 to 29 percent. In construction, non-state enterprises increased their share in the total number of enterprises, and in the scale of production. It is expected that in 1994, the share of construction and repair work carried out by non-state enterprises will exceed the work carried out by state enterprises. In retail trade, the share of non-state enterprises has reached 60 percent. Now the task is to unify small state enterprises into commercial companies, and trading houses, to create a wholesale chain for private commerce, for the intensification of the interregional exchange of goods in Ukraine, to improve the activity of the commodity exchanges, and to introduce the changes in legislation necessary for their activity. The number of joint ventures in Ukraine is rapidly increasing; at the end of 1993, they reached 2,530, and continue to grow, despite the statements about the supposed worsening of the conditions for their activity as a result of the curtailing of certain untenable benefits. The amount of privatized state housing is steadily increasing. At the end of 1993, more than 900,000 apartments had been privatized by citizens. The farmers' movement in Ukraine is gaining strength. More than 27,700 farms have already been created; 558,200 hectares of land have been allotted to their use, of which 504,600 hectares are arable. The farmers are experiencing great difficulties because of the absence of targeted credits from the state, the absence of specialized technology, and of other means of production. Privatization by initiative from the enterprises themselves, from their labor collectives, has proceed in the most organized way. After the change in the form of property, such enterprises work stabilely, and use internal reserves for resolving production and financial problems. The basic economic obstacles to the process of the transfer of the property of state enterprises to non-state forms of property are the serious financial situations of the majority of state enterprises; their indebtedness to other enterprises of Ukraine, to banks, and to enterprises of other states increased by the end of the year to 127 trillion karbovantsi, which is almost twice their claims on their own debtors. Thus, for every employee, the state enterprises have an average of more than five trillion karbovantsi of pure debt. This significantly limits the possibilities of their activity, and the transition to leasing and auctioning. The second most important factor making the privatization of enterprises more difficult was the great number of normative acts, which mostly do not correspond to the laws of Ukraine on privatization, and which were published by agencies of the executive branch, with the goal of hindering privatization; as well as similar decisions by government structures concerning particular facilities, when initiatives for privatization appeared. This shows that officeholders in government structures do not sufficiently understand the great political significance of the process of privatization, as an important economic means for increasing the effective utilization of the national wealth of Ukraine, which was created by the hard work of several generations of our nation; of the transfer of property into the diligent hands of owners, who will increase it and preserve it from being stolen and ruined, and will utilize property for the profit of our national and the Ukrainian state.
