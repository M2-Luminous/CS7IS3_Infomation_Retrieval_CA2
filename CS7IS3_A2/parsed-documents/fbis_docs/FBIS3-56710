According to him, the $220 Mn contract signed with the former USSR remains virtually the same amount, even though Moscow had to give up the supplies of booster technologies stipulated in the contract. According to Koptev, Russia agreed to shoulder some of the commitments connected with India's space program. For instance, it is prepared to supply cryogen boosters (i.e. the last stage of the booster rocket) for India's Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicles. In addition, Russia has signed a contract worth $28 Mn for the production and supply of equipment to service cryogen booster systems.
