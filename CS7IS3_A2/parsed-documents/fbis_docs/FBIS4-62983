Laar told the news conference that he had asked the cabinet members about the vote, but nobody had wanted to raise the issue. Laar did admit that "some politicians" have a desire to reorganise the government, but he described it as a demolition, rather than rearrangement of the cabinet. "I would not dare to term it a press speculation, since the matter was too serious," Laar told the conference. He called for the dissatisfied "Fatherland"-appointed ministers to discuss their objections with the ruling coalition factions. The "Fatherland" faction made a statement yesterday declaring that any attempts to force the premier to resign would cause great political harm to Estonia in the present situation. A cabinet session will be held today, according to Social Minister Marju Lauristin. She declined from elaborating on the agenda of the session.
