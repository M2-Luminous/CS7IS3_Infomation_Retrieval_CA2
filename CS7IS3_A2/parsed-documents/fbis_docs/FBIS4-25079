In a national conference on comprehensive agricultural development, Chen stressed the importance of agriculture in coastal provinces. He warned officials from the coastal areas, "the consequences would be dangerous if the secondary and service industries are developed at the sacrifice of agriculture." A task of key importance for China is to adopt measures to make optimal use of land resources so as to ensure the steady and sustainable supply of farm products, he said. To do so, he said, local governments should intensify their efforts in improving the country's 57 million hectares of low-yield farmland which is a potential food basket. According to Chen, China has already improved nearly 10 million hectares of low-yield land and reclaimed another 1.1 million hectares of waste land in the five years from 1988 to 1993. The key to further efforts in this respect lies in the construction of irrigation projects, extension of fine seeds and development of new cultivating techniques, he said. Chen also urged local governments to fortify sandy land to make it productive. He told the officials present that China has about 67 million hectares of sandy wasteland. "It would produce considerable social and ecological benefits if we could develop just ten percent of this land in ten years," he said. Meanwhile, he called on local governments to develop tidal zones and reclaim land by enclosing sea beaches. Chen said China's coastal provinces have a total of 1.3 million hectares of tidal flats which can be reclaimed. "Economic results would be enormous if we could turn half of this area into arable land," the state councillor added. In the conference, Chen lauded the efforts by Liaoning, a major industrial province in China's northeast, to provide ample food for its people. According to the state councillor, Liaoning used to rely on other provinces for supplies of grain and major foodstuffs. However, the province doesn't have to transport grain from other provinces anymore as it has boosted its grain output to 15 billion kg since 1990. The province now boasts of surplus supplies in domestic poultry, eggs, milk, meat and vegetables. "Liaoning Province has set us an example to attain coordinated development in the first, second and third industries for other coastal areas," he said.
