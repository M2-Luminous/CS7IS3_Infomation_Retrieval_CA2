The "Equal Rights and Legality" electoral bloc, comprising seven democratically oriented parties and movements, is showing the greatest initiative. The newspaper IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA reports that the bloc determined its list of candidate deputies to the Russian Parliament at a routine session. They include political scientist Vladimir Belyayev and Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Deputy Valentin Mikhaylov. They gained the greatest number of votes in December's election. Senior Lecturer at Kazan University Aleksandr Shtanin is being nominated from "Russia's Choice," and Rayon Soviet worker Yuriy Rostovshchikov from the "Yabloko" bloc. In the meantime, the newspaper comments, the opposition has also become active. The "Defense for the Tatarstan President" committee has examined the question of "whether it is expedient to conduct Russian elections on the territory of the sovereign Republic of Tatarstan." It came to the conclusion: "Elections to the Russian Parliament should not take place in Tatarstan as the republic did not sign the Federation Treaty. What is more, it has its own Constitution."
