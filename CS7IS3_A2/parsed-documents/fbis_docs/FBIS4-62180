Reports of Russian Generosity Were Exaggerated"] [Text] It has not been ruled out that a small portion of Syria's debts to the Soviet Union, which have now been inherited by Russia, will be written off. A Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations staffer refused to be drawn on how far Moscow's generosity would extend while negotiations are still in progress. Some Arab newspapers have been quick to report that an agreement was signed during the visit to Damascus by Russian First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets and that Russia canceled 90 percent of Syria's debts. Yuriy Mikhaylov, advisor to the vice premier, who was in the delegation along with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, has stated that no agreement on debt was reached, although there are high hopes of resolving the problem this year. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations staffer reported that the exact total of Syria's debts is in the order of $11 billion. Of this total, almost $4 billion are overdue payments. Moreover, the USSR gave Syria a total of $205 million in freely convertible currency. The rest is composed of ruble loans, mainly to acquire arms and military equipment in the USSR, and also interest. Damascus has in fact been pressing for the bulk of the debt -- which has emerged as the result of unproductive spending on military purposes -- to be written off, for repayment conditions to be relaxed, and first and foremost for the right to pay in installments over 20 years. Moscow favors the fulfillment of the contractual obligations relating to every loan and the repayment of the debt by 2005, at least with regard to the foreign currency loans. It is envisaged that the remaining amount will be paid off by deliveries of commodities (Syria has approximately 70 commodity categories which are in demand on world markets), by financing Russian institutions in Syria, and also via reinvestment in the local economy. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations is convinced of Syria's creditworthiness. Before the collapse of the transaction clearing system, when Russia stopped meeting its commitments, Damascus was punctually paying off 400-500 million clearing rubles a year in order to cancel its debts. By 1994 Syria had paid back a total of $5.2 billion. Its present financial and economic well-being is not causing any concern to specialists, and it is undoubtedly a major trading partner of ours. Following the cooling of relations between the USSR and Egypt, Syria remained Moscow's only strategic partner in the Near East. Russia intends to preserve this special relationship. Political factors, and also the bid price (going rate) of Syrian debt on the world debt market will be taken into account in determining the percentage of the debt to be written off, if indeed things reach that stage, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations staffer said. In any case we are only talking about fairly insignificant sums and certainly not 90 percent of the debt. This concession, the ministry claims, does not create a dangerous precedent for debt negotiations with other countries.
