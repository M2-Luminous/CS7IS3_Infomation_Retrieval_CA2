Attending the meeting of the Asia-Pacific sister cities exchange are a total of 60 representatives from cities in 14 foreign countries and 15 Japanese municipal governments, organizers said. Under the sponsorship of the Home Affairs Ministry and the Foreign Ministry, the convention aims to provide a forum for the sister city authorities to discuss matters of mutual concern and to foster closer ties. This is the second such Asia-Pacific exchange, organizers said. The morning was taken up by the executive committee session but subcommittee meetings in the afternoon planned to discuss two issues -- ``economic activity and the role of self-governing bodies'' and ``developing consideration for the environment.'' From Thursday the Japanese cities represented will host the delegates from their respective sister cities and the visit will culminate in a concluding session next Monday in Tokyo.
