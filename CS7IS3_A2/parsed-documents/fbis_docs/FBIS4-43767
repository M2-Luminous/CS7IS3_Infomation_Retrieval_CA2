In view of the fact that the matter is a topical issue, we have decided to focus on "how and when the question of Hammer Force began and what was said on the matter at the time." I discovered an interesting report when I studied the documents, a report that has been overlooked for one reason or another. It said that the Council of Ministers has agreed that "Turkey should assign a contingent of troops to the military force, which will be established within the CSCE framework and based in Erzurum to prevent the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan." That shows that the Turkish Government has decided to open our country's door to a multinational force before sending off the one that is already based on our territory. Let us recall a basic point: A foreign military unit in any country will take away something from that country's independence, honor, and esteem. That will not change even if the presence of that military unit is called for by the host country. The invitation a country extends to a foreign military unit will automatically give it the right to express its opinion on that country's affairs and problems and even interfere in its activities. Therefore, what is important for a country is "not to be in a position to have to call for the deployment of a foreign military unit in its territory." In view of that, it is difficult to understand why Turkish officials have agreed to the deployment of a multinational force in Turkey for one reason or another when the problem of the Hammer Force has not yet been resolved. It is common knowledge that the reason Hammer Force has been deployed in Turkey is still vague. Furthermore, the activities and objectives of that force are debatable. Before we say anything else, we wish to ask the following: What has happened that our Western allies have decided to take action on the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan when they failed to act against the violation of the UN Charter and the CSCE principles in Bosnia and condoned the Armenian attacks against Azerbaijan for a very long time? Is it a coincidence that the two problems, which have prompted them to agree to dispatch military units to Turkey, are linked to matters that were upheld by the Sevres Agreement but rejected by the Lausanne Agreement in the past? The plan to give part of Turkey's territory to the State of Armenia was in line with the spirit of the Sevres Agreement. That approach was rejected by the Lausanne Agreement. Let us return to the question of Hammer Force. It is common knowledge that Hammer Force is former President Turgut Ozal's legacy. He is the person who advised former President Bush on the deployment of an international military force in Turkey to prevent Saddam Husayn from oppressing the Kurds in northern Iraq. Ozal is the person to be blamed for the problem that military force has caused to Turkey. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that Ozal advised the U.S. officials to put pressure on the Turkish Government before the TGNA debated the extension of the Hammer Force mandate. The newspapers reported that on 2 May 1992. Preparations were made for the deployment of Hammer Force in Turkey in July 1991. With a view to convincing the Turkish public of the necessity of that force, the then Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said: "A decision has been adopted to the effect that Hammer Force should seek the approval of the Turkish Government for a cross-border operation." We wish to ask the following: Aside from Hammer Force seeking the Turkish Government's approval for its cross-border activities, has anyone heard or read a report that it has informed Turkey on any one of its numerous operations in northern Iraq so far? Do you realize what that means? It means that there is no way for Ankara to be aware of a move by Hammer Force which may create a war between Turkey and Iraq. Do you realize the threat behind that state of affairs? Furthermore, it is common knowledge that a number of officials stressed in the past that "Hammer Force can be withdrawn from Turkey in three months and the Turkish Government will be careful not to allow the presence of that force to set an example in the long run." The government's decision to "allow the deployment of an international CSCE force in Erzurum for the obstruction of the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan" has proved that the officials lied in the past.
