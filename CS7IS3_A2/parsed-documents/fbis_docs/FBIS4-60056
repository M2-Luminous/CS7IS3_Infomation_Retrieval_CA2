Our information confirms that the value of the weapons that have entered Yemen recently totals $1 billion and that these weapons have flowed into Yemen from various U.S., European, and Israeli arms companies. The reports say that Israel exploited the complications of the Yemeni crisis and shipped these weapons to Yemen via several African countires, including Uganda and Zaire. Reports also say that there are secret alliances between certain Yemeni tribes and Israeli military personnel stationed in these African countries. The reports add that an Israeli military committee left for a tour of these countries early in February where they met with Yemeni tribal leaders. Under an agreement reached between the two parties, these Yemeni figures became responsible for shipping the arms to Yemen across Yemeni borders with certain Arab countries. The reports say that $2.1 billion has flowed into Yemen from abroad with the aim of consolidating the division. The reports affirm that the Pledge and Accord Document which was signed in Amman on 20 February raised deep concern among foreign circles opposed to Yemeni unity. The Israeli Cabinet studied the Document on 28 February and realized that it augers well for Yemeni unity. They therefore considered that it posed a danger to Israeli security in the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa and that Yemeni unity might affect Israeli movements in the Red Sea littoral countries in Africa.
