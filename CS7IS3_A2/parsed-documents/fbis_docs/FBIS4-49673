Tian, who is leading an NPC delegation now on a visit to Australia, described his visit to the four South-Pacific nations as a "successful, satisfactory and fruitful one." In an interview with the Chinese reporters based in Australia here today, Tian said there is no fundamental conflict of interests between the four countries and China, and on the contrary, they share many common interests. "To keep peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, to make the pace of each country's development more faster and to make the life of their people better" are the common desires of China and these countries, Tian stressed. Tian said both Australia and New Zealand believed that "we bear the important and historic responsibilities for safeguarding peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region." On the prospect for cooperation between China and the four nations, Tian said that the economies of both China and the four nations have strong complements and the potential is great for furthering economic and trade cooperation. He mentioned particularly the considerable potential of cooperation between China and both Australia and New Zealand. He cited as an example the husbandry industry of New Zealand, which he said has unique strong points in improving the grassland and the breed of ox and sheep. Tian also talked of the rich resources that Australia boasts, saying that China has a considerable demand for resources as China is striving for achieving its goal of modernization. He stressed that as China is on its way towards modernization, "China should not only expand its markets in the world, but also find resources markets outside the country." Tian believed that China, while paying attention to the markets in Europe, America and Japan, "must attach importance to the South-Pacific region." "There is much room for China to manoeuver in expanding trade and cooperation in the region," he added. Pointing to the importance of parliamentary diplomacy, Tian said, "to do a good job in this regard can play a major role in increasing friendship and cooperation between China and the countries in the world." During his visit to the four nations, Tian met leaders of the parliaments and governments, had extensive contacts with the parliamentarians and exchanged views with the figures from the industrial and business circles on furthering bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Tian left here for Brisbane this afternoon to continue his visit in Australia, the last leg of his four-nation tour.
