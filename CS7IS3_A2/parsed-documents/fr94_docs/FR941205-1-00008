FR941205-1-00008 FR941205-1-00003 12 CFR Part 563 [No. 94&hyph;245] RIN 1550&hyph;AA72 Capital Distributions AGENCY: Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) proposes to amend its capital distributions regulation to conform to the system of prompt corrective action (PCA) established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) and by implementing regulations adopted by the OTS and the other federal banking agencies. The proposed regulation incorporates the PCA definition of capital distributions. Under the proposal, a savings association that is not held by a savings and loan holding company and that has a composite CAMEL rating of ``1'' or ``2'' need not notify the OTS before making a capital distribution. Other savings associations that will remain at least adequately capitalized after making a capital distribution would be required to provide notice to the OTS. ``Troubled'' associations and undercapitalized associations may make capital distributions only by filing an application and receiving OTS approval. Such applications may be approved only under certain limited conditions. The proposed regulation defines ``troubled condition'' as a function of a savings association's composite examination rating, its capital condition, or on the basis of supervisory directives issued, or ``troubled condition'' designation made, by the OTS. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 3, 1995.
