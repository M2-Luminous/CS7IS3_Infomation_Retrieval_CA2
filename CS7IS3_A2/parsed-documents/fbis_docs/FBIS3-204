This was disclosed by Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana at the end of yet another meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC]. He said the government's decision is designed to speed up the peace process and enable soldiers to leave assembly areas. The simultaneous demobilization of troops of both sides should have started on 22 February, but Renamo was late in submitting the list of its troops. Raul Domingos, head of Renamo's delegation to the CSC, said the government's decision to unilaterally begin confining [as heard] its troops was worrisome. Raul Domingos said the two sides should operate within the parameters of the General Peace Accord so as to prevent mistrust. He said the delay in demobilizing Renamo troops was due to technical problems.
