Mr. Claes, after meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, stated: "As long as the Kurdish organizations respect the rules of democracy in Belgium, we will not ban them." Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin had implicitly criticized Belgium for allowing groups close to the PKK to operate on its territory while they are banned in France and Germany. Mr. Claes further explained: "We doubt considerably the effectiveness of a ban insofar as when you ban one organization this immediately leads to the creation of another sister organization going under a different name or even drives the organization underground."
