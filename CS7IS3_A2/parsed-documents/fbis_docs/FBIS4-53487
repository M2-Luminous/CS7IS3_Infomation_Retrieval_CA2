The agreement came at a meeting of party floor leaders at the National Assembly Tuesday morning. The assembly is expected to begin the probe right after it approves investigation plans at an extraordinary session to be convened on Saturday. The accord was the product of a rare compromise worked out between the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP), both of which were well aware of the public's critical eye on the Sangmudae scam. The scandal involves a medium-sized construction company which received a multibillion won contract from the Defense Ministry to move a military facility called Sangmudae in Kwangju to the outskirts of the city. The DP alleges that the president of the company siphoned part of the project's profits into a slush fund, which eventually found its way into the ruling circle and was used as campaign expenses during the 1992 presidential election. The opposition party has demanded that the National Assembly invoke its right to investigate national affairs and find out how the alleged slush fund was used and by whom. The DLP and DP have been bickering for a month over who should be called as witnesses. The DP finally gave in and agreed with the DLP to limit the number of witnesses to 30, as the ruling party insisted. The opposition party also agreed not to include current and former presidents as witnesses. As for the probe's length, the two parties had originally agreed that it would last 20 days. The DP demanded that 20 more days be added, however, and the ruling party apparently gave in as a compromise for the issue of witnesses. In addition, the two sides agreed to trace the whereabouts of checks totaling 27.7 billion won that had allegedly been used by the construction company's president, Cho Ki-hyon. There is no denying that for ruling party officials, the proposed investigation of the Sangmudae scam is an irksome undertaking, even though the scandal allegedly took place during the administration of Former President No Tae-u. A parliamentary investigation into the scam would expose many old as well as new members of the ruling party. Consequently, the DLP is expected to minimize the effects of the investigation as much as possible. The Defense Ministry and the prosecution have already undertaken separate, thorough investigations into the scam. The ruling party is thus insisting that a parliamentary probe would reveal little else. Everything that could possibily be known by authorities is already known, and some other aspects alleged by the opposition party have been rejected by the prosecution due to a lack of hard evidence. What worries the ruling party, therefore, is the possibility that the opposition party will launch a political offensive during the parliamentary investigation, although the DP has already agreed not to call the present and former presidents and lawmakers as witnesses. Both the ruling and opposition parties would face severe criticism if the upcoming probe failed to produce any substantial results since the DP has managed to plant deep suspicion among ordinary citizens through its unsubstantiated allegations.
