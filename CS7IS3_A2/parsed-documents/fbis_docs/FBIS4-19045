In a poll conducted by HANDELSBLATT, the Ifo Institute [Institute for Economic Research] in Munich said that the GATT agreement can make only a partial contribution to containing protectionism. The decisive thing is, much rather, that the individual states combat unemployment and ensure the reduction of foreign trade imbalances. The IfW [Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research] stressed that the agreement can stand up to protectionism only if it is possible to punish the most important parties to the agreement, above all the European Union [EU] and the United States, with tangible sanctions in the case of proven violations of the agreement and to prevent them from one-sidedly implementing bilateral measures. The Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) points to the weak sanction mechanisms of GATT. The DIW [German Economic Research Institute], Berlin, is more optimistic about the chances of GATT holding its own against growing protectionism. The HWWA [Hamburg Economic Research Institute] fears that the new WTO will be overstrained by the comprehensive inclusion of global environmental issues. The results of the Uruguay Round should be urgently consolidated and expanded. Industry is willing to support the government with all its strength. The Uruguay Round topics that are still open should be settled as soon as possible by means of further negotiations, and the work to establish a functioning WTO should be tackled. This demand is made by the employers' associations of the United States, Japan, and the European Union with a common appeal addressed to the GATT ministers' conference in Marrakesh. Everything should be done to ratify the new GATT agreements by the end of 1994 so that they can be implemented at the beginning of 1995. UNICE [Union of EC Industries], Kaidaren, the U.S. Chambers of Commerce, the U.S. Council for International Business, and the National Association of Manufacturers welcome the fact that great progress has been made in the field of agriculture and with the full inclusion of services, of intellectual property, and of direct investments in the GATT discipline. The employers assume that further abolition of customs duties and trade obstacles will lead to a strong expansion of world trade. In addition, discrimination and protectionism will be prevented by stricter rules. Finally, with the WTO, an organization is established that can, in the future, contribute effectively to stabilizing world trade and to settling conflicts that have developed. Violations of the spirit and letter of free world trade are made considerably more difficult.
