One of the areas hardest hit has been Muisne which, after having had 3,500 hectares of mangrove swamps, is left with only 20 percent of that total. People from the island have made serious charges of illegal tree felling and fraudulent concessions to shrimp-breeding establishments. The mangrove swamp is disappearing, and nearly 2,000 users, such as scallop and crab fishermen and charcoal makers, are being hurt directly. During the canoe trip that we took last week through the Muisne area, Nisbaldo Ortiz never stopped raising his hand to point to the sites where shrimp pools have supplanted what had previously been a mangrove swamp. We were accompanied by members of ecological groups, some settlers, and authorities from the Ecuadoran Natural Areas and Wildlife Forest Institute (INEFAN). Nisbaldo is a young native of Muisne who has become the leader of the community's own mangrove swamp defense movement. Tired of complaining and appealing to the authorities to stop the illegal felling of mangrove trees, the community residents decided to create the Ecological Defense Foundation. It has its own surveillance committee to make constant checks of the area, so as to catch those felling the trees and attempt to stop them. Despite the surveillance goals and action, what the community has been able to accomplish is very little or nothing. This is readily discernible, because shrimp-breeding establishments show up everywhere in this area. Some appear camouflaged. Anyone travelling along the Muisne River and viewing its shores, apparently filled with mangrove trees, would have every reason to think that the mangrove swamps are intact. However, one need only enter them a short distance to find the large shrimp-breeding pools. The Muisne residents estimate that there must be about 250 shrimp-breeding establishments in the area, some small and others covering many hectares. Added to this are the large expanses of now infertile mangrove land, which was once used for shrimp breeding and never reforested. The original size of the local mangrove swamp on Muisne Island was 3,500 hectares, and now the largest remaining areas, between the localities of Bunche and Mompiche, measure 716 hectares. In other words, approximately 80 percent of the mangrove swamps have been destroyed. The tree felling boom began in 1987, upon completion of the paved road leading to Nuevo Muisne, situated opposite the island. With the start of the indiscriminate tree cutting, the shrimp boom also began in the area. Besides the threat to nature entailed by the disappearance of the mangrove swamp, large groups of humans, such as scallop, crab, and other fishermen, larvae collectors, and charcoal makers, are being hurt by the shortage of products and the deterioration in their way of life. Seven communities and six districts, located between Bunche and San Gregorio, in Muisne Canton, with approximately 1,680 inhabitants, have been forced to seek their catch far from the area, or to change their mode of living. Simon Vega, aged 30, claims to have been catching scallops and crab in the mangrove swamp all his life. Now, he also has a tricycle of the type used on the island to carry tourists to the beach, ``because if I did not have another job I could not support my family. In the past, I used to catch from 300 to 400 scallops in two or three hours. Now, working almost all day, I can barely collect 40 or 50, and I earn only 4,000 sucres from that.'' However, the problem is not merely a financial one. Simon adds that anyone entering the mangrove swamp does so risking his life. ``They do not even let us approach the shrimp breeders' shores. If you go in too far, they shoot you. One day they shot and wounded my mother, who is 60 years old and also fishes for scallops.'' Lourdes Proano, secretary of the canton's Civic Board, who is also fighting to defend the mangrove swamp, claims that the situation has worsened, particularly for poor families and women, most of whom are engaged in scallop fishing. ``While they are destroying the livelihood of the people here, the shrimp breeders have not generated sources of employment for the residents, because most of the people they hire are from other places.'' Charges The Muisne mangrove swamps were one of the best reserves in the country. The largest one now is the reserve located in the northern part of Esmeraldas, between Limones and San Lorenzo, with approximately 40,000 hectares. However, 15 percent has been devastated by the shrimp breeders' intervention. In 1986, the mangrove swamps were declared protective woods by law; hence, felling them is illegal. So, what is the explanation for the shrimp-breeding establishments' presence in the mangrove swamps? The members of Muisne's Ecological Defense Foundation show us a considerable number of charges that they have brought to the local and national authorities, who have not adopted any measures to deal with them. The Muisne residents admit that they are not optimistic about the type of action taken by the authorities. They inspect at a given time, halting the work that is being done on the shrimp pools. ``On those occasions, they stop everything, but the work is continued afterward, because the financial pressures are much stronger,'' remarks Lourdes Proano. Nisbaldo Ortiz adds: ``On the other hand, a genuine black market for the sale of mangrove woods has become legitimized. Through it, the businessmen learn that they must first cut or destroy the mangrove swamps, and then request the concession. The local authorities' action has been very slight, and they act only when pressured.'' Since 1989, the foundation has reported 37 cases of mangrove felling, only four of which have been handled properly. A report from that institution states: ``Nearly all the violators were reported on time, when they had just begun cutting or sawing mangrove thickets. Yet the vast majority managed to complete their shrimp pools, because the competent authorities failed to do their duty by stopping them permanently, confiscating tools, punishing the guilty ones, and forcing them to repair the damage they had caused. On the contrary, the collusion of bureaucrats on all levels in failing to take action is obvious.'' The charges in each case are detailed. They note, chronologically, how the cutting occurred; and, insofar as land ownership certificates are concerned, they indicate that the majority of shrimp-breeding establishments have fraudulent ministerial decrees. They also charge that, in both the Muisne area and northern Esmeraldas, the IERAC [Ecuadoran Institute of Agrarian Reform and Settlement], in a clear violation of the Forest and Wildlife Law, is granting permits and concessions to private individuals in extensive mangrove swamp areas. Lack of Institutional Coordination Institutions such as the Merchant Marine, the Undersecretariat of Fisheries, the Coastal Resources Management Program, and the INEFAN are supposed to oversee the proper operation of shrimp-breeding establishments. Luis Valverde, national forest director, declares: ``There is, however, no order; rather, they just come and cut trees. The Merchant Marine is the one responsible for beaches and bays; it should come and put them in jail. But, in fact, this does not occur. Almost none of the certificates issued for forming shrimp-breeding establishments have been authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture through the INEFAN, at least so long as I have held this position.'' So, what is the explanation for the shrimp breeding establishments' unauthorized presence? ``Because there is big capital here; this is achieved with banknotes here.'' ``Furthermore, the INEFAN is responsible only for the trees. So, when they are already cut, we have to apply the law stating that the fine is from one to 10 minimum living wages. The forest law does not call for criminal type action. So, I think that the only way to stop the felling is to heighten the awareness of the citizens. Shrimp exports are the third-ranking item in the nation's economy; and so, these are very powerful people. It is not that we oppose the shrimp breeders' establishments or the nation's progress. They could be started, but in the upper part of the mangrove swamp, not in the swamp itself.'' This is Valverde's response. By law, it is determined that the Merchant Marine has control over the beach and bay areas, and that the INEFAN can take action only in areas declared protective woods. Thus, in one way or another, the control of the mangrove swamps depends on these two institutions. Moreover, the Constitution of the Republic specifies that no institution may become involved in another's activities. With this situation, Jorge Barba, director of the INEFAN, claims that the advantage of the institute headed by him is that the INEFAN law stipulates that it must concern itself with all the marginal land not being used for agriculture or livestock raising, such as the mangrove swamps. ``This has enabled us to accomplish some work; and, for cases such as these, the Commission for Environmental Affairs has been created.'' Barba adds that, since the INEFAN has just been created, plans and maps are yet to be made for this area, so as to study the problems in detail. ``We are just now meeting with representatives of the World Bank, and we shall request $60 million for the renewable resources sector. We also intend to meet with the owners of the shrimp breeding establishments, so that, instead of being enemies, we can work together.'' The National Campaign for Defense of the Mangrove Swamps and the South American Mangrove System charged that the national forest director, through an official memorandum dated 31 August of this year, set a price per pilot and per hectare of mangrove trees, thereby legitimizing their destruction. When Barba was asked about this, he commented: ``We must give the mangrove tree a value, in any case, whether it is cut with or without a permit: we have to collect. It is not a sin to cut a mangrove tree; the sin lies in its being cut without many more being planted. So, the problem is not in setting a value for it, but rather in undervaluing it.'' Use Without Destruction Good management of resources seeks a break-even point that will enable people today to meet their needs without denying opportunity to future generations. The mangrove swamp has done the country much good; but it cannot stand there untouched, either. It must be used, but without being destroyed. This statement was made by Washington Macias, director of the Pedro Vicente Maldonado Foundation which, together with the Coastal Resources Management Program (PMRC), has a management plan for the Muisne area, among others in the country. Macias adds that the break-even point in a mangrove swamp is reached when more than 75 percent of its trees are felled. The Pedro Vicente Maldonado Foundation, jointly with the PMRC, is working on the process of mangrove tree regeneration. As Macias indicates, this means that some mangrove tree users could make use of part of their hectares alternately. For example, if they use 20 for making charcoal, immediately harvesting it, and do the same thing, consecutively, with the other hectares, when they reach 200 hectares the first 320 would already have been regenerated. He remarks: ``We must see to it that the communities have direct access to the mangrove swamp for activities that are not devastating, but, rather, productive, such as tourism.'' ``In Venezuela, for example, in all their soap operas they show the Margarita mangrove swamps: which are rather insignificant from a scenic standpoint when compared with the mangrove swamps extending from Puerto Bolivar to Jambeli.'' This claim is made by Macias, who adds that, ``if concessions have been made to shrimp breeding establishments in mangrove areas, it is because the law itself is inadequate. Hence, there must be a heightened awareness among the shrimp breeders.'' For the present, the Muisne residents have begun establishing a new strategy for themselves: speaking directly to the shrimp breeders. ``We think that they sometimes cut down mangrove trees without realizing what they could be causing. We want to enter into a joint system with them to save our mangrove swamps.'' Nevertheless, they will demand, officially, that the State Comptroller General's Office form a committee to audit the management of the public institutions that have granted concessions to shrimp breeders since the date when the country's mangrove swamps were declared protective woods. [Box, p 12] Particular Features of the Ecosystem The mangrove swamp is the perfect habitat for scallops, crabs, and crayfish, because it produces the detritus that is the food for these species. It is produced when the mangrove tree dumps tons of dead foliage into the water. The mangrove swamp is a natural element to protect against downpours and to prevent flooding in nearby towns and land. It prevents the winds blowing from the sea inland from salinizing agricultural land. Generally, since mangrove trees do not have one large root, but rather are entangled with one another, when they are cut, even though it be only one tree, there is a danger that the others will fall. The tree produces pilots, and the bark on the branches is useful for making a tanning substance. Other major users of the mangrove swamp are the charcoal makers.
