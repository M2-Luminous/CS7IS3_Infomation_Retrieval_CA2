He told MENA that he and the Palestinian delegation will leave for Tunis Sunday morning to meet with the Palestinian leadership under the chairmanship of president 'Arafat to decide on a response to the U.S. President's invitation. What matters is not the venue of the talks, he said; the talks in Egypt, both in Cairo or Taba, were going very well, and Egypt is providing all possible support, Sha'th explained. The issue is not where we negotiate but what we negotiate, he said. He urged international protection for the Palestinian people in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles reached in Oslo. Dr. Sha'th accused the Israeli Army of colluding with the Israeli settlers who carried out the criminal massacre and the horrible killings in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn yesterday. Without genuine protection against the Israeli settlers, the Palestinian people will face daily massacres, he said. These criminal acts, Sha'th added, cannot be perpetrated by individuals. He noted the bad emotional climate and the collusion of the Israeli Army with the perpetrators of massacres. Sha'th wondered where the Israeli Army was, which usually fills the plazas of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that the Palestinians pray daily in the mosque under the guns of the Israelis. Where was the Israeli Army at the time of the massacre, he wondered. Sha'th stressed that eight worshipers were killed by Israeli Army gunfire at the mosque's entrance while trying to leave. Sha'th stressed the need for reconsidering the form, method, and demands of the Israeli negotiators. He pointed out that two-thirds of the draft security agreement worked out during the talks in Cairo and Taba deal with Israeli demands for the protection of settlers. It is the Palestinian people that really need protection, he stressed. Sha'th said: We demand international protection for the Palestinian people, because this is part of the Oslo agreement, and Israel cannot reject it. He noted that Israel has so far been procrastinating in accepting such protection. Concluding, Sha'th stressed that the next Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will mainly focus on international protection for the Palestinian people so that the criminal massacre and the horrible killings will not recur.
