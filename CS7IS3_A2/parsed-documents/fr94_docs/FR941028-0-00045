FR941028-0-00045 FR941028-0-00009 OSMRE disagree[s] with the commenter's position. Although the statute of limitations may provide a defense to suit for collection of money filed five years following the entry of a final order, it does not invalidate the final order or cancel the underlying debt, which will continue to be listed in the Applicant Violator System and will result in blocking the issuance of a permit. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38884 (October 3, 1988). The agency considers this position to be sound and has no intention of changing course. Accordingly, this criticism of the proposed definition is rejected. A number of commenters representing industry interests asserted that the definition of violation contained in the rule was overbroad in that it potentially included violations of laws other than SMCRA as the basis for permit denial. These commenters proposed that the rule incorporate explicit limitations to the effect that only violations relevant to SMCRA or consistent with the environmental protection standards of SMCRA be the basis for permit denial. OSM rejects the commenters' proposals as unnecessary. To the extent that the final definition of ``violation notice'' describes the type of violation for which the listed types of notice will be provided, the final rule is intended to track the language of section 510(c) of the Act. That provision of the Act states that the basis for permit denial includes violations of the Act ``and any law, rule or regulation of the United States, or of any department or agency in the United States pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred by the applicant in connection with any surface coal mining operation *␣*␣*'' (Emphasis added.) Commenters' concerns are already addressed by the Act and the proposed and final definitions of ``violation notice'' which incorporate the above-emphasized language of the Act. This language requires that violations which support permit denial must be those pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred in connection with any surface coal mining operation. Any air or water environmental protection violations incurred in connection with a surface coal mining operation would be of a type ``relevant to SMCRA.'' If the violations are committed not in connection with a surface coal mining operation, they would not be a basis for the denial of a permit under section 510(c) of the Act. Thus, OSM does not believe that a change in the proposed rule language to reflect commenters' concern is needed. A commenter representing certain State regulatory authorities also criticized the proposed definition of ``violation notice'' as being too broad and was concerned that such definition, when read with the provisions of 30 CFR 778.14(c), would lead to ``nationwide gridlock'' or undue delay in State regulatory authorities' processing of permit applications. The proposed definition of ``violation notice'' is designed to incorporate the full range of violations which would form the basis for permit denial under section 510(c) of SMCRA. The definition is intended to implement the statutory definition, not expand such definition. A more limited definition would be an impermissible constraint upon the broad language of the Act. Accordingly, OSM rejects the view that the proposed definition is overbroad. OSM further disagrees with commenter's view that applicants' reporting of such violation notices in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 778.14(c) will lead to undue delay in the processing of permit applications. Applicants must supply complete information with respect to outstanding violations to enable regulatory authorities to make informed decisions as to permit issuance as mandated by section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The reporting of such information by an applicant may, indeed, lead to permit denial. That, however, constitutes with the mandates of the Act, not inappropriate delay or stalemate. OSM is confident that OSM and Sate regulatory authorities can evaluate and use the information provided by applicants with respect to outstanding violations in accordance with the definitions of ``violation'' and ``violation notice'' along with information contained in AVS to meet the requirements of the Act in a timely fashion. The same commenter additionally urged that OSM retain the limited definition of ``violation notice'' previously contained in 30 CFR 701.5 because such definition is more ``realistic'' in its scope and because there is a need for such a definition across OSM's regulations, not just those contained in 30 CFR part 773.
