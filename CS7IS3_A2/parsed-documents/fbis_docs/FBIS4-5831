FBIS4-5831 "dreas072_j_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-072 Daily Report 11 Feb 1994 Indonesia *President, Foreign Minister on Nonaligned Movement *President, Foreign Minister on Nonaligned Movement 94SE0099A Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 11 Feb 94 p 13 94SE0099A Jakarta KOMPAS Indonesian CSO [Text] Jakarta (KOMPAS)--Indonesia is prepared to extend temporarily its position as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) if Latin America cannot decide which country is to be the NAM chairman for the 1995-98 term. Indonesia has been the NAM chairman since September 1992, and its three-year term will end in September 1995. Thursday night, 10 February, at the Foreign Affairs Department at Pejambon, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas disclosed to reporters the results of the NAM Foreign Ministers Consultative Meeting, held at Pejambon on 9-10 February. The matter of the new NAM chairman is still completely uncertain, since Nicaragua--the only official candidate--has yet to decide its willingness to be the host of the 1995 NAM Summit Conference. According to Alatas, Indonesia's willingness is a flexible position because it understands the difficulty that Latin America and the Caribbean are having in determining who will be the NAM chairman for the 1995-98 term. Nicaragua so far has not withdrawn its candidacy for hosting the NAM Summit Conference in September 1995. Besides Nicaragua, according to reports circulating in Jakarta and New York, Chile and Colombia are also interested in being the new NAM chairman. The decision as to who will be the new NAM chairman may be known before the NAM minister-level meeting in Cairo (Egypt) this June. Alatas reemphasized, however, that Indonesia feels the NAM chairmanship should rotate. "It is not good for one country to be chairman again. It would be much better for other countries to be given the opportunity. In that way, we can apply a three-year rotation," he said. Alatas also stressed that Indonesia's willingness to extend temporarily its term of office would not be an extension of mandate. In fact, Indonesia does not expect that the selection of a new NAM chairman will be delayed until the meeting of NAM ministers in New York around September or October 1994. Received by President According to Alatas, President Suharto hoped that the NAM Foreign Ministers Consultative Meeting would produce input, views, suggestions, and proposals for implementation by the minister-level conference in Cairo. Alatas said this after accompanying heads of delegations to a reception with President Suharto at Freedom Palace. The president explained a number of resolutions and decisions from the 10th NAM Summit Conference, particularly those related to management of population and foreign debts. He also touched on NAM political issues. Alatas said that although the meeting was informal, the president hoped it would produce suggestions for the Cairo meeting, especially about ways to increase NAM cooperation with the Group of 77 and improve South-South and North-South cooperation. Specifically, the president hoped South-South cooperation can be conducted comprehensively in all areas of development in the respective countries. According to Alatas, the president believes Third World countries actually can develop projects at low cost and for collective benefit if they mobilize all Third World resources, capabilities, and experience. "That is the next step we must take," he said. The president feels that new NAM approaches to restimulate a North-South dialogue that is no longer based on a confrontational attitude--but on an attitude of cooperation, partnership, collective responsibility, and mutual dependence--appear to be accepted and increasingly evident, all of which are embodied in the word "partnership." President Suharto explained to the delegations that steps to expand the North-South dialogue were begun at the G-7 [Group of Seven] summit conference in Tokyo in 1993. On that occasion, the president explained NAM positions and aspirations to the leaders of the seven industrialized countries belonging to the G-7 (Canada, the United States, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, and Japan). The president emphasized that South-South cooperation includes helping the poorest countries and those that are trapped by debt problems. "In performing its duty as NAM chairman, however, Indonesia does not want to get any benefit or 'butt in,'" Alatas said. Indonesia will be involved in efforts to find solutions. "We will fight for other countries, especially the 50 countries burdened with debt and the 18 low-income countries in Africa and Asia," he asserted. On Bosnia The president also took the occasion to touch on political matters like Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially with regard to the Bosnian request for support made to Indonesia and the NAM when Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic visited Jakarta. The plan for an international conference on Bosnia was also mentioned. The president explained that the issue of holding an international conference is to be discussed immediately by the NAM Coordination Bureau in New York and that efforts are now being made to obtain acceptance and approval from the United Nations and the world community. In reply to a question about sending volunteers to Bosnia, Alatas said that sending troops to Bosnia is not the way to a solution. He said he understands the frustration and irritation felt by people all over the world with regard to resolving the Bosnian war. "Do not let that irritation be manifested in calls to send troops to Bosnia, for that would not solve the problem but would expand the war instead," he said. He said the steps that must be persisted in are approaches to the United Nations and the former Yugoslav states, urging them to take serious responsibility, implement UN decisions, and stop aggression. In addition, the slaughter should be stopped, by using UN military force if necessary. "Thus, the way is not through an expanded war, in which each country would take part in warfare, but we must uphold international law and support the actions of the UN Security Council," he emphasized. In reply to a question about a candidate for host of the 11th Summit Conference and chairman of the NAM for the 1993-98 [as published] term, Alatas said the next candidate is Nicaragua. However, Nicaragua has yet to state its willingness and is still considering the matter while discussing it with other countries in Latin America. It is hoped that the issue will be resolved quickly. Touching on the failure to hold a G-15 [Group of 15] summit conference in India last year, the minister said the postponed summit conference will be held in New Delhi, India, this March. "We hope that this time there will be no problem in obtaining a quorum," he said. There can be no representatives at the summit conference, and at least 9 or 10 chiefs of member states must be present.
