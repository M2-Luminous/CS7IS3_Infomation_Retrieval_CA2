It was pointed out that in view of the series of unfriendly acts by the Chinese Communists in recent days, which harms the atmosphere of the upcoming talks between Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shu-pei [Tang Shubei], the meeting decided to reexamine the timing of the Chiao-Tang talks; it did not exclude the possibility of postponing the talks. Yesterday's decision has cast a cloud of uncertainty on whether the first high-level meeting between SEF and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] will be held on 31 January as scheduled. Here is a report by Yang Ching-hui. [Begin recording] [Yang] The breakfast meeting between MAC and SEF put an emergency brake on the Chiao-Tang talks. Kao Kung-lien, MAC vice chairman and spokesman, stressed: MAC and SEF discussed the Chiao-Tang talks. In light of the current relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which are currently at a low ebb; in light of the unfriendly atmosphere surrounding the talks, an atmosphere created by the Chinese Communists' attempt to isolate us diplomatically and to forbid France to sell us arms; and in view of the fact that Wang Chao-kuo [Wang Zhaoguo], Wang Tao-han [Wang Daohan], Tang Shu-pei, and others from the mainland have maneuvered for a more advantageous position by issuing various statements on eve of the talks, it is necessary to reevaluate more profoundly whether the talks should be held on schedule. Kao Kung-lien said: [Kao] The Chinese Communists made a special point of creating an unfriendly atmosphere, thereby creating obstacles to the talks even before they take place. For the sake of avoiding political issues, they are actually trying to prevent us from enforcing laws under our jurisdiction. We believe there is no need to hold the Chiao-Tang talks on schedule, and the matter should be reexamined. [Yang] Kao Kung-lien stressed: Unfriendly acts on the part of the Chinese Communists have increased in recent days. This has had a negative impact on the development of relations between the two sides of the Strait. [Kao] The Chinese Communists' attempt to isolate us diplomatically and to suppress us militarily will only create resentment among the general public on Taiwan. This will certainly have a very negative impact on cross-Strait relations. In our view, the Chinese Communists' acts have never departed from their old mentality (words indistinct). This will only result in the waste of the resources of the Chinese people. If they do not change their mentality and adopt a policy of promoting coexistence and common prosperity, it will be difficult for cross-Strait relations to develop further. [Yang] MAC held that because the Chinese Communists do not want to alter their rigid mentality, we cannot help but reevaluate the timing of the Chiao-Tang talks. Kao Kung-lien stressed that although he would not go so far as to say the Chiao-Tang talks will be canceled, it is likely the talks will be postponed. Our side will inform ARATS following the reevaluation. However, there will be no major changes in the government's general policy direction toward the mainland. [end recording]
