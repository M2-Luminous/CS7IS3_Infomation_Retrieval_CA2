FBIS4-28842 "dreas114_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea DPRK Asked To Retract DPRK Asked To Retract SK1406054494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0457 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406054494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- Opposition leader Yi Ki-taek called on North Korea Tuesday to retract its announcement on quitting the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), asserting that such action will not help settle its nuclear row with the international community. He also urged Pyongyang to guarantee the transparency of its nuclear development program and renounce its nuclear ambitions. In an emergency press conference called at his Democratic Party office in the morning, he said, "I'm deeply concerned about a crisis of war being brought about by the government's unprincipled and incompetent diplomacy." He called for a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem through a package deal, instead of through sanctions, and the convening of a special parliamentary session to discuss this pressing security issue. On the failed parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal, he criticized certain banks and government agencies for refusing to produce the documentary evidence requested by lawmakers, terming the refusal "an anti-social act." The opposition party will sue those suspected of being involved in the scandal for bribery, impeach the finance, justice and defense ministers for obstructing the investigation and make public its own probe results and the military prosecution's investigation records, Yi said. Commenting on the nuclear issue, he said, "the present government instils a sense of war crisis into the people's mind, the people are scared of war, and because of this the economy faces a crisis... Dealing with the issue, the government has only created confusion in its approach, using a stick one time and a carrot another time without any principle. It must now reconfirm the principle of avoiding war under any circumstances." He added, "I'm ready to visit North Korea if it would help solve the nuclear issue." Yi opposed any U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea outside the UN Security Council and urged the government to seek a peaceful solution through direct inter-Korean dialogue, including a summit, "instead of pushing for UN sanctions even by distorting the results of summit diplomacy." Asked why the parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal failed, he said the government had interfered with the probe by refusing to produce necessary data in an attempt to conceal the truth. During the course of the investigation, the government exposed its immorality while destroying public trust in politics, he said. The truth behind the scandal must be brought to light by amending the parliamentary inspection law to give it more teeth, he stressed.
