Widespread of jaundice epidemics is due to lack of vaccination and closing of many heath centers in villages, according to RILINDJA issue of January 9. Epidemiologists say that water pipes of Gllogovc might have caused the epidemic because the water system of Gllogovc is still dirty since Serbian officials of the commune did not deem it necessary to clean the reservoir and put chlorine to water. Gllogovc is a commune with 100 percent Albanian population.
