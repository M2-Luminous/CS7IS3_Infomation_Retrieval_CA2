"There were different periods in relations between our two countries: 'From love to hatred'," the Albanian leader noted. Present-day Albanian-Russian relations are based on equality and mutual respect. Cooperation between Albania and Russia in the international arena is of great importance for the establishment of peace in the Balkan region, Berisha stressed. He also favoured broader bilateral relations in the economy, politics and culture. Speaking on Thursday at the ceremony of launching a factory of the Coca Cola firm in Tirana's suburb, where foreign journalists accredited in Rome were invited, the Albanian president said of his country's readiness to liberalise the economy and invite foreign investments. In the past, legislation forbade the participation of foreign capital in the Albanian economy. It will now play the key role in the country's transition to the market model of development. Albania hopes for an inflow of foreign investments in the power industry, agriculture and the food industry as well as in the tourist industry. The president noted in this connection that his country has rich natural resources and cheap labour. The new course of the Albanian leadership for openness and international cooperation offers broad opportunities for the development of the national economy, the president continued. This course has opponents inside the country. But the overwhelming majority of Albanians support the policy of reforms, he added. The Albanian leader also touched on some pressing foreign policy issues in his speech. He said that Albania is following with great concern the development of the Bosnian conflict, advocates the immediate end to combat operations and expresses readiness to cooperate closely with the international community in a search for a peaceful settlement. The president dwelt at length on Albania's relations with neighbouring countries. He pointed to the successful development of Italian-Albanian relations and also stressed that his country is interested in a stable situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and seeks normal contacts with Greece. Berisha, together with Premier Aleksander Meksi and other cabinet members, opened the Coca Cola enterprise built with Italian and American assistance. The factory with a capacity of 16,800 bottles per hour was built for [as received] 80 days. Albania has become 197th country where the Coca Cola company puts out its soft beverage.
