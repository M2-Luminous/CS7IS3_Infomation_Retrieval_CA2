The comment contended that even filtered Xenon lamps contain significant amounts of visible radiation which, while not harmful to the skin, may cause the IPD reaction to occur. The comment pointed out that a sunscreen's ability to block visible light should not be confused or combined with its ability to provide UVA protection. In addition, the comment argued that the light sources used for both IPD methods lack significant energy in the shorter UVA wavelengths, which are present in sunlight and which are responsible for the preponderance of UVA damage to the skin. Stating that there is great demand among the ``sunbather'' population for a ``great looking'' tan and for an indicator to predict how good a tan can be obtained with a product, one comment argued that tanning tests like the IPD are not appropriate for measurement of the damage caused by UVA radiation. The comment contended that measures of melanogenesis would be misinterpreted by consumers as indicators of efficacy of tanning and that consumers would soon be choosing products with the lowest IPD rating to help get the deepest tan. One comment recommended that the agency adopt the Protection Factor in UVA (PFA) test method (Refs. 24, 25, and 26). This method is similar to the SPF testing procedures with a modification to the light source to virtually eliminate UVB radiation and thus expose subjects to UVA radiation (greater than 99 percent). The PFA test uses subjects with skin types I, II, and III. The UVA source is a continuous UVA spectrum (preferably xenon arc) filtered with a 3-mm Schott WG335 filter that eliminates 99 percent of the UVB radiation, with less than 1,500 W per square meter (W/m2) irradiance. UVA exposures are delivered at 25-percent increments to skin above and below the expected UVA protection level of the sunscreen product times the minimal response dose. The endpoints measured in this testing method are delayed erythema or tanning, whichever is present, observed 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. The comment stated that these acute responses have similar action spectra to the chronic action spectra for nonmelanoma skin cancer (as determined in animals), solar elastosis, and skin wrinkling. The comment added that the data indicate equivalent results with either response parameter. Minimal response doses are elicited with UVA exposure ranging from approximately 80 to 250 J/cm2. The PFA is the ratio of the minimal response dose on protected skin to the minimal response dose on unprotected skin. The comment submitted the results of a multicenter evaluation of sunscreens using PFA methodology (Ref. 25). Sunscreens containing 2 or 5 percent oxybenzone, 7 percent padimate O, and a placebo were tested in five laboratories using a PFA protocol. All the solar simulators had intrinsic UV reflecting/IR absorbing dichroic mirrors and were fitted with Schott 3-mm WG335 and 1-mm UG11 filters. The comment stated that the PFA test method yielded reproducible results between test centers and was capable of distinguishing between the three levels of UVA protection provided by the placebo sunscreen and the sunscreens containing 2- or 5-percent oxybenzone. The test was incapable of distinguishing between the UVA protection provided by the placebo and the 7-percent padimate O (a strong UVB absorber with little UVA absorbency). The comment stated that these results indicate that the PFA test method is not influenced by the presence of a strong UVB blocker in the formulation and is specific in identifying UVA protection. The comment added that the data show that the level of irradiance of the light sources (i.e., 300 to 1,200 W/m2) did not influence the protection factors of the sunscreens. Two comments stated that testing procedures using modified lamps that produce mostly UVA wavelengths are unsatisfactory for evaluating the UVA protection afforded by a sunscreen drug product because the filters required for such testing can remove 40 percent or more of the critical, damaging wavelengths between 320 and 340 nm. In addition, the comments pointed out that some of these modified lamps contain UVB wavelengths below 320 nm that can overwhelm UVA effects. However, another comment stated that PFA values obtained using modified lamps and delayed tanning or erythema as endpoints weigh the UVA II (320 to 340 nm) heavily and, for the most part, ignore the contribution of the longer UVA wavelengths (360 to 400 nm). One comment stated that failure of reciprocity may occur with very long exposures and that making each test exactly the same for each differently configured UV source used and its particular energy distribution would be impossible. Another comment stated that dose reciprocity for the endpoints of delayed tanning or erythema has been reported to fail at irradiances between 10 and 50 milliwatts per cm 2 and below. One comment noted that the interval after exposure at which the responses are evaluated can bias the results. The comment added that the infrared energy or heat delivered to the skin during these exposures can affect and alter the results.
