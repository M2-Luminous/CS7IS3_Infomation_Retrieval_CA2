The Argentine delegation made the proposal. [Chilean] President-elect Eduardo Frei is also invited. Patricio Aylwin, Sanchez de Lozada, and Eduardo Frei will hold complementary meetings with their Mercosur counterparts but they will not formally participate in the deliberations. It is being reported in Santiago, Chile, that President Patricio Aylwin is studying the possibility of attending the summit, which will be held in Colonia on 17 January. The presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the Mercosur member countries -- invited Aylwin and also his elected successor, Eduardo Frei, to participate. Frei is unable to attend; he is resting following a inguinal hernia operation today. Chilean Foreign Ministry economic delegation sources told the afternoon newspaper LA SEGUNDA that Chile should send a high-ranking representation to the meeting, even though it is not a Mercosur member and clearly cannot become one.
