Douglas, who was also a panelist on the "One" discussion program, noted that in light of the end of the Cold War and the quest for economic cooperation in the region, Caribbean governments [words indistinct] time ago. He suggested that the governments join hands with the Black Caucus of the United States in the current move to pressure the Clinton administration to bring down the illegal regime in Haiti. [Begin Douglas recording] We are going to impose a serious blockade, not without [words indistinct] spoke to the government in Santo Domingo who would send military advisors that will ensure that no oil flows to Haiti. That kind of embargo is much more serious. And I think the Caribbean governments realize it is at that point when the United States drifted away from the original objective of ridding the country of that kind of dictatorship. That is where the Caribbean governments [words indistinct] the Cold War is over [word indistinct] to that return now that they are associate membership in Santo Domingo, now that they have broken the ice with Cuba. I think that at that time, the Caribbean as a group should have stood up to [word indistincts]. But they are still more or less simply endorsing what the United States is doing, but they themselves are not taking up the kind of responsibility, in the light of the end of the Cold War, in the lack of the need of that kind of economic bloc in the Caribbean. They should have been the ones sticking up the [words indistinct] nothing through the back door -- Jamaica, Trinidad are ready, then talking as one voice -- Haiti is part of the Caribbean -- and linked through the Black Caucus. The Black Caucus would like the Caribbean leaders to link much closer to them, and tell Mr. Clinton, look, action must be taken. I believe now that the approach we take now on the pressure from the Black Caucus will see the end of that dictatorship, certainly before the end of this year. [end recording]
