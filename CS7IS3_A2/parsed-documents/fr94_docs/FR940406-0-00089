ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Delaware. This revision establishes and requires the implementation of primary and secondary particulate matter standards consistent with the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM&hyph;10). The intended effect of this action is to approve four (4) regulations, amended by Delaware in order to conform with the requirements established for Group III areas for PM&hyph;10. This action is being taken under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action will become effective June 6, 1994 unless notice is received by May 6, 1994 that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Thomas J. Maslany, Director, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107; Jerry Kurtzweg ANR&hyph;443, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, 89 Kings Highway, Dover, Delaware 19903. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David J. Campbell, Air and Radiation Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107; 215 597&hyph;9781. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 26, 1988, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control submitted a revision to the Delaware State implementation plan (SIP) to achieve and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM&hyph;10). The revision consists of: (1) Regulation 1_``Definitions and Administrative Principles''; (2) Regulation 3_``Ambient Air Quality Standards''; (3) Regulation 15_``Air Pollution Alert and Emergency Plan''; and (4) Regulation 25_``Requirements for Preconstruction Review''. The April 26, 1988 submittal also contained revised cutpoints for the motor vehicle exhaust emissions testing program in Delaware and a newly-adopted volatile organic compound (VOC) control regulation for equipment leaks at synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry (SOCMI) facilities. The former was addressed under a separate rulemaking at 55 FR 3402. The latter is also being addressed under a separate rulemaking. This notice will address only that portion of the State of Delaware's April 26, 1988 submittal pertaining to PM&hyph;10. The April 26, 1988 submittal is consistent with the SIP revision requirements for PM&hyph;10 Group III areas as detailed in the July 1, 1987 Federal Register notice (52 FR 24672). The amended Delaware regulations are consistent with the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10, and specify: •PM&hyph;10 as an indicator of particulate matter. •exceedance levels. •reference methods for measurement of PM&hyph;10. •emergency episode plan revisions to include PM&hyph;10. •Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulation standards for both PM&hyph;10 and Total Suspended Particulate (TSP), with standards for emission rates and significant monitoring concentrations. Summary of SIP Revision On July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) (52 FR 24634). The PM&hyph;10 standards replace the total suspended particulate (TSP) standards promulgated by EPA in 1971. Also on July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated changes to the policies and regulations by which it will implement the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52 (52 FR 24672).
