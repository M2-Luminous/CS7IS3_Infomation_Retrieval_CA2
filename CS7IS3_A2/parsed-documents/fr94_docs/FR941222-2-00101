FR941222-2-00101 FR941222-2-00088 Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited Technologies Receipt of Application for Design Certification Notice is hereby given that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has received an application from Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited Technologies dated September 30, 1994, filed pursuant to Section 103 of the Atomic Energy Act and 10 CFR Part 52, for the standard design certification of the CANDU 3U Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor Plant. A notice relating to the rulemarking pursuant to 10 CFR 52.51 for design certification, including provisions for participation of the public and other parties, will be published in the future. The CANDU 3U is a 450 MWe pressurized heavy water reactor design. A unique feature that distinguishes the CANDU 3U from the current generation of light water reactors designed in the United States is the use of natural uranium fuel contained in a pressurized heavy water coolant system and a separate heavy water moderator system. The CANDU 3U application includes the entire power generation complex, except those elements and features considered site specific. The staff has determined that the application does not contain all information required by 10 CFR 52.47. A docket number is being assigned to the application to facilitate public access to correspondence and review information. Although no formal review schedule will be established until an updated Safety Analysis Report and schedules for all information required has been received, the NRC staff will continue limited review of the application. This is consistent with the letter of September 30, 1994, ``.␣.␣. that no major activity will be initiated by the NRC beyond the acceptance review .␣.␣. .'' A copy of the application is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Previous correspondence on this application is filed under Project number 679. The new docket established for this application is STN&hyph;52&hyph;005. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of December 1994. Dennis M. Crutchfield, Associate Director for Advanced Reactors and License Renewal, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
