[Correa] He should answer that question, but he told me he thought it was a gesture on the part of the state -- a gesture for the future -- to offer the most important portfolio to a Socialist. He said this will erase the ghosts of the past, putting a definitive end to "banned" areas. He said the fact that a Socialist -- who is currently the president of the party -- was chosen for that the post reflects the maturity of our democracy. Second, because he recognized my personal qualities, my ability, and the experience I acquired in the cabinet of President Patricio Aylwin. Generation factors also played a role: Two men of the new political generation beginning a new phase in the consolidation of our democracy. [EL MERCURIO] Malicious people have said it is a way to keep the Socialists totally tied to the coalition and to the government. [Correa] There is no room for such malicious thoughts. To be strong, a coalition like ours needs to share the responsibilities of the government. And this must be done for better or for worse. That is part of government work. It is not a matter of burning either the Socialists or me, but of sharing the responsibility for all the good and the bad the next government may do. [EL MERCURIO] Did the Socialists want the interior portfolio? [Correa] Not at all. Our political analysts believed it would be politically unfeasible. A Christian Democratic Party member would have been the most obvious choice for the post, which is so close to the president and is so trusted by him. It was a surprise for my party. I frankly wanted to continue to lead my party, but when the president repeatedly offered the most important post... Had it been any of the other 20 ministerial posts, I would have continued to say no. But this is a historic step, an extraordinarily important, symbolic and political gesture. I had to properly appraise it, and so did the party. [passage omitted] [EL MERCURIO] This ministry is in charge of public security, and as such is in charge of repression. [Correa] This ministry is responsible for both public security and the immense task of regionalization and decentralization of the country, which must be set in motion now. [EL MERCURIO] Will you suggest to Frei names for mayors and governors? [Correa] Of course. As of 2 January, part of my job is to help the president-elect create his team of under secretaries, governors, and to fill the other public posts. [EL MERCURIO] Will you do it with a calculator, counting the votes of each party? [Correa] No. I believe political factors are much more important for cabinets, which rely on their political support. [EL MERCURIO] The next cabinet is criticized for being more political than technical. [Correa] Genaro Arriagada has publicly said that this will be a highly political cabinet for which excellence will also be taken into account. Excellence also applies to politicians. The designation of some politicians to technical portfolios was strongly criticized a few days ago. Yet I believe we did nothing wrong. [passage omitted] [EL MERCURIO] You said you will have photographs of Frei, Aylwin, and Allende in your office. Which would you prefer in the presidential chair? [Correa] Salvador Allende, without doubt, so that he could complete, within a different context, the dream we started in 1970; the dream that was thwarted by the convulsed reality in the country due to our mistakes and the great national and international plots. [EL MERCURIO] You mean the dream of leading the country towards a socialist system? [Correa] But a socialist system designed for Chile, with a lot of democracy and freedom, which Allende had in mind. I think many socialists at that time did not understand the socialism Allende offered. [EL MERCURIO] Do you aspire to materialize that dream or is it something of the past...? [Correa] The dream is unchanged. The form of expression, however, is quite different. It is a very democratic, very libertarian, participative, and very fair socialism. We will always aspire to achieve Allende's dream. He was unable to achieve it, but... [EL MERCURIO] It was a socialism against market freedom, private property, which promoted expropriations... [Correa] Precisely... We are suffering the consequences of those mistakes. [passage omitted] [EL MERCURIO] Will yours be a hard or soft policy? [Correa] A democratic policy. Fully respecting human rights and the peoples' dignity as well as the institutions in charge of safeguarding public order that risk their lives to do their job. Speaking frankly, we will promote the necessary changes regarding procedures and training of the Investigative Police and the Carabineros. We must continue the great task started by President Patricio Aylwin's government. [EL MERCURIO] Will the Investigative Police and Carabineros be placed under the Interior Ministry? [Correa] From the political and congressional viewpoint, that might not be feasible, but I will make every effort to achieve a consensus with the opposition that will allow us to progress in that direction. There are several reasons against this and we must assess them carefully. This issue involves matters related to the public order policy and also very legitimate issues such as belonging to certain social security plans, being linked to other Armed Forces' branches. There are all sorts of symbolic aspects to be taken into account. It will be my duty, when we tackle this issue, to take all these aspects into account. [passage omitted] [EL MERCURIO] How can you guarantee public order if you were involved in disrupting it? [Correa] Well... That was when the country was ruled by a government that was not elected sovereignly by the people through free and informed elections; by a regime that systematically violated human rights; which imposed itself by force. Therefore, it was legitimate to fight against this illegal government. I would do so again if the country faced a similar situation again. We now live in democracy, in a state of law, with all its faults. I promote democratic means of struggle which excludes the use of armed violence. [EL MERCURIO] Had you been interior minister last 11 September, would you have authorized the demonstration by extreme leftists at La Moneda on the anniversary of Allende's death? [Correa] Yes. I did not agree with the mayor's decision. By authorizing the demonstration he could have reached direct agreement with the leaders, thus preventing violent demonstrations. Minor groups willing to unleash violence use the excuse of a ban like that to exercise violence, as was the case that day. [passage omitted]
