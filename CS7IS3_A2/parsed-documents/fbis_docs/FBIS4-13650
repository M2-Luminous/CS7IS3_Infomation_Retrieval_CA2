Topping these is the primary and sensitive issue in which Israel categorically rejects Yasir 'Arafat's entrance into Jericho and Gaza after the Israeli withdrawal and during the transitional period. This issue exhausted efforts to achieve progress on the other levels of negotiations. However, Israel considers this issue unquestionable and insists on this stand. As a compromise, the PLO asked Egypt to intervene in order to rescue the situation. Egypt presented a compromise proposal to establish a temporary headquarters for 'Arafat in al-'Arish so he would be close to Gaza in order to organize matters and to take the helm of the government. AKHBAR AL-USBU' learned from well informed Palestinian sources that Israel has now completed defining what it calls the yellow area between Gaza and Dayr al-Balah, in which there are Israeli settlements, and that this area includes the coast. In another development, Yasir 'Arafat asked the Russian leadership to intervene in order to cancel Israel's decision not to allow him to enter Gaza and Jericho during the self-rule period. The Soviets promised to use all means to cancel the Israeli decision.
