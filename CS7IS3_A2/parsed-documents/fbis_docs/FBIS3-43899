PAC Regional Secretary Mfanelo Skwatsha said the move was not in line with national conference resolutions taken in Umtata last year. "The conference mandated the PAC leadership to negotiate a mutual cessation of hostilities with the regime. This move is nothing but capitulation and renegation on the part of the PAC leadership," Mr Skwatsha said. He called for a special conference for the PAC leadership to explain its decision.
