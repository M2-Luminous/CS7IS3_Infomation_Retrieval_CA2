The three-day visit to Romania of the delegation led by Premier Santer is the first at this level since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1910. Premier Vacaroiu communicated to his Luxembourg counterpart his cabinet's surprise to find out that Romania was left out of the community's crediting programmes for the development of infrastructure networks and requested Luxembourg to help Romania get access to such credit lines. Mr. Vacaroiu also asked for Luxembourg's help, as acting president of the Western European Union, for a non-discriminatory treatment by that body. The Romanian prime minister also found useful for the sides the idea of a joint bank to assist business people in both countries. Prime Minister Santer promised to sustain closer business and financial ties with Romania, not only at a country-to-country level, but also at the level of the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in his capacity of governor and chief of the exchequer. These bodies should take, in his opinion, a more active part in financing Romania's air and seaport projects and energy development schemes, and said his country perfectly understood the adequacy of non-discriminatory treatment of Romania in both the Council of Europe and the Western European Union. The prime minister of Romania asked his guest to convey the grand duke of Luxembourg the invitation to visit Romania. In his turn, Premier Santer invited his Romanian counterpart to be the guest of Luxembourg, an invitation readily accepted.
