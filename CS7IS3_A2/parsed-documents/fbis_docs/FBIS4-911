Now they have turned their attention to the country's Armed Forces. Currently, government soldiers who oppose the clique of killers, those who are unhappy about the continuing deaths of innocent people, are being killed while others are being hunted. It is said that many have been killed since 16 April. The Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines [RTLM] tried to hide it by saying that some soldiers were planning to kill their superiors. The clique needed a pretext for these deaths. RTLM also said some soldiers had committed suicide. This is their way of explaining the deaths of innocent people. All these explanations are meant to hide the truth. Some government soldiers are being killed because their goals do not coincide with the clique of killers who want to kill innocent people. The killings of innocent soldiers started when Colonel Augustin Bizimungu was appointed chief of staff of the government's Army. One can say that the current killings in the government's Army was the objective when he was appointed to that position by the clique that took power after removing those already there. Col. Augustin Bizimungu's aims were the reason he replaced Col. Gatsinzi, since the clique was not sure the latter would do things in the same way as Col. Bizimungu. Col. Bizimungu is well known for his wrongdoings. [passage omitted] This should be a lesson even to the Interahamwe [militia] and the Impuzamugambi [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic youth wing members] who agreed to follow blindly by becoming a tool for killings. As the dictatorship (?is exposed), those who supported it now begin to suspect it. The dictatorship then loses trust in them and starts killing them. That is how things go with dictatorships; the other day it was the Tutsis and opposition members who were and still are being killed. Now it is the government soldiers who are being killed by the clique, even though some were fighting for it. Soon, it will be the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi themselves who will be targeted by the clique. That is certain, because that is the reality of the dictatorship. [passage omitted]
