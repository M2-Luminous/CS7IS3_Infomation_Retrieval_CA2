The way out provides for support of the initiative on establishment of a Eurasian union put forward by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. This was suggested by Kazakh Foreign Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov in an interview with Interfax. Suleymenov clarified that the Kazakh president's proposal meant that the economy must finally prevail over the politics. "The CIS in its present framework does not work. Its documents (there are already more than 400 of them adopted) are not carried out. If two, three or four states interested in a close cooperation join the Eurasian union, it will work," Suleymenov suggested. He said many people were worrying that establishment of over-national organizational structures might violate the sovereignty. "However, Kazakhstan is not afraid of this. That is why President Nazarbayev has put forward this initiative," he added. Suleymenov is certain that the CIS states will back the Kazakh initiative in the near future "some earlier, some later." "Definite mechanisms of interaction do exist. There is no use to reinvent the wheel. For instance, there is the European Union [EU] is it not an example which should be followed? This is a single customs and economic space with inter-state banks and mutual settlement. By the way, the sharp issue on dual citizenship would be resolved." One would be able to change the citizenship freely, Suleymenov stressed. Suleymenov believes that there is no reasonable alternative to the Eurasian union. "We need each other. Even now our former Soviet republics are more integrated with each other than the EU states. We must unite. We have separated in order to reunite on a new basis," Suleymenov suggested. On the convention on human rights for ethnic minorities submitted for additional work on it, Suleymenov emphasized its importance and necessity for Kazakhstan. "The draft convention was considered by the Council of Foreign Ministers for the third time already. We have repeatedly put forward our proposals and recommendations. Unfortunately, experts do not always take into consideration the recommendations of all the CIS states. That is why documents turn out to be incomplete. This happened once again," Suleymenov said. He announced that the CIS foreign ministers had agreed to reconsider the convention in mid-May in order to discuss it once again and to submit it for approval by the heads of state. "We would like this document to work in favor not only of Kazakhstan but also in favor of the whole CIS. It concerns our burning issues. That is why the convention must be brought to conformity with the national legislation of all the CIS states," Suleymenov pointed out. He stressed that Kazakhstan was also very interested in another document - the declaration on sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the CIS states' borders. "These issues are of great importance for us now. We are satisfied with the adoption of this document," Suleymenov stressed.
