By decomposing ammonia with magnesium hydrate, magnesium sulfate, which can be disposed of in the ocean, is extracted as a by-product. Since fixed ammonia is subject to regulation by waste water standards, the company plans to promote plant sales based on the new technology. Although Nittetsu Chemical Industry also examined a processing technology using inexpensive calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydrate was adopted instead since separation was difficult due to the gypsum generated when using calcium hydroxide. While treating the fixed ammonia, ammonia water and ammonium sulfate can be collected for recycling. The company is constructing a pilot plant which will begin operation soon.
