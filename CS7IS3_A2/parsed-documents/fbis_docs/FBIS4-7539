Since then Markovic has become vice chairman and leads the SPS's think-tank. He is the party's ideologue and regarded as the most important adviser to the Serbian leader. Now Serbia has to mark time for a while in its goal of a Greater Serbia, the professor said. "The time has come for us to turn to the status quo," Markovic said. "That meant," he said, ``that Serbia should not regard uniting areas of Croatia and Bosnia inhabited by a Serbian majority with the Serbian `motherland' as the highest priority. "The Serbian republic of Krajina in Croatia and the Srpska republic in Bosnia, as their leaders have baptised their unrecognized states, could develop a very good independent existence," Markovic said. "With economic links with Serbia of course and also with neighboring counties," he said. "That is the goal in the first instance. In the end, and that could last a very long time, a decision must be made about their definitive political status, or about a possible unification of the Serbian areas." As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and the Committee for National Questions, Markovic is working on a memorandum "which defines the most important objectives for Serbian national policies," he said. "My colleague Anton Razmazic and I have virtually finished the draft version. It is a sort of guideline, advice to the party leadership for a national program." The memorandum lists the fundamental interests of the Serbian people. "At present the most important things are peace and the right to self-determination in the areas where Serbs are in the majority," Markovic said. "Referendums should be held at a local level in Bosnia and Krajina," Markovic said, "so that the people could itself decide whether it wanted to be part of the Serbian area or preferred to belong elsewhere." "If Krajina voted for reintegration with Croatia, something which the international community is pushing for, then Serbia would not oppose that in any way," Markovic said, but he "was certain" that Krajina did not want this at all. However, in recent weeks the leadership of Krajina in Knin have been put under heavy pressure by the international mediators, the United States and Russia, but little support has been seen from Belgrade. Both the SPS and the opposition parties are leaving their options open. A large flow of rumors has been set off, according to which the Serbian leader wants to give Krajina to Croatia in return for the lifting of international sanctions. The independent papers in Belgrade published photomontages of Milosevic and Tudjman in bed together this week. Markovic grinned. "I know these rumors are going round in the West," he said, rejecting the reference to the Serbian media. "But you should understand two things," he said. "Point one: Milosevic is a man of few words, he does not feel such a strong need to talk to the press. He sees no reason to endlessly repeat himself. Believe me, Knin knows that it is guaranteed Serbian support. In recent days I toured villages in the region and I once again told people that Serbia is behind them. Should Croatia try to take Krajina using military force, that would mean war by 10 million Serbs again four million Croats." But things would not reach that point, Markovic thought. "In fact Croatia can never get together enough people who want to fight," he said. "Should a few extremist groups want to try it nevertheless, then Krajina can deal with that itself. In that way Split and Zagreb would be wiped off the map." But would Milosevic finally bend under the pressure of the economic sanctions and nevertheless advise Knin to give up the search for independence? "That is the second point that the West should now understand," he said. "Serbia will not bend before sanctions. Unlike Croatia, which has allowed itself to be forced into that peculiar confederation agreement at the moment when an embargo was about to be installed because of involvement in the fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Markovic has his own opinion of the latest peace plans -- Germany is behind them. "Germany is the biggest financier of the Croats, but war is expensive," he said. "Also Croatia did not have great perspectives in the fighting and Germany wanted to prevent a Muslim state being founded in Europe. On the other hand, a plausible solution had to be found for the Muslim question, because they and their brothers in the rest of the world represent a great interest for both Europe and the United States: oil." "This reasoning was picked up by the United States, which wanted to show that Europe is not able to solve the conflict in the Balkans without U.S. intervention," he said. "Result: The Washington agreement of 18 March, when the Croats and Muslims decided to form a federation in Bosnia, possibly to be expanded later into a confederation with Croatia." "This agreement would never be completed," Markovic said. "The people do not want to live together at all," he said. "Heavy fighting is still taking place now. What ever the case, Serbia still wants to negotiate and make a few territorial concessions, but there can be no possibility of forming part of a union with the other parties." And what would happen if the country which had defended Serbian interests up to a certain point started to stir? "Russia will never go so far as to force us into an agreement against our will," he said. "Kozyrev might want to do that, but he could not sell that to his rank and file." Markovic sighed. "For Serbia it would be better if someone like Rutskoy, for example, came to power. The present Russian leadership is too keen on a good understanding with the United States."
