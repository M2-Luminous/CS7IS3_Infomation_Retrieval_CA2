After the disruptions of the 1970's, diagnoses of the disease by microscope resumed in the late 1980's with the provision of equipment and laboratory training by foreign relief agencies. Now, about 120,000 cases are confirmed microscopically each year; nonetheless, they don't really indicate the incidence of malaria because so many people are treated without blood tests. The Ministry of Health has estimated that as many as 500,000 Cambodians may contract malaria each year, resulting in between 5,000 and 10,000 deaths. In contrast, Thailand, with a population almost nine times larger, registers only about 300,000 cases annually and about 3,000 deaths. Cambodia has a National Malaria Center, but administrative activities are decentralized, with provincial and district health committees determining how best to combat the disease. They have yielded some data on the effectiveness of anti-malarial drugs. In northwestern parts of the country, the resistance of the most deadly malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, to traditional remedies is progressing at an alarming rate. Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyremethamine appear to be totally ineffective for treatment in these areas, according to studies by a French agency, Action Internationale Contre Faim (AICF). Although only recently introduced in the northwest, mefloquine (marketed in Thailand as Lariam) is following a pattern set in Thailand in the 1980's; parasites present in the blood of more than half the patients in one AICF study showed resistance to the drug. In remote areas, such as Rattanakiri province in the northeast, malaria is much more responsive to traditional drugs. But Chus Alonso, an AICF epidemiologist, said she had her doubts about the scant data sent by medical workers in the northeast. The Khmer Rouge and other security threats forestall any thorough studies. Security problems also have made it difficult for medical personnel and drugs to reach affected people, including ethnic minorities. When 300,000 Cambodian refugees returned home from the Thai border, it was inevitable that they would carry the resistant parasite along with them. Just as likely, the mosquitoes bearing the parasite were waiting for them. In fact, while Thailand has earned a bit of international notoriety from its chloroquine-resistant parasites, they may have originated in Cambodia in the late 1950's and early 60's. At that time, northwestern Cambodia had a peculiar malaria prevention programme whereby table salt was laced with chloroquine. Scientists speculate that prolonged exposure to low levels of the drug enabled parasites to build up immunity to it. Nonetheless, falciparum malaria in Cambodia differs from the Thai version in a way that makes it especially difficult to fight. The mosquito carrying the parasite is called Anopheles dirus. Its preferred breeding ground is in the forest, in pools of water, including those created by an animal's hoof prints. This explains why malaria rarely occurs in Cambodian towns or in the heavily populated areas surrounding the vast Tonle Sap Lake. People clearing forests for farmland or working in forests, therefore, are most vulnerable. What worries public health officials is that the numbers of such transient people have surged with the relative peace of the past two years. They include the gem miners in the Pailin area and woodcutters along both the Thai and Lao borders. Often they are accompanied by their families. Assistance from AICF and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the past few years has upgraded the national center's treatment services. But a large grant from the British Overseas Development Administration coupled with increased access to the countryside now has made a much wider control effort possible.
