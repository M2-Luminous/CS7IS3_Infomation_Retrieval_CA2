Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing.

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket No. RSEQ&hyph;94&hyph;5) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications received before December 1, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable.

The waiver petitions are as follows: Sperry Rail, Inc. (SRIX) (Waiver Petition Docket No. RSEQ&hyph;94&hyph;5) The Sperry Rail, Inc., (SRIX) seeks a permanent waiver of compliance from all provisions of 49 CFR part 240, Qualification Standards for Locomotive Engineers. The SRIX operates 37 self-propelled rail testing cars utilizing their own operators, and a railroad employee acting as a pilot who is qualified on the physical characteristics and operating rules over the railroad it is being operated on. The SRIX argues that their operators are well trained and would not benefit from part 240 certification requirements. The SRIX also argues that the cost of certification would make them non-competitive due to increased labor costs. St. Louis & Chain of Rocks Railroad (SLCR) (Waiver Petition Docket No. RSEQ&hyph;94&hyph;6) The St. Louis & Chain of Rocks Railroad (SLCR) seeks a waiver of compliance from all provisions of 49 CFR Part 240, Qualification Standards for Locomotive Engineers. The SLCR Railroad is an excursion railroad which operates in the St. Louis, Missouri area. It is a non-profit rail museum and operates over less than three miles of track, fewer than ten days a year at speeds not exceeding 5 mph. Issued in Washington, D.C. on October 21, 1994. Phil Olekszyk, Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety Compliance and Program Implementation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26693 Filed 10&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;P
