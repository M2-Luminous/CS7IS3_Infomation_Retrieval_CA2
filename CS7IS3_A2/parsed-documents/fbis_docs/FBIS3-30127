Now that the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks, which Prime Minister Hosokawa had boastfully described as a venue resulting in an "adult relationship" between Japan and the United States, have created a situation that is casting a dark cloud over bilateral relations between the two countries. As usual, there are strong signs that government leaders are trying to shift the responsibility for the breakdown of the talks onto others. This phenomenon can be regarded as an expression of their irritation at their failure to find effective ways to soften the U.S. stand on Japan, which is increasingly hard-line. On the evening of 11 February right after the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks, a dinner party was held at the official residence of Japanese Ambassador to Washington Kuriyama in Washington. The dinner party was attended by Deputy Foreign Minister Matsuura, who was in charge of administrative matters in the talks, and Bowman Cutter, special assistant to the president. At the dinner party, Mr. Matsuura asked Cutter, "How do you feel now?" In response, Cutter said "it was horrible." Why did Mr. Cutter said "it was horrible?" An informed source in the Clinton administration on 17 February told a Japanese Government official whom he has known well for a long time: "Mr. Cutter and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Barshevsky have reported to the president that the Japan-U.S. framework talks will hammer out agreements. They have reported to the president to that effect after a "Japanese close to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata" had hinted to them that the Japanese side was willing to make concessions. On the evening of 7 February, the foreign minister talked over a dinner with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mondale in the Foreign Ministry's Iikura Hall. It has been speculated that during the dinner party, the foreign minister might have hinted that Japan would make concessions and the speculation has sparked allegations that the foreign minister is a "culprit" responsible for the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks. The foreign minister has continued to take a stand against numerical targets that have become the hot point of dispute between Japan and the United States. The foreign minister was still negative about Japan's acceptance of the U.S. demand for setting the numerical targets when Deputy Foreign Minister Matsuura reported by telephone to him for nearly one hour just before he left on 5 February for the United States to begin final negotiations with U.S. officials. The prime minister met with cabinet ministers in charge of the Japan-U.S. framework talks in his official residence just before the foreign minister departed for Washington. During the meeting, the Foreign Ministry asserted: "The foreign minister will visit Washington for talks with the U.S. side prior to Japan-U.S. summit talks, but he will carry no card to play at the talks. International Trade and Industry Minister Kumagai should go to Washington for the talks." The prime minister and the foreign minister came to a final conclusion that the foreign minister, who is also "deputy prime minister," will visit the United States. Shortly after the meeting at the prime minister's official residence, the foreign minister met with senior Foreign Ministry officials; the meeting was held in a gloomy atmosphere. At the meeting, the foreign minister said: "At the present stage, we have no choice but to oppose the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to the last" and then decided to leave for Washington with empty hands. A government official who is well aware of these events has said: "It had been speculated that at the Hata-Mondale meeting, Mr. Hata hinted that Japan would make concessions, but the speculation has been exhausted. A senior Foreign Ministry official was present and the Foreign Ministry kept a record of the meeting. The United States might have misunderstood that if it pulled the foreign minister out of Japan to Washington, he would certainly come here with a compromise proposal." A Foreign Ministry official has pointed out: "The foreign minister simply met with the American ambassador, but the meeting has spawned speculation. Ichiro Ozawa met with the American ambassador on 7 February and the international trade and industry minister met with him on 8 February." Who is the "Japanese person close to the foreign minister"? There is a rumor that he is an influential politician who has nothing to do with the Foreign Ministry, but the truth still remains unclear. This type of approach to the United States smacks of the "dual diplomacy" that was often noted during the period the Liberal Democratic Party was in power. The United States has complained that Japan plans to cut the income tax only for one year, and the foreign minister has been criticized for his failure to assuage U.S. complaints at talks with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor. In response, the Foreign Ministry has refuted the criticism, saying: "The foreign minister has stressed that, as a realistic issue, it is impossible to cut the income tax for only one year." Recently, President Clinton harshly criticized the Japanese bureaucracy as standing in the way of the prime minister's reform efforts, while supporting steps taken by the prime minister for reforms. In this way, the President made clear "his strategy to separate politics from bureaucracy." The government and ruling coalition parties are still continuing their "research for culprits," and this could make the U.S.'s tough trade stand on Japan "effective."
