(Liechtenstein) and Frankenburg Inc. against the Russian oil company Lukoyl. According to American legislation, a private company cannot file a suit against a state company. This is exactly what Lukoyl is--the state has the controlling block of shares. Lukoyl is inclined to believe that the very fact that the suit was filed with the court in January 1994 is an attempt to discredit the company in international oil circles. Lukoyl severed its relations with the Frankenburg Est. company as far back as 1992 on the expiration of the contract period, without any claims against each other. Besides Frankenburg Est., the Canadian firm Calgary Overseas in the PO [production association] Kogalymneftegaz was engaged in the repair of wells, and is continuing this work to this day. Lukoyl did not at all suspect the existence of Frankenburg Inc., the other company mentioned. The appearance now of negative articles in the Western press about the largest Russian oil company, according to a statement by Aleksandr Vasilenko, chief of the public relations office, is attributed by the Lukoyl leadership to the reluctance of Western and American oil companies to have the Russian firm participate in the development of the Azeri and Shirak oil fields on the shelf of the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan. It is well known that a protocol on intentions to develop these fields was signed in November of last year between the Government of Azerbaijan and a consortium of oil companies of the United States and Great Britain, and in February of this year a contract is supposed to be signed on the start of this work on the Caspian shelf. The reserve of oil in these fields is estimated at 50 million tonnes. The fields are considered the most attractive on the territory of the former Union. And the fact that the Russian firm laid claim to the development of these fields even earlier, during Elchibey's time, was no secret to anyone in the international oil market. It seems that Azerbaijan's turn toward Russia with Aliyev's coming to power compelled foreign claimants to Azerbaijan oil to be on guard. They, of course, would like to play a more significant role in the oil business of the former USSR. The moral costs incurred by Lukoyl from the "organized" scandal (this is what the company thinks) are obvious. However, it is hardly likely that it will be deprived of a significant share of the oil fields on the Caspian shelf. The final word on who will participate in the developments, and how, belongs to the Government of Azerbaijan, which is favorably disposed toward Lukoyl and which is headed by Vagit Alekperov, an Azeri by nationality and a former deputy minister of the oil industry of the USSR. Trust in Lukoyl is also reinforced by the strong support of this independent oil company by the Russian leadership, which is of no small importance for official Azerbaijan under the current political and economic conditions in which the republic finds itself. Lukoyl, laying claim to its share of participation in the consortium, is not going there with empty hands. It opens up for all its participants the possibility of transporting the extracted oil through the Friendship oil pipeline, or through the Novorossiysk port--until the new export pipeline proposed by Turkey is built. According to the estimates of experts, the new project will cost $1.4 billion. It would be cheaper to take advantage of the proposal of the Russian company. Lukoyl's claims to Azerbaijani oil have aroused the concerns of Western oil companies. As has also, moreover, its activeness on the world oil market. Already this year Lukoyl will begin research and development of oil fields on the Tunis part of the Mediterranean shelf. The right to development was granted Lukoyl by the Italian company ENI, which has a license for this, in exchange for the oil and gas bearing sectors of Western Siberia. Lukoyl forces are also planning to begin exploitation of oil fields in southern Egypt.
