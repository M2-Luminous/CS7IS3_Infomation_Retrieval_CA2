Essotier also insists that there are large reserves in Yemen, but conceded that the area's secrets cannot be known until additional information is available. He says: "We are continuing to work on an active program of exploration in the concession area granted to us, where we can produce some oil. We still expect to test small setups. We are working hard and actively to complete this, because these wells are close to our existing facilities." In view of the fact that the drop in oil prices is negatively affecting the budget earmarked for exploration, the Canadian company is not at present pushing to find large discoveries in the remote parts of their concession area, which totals 37,500 square km [sq km]. Rather, it is concentrating on the smaller discoveries, which can be incorporated economically into the existing facilities. It is worth mentioning that the oil fields and facilities belonging to the Canadian company are located in the al-Masilah region in Southern Yemen. These facilities are connected by a 138 km pipeline south to the port of al-Shuhayr on the coast of the Gulf of Aden. The Canadian partner announced that, since the start of production in September 1993, its concession area has produced 546 million barrels of oil. Production has reached an average of 135,000 barrels per day [bpd], i.e., one-third of Yemen's oil production. Despite Essotier's doubts that his company's production from its producing fields will increase very much in the coming year, he expressed optimism regarding increased oil discoveries in his company's concession area. He said: "There are still good quantities, particularly in the lower strata," referring to the fact that solid rock bases are located under the higher limestone formations, where oil is usually found. He added: "We have one well that produces 8,000 bpd of excellent quality oil in a natural smooth, stable flow. This indicates a broad area, some of which is connected with others, which encourages us to continue our activities." In a related development, the Canadian company is exchanging data with other companies that control nearby concession areas, especially with the Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimeyer companies, active to the north and northeast of the al-Masilah fields. With regard to the Canadian company's discoveries, those active in the oil business think that there is a not inconsiderable amount of oil there, but they have so far been unable to find conclusive evidence. In April 1993, the Total Company announced the discovery of a field that could yield 12,000 bpd, located east of al-Masilah. North of al-Masilah, the Clyde Company is currently evaluating results, after the recent discovery of a field located close to the Canadian company's concession. It is said that Lasmo has so far dug three wells in which nothing was found, while the Nimeyer Company has just begun to implement its digging program. With the diminishing possibily of finding major quantities of oil, the oil companyies, in order to assure economic feasibility, will be obliged to gradually intensify their exploration programs and concentrate their efforts on small discoveries close to their present facilities. Nevertheless, workers in the oil business insist that even these modest exploration efforts might be economically unfeasible, in view of the existing agreements with the Yemeni Government, which stipulate participation in production.
