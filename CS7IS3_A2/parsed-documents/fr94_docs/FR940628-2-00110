FR940628-2-00110 FR940628-2-00084 T.D. 56487 emphasized the statutory requirement that the total amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise. To ensure compliance with this requirement, the T.D. provided that the exportation of a given quantity of a manufactured product affords a proper basis for the allowance of drawback only to the extent that the product could have been produced in that quantity (together with the quantities of related products produced concurrently) from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. The T.D. provided that this requirement meant that such concurrent production must be practicably possible by ordinary manufacturing techniques. T.D. 56487 contained explicit accounting procedures for manufactured articles. When the inventory of a particular product contained product with different drawback factors (e.g., if the inventory of motor gasoline was from more than one month's production, each month's quantity could have a different drawback factor), withdrawals from the inventory for exports were required to be ``[f]rom lowest [factor] on hand'', withdrawals for drawback deliveries (i.e., for further manufacture resulting in a product on which drawback could be claimed) were required to be ``[from] lowest on hand after exports are deducted'', and withdrawals for domestic (non-drawback) shipments were required to be ``[f]rom earliest on hand after [withdrawals for export and drawback deliveries] are deducted.'' The basis for the above accounting procedures is explained in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for T.D. 56487, in which it is stated, ``[t]he total amount of drawback allowable *␣*␣* shall be computed by multiplying the quantity of product exported by the drawback factor for that product, with due consideration for the `lower-to-higher' principle established in [19 CFR 22.4(f)] .'' (Emphasis added.) Customs has been requested to amend T.D. 84&hyph;49 (as stated above, when the Customs Regulations pertaining to drawback were revised in 1983, the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives was not included in the revised regulations but was subsequently published, without substantive change from its initial publication as T.D. 56487, as T.D. 84&hyph;49) to permit the accounting for withdrawals for export and for drawback deliveries from the inventory of a particular product containing product with different drawback factors on the basis of FIFO or higher-to-lower. The basis for this request is stated to be that when T.D. 56487 was published, Customs permitted such accounting only on a lower-to-higher basis but now other bases of accounting, including FIFO and higher-to-lower are permitted. It is Customs position that the above-described rationale for amending T.D. 84&hyph;49 to permit the accounting on a FIFO basis in the described situation has merit (although, in the interest of administrative simplicity, Customs believes that the order of such withdrawals should continue to be the same; i.e., first exports, then drawback deliveries, then domestic shipments). The reasons given for the introduction of FIFO to accounting procedures for drawback still apply; i.e., that FIFO is less difficult to administer and is consistent with commercial accounting procedures (see, e.g., Miller's Comprehensive GAAP Guide (1985), page 2401 et seq ., Inventory Pricing and Methods). The basis for requiring use of the lower-to-higher accounting procedure in this situation was that that was the only accounting procedure permitted to be used for drawback at the time. Customs position has now changed. Furthermore, we note that under T.D. 84&hyph;49, there are procedures guaranteeing that the total amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise, as required by the drawback law. However, it is Customs position that T.D. 84&hyph;49 should not be amended to permit the accounting on a higher-to-lower basis and, furthermore, that C.S.D. 84&hyph;82, the only published Customs ruling permitting higher-to-lower accounting for drawback purposes, as well as any unpublished Customs rulings to the same effect, should be revoked. As described above, when the Customs Regulations on drawback were revised in 1983 and the use of FIFO, or any other accounting procedure approved by Customs, was authorized, the applicable provision (19 CFR 191.22(c)) was modified from that proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for the revision. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making, only FIFO would have been permitted. In the Final Revision it was explained that this change was in response to a comment which was found to have merit, and therefore other accounting procedures could be used. Illustrations of these other accounting procedures were given. The illustrative accounting procedures (``low-to-high'', ``identification'', and ``blanket identification'') are either as conservative as the lower-to-higher procedure then permitted or consist of direct identification without recourse to an accounting system.
