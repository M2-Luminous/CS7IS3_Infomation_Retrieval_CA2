At 0905 GMT, ranking Syrian officials enter the hall, led by 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP] and President Hafiz al-Asad's representative, accompanied by other officials, including Vice Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah; Sulayman Qaddah, ASBP regional secretary; People's Assembly Speaker 'Abd-al-Qadir Qaddurah, and Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi. Other ministers and officials are also seated near the podium. The rally begins with the observance of one minute of silence in memory of President al-Asad's late son, Basil, and the Arab martyrs. This is followed immediately by the Ba'th anthem. The first to address the rally is Ahmad Abu-Musa, head of the Ba'th Vanguards Organization, on behalf of popular organizations and professional unions. Abu-Musa begins his speech by euloging Basil al-Asad and his traits, praising President Hafiz al-Asad's patience and forbearance. He says the sympathy with Syria that Arabs have shown illustrates the unity of the Arab nation. He reviews Syria's political, economic, social, and democratic accomplishments under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad. He adds that the 8 March revolution was the major turning point in the history of Syria, which turned from a small state to a leading country able to influence Arab and world relations. He adds that Syria's credibility has been enhanced by the Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, noting that Syria's stand on the peace process is based on adherence to Arab rights and international legitimacy and respect for UN resolutions. He concludes by saying that Syria's stability, national unity, and democratic practice have been enhanced by popular organizations. At 0927 GMT, Safwan Qudsi, member of the Progressive National Front [NPF] Central Command and secretary general of the Arab Socialist Union Party, delivers a speech on behalf of the NPF. He begins his speech by stressing the importance of historical memory, which, he says, shows that Syria has taken large strides since the 8 March revolution. He says that under President Hafiz al-Asad, new realities have been created, noting that Syria before Hafiz al-Asad was not the same as Syria with al-Asad. He explains that President al-Asad is a historic leader who managed to initiate conspicuous changes in the life of Syria. He notes the launching of the al- Asad-led Corrective Movement in 1971 has proved the ability of the 8 March revolution to rectify its own course and to rid itself of ideological rigidity. He notes that this would not have been possible if the 8 March revolution had not had a special mechanism that allows it to develop itself and to respond to challenges and changes. He lavishly praises what he terms President Hafiz al-Asad's genius, profound understanding of reality, and farsightedness. Turning to Syria's participation in the Middle East peace process, he says Syria has shown a readiness for political flexibility, but not at the expense of basic constants. At 0957 GMT, 'Abdallah al-Ahmar delivers a speech on behalf of the ASBP. After conveying the congratulations of President Hafiz al-Asad and the ASBP command, al-Ahmar salutes the souls of the martyrs of the ASBP and Arab nation and greets the Syrian Armed Forces. He then eulogizes Basil al-Asad, noting that his loss has shown the Syrian people's rallying around the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, love for the deceased, and strong national unity. He adds that this "ordeal" has also proven the strong ties between Syria and Lebanon. He then reviews al-Asad's role in the ASBP's struggle since its establishment, noting that thanks to President al-Asad's leadership, the 8 March revolution managed to tackle all shortcomings in view of his understanding of reality. He says the revolution after the Corrective Movement has realized achievements everywhere in Syria. He also notes that the revolution has stressed the importance of building the individual through the spread of education, remarking that the revolution has guaranteed education as one of the citizens' basic rights. He says that under the Corrective Movement, party pluralism was introduced, represented by the establishment in 1972 of the NPF, which groups a number of parties in Syria, including the Ba'th Party. Turning to the country's economic performance, he says that "satisfactory" growth rates were achieved in 1993. He notes the growth rates of various sectors of the economy. He says Arab unity is a basic ASBP objective. The objective of Arab unity, he says, guides the ASBP in all its efforts. He says that since the Corrective Movement, President al-Asad has been calling for Arab solidarity. Turning to the Middle East peace process, al-Ahmar says this process is aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive peace. He notes that Syria joined this process on the basis of this understanding. He notes that Syria adheres to the Madrid formula. Since the Madrid conference, he says, Israel has been been trying to hamper the peace process. He adds that Syria has confronted Israel's attempts to isolate Syria, and worked to enhance coordination among Arab parties to the peace process, especially with Lebanon. He says Syria's efforts to confront Israel's "maneuvers" were crowned by the Geneva summit, which emphasized the principles of the solution and the Madrid formula. He stresses that Syria will not relinquish one inch of the Golan or other occupied Arab territories. At 1045 GMT, al-Ahmar turns to the international scene, noting that the world will not stabilize unless racism, double standards, and aggressive tendencies are removed. Al-Ahmar concludes his speech at 1050 GMT. Immediately afterward, the speech rally concludes with the Syrian national anthem. Live transmission ends at 1052 GMT.
