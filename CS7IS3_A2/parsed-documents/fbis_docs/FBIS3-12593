Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that it is unclear whether the settler leaders' declaration also referred to the Kakh and Kahana Hay activists who were ordered to turn in their weapons. The call was published following telephone consultations between the leaders of the Council of Jewish Settlements. The declaration said that confiscating the weapons of the Jewish residents at such a time was tantamount to jeopardizing their lives. The proclamation was signed by the leaders of the Efrat, Qiryat Arba', and Mate Binyamin local councils. [Writing on page 12 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT on 3 March, Tzvi Singer, Ilana Baum, and Arye Kiesel add: "Thirty Qiryat Arba' public figures and rabbis decided close to midnight last night to call on the local Jewish residents to refuse to surrender their weapons to the IDF if they are told to do so, and to choose prison instead." "Among the call signers are Tzvi Katzover, Elyaqim Ha'etzni, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, Rabbi Shim'on Bet-Tziyon, and No'am Arnon. Joining the call were heads of numerous local councils in the territories, including Yisra'el Har'el, chairman of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip; Yinon Ahiman, head of the Efrat local council; and Pinhas Wallerstein, head of the Mate Binyamin local council."]
