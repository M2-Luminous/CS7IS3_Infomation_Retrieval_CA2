He is expected to attend the inauguration ceremony of Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, to be held in Shenzhen's Daya Bay on 7 February. Sources disclosed that Premier Li Peng has inspected Guangzhou, Foshan, and Zhongshan so far. He went round the cities in the evening to admire the light decorations and find out about the market and the urban public's daily life as the Spring Festival approaches. It is learned that Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, which is about to go into operation, is up to now China's biggest Chinese-foreign joint-venture project, with a total investment of about $4 billion. While Zhejiang's Qinshan Nuclear Power Station, completed in 1991, was China's first nuclear power generation base, the soon-to-be-completed Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, with two 900,000-kwt pressurized-water reactor generating units, will bring China's nuclear power industry to a new height. Sources pointed out: Premier Li Peng has devoted a great deal of energy to the construction of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station. From the time when the site was being sought to this day when the plant is about to go into operation he has inspected the project a total of 10 times and gave clear guidelines for every stage of the construction process. He went on many observation trips to other countries and painstakingly worked out strategies for initiating the nuclear power industry in China. He clearly instructed: "Guangdong Nuclear Power Station should consistently implement the principle of safety first, quality first." The core project of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station started on 7 August 1987, that is, over six years ago. Its annual electricity production will be about 10 billion kwt-hours, which means, when it is combined with the energy-conserving hydroelectric power plants in the province, a total annual energy output of 12.6 billion kwt-hours. This will greatly benefit the economy in Guangdong and Hong Kong.
