Deputy intelligence chief Colonel Kyaw Win told visiting Japanese reporters the security act under which Aung San Suu Kyi was held came into effect in July 1990, and the previous year of detention was considered an "arrest period." His remarks came amid mounting speculation that the diminutive dissident might be released on or around the fifth anniversary of her detention, next July, because Burmese law permits house arrest for a maximum of five years. [passage omitted] Kyaw Win, meanwhile, said the military government was willing to talk with Aung San Suu Kyi if she makes an official request for a dialog, and the only question was at what level the meeting should be held. The Japanese journalists quoted him as saying that the dissident's "rudeness and arrogance" in dealing with the ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), was one factor in deciding whether she should meet SLORC leaders or lower officials. The colonel said the junta had let Richardson meet with Aung San Suu Kyi because he had asked for the meeting "as her personal friend" and she had agreed to it. Kyaw Win added that the SLORC was totally unconcerned about international pressure to release the dissident and would continue to act as it sees fit. Richardson and Raheem on Tuesday visited Insein jail, where Burma holds a number of political prisoners, eyewitnesses said, before Richardson paid a second call on Aung San Suu Kyi. There has been no official word on the substance of the meetings. Terse reports in the Burmese state media said only that Monday's meeting [words indistinct] place. But informed sources said Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, handed a personal letter to Aung San Suu Kyi From US President Bill Clinton on Monday, and that she had vowed to continue to champion the cause of democracy. No Burmese government officials attended the Monday meeting, but a US Embassy representative and US journalist were present, reportedly at the request of the dissident herself. [passage omitted] A source present at the Monday meeting told AFP that Aung San Suu Kyi looked well: "She is fine. She was smiling, but she looked a little sad, too." She was wearing a plain brown Burmese dress when she met with her visitors. She appeared much thinner, but otherwise in good health, the source said. [passage omitted] Richardson met Burma's powerful intelligence chief, Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, on Monday and was to have met senior SLORC officials again Tuesday before leaving for Bangkok in the evening. Richardson is a member of the Congressional committee monitoring human rights under the Helsinki agreement and is said to be a close friend of President Clinton.
