We hope that under the new administration, the political authorities will not be influenced by bureaucrats, and will take the initiative in promoting administrative reform. After the bursting of the bubble, Japan's economy is facing structural problems amid a prolonged recession. The yen continues to appreciate due to Japan's huge trade surplus; Japan is losing its industrial competitiveness with the rapid industrialization of other Asian countries; and the phenomenon of "hollowing out"--with factories being moved overseas--is now taking place. Furthermore, due to the overwhelming export surplus, no solution is forthcoming in Japan's economic friction with Western countries. Under the circumstances, reducing the trade surplus to rectify the trend of excessive yen appreciation through the expansion of domestic demand and market liberalization has become an urgent task. In this connection, it is important to abolish in principle various regulations obstructing participation of new businesses in the market and those restricting the daily operations of the business sector, and to give full play to the spirit of entrepreneurship. Under the Hosokawa administration, the Economic Reform Study Council, in its interim report of November 1993, already came up with the concept that the economy "should be free in principle, and regulated only in exceptional cases." Therefore, the new cabinet should work for the implementation of this principle. It should set a deadline, perhaps three to five years from now, for the complete abolition of economic regulations. If the bureaucrats want some exceptions, they should explain the reasons to the people, and exceptions should only be allowed in cases agreed upon by the people. A total of 94 deregulation measures were included in the emergency economic package announced in September 1993. They represented a negligible number of deregulation measures which were acceptable to the bureaucrats. We do not want a repetition of such phony deregulation. In administrative reform, a drastic reduction and rationalization of administrative organs, including public corporations, and laying off unnecessary personnel are as important as deregulation. If sectarian administration is rectified, outdated regulations are abolished, and economic regulations are eliminated in principle, a small government will certainly be quite enough. The private sector is struggling amid the storm of restructuring, resorting to such measures as prompting voluntary retirement, or reducing new recruitments. It will likewise be a matter of course for the government to undergo restructuring, since its revenue income is diminishing. By merely reducing the number of new recruits by half from now on will result in the elimination of unnecessary tasks and organizational rationalization in the long run. There will also be less "amakudari" [the practice of retired senior bureaucrats taking up lucrative positions in semi-government or private organizations]. By implementing such reforms, fiscal spending will surely be reduced substantially. The Finance Ministry has no scruples about asking for a tax increase to rehabilitate government finances even without doing anything about expenditures. Such a way of thinking is putting the cart before the horse. The problem is, administrative reform may end up half-finished under a bureaucrat-led political regime, as in the case of the Hosokawa administration. The bureaucrats cannot be expected to collaborate in instituting reforms that will undermine their own interests. For Japan's long-term interest, administrative reform has to be implemented even at the cost of eliminating the bureaucrats' resistance. We hope the new administration will make this difficult choice.
