Zhang Zhen, Central Military Commission [CMC] vice chairman, addressed the forum, stressing the need to follow the instructions of CMC chaiman Jiang Zemin, as well as other relevant CMC instructions and decisions in bringing into play the Army's fine traditions of serving the people wholeheartedly and of consciously subordinating itself to the overall interests, and in further promoting healthy development of the Army's productive and management activities. Fu Quanyou, CMC member and director of the General Logistics Department, attended and spoke at the forum. CMC members Chi Haotian and Yu Yongbo attended the meeting. According to a briefing, the Army has scored notable results in consolidating and reforming productive and management activities: In the light of realities, all major units have formulated concrete plans to actively and steadily implement the CMC's guidelines on centralized management of enterprises; the CMC's regulation banning combat troops from engaging in productive and management activities has been gradually enforced; Army-run coal mines in Shanxi have been transferred to local authorities to the satisfaction of the state, the Army, the local governments, and the masses of people; and all units have persisted in promoting consolidation and reform on the one hand, while stabilizing and developing production to avoid drastic decreases in production efficiency on the other, thereby giving a strong impetus to agricultural and sideline production in all Army units. In his speech, Zhang Zhen said: Consolidating and reforming the Army's productive and management activities is a major policy decision made by CMC in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of Army building in the new period. Chairman Jiang Zemin made a series of important instructions regarding the work. We must earnestly understand and unify our thinking, based on the spirit of important instructions and the policy decision, so as to more consciously and steadfastly implement the CMC policy decision. He emphasized: As the consolidation and reform of productive and management activities involves major readjustments in interest relationships, we must emphasize, in particular, the sense of discipline. We should strengthen supervision and inspection by bringing into play the role of discipline inspection and auditing departments. He pointed out: To successfully consolidate and reform productive and management activities is a real test of high-level leading organs; it is also an important aspect of the task of improving office and leadership work style. In the next phase of consolidation and reform work, the headquarters and all major units should pay close attention to the consolidation and reform of their productive and management activities, assigning principal leaders to personally take charge of the work to ensure consolidation and reform in each and every department. Office and department leaders must take overall interests into account and ensure the completion of consolidation and reform work quantitatively and qualitatively. In his speech, Fu Quanyou summarized the consolidation and reform work in the productive and management activities of all Army units in the early phase, and set forth specific tasks for the next phase. He said: In the next phase, we should focus attention on work in the following five areas: 1) conducting an immediate inventory of the "dismantling, screening, suspending, and standardizing" productive and management activities of Army units stationed in some localities; 2) earnestly ensuring readjustment of the organizational structure of all Army-run enterprises; 3) further screening and consolidating productive and management projects and setting a deadline by which all those violating the regulation must correct themselves; 4) striving to fulfill this year's productive tasks; and 5) strictly conducting inspections and acceptance tests. Leaders of the three general departments and responsible comrades of all major units and the Army police headquarters attended the forum.
