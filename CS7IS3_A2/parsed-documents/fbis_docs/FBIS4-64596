This is an interesting development and it will be the beginning of an era in which the traditional consensus, with compromises with the middle parties, will be replaced by more ideologically flavored solutions. The broad majorities will no longer decide. On the other hand, legislation will be more temporary and what is approved by one Folketing may be thrown out by the next, even if it is a matter of far-reaching reforms. Thus, Danes must get used to the idea that political reality can change faster than fickle spring weather. The Social Democratic grouping includes the four present coalition parties. There has not yet been any clear indication as to whether these four parties will enter the election campaign as a unit, but since all four parties are expressing enthusiasm over their performance this past year, they must believe that the voters will reward them with a mandate for another four years in power. Continued cooperation among the coalition parties with support from SF [Socialist People's Party] seems to be Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's only chance to remain as the government's leader. And he is willing to go a long way, an extremely long way, to retain the title of prime minister. However, he will experience the same kind of schism that Poul Schluter faced as the head of his government: Entering the elections with the idea of continued coalition government means that governmental cooperation must be placed before party egotism. That is something that burned the Conservatives and it will be no different for the Social Democrats that, as the party that sets the tone, must demonstrate its good will by giving the small coalition parties preferential treatment and by stressing the government in its entirety rather than the party's own virtues. Despite the possible problems, Rasmussen has no real alternative to acting as a unifying force, even to the detriment of his own party. Both the Radical Liberals and the Democratic Center, each in its own way, have announced their desire and willingness to continue under Rasmussen's leadership, even though the polls do not give the coalition much chance to survive beyond Christmas. Typically, it is more difficult to get a statement out of the Christian People's Party, but it is probable that the Christian People's Party, too, is geared toward continuing in the coalition with the Social Democrats, assuming that the party receives the minimum percentage required for representation in Folketing. This is every bit as true for the Democratic Center. Paradoxically, it is the small middle parties, which traditionally favor the broadest possible cooperation, that are now forcing the creation of political blocs. Not only have these parties used a simple majority to reform tax and labor market policy, but now they are actually warning the nonsocialist opposition of the calamities that would befall the nation if they, in a similar manner, would utilize a fragile majority that would include the Progress Party. This is hypocrisy with a vengeance. The government itself set the tone, so it does no good to become angry if others play the same tune. The opposition, too, has no common foundation on which to form a government. It will probably present an alternative budget in August, but even now there are clear differences. The Liberals have presented an extensive tax plan and now the Conservatives have come out with an economic package, the essence of which is a strong investment in education and research and tax changes that are clearly aimed at creating growth in the private sector. The fact that each party has its own plan could create the impression that the opposition is split. But there is nothing wrong with independent parties having their own independent plans and independent programs. But there should be no doubt that the Liberals and the Conservatives can and will work together when the parliamentary prerequisites are in place. For decades Danish politics have been characterized by nonsocialist majorities that, due to a lack of willingness to cooperate, turned the power over to the Social Democrats. The last decade has shown that nonsocialist Denmark is capable of offering an alternative, even though some of the legislation from the last 10 years of governments looks more like the art of the possible rather than nonsocialist ideology. This noon when the government holds its news conference after two days of strategy meetings at Toruplund in North Zealand, it would be nice to hear whether the government plans to face the voters as the four musketeers with a self-imposed common destiny or if they choose to operate with a hidden agenda until all the votes are counted.
