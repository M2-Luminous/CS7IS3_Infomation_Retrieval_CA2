The State Council, sworn in a week ago, mandated ECOMOG to disarm all factions that took part in the four-year civil war, including those that did not sign a peace agreement. Detailing for the first time the disarmament underway, ECOMOG said in a statement that soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL -- the armed branch of the interim government) and the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) had started to turn weapons in at eight special centres around the country. The United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), main rival of the NPFL, had given ECOMOG the green light to start disarming its fighters, ECOMOG added. Peacekeepers had collected 856 individual weapons, two artillery pieces, ammunition and hand grenades, the statement said. The AFL began disarming March 8, while the NPFL did so on March 12. A leadership crisis caused the ULIMO to delay, but ULIMO president Alhaji Koromah had now given the green light to begin disarming his forces. On Saturday General Roosevelt Johnson, ULIMO's top military leader, said he had "reconciled" with Koromah after a crisis sparked by political and ethnic rivalry within the organisation. Johnson afterwards urged all the movement's fighters to cooperate with the disarmament process.
