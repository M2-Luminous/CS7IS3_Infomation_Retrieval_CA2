FBIS3-27175 "drchi035_d_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-035 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Feb 1994 Northeast Asia `Talk' Welcomes DPRK Decision To Allow IAEA Inspection SK2002100894 Beijing China Radio International in Korean 1100 GMT 18 Feb 94 SK2002100894 Beijing China Radio International Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Unattributed talk: "Korea has Agreed to International Atomic Energy Agency Inspection of Nuclear Sites"] [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], in a statement issued in Vienna on 15 February, announced that the DPRK had agreed to IAEA inspection of seven nuclear sites in the Korean territory. The talks and negotiations between the IAEA and the Korean Government had been interrupted for as long as three weeks before the agreement was made on 15 February. Going through the interpretation and announcement of the nuclear inspection activities of the IAEA, the Korean representative to the IAEA said that he, on behalf of the Korean Government, informs the IAEA that the Korean Government agrees to the inspection. According to the agreement made by the two sides, the main objective of the IAEA inspection team is to verify whether the Korean side did not (?transfer) material from the seven nuclear sites, which the Korean side declared after the previous inspection activities. To facilitate the inspection work henceforth, the Korean side is to allow the inspection team to take photographs of these seven designated nuclear sites again and to inspect again some nuclear facilities that the inspection officials had sealed. However, the agreement between the two sides does not include the provision that the Korean side will allow the IAEA inspection team to inspect the two nuclear sites near Pyongyang which the Western officials regard as secret nuclear weapon production bases. An IAEA official welcomed the Korean decision and said that the inspection activities will begin next week at the latest. The United States and the ROK welcomed the agreement as soon as it was announced. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that this was a necessary and positive step and would help the IAEA precisely grasp the status of the Korean nuclear sites. He added that a satisfactory result of the inspection and the resumption of the inter-Korean dialogue on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would facilitate the next round of U.S.-Korean negotiations. ROK media noted the possibility of U.S. suspension of the U.S.-ROK Team Spirit joint military exercise this year in view of the positive Korean attitude, in addition to the possibility of reconsidering the plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK. Korea has adamantly refused to admit that the nuclear sites in the Korean territory are used for the production of nuclear weapons, and at one time rejected IAEA inspections. The negotiations between the IAEA and Korea on the nuclear sites was interrupted by the Korean declaration in March 1993 that it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. U.S. and Korean delegates held 18 rounds of unofficial talks on nuclear inspection during the second half of last year, finally reaching agreement. The agreement is as follows: Korea agrees, in principle, to the inspection of seven Korean nuclear sites by the IAEA. In return, the United States will call off the ROK-U.S. Team Spirit joint military exercise for 1994. On the basis of this principle, the two sides agreed to prepare for the third round of official high-level talks to discuss the issue of improving Korean-U.S. relations. However, after the United States had announced its plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, Korea withdrew its agreement to the nuclear inspection. As to how to resolve the issue of the inspections of the nuclear sites in the Korean territory, the Western countries called for a tough stance of putting pressure and applying sanctions on Korea. Nevertheless, the Korean leaders said that the Korean Government and people would never submit to the Western pressure and threats. The result of the negotiations between the Korean Government and the IAEA proves that dialogue is the only effective way to settle an international dispute. The Korean Government's decision will be beneficial to the security and stability on the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia as a whole.
