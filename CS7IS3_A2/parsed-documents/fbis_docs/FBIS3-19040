The current account balance will, however, "register an estimated deficit of 35 billion German marks [DM]." In the view of the Hamburg economic research staff, prospects for a sustained growth in German exports have increased over the past few months. The United States is experiencing a brisk upswing. In addition, a relaxation of monetary policy and the attendant reduction in interest rates have created favorable conditions for higher demand and output. The HWWA states that German exports will profit from the improved economic climate in the industrialized countries, especially in Europe. The negative effects on demand of the German mark's high value in relation to other currencies will continue to diminish. As the upturn in the economic climate in Europe will continue at its present rate in the immediate future, the HWWA expects exports to grow moderately. The institute estimates that west German exports will grow by about 5 percent in real terms in 1994. Last year, exports fell by about 6 percent. East German exporters are still heavily oriented toward former Soviet markets. Demand there is only expected to pick up slightly in the near future. In addition, east German exporters now have to compete against their west German counterparts. However, the east German economy is only gradually becoming more competitive internationally. The improvement in the worldwide economic climate is making it easier to enter new markets in the West. The HWWA's overall assessment is that "east German exports will continue to increase this year." Economic expansion in western Germany will cause imports to start rising again, writes the HWWA. The institute estimates that west German imports will grow by about 4 percent in real terms in 1994. In 1993, imports in the old laender fell by about 9 percent. In the view of the HWWA, imports from Central and East European countries "will register above average growth." Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have already ceased to be solely suppliers of raw materials and simple preproducts. They will gradually assume "the role of threshold countries." According to the HWWA, the increase in east German imports, which already rose last year, will "be in double figures assuming there is continued economic recovery."
