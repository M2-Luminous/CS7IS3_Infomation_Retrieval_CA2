The news analyst says: The May 2 white paper of the Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front on the truth and purpose of the South Korean rulers' development of a fast breeder reactor is another stern indictment against their development of nuclear weapons. To tell the truth, the economic advantage and stability of the fast breeder reactor are not guaranteed in the world. That is why other countries which built reactors of this type have suspended their operation or closed them. The South Korean puppets' desperate efforts to develop a fast breeder reactor are directly linked with their ambition for nuclear arms development. Through the development of the reactor, they plan to secure large quantities of plutonium and possess reprocessing facilities. The traitor Kim Yong-sam signed an agreement on joint nuclear development with Japan some time ago. The South Korean puppets hosted an "international symposium on the reactors of the next generation" in Seoul in October last year, where they wrested a promise from some officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency to "cooperate in the development of the next-generation reactor in South Korea." Facts prove that the South Korean rulers' development of nuclear weapons has reached a very dangerous stage. It is all the more disgusting that the South Korean rulers are continuously making a fuss over "suspected nuclear arms development" of the North while promoting their own nuclear arms development in secrecy. With a view to concealing its criminal acts, the Kim Yong-sam clique is doing all evils as a shock brigade in the "campaign for pressure" on the DPRK. This reminds us of "the guilty party filing the suit first." So long as such fellows are left alone, the disaster of nuclear war cannot be avoided nor can the North-South relations be improved. If the Kim Yong-sam group continues developing nuclear weapons, it will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.
