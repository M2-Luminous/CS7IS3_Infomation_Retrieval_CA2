Zhu begins by saying: The resolution of the CPC Central Committee on certain issues concerning the establishment of a socialist market economy adopted on 14 October 1993, specifically requires reform of the exchange control system and establishment of a floating exchange rate system on the basis of market supply and demand, and under proper control; as well as a unitary and standardized foreign exchange market to make the Renminbi gradually become a convertible currency. To further implement the requirements raised by the resolution, the State Council and People's Bank of China issued circulars on accelerating reform of the exchange control system. The reform measure will have a great impact on China's economic opening up and development in the future. He continues: The coexistence of dual exchange rates resulted in two calculating standards and two prices for the Renminbi in the past. Zhu says: "It was not conducive to the transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms, to the utilization of foreign funds, to international economic exchanges, or to the development of the market system as a whole." Furthermore, Zhu notes: "Deepening reform of the exchange system is an objective requirement for economic development under the situation of accelerating development, reform, and opening up." He then goes on to outline the main points of the reform measure: 1. Beginning from 1 January 1994, two different exchange rates were merged and a unitary floating exchange rate system on the basis of market supply and demand, and under proper control has been implemented. Zhu says: "Implementation of the new exchange rate system has important significance for China in opening up its doors wider to the outside world and developing economic cooperation, trade, and contacts with all the other countries in the world; and meanwhile, complies with the exchange rate requirements of the IMF and GATT on their members and signatories." He continues: "The new exchange rate system will lay a foundation in terms of a monetary system for the Renminbi to become a convertible currency in the future." 2. The system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange has been abolished. It is no longer necessary to turn over a portion of foreign exchange to the higher authorities. Meanwhile, banks are authorized to settle and sell foreign exchange. Zhu explains: "This means enterprises may gain the full amount of their receipts from exports." 3. Mandatory plans for foreign exchange receipt and disbursement have been canceled. The state will mainly employ economic and legal means to achieve macroeconomic regulation and control over the balance of international payments of foreign exchange. 4. Foreign exchange certificates will no longer be issued. Foreign exchange certificates which have already been issued and are in circulation may continue to be used; they will be gradually recovered through conversion. Foreigners, Overseas Chinese, and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots traveling in China may continue to use foreign exchange certificates in their possession. They may also use their passports and relevant identification documents to convert them into foreign exchange at the official exchange rate announced on 31 December 1993. 5. An interbank market for the trade of foreign exchange will be established to improve the mechanism for formation of exchange rates. Zhu says the reform has been implemented to make the Renminbi on current account conditionally convertible. It means the state will rely on its industrial, trade, investment, and banking policies to guide and regulate enterprises' foreign exchange receipts and disbursement; and will adopt an exchange rate policy that reflects market supply and demand to maintain a balance of international payments. Because a system for banks to sell foreign exchange has not yet been established, and because a unified national foreign exchange market has yet to take shape, the foreign exchange regulatory market will continue to operate in accordance with original procedures. All the Renminbi funds needed during the current transition period shall be paid by the People's Bank of China. Touching on the importance of exchange rate stability, Zhu says: "Stabilizing the exchange rate is an important condition for guaranteeing the success of reform. Stabilizing the exchange rate will create a favorable environment for reform and, as such, it is an important task for us to guarantee the success of the foreign exchange system reform." We must be aware of not only its difficulties but also its possibilities, and we must have confidence. In this connection, he further points out: 1. Exchange rate stability is dependent on our macroeconomic situation. The macroeconomic environment is the foundation on which we can maintain exchange rate stability. The 16-character policy -- "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability" -- decided upon by the central authorities this year will enable us to properly handle the relationship between reform and development, and between development and stability. Zhu stresses: We will have the prerequisite for maintaining exchange rate stability so long as we conscientiously implement this policy. 2. China has a relatively adequate foreign exchange reserve and, as such, it is capable of intervening in the market and handling risks that may be encountered. 3. Market supply and demand are the factors that determine the exchange rate. China has maintained a basic balance between the supply of and demand for foreign exchange due to proper measures taken to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control since the second half of last year. Zhu says: Our consistent policy is to maintain a balance between foreign exchange receipts and disbursement, and to maintain a little surplus. When we pay attention to achieving a basic balance between the supply of and demand for foreign exchange, we will be able to maintain basic exchange rate stability. Zhu stresses that it also poses an issue that requires concerted efforts by all departments concerned. 4. The impact of the merger of exchange rates on price hikes is not great. Zhu says: First of all, in the past few years, the government has tried to apply the official exchange rate to as small a scope of business activities as possible. As of the end of 1993, more than 80 percent of import and export-related foreign exchange was actually calculated on the basis of the rate on the foreign exchange regulatory market. The official exchange rate -- 5.8 yuan Renminbi against $1 -- was rarely applied in actual operation. Most import commodities were purchased at the prevailing foreign exchange regulatory prices. Furthermore, beginning from 31 December 1993, China lowered its customs duties for some import commodities, thereby reducing the import costs for enterprises. As hotels for foreign tourists and airlines also use U.S. dollars to calculate costs, their price adjustments do not affect most of our residents at home. Though the pressure from inflation does exist, it is not necessarily related to the merger of exchange rates. To prevent problems that may crop up and to reduce the risks of reform, we must rely on close and timely coordination among all departments concerned, and must also have a favorable macroeconomic environment. Only when we have maintained a balance between total supply and total demand on the whole by adopting such macroeconomic measures as industrial, monetary, and financial policies can we minimize the pressure from inflation. At 0659 GMT Zhu concludes: China is likely to encounter some specific difficulties and contradictions in the course of implementing various reform measures. It requires us to keep summing up experiences, readjust some specific policies in a timely manner, and continuously improve various measures.
