Backed into a corner by this questioning, Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes pulled a card out of his sleeve and said to some who were expressing concern about the growth of spending: "Those accounts do not include what cellular telephone companies will pay in licensing fees, which will amount to about $500 million." Hommes was right in saying that this money would go a long way toward solving the deficit problem, but his calculations were a little off. As it became clear this weekend, when the bids of the various cellular phone companies were opened, the minister's figures will be doubled: Private companies will pay nearly $600 million, and their mixed-band competitors, who will be chosen in the next few weeks, must pay 95 percent of that amount, for a grand total of around $1.2 billion. If we add to that the more than $400 million (347 billion pesos) that the nation will receive from the sale of the Bank of Colombia, after deducting the funds earmarked for replacing capital and guarantees that were uncovered, the result is that, thanks to these two items, the nation's coffers will be richer by more than $1.6 billion. This is equivalent to about 3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, and is more than double the amount that the latest tax reform will bring in over a period of one year. The cellular phone situation is perhaps the most interesting development, because in the final analysis the sale of the Bank of Colombia means that the state is recouping the investment it made 10 years ago when it intervened and nationalized that entity. But despite the difficulties that arose at the last minute in both cases, it appears that the auction mechanism is here to stay in this country. It is not such a novelty in the sale of a bank; the gavel has been used in the past to sell off financial institutions. But with respect to bidding to operate public services, this development represents a major change, with two great virtues: its transparency, since subjective criteria give way to a very objective evaluation criterion (whoever offers the most money wins); and the way it optimizes state resources. If the government had set the value of the licenses according to its calculations, it would not have received even half what it actually obtained, given that the competition among several bidders to offer the best price necessarily drives up that price. The redistribution factor is another positive element of the auction; for example, much of the revenues from the sale of the Bank of Colombia will be used to pay overdue pensions. To be sure, the auction can also be criticized because driving up prices will, in the long run, raise rates as the companies try to recoup what they invested in license fees. But since there will be competition between at least two companies, rates cannot climb too high. On the contrary, they may just lower the rates to attract more customers. A more valid criticism may be that if all bidding is done through auctions from now on, only those with the most money will be able to participate: the same old handful of companies, which could lead to a greater concentration of wealth in Colombia. For many years now, analysts have seen that as one of the country's most serious problems. One way to mitigate these effects may be to pass antitrust laws, setting limits to the concentration of ownership. The incoming government will surely have to debate this issue. In the meantime, the finance minister can rest assured: with full coffers, the specter of a runaway budget deficit seems to have been chased away. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Funds Obtained by State from Sale of Bank (in billions of pesos) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cost of intervention and nationalizat-|268.0 | |ion of bank, at today's prices | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Approximate sale price of Bank of Col-|410.0 | |ombia | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Funds earmarked for covering capital |-63.0 | |and guarantees | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Net value obtained by the nation = |347.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Distribution of Funds Obtained by the Nation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |For Financial Institution Guarantee F-|69.4 | |und (Fogafin) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Budgeted in 1994 to make advance paym-|277.0 | |ents on foreign debt and back pension | | |payments | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total Obtained by State From Cellular Phone Bidding and Bank (in billions of | |pesos) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total obtained for cellular phone lic-|978 | |ensing | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total obtained from sale of bank + |347 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grand total = |1,325 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grand total in dollars |$1.625 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |State's Earnings on Cellular Phone Licenses (in millions of U.S. dollars) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |License for private network in Easter-|335 | |n Region | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |License for private network in Wester-|160 | |n Region | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |License for private network on Atlant-|120 | |ic Coast | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |615 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Amount mixed companies must pay for m-|585 | |ixed network in the three regions (95%| | | of what private companies pay) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total to be received by the nation fo-|1,200 | |r mixed and private concessions | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total to be received by the nation, i-|978 billion | |n pesos | | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
