As it is not possible to rule out "complications in Russia's domestic development or other unpredictable circumstances," as in May when his visit was canceled, the date of the visit is only preliminary, Lauko added. However, Ladislav Mojzis, the owner of a Bratislava restaurant and the second host, has received a fax confirming the arrival of a seven-member delegation headed by Zhirinovskiy. The agenda of Zhirinovskiy's visit does not include any meeting with Slovak politicians. He will see the Gabcikovo water project and the memorial to the Soviet war dead at the Slavin cemetery in Bratislava. According to unofficial information, Zhirinovskiy has asked the Czech and Slovak embassies to say what they thought of his visit; while the Czech Republic has made it clear that his arrival is not desirable, the Slovak authorities have said they cannot block a private visit due to the agreement on visa-free relations between the two countries.
