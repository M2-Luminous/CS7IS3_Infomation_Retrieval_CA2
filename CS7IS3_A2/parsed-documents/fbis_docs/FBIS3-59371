Implementation of Agricultural Preferential Policies Is Not Very Ideal To protect the interests of farmers and arouse their enthusiasm for production, the state has decided to improve management of agricultural material prices and set maximum prices for major products. But in several localities operations greatly exceeding authority and unauthorized operations have occurred. According to data supplied by the Hubei provincial supply and marketing association, in that province's Tianmen City there are 1,469 primary business units that are engaged in agricultural material business in violation of state regulations. Of those 1,043 are individuals and other fixed primary business units exceeding their operating authority reach 42. The Ezhou City Huarong District Putuan Credit Union replaced loans with fertilizer for all of the entire township's 600,000 yuan in loans this year. All of the farmers who wanted loans, whether to buy farm cattle or to buy farm implements, were given fertilizer in place of loans. The farmers poured out endless grievances. To support agricultural production and solve the farmers' shortage of funds, the state decided at the beginning of the year to provide advance purchase earnest money. But according to a Hunan provincial survey, most of the rural households did not receive the advance purchase earnest money at the beginning of the year. Of the 80 Linli County rural households that responded to the survey, approximately 60 percent had not received the advance purchase earnest money, and the minority of the rural households that did get the earnest money did not get the full amount. After the March issuance of the urgent "Two Managements" notice regarding lightening farmers' burdens, governments and departments concerned at every level adopted a series of positive measures and in the first half of the year farmers' burdens were lightened somewhat. But some regions continued to increase them. For example, the per capita increase in Nei Mongol was 5.57 yuan, in Liaoning it was 3.57 yuan, and in Fujian it was 2.68 yuan. The Contradiction of Tight Funds Is Still Pronounced Despite the fact that the central government has expended a great deal of effort to resolve the fund problem, this year agricultural product procurement funds still are tight. The third and fourth quarters are peak periods for purchase of agricultural products and the contradiction of tight purchasing funds is pronounced. For example, 1.33 billion yuan is required to purchase Jiangxi cotton and the deficiency reaches 910 million yuan. Gansu's cotton purchasing fund deficiency reaches 45 percent. Henan Province has indicated that since the beginning of August it has had extreme difficulty raising grain and oil purchasing funds. In seventeen localities and cities throughout the province, as of 20 September, the grain system had only completed 5.4 percent of its fund raising task and of the 2.4 billion kilogram wheat negotiated purchase task, only 1.1 billion kilograms had been completed. This fall the province's planned purchase of grain, oil-bearing crops, cotton, hemp, and tobacco leaves requires 9.706 billion yuan. As of 20 September, they had only raised 3.218 billion yuan. Prices of Agricultural Means of Production Have Risen Abruptly, the Scissors of Industrial and Agricultural Product Prices Continues To Expand Beginning this year, despite the fact that the state formulated a policy to limit agricultural material prices, in the first half of the year, they still increased by 12 percent over the same period last year, but in the same period, agricultural product purchasing prices rose 8.1 percent. Abruptly rising agricultural material prices on the one hand restrain farmers' investment in agricultural production, and on the other hand, they erode farmers' earnings, and farmers are caught in a vicious circle of "small income--small investment." Grain Purchases Decrease, State Ability To Exert Macroeconomic Control on the Market Is Weakened This year because purchasing funds were inadequate, after grain prices were freed up, with multichannel business competition, after the grain department had essentially completed its quota purchases, negotiated purchase progress was slow. As of the end of September, only 66 percent of the planned summer grain negotiated purchases had been completed. In previous years by the end of September, early rice purchases were completed. This year by 20 September, about 50 percent of the planned purchases were completed. So, we must now further implement the central government's preferential policies regarding agriculture, realistically reduce farmers' burdens, guarantee funds for agricultural product purchases by every possible means, and adopt measures to improve management of rural market prices to safeguard the enthusiasm of farmers for production and ensure stable growth of agriculture.
