These reports are wholly speculative and baseless. It will be recalled, however, that India has always shown readiness to resolve all outstanding issues with Pakistan bilaterally through negotiations as envisaged in the Simla Agreement. We have repeatedly conveyed to Pakistan in the recent months our willingness to hold a comprehensive dialogue at the foreign secretary level. We are awaiting Pakistan's formal response.
