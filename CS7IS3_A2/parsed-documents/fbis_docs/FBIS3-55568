This decision fully conforms with the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Courts in the Russian Federation," regulating both the status of courts under general jurisdiction and military courts. The law, in particular, envisages that the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice takes steps to create the conditions needed for judicial activity and its cadre, organizational, and resources support. A 4 November 1993 decree of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government ratified the statute on the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice. This document also confirms that military courts are part of the unified system of the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice. One of the tasks assigned to the said ministry, according to the statute, is to fund the appropriate courts. The said draft legislative acts were formulated directly by organs of justice and were not coordinated in any way with the Russian Defense Ministry.
