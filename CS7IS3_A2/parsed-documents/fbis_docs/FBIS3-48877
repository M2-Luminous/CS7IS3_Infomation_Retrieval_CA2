As for changes in the State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) policy on human rights, the government has judged that "because gradual improvements have been observed in the country's situation concerning human rights, this opportunity should be taken to seek a policy of dialogue" (as stated by a Foreign Ministry source). Specifically, it is expected that a small-scale aid program in which 3 million-5 million yen will be extended in each instance to purchase medical equipment and drugs for hospitals will be implemented by the end of the current fiscal year. This is to be done through such nongovernment organizations (NGO) as the Burmese Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders. Ever since a military coup took place in Burma in 1988, Japan has as a rule suspended all new aid programs to that country, except for emergency humanitarian aid. Starting in April 1992, when General Than Shwe became chairman of the SLORC, the Burmese military dictatorship has released political prisoners, ceased attacks against ethnic minorities, and lifted martial law. It has also permitted meetings between opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (a Nobel Prize winner), who has been under house arrest, and her family. Such changes have thus been noted in the government's clampdown policy.
