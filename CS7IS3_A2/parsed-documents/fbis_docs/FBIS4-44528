The spot check showed that China's current agricultural-production situation is of concern, with a quite severe product-quality problem. This spot check involved 353 products in 10 categories, such as seeds, pesticides, and farm machinery parts, produced by 216 enterprises, with 157 products being up to standard, for a sampling up-to-standard rate of 44.5 percent. This included up-to-standard rates of 92.6 for long-effective phosphorus agricultural chemicals, 88.95 percent for pesticides (herbicides), such as buta-weed-amine, 81.9 percent for three-wheeled farm-use transportation vehicles, 64.3 percent for upright slush and sewage pumps, 57.7 percent for triazole-ketone pesticide, 56.3 percent for cotton seeds, 42.9 percent for fungus-clearing pesticides, 42.1 percent for rotocultivator curved-blade paddy-field harrows, 35 percent for bromide-cyanogen ammonia-ester milk-oil, and 2.8 percent for corn seeds. This shows that seed quality was most severe, with only 30 of 156 corn and cotton seed samples from 89 sales units in seven provinces being up to standard, for a sampling up-to-standard rate of 19.2 percent. Of 108 corn-seed samples, 88 hybrid seeds did not have a purity of the (minimum) national standard of grade two, with only three of 20 self-crossed seed samples being up to standard as to purity; 19 of 48 cotton-seed samples did not reach purity criteria. In the two provinces of Shanxi and Henan, not even one of 42 samples from 18 enterprises were up to standard, with the "Nongda 60" seeds from a seed company in the southern suburbs of Taiyuan, Shanxi not meeting standards for all four inspection targets.
