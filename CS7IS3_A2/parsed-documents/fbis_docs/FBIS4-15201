Russia will present its point of view regarding cooperation and partnership with NATO and will point out concrete directions of this cooperation, Director of RF [Russian Federation] Foreign Ministry's European Cooperation Department Yuriy Ushakov declared in his interview with Interfax on Wednesday. Ushakov explained that out of all 14 countries which expressed their willingness to join the Partnership for Peace program only Poland had presented such practical documents. "Other countries have not submitted any presentation documents because they are probably not ready yet," said Ushakov. In his words, Russia's cooperation with NATO in the frameworks of the Partnership program should be "of a special character." "It should take into consideration Russia's role on the international arena and our military might as a nuclear power," explained Ushakov.
