FR941021-0-00002 FR941021-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Rural Electrification Administration 7 CFR Part 1755 Specification for Outside Plant Housings and Serving Area Interface Systems AGENCY: Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) is amending its regulations on telecommunications standards and specification for materials, equipment and construction by codifying REA's specification for outside plant housings and serving area interface systems. The new specification informs manufacturers and users of outside plant housings and serving area interface systems of the engineering and technical requirements that are considered necessary for satisfactory performance in outside plant environments. A significant requirement of the specification involves the changing of the bonding and grounding system associated with outside plant housings from a 14 gauge system to a 6 gauge system. The change to the 6 gauge bonding and grounding system will help to assure that REA housings will be manufactured in compliance with recognized industry safety standards which will result in improved electrical protection of outside plant telephone equipment, craft personnel, and the public to hazardous voltages. DATES: Effective date: November 21, 1994. Compliance date: Manufacturers of outside plant housings and serving area interface systems will be allowed until July 21, 1995, to supply borrowers with products already produced or currently in the process of manufacturing. Incorporation by reference: Incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in this final rule is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 21, 1994.
