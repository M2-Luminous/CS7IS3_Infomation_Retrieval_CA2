In particular, the letter broaches the agreement on monetary merger between Belarus and Russia, which was signed by the prime minister. "Mr. Kebich, resting upon those forces in the Supreme Soviet, which allow themselves to grossly violate the state constitutional system, attempts to incorporate Belarus into the Russian Federation by an unconstitutional means," the letter reads. "We are also astonished by the position of the Russian Government, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which signed the agreement contradicting the Belarusian Constitution." The authors of the letter express their assurance that the international community is not interested in destabilizing the situation and maintaining Russian nuclear weapons in the center of Europe; therefore, the United Nations will give a legal evaluation of the above mentioned agreement as well as the resolution on the holding of presidential elections in May-June 1994.
