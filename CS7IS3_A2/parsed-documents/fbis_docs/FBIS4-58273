This Syrian desire to achieve a just and comprehensive peace was not conceived on the spur of the moment, but a strategy that has been adopted by Syria for many years. The objective of peace has been, and still is, the heart of Syria's policy. Syria has responded positively to every call or initiative to establish peace based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the return of Arab rights to their owners. Since past initiatives have not achieved their objectives, and the last two and a half years of talks have not achieved peace thus far, we must lay the blame at the feet of the Israelis. Israel has foiled each and every call or initiative to achieve peace in the past, obstructed and hampered the current peace process, and prevented the achievement of any results worth mentioning. Today, it seems there will be a new opportunity to push the peace process forward if Israel abandons its previous stands and deals positively with the substantive queries the U.S. secretary of state carried with him from Damascus. The queries deal with the basic issues and not with formalities and unimportant issues. We do not believe the bases of a just and comprehensive peace need further explanation or clarification, for the peace process is based on specific and clear principles; namely, the UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. When all the parties declare their adherence to these principles, then peace will be within reach. The more this or that party departs from these principles, the more dim become the prospects to achieve peace. Syria has announced its stand toward peace. It is a stand based on the UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. This stand has not and will not change. By the same token, Syria is concerned about establishing the peace of the brave in the region, and is committed to the peace process until it achieves its goals; it adheres to its right to restore every inch of the Golan and the occupied territories. Syria said it will not accept half solutions and partial withdrawals. Moreover, it did not take part in the Madrid conference and the Washington negotiations to bargain over its territory and rights, but joined the peace process out of its desire for a just and honorable peace and because the peace initiative is based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which are in harmony with Syria's peace strategy. Any peace that is not established on firm bases will be threatened with collapse at any time. Any peace that does not liberate all the occupied Arab territories and restore all the usurped rights cannot be established. It is either comprehensive peace or no peace. Withdrawal must also be full, for it is impossible to achieve peace with the continuation of occupation. Syria has sought and is still seeking a just and comprehensive peace that can last and hold. This peace, which is based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, is the only means to end the whirlpool of wars and aggression, and restore rights to their owners. If the other party is ready for such peace, it will find reciprocation from Syria. Only then, can the peace process proceed toward the objective aspired by the region and the world. The ball is still in the Israeli court. Israel must answer these substantive queries. And, in light of their answers, we can then talk about the progress or retreat of the peace process. The opportunity is still available to achieve the aspired peace.
