Commissioner of Inland Revenue Trevor van Heerden confirmed at a Nedbank/Old Mutual Budget Forum in Cape Town that only about 15,000 of the 330,000 companies registered have taxable income which exceeds R50,000 -- and these are mostly blue-chip companies. Experts said this was indicative of the financial difficulties companies faced as a result of the recession and the fact that many companies were dormant. However, it could also be attributed to the practice by which many companies reduce their taxable income by inflating certain expenses such as directors' fees. Other ploys include buying groceries through a company credit card, overseas entertainment and sundry other expenses. They said many companies would now be looking to defer income and advance expenditure to avoid the levy. On the personal tax side, fewer than a million taxpayers out of a total of about 4.5 million will have to dig into their pockets to fork out the 5 percent levy. Van Heerden also confirmed that a negligible number of married women earn taxable income above R175,000 a year -- making this concession almost meaningless.
