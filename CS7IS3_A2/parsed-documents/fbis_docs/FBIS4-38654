Aleksandr Rutskoy will be running, of course. His party, which was unable to fight in the December election, has met for its second conference. Until yesterday, it was called the "Free Russia People's Party," while, as of today, they have added the adjective: "social democratic." The election campaign has begun for the former Lefortovo detainee. He sees me in a private reception room in an imposing building on the Leninskiy Prospekt and asks me not to publish its address. The conference is not clandestine, but the owners of the building are shy of publicity. [Chiesa] Aleksandr Vladimirovich, when you call for presidential elections, do you have any particular date in mind? [Rutskoy] It is not up to me. The president, the Duma, and the Federal Council have to decide. I hope they will be reasonable, otherwise we may plunge headfirst into another tragedy. People's patience has its limits. In the days of serfdom, there were no wages, but at least people had something to eat. Now, millions of people in Russia have no wages and nothing to eat. What sort of national concord is that! No form of concord is possible in these conditions. Anyway, look how the president's followers, the people from "Russia's Choice," are behaving toward Zhirinovskiy. They have signed the pact, and he has signed it too, but they still go on calling him a fascist. Do they want concord? I hardly think so. They have even labeled me a communo-fascist as well. Tomorrow it will be somebody else's turn. They have a saying in the East: "If the prophet stumbles, the whole populace stumbles, too." As long as Yeltsin is the prophet, they will go on stumbling. And in the end we shall fall down and crack our skulls. This is why the election must be brought forward. [Chiesa] Do you think that the opposition parties can submerge their differences and select you as their sole candidate? [Rutskoy] The opposition must unite if it wants to win. Time is against those in power. I have asked my party to work on promoting unity among the opposition, but we must keep at it. Unless we unite, we shall remain patriotic leaders of the parlor. Striking deals with those in government is not a viable option, because there can be no consensus between the murderer and the murdered. [Chiesa] You will be aware that you are regarded with considerable distrust in the West. How do you intend to convince them that you pose no threat to democracy? [Rutskoy] The democrats have slung mud at me, presenting me as an antireformist. I have collected all my major speeches in a book. They should read them in the West, and they will realize that they have been misled by the propaganda put out by the Russian democrats. I am a social democrat by deeply held conviction, I stand for a just society where all are equal before the law and all have the opportunity to improve their status. My creed is reform and patriotism, and I think that international relations must be based on mutual trust. [Chiesa] But not all the patriotic forces in Russia are democratic and reformist, as you know full well, and one of the gravest suspicions regarding you derives from the fact that, during those tragic days in October, you did not throw Barkashov's fascists, who were giving the stiff-arm salute and wearing swastikas on their arms, out of the White House. [Rutskoy] And I ask you: Who has the moral right to call his own compatriots fascists? Public opinion abroad is being misinformed by having the black rag of the fascists in Russia waved in its face. The primary task of true Russian reformers now is to consolidate a large front with room for all shades of reform, ranging from the evolutionary to the revolutionary. Only then, when consolidation has been achieved, when the worst rents have been patched up, will we decide what to do about the unacceptable ideologies. [Chiesa] What do you think of Chernomyrdin? And if you were to win, who would be your prime minister? [Rutskoy] Chernomyrdin is a nothing, a nonentity. He would do better to see to the economy in a country that has seen a 42-percent drop in national income in the three years of "reforms" in which he has been in operation. As a comparison, just think that national income in the USSR, which had been destroyed by the war against the Nazis, fell by only 17 percent. These reformers have done Russia three times as much harm as the Nazis. There are as many excellent prime ministers in Russia as anyone could want. An example? Sergey Glazyev, who left the Chernomyrdin government as a protest against the October coup. [Chiesa] Would you change the current Constitution or go back to the old one? [Rutskoy] There is no question of going back. I would like the Constitution to contain clear rights and clear duties for all the citizens, the president included. This one merely grants the president powers and absolute liberty with no oversight and no institutional accountability. [Chiesa] Would you prefer a parliamentary republic? [Rutskoy] I am not saying that. What I have in mind is a system of powers balanced by reciprocal restraints, as in the whole of the civilized world. The parliament has no power here. The government is formally accountable solely to the president, although it does as it pleases. The president is answerable to no one: He decides whatever he likes, even though no one obeys his decisions. Do you think this is workable? [Chiesa] What do you think of Zhirinovskiy? Do you regard him as an opponent? Could he become an ally of yours? [Rutskoy] His conduct is clearly unworthy of a true leader, but no one can rule out the possibility of his winning. Indeed, no one expected such a success in the December election. But I believe the fact that he has signed the concord with the cannoneers who have the parliament under fire, with the authors of the present chaos, has irrevocably sealed his fate. People have not forgiven Yeltsin for the dead, and they will not forgive Zhirinovskiy for flirting with Yeltsin. [Chiesa] And what about Zyuganov's communists? Could they become allies of yours? [Rutskoy] I think so, even though the communists behaved very ambiguously, both in the first coup, in August 1991, and in the one that took place in October 1993. But the fault lies with the leaders, not with the voters. [Chiesa] In October, you were relying on the Army, but it did not come to your aid. What is the mood currently prevailing among the Armed Forces? [Rutskoy] I was not relying on the Army, but on the people. I was not the one who wanted a confrontation. It was not the Army that was responsible for the massacre. It was corrupt generals, well-fed and arrogant, who dug in with the minister at the Ministry of Defense. The crack divisions that opened fire are by no means the whole Army, most of which is ill-treated, poor, and lacking in social guarantees. The election confirmed this, with 60 percent of the military vote going to Zhirinovskiy. Had I not been in prison, I would have obtained just as much. [Chiesa] What do you think of Gorbachev? [Rutskoy] As a politician, he is finished. Any attempt at a comeback as the leader of Russia is bound to fail. No one will believe him again. He was president of a great power, but he lost it. [Chiesa] What would you say to Bill Clinton if you met him? [Rutskoy] That current relations between our two countries are neither sincere nor honest. People think that the United States set out to weaken the USSR and Russia so that we would collapse, and to bring us to the disaster in which we now find ourselves. The United States made a mistake in its dealings with us, and the Western leaders who are continuing along the same lines are making the same mistake. Every chemical reaction has its effects. The United States lays claim to a hegemonic role in the world, but the effects of this claim will have repercussions on Europe, too. As far as Russia is concerned, I do not doubt that she will be capable of getting back on her feet and that, sooner or later, the peoples that made up the USSR will join forces once more to form a new entity. [Chiesa] Will you meet Solzhenitsyn when he returns to Russia? [Rutskoy] I have read his books, even when they were banned. His return is only right and natural. I think it will exert an influence on our society and politics. I concur with much, though not all, of what he says in his famous essay, "How To Organize Russia." He was a long way away, and I am here and see things better. I hope that he will support the patriotic movement, which is fighting to turn Russia back into a great, respected nation. [Chiesa] Do you not think that the fact that you have accepted the amnesty is tantamount to acknowledging your guilt? [Rutskoy] No. They were the ones who decided on the amnesty in exchange for the suppression of the inquiry into the October events. I broke neither the law nor the Constitution in force at the time. I did not ask for an amnesty, and I demand full rehabilitation. God exists, and He knows I did all I could to avoid people being killed. The only weight on my conscience is a moral one, because I failed to avoid it. [Chiesa] What future do you see for Yeltsin? [Rutskoy] I wish him no ill. The most sensible thing for him to do would be to resign and spend more time with his grandchildren.
