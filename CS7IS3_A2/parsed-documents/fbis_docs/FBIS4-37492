FBIS4-37492 "drnes120dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Abu-Samahdanah, Abu-Sittah Brothers Recruited After Arrest Abu-Samahdanah, Abu-Sittah Brothers Recruited After Arrest TA2106182994 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 21 Jun 94 TA2106182994 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network Hebrew BFN [Report by Army affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel] [Text] Sami Abu-Samahdanah, a leading Fatah official in the Gaza Strip, was arrested and later released for blocking the Netzarim junction because -- so he claimed -- shots were fired at him from the settlement of Netzarim. His takeover of the junction was recorded on film, Israel lodged a complaint, and Abu-Samahdanah was arrested by the Palestinian police. However, there is a follow-up to this story. Our Army affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel reports: [Begin Daniyel recording] Sami Abu-Samahdanah, a leading Fatah official in the Gaza Strip, wanted to make a show of muscle. He summoned television crews to the Netzarim junction to show everybody that he could take over the junction. The embarrassment was mutual, both for the Israelis and the Palestinian policemen. Abu-Samahdanah and his followers pulled out guns, said they were there to stay, and that they would not allow Jews to cross. Nine of his followers were arrested yesterday, and last night Abu-Samahdanah himself was summoned to the Khan Yunus police station. It would seem, however, that the friendly attitude of the Palestinian policemen during the dispersal of the demonstration continued there as well. Abu-Samahdanah was released. Moreover, he was recruited to Muhammad Dahlan's security apparatus, his followers were stationed in a training camp, and the Abu-Sittah brothers -- who were arrested on suspicion of having murdered the late Uri Magidish -- will serve in the unarmed police. A Gaza-style solution. [end recording]
