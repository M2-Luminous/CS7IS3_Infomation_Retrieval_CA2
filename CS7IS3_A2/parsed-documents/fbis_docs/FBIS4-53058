The plan proposes that: 1) The United States introduce an open information system under which information on inventions is disclosed after patents are applied for; and 2) Japan abolish the system of allowing a third person to make objections to a patent applied for in a period of patent examination. The disclosure of information on inventions will reduce the number of patent disputes between Japan and the United States, while the abolition of the objection system will shorten the period needed for patent examination. Tokyo hopes this mutual compromise will lead to the resumption of the stalled framework trade talks. The plan was recently submitted in writing by Patent Office Director General Aso to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Chief Lehman. In both Japan and Europe, information on inventions is disclosed after patents are applied for. In the United States, however, information is not disclosed during patent examination. Under the U.S. system, it is possible that when patent examination is seriously delayed, a patent is issued 10 or more years after submission of the application. Such patents are called "submarine patents." When a submarine patent is given to technology after many years, companies that have used the technology for a long time are sometimes asked to pay huge patent royalties. This happened in the past and caused international disputes over patents. For example, an image-processing technique for automobile production invented by an American was patented in 1992, although the application for the patent was submitted in 1954. In a dispute over the royalty of this submarine patent, Japanese automakers had to pay 200-300 million yen to 2-3 billion yen each to settle the dispute. The Japanese Government thinks if Washington accepts its compromise plan, patent disputes of this kind can be averted. Under the objection system, the government receives the objection, which should be made within three months after a patent is applied for, from a third person who claims "a patent should not be given to the invention" and the claim is used for reference during patent examination. The abolition of this system will simplify procedures for patent licensing and make a prompt examination possible. However, to protect the rights of a third person, the government plans to establish a new system under which objection is accepted after a patent is issued and if necessary, the patent is reexamined. There are growing voices within U.S. industries calling for introduction of an open information system. They say: "The system will help increase the transparency of patent examination and avert unnecessary disputes over patents." Moreover, a bill to introduce an open information system has been submitted to the U.S. Senate. These things led Tokyo to the conclusion that popular opinion in the United States is greatly tilting toward introducing an open information system. Based on this conclusion and as a compromise, Tokyo has included in the new plan a proposal to abolish its objection system, which has long been criticized by Washington as being the cause of prolonged patent examination in Japan. If the United States introduces an open information system under which information on inventions is disclosed after patents are applied for, there will be no problems with submarine patents, and Japan and the United States will begin to move toward standardization of their patent systems.
