The projects will cover farming, water conservancy, energy, transport, communications and raw materials, according to provincial authorities. To guarantee success, Shandong will introduce new measures including tendering, ways of investment and a responsibility system. Last year, the province invested seven billion yuan in 36 key projects, 16 of which have already been completed. The newly-constructed Jinan-Qingdao highway, which links the province's inland capital to the scenic coastal city widely known for its beer, was the top project. The highway, of which the construction involved investments totalling 3.1 billion yuan, is expected to spark an economic take-off for the areas along the expressway. Local experts estimate that the highway will bring about additional profits of more than five billion yuan every year.
