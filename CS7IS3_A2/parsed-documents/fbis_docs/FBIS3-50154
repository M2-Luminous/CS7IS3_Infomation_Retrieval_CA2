Martin Dorazin reports from his news conference: [Dorazin] At a news conference shortly after arriving at the old Ruzyne airport, Minister Baudys summed up the contents of his visit to Lithuania. During his talks with the Lithuanian president, the parliament speaker, and the minister of defense, Baudys focused on briefing them on the Partnership for Peace project. He also briefed the Lithuanian representatives on our attitude toward European security. Let us recall that a desire to cooperate with NATO was voiced by representatives of the Baltic countries in the so-called letter from three presidents to NATO. The Czech minister of defense then got acquainted with the situation in the Lithuanian Army, which is undergoing the process of building and has problems similar to those of the Czech Army. Minister Baudys confirmed that the Czech Republic will grant Czech surplus equipment to the Lithuanian Army as a gift. Antonin Baudys expressed mild surprise at the atmosphere full of trust that accompanied his visit to Lithuania and said that, while we have survived socialism, Lithuania survived the USSR.
