"We will insist that President Snegur and Speaker Lucinschi sign the last variant of the project agreed upon in the last meeting between Moldovan top leadership, president Topal, and Gagauz Speaker Kendigelyan and that this project be examined by parliamentary factions and adopted by the Moldovan Parliament," added Marunevich. Referring to Suleyman Demirel's recent visit to Comrat, she expressed concern that "several statements were made recently that contradict the Gagauzians' wish for self-determination." The newspaper HABERLAR stated on this issue that "certain internal divergences between Comrat and Ciadir-Lunga could not be concealed from the eyes of the guests. The Turkish guests felt that some speakers avoided the usage of terms `Gagauz Republic' and `Gagaouzia'; they preferred to use such terms as `our region,' `the districts densely inhabited by Gagauzians' or merely `the Ciadar-Lunga district.' This happened despite the fact that Suleyman Demirel himself repeatedly said that he did not come to a certain district, but to Gagauz peoples, to Gagauzia." According to Marunevich, "the Gagauz-press agency called this an event that politically damaged Gagauzia's position as Demirel's visit had utterly different motives."
