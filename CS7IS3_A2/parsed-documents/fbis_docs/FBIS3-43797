Mobutu dissolved the mainstream National Assembly as well and announced the formation of a new transitional High Council of the Republic cum National Assembly. He said it would hold its first session on January 17 and would select a premier from two candidates presented by Mobutu loyalists and the opposition led by Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi. The president, in power since 1965, said he hoped the new High Council "would not get bogged down in the byzantine quarrels" that have left Zaire with two rival governments, parliaments and prime ministers. Joseph Ileo, the vice president of the now-dissolved HCR, immediately attacked the move, calling it a "constitutional coup d'etat" by the Zairean president. The Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC) gathered around Mobutu and the Holy Alliance of Radical Opposition (USOR), which backs the presidents's arch-rival Tshisekedi, had earlier in the day reached agreement on reshaping the interim legislature, a spokesman for the Holy Alliance, Gerard Kamanda, said. "The president does not have the powers to dissolve the High Council even if an agreement has been signed," Ileo told AFP, adding that the documents should have been submitted to the council for approval. The aim of the latest round of negotiations -- which had been going on for more than 10 days -- had been to draw up an agreement on Zaire's transition to genuine parliamentary democracy and to form a new government, ending the co-existence of rival teams. Tshisekedi, whom the president was compelled to appoint as prime minister last year but tried to sack in February as part of a power struggle, had refused to step down. Tshisekedi claimed to have the support of the national conference on democracy which set up the original HCR and whose sovereignty Mobutu always refused to recognise. Mobutu subsequently appointed another prime minister, Faustin Birindwa. Violent clashes in October 1991 led to increasing pressure at home and from major aid donors for Mobutu to reform his autocratic system of government. Tshisekedi was relected as de facto head of government in August 1992 by the democracy conference.
