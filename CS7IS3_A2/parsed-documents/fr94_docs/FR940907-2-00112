David Messman, Branch Chief, at (202) 942&hyph;0564 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is a diversified open-end investment management company organized as a Maryland corporation. On August 22, 1968, applicant filed a Notification of Registration on Form N&hyph;8A pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act. On September 16, 1968 applicant filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A under section 8(b) of the Act and under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on July 30, 1969, and applicant's initial public offering commenced shortly thereafter. 2. On March 18, 1994, applicant's Board of Directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to transfer all of its assets and stated liabilities to State Bond Common Stock Fund (the ``Acquiring Fund''), in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interest of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result. 1 1 Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons are generally prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of one another solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 3. The directors of applicant concluded that the reorganization would benefit applicant's shareholders because the overall fees charged to the combined fund should result in lower expense ratios than are currently being incurred by the applicant. 4. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 was filed with the SEC on April 6, 1994. The proxy statement/prospectus contained therein was furnished to applicant's shareholders on or about May 9, 1994. At a special meeting held on June 21, 1994, holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the reorganization. 5. The reorganization was consummated on June 25, 1994 (the ``Closing Date''). On June 24, 1994, applicant had aggregate net assets of $8,605,437 and a net asset value per share of $11.32. On the Closing Date, all of the assets and stated liabilities of applicant were transferred to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund having a net asset value equal to the net assets of applicant. Shares of the Acquiring Fund were then distributed to applicant's shareholders. Each shareholder received the proportion of Acquiring Fund shares received by applicant that the number of applicant shares owned by each such shareholder bore to the number of outstanding applicant shares. 6. Applicant bore approximately $23,787 in expenses in connection with the reorganization. Such expenses were for legal, accounting, proxy solicitation, and liquidation fees. 7. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is neither engaged in nor proposes to engage in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. 8. Applicant terminated its existence as a Maryland corporation on July 25, 1994. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21925 Filed 9&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
