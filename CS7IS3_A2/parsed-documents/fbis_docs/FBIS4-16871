FBIS4-16871 "drsov076_r_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Azerbaijan Stresses Severity of Offensive Stresses Severity of Offensive LD1904172394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1457 GMT 19 Apr 94 LD1904172394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] Head of State Geydar Aliyev told a meeting of the presidential staff that the Armenian offensive which began in the Karabakh conflict zone straight after the CIS summit in Moscow was "the worst of recent times." The president said "the character of the offensive proved that the Armenians are receiving outside help." The Azerbaijani leader considers the fact that the Armenian attack began the day after the meeting of heads of states in Moscow was proof that the negotiations process was being used as a tactic to "prepare and step up aggression." Aliyev pointed out that the "Azerbaijani army was doing more than ever before to rebuff the aggressor." The president again called for stronger measures to defend the republic. He had in mind the radical upgrading of army discipline above all. He said the military enlistment offices in all districts should improve and resolve all aspects concerning the army call up. He referred to the many signals received on serious irregularities in that area, and said there would be a presidential decree to merge the three heads of the district military enlistment offices. The defense minister would, under the document, be instructed to send military commissioners guilty of irregularities to the front line and demote them. The Azerbaijani leader said that henceforth all personnel issues connected with the activities of enlistment offices would be resolved by the presidential staff on presentation by the defense minister. He requested the state councillor for military affairs to assess the suitability of personnel in the enlistment offices within a ten-day period. Aliyev announced that from now the local departments of power ministries in districts would be subordinate to local heads of administration. The president stressed that Baku would still use every opportunity to settle the conflict peacefully. As had been announced at the meeting of the heads of states in Moscow, a four-party meeting had been planned on Moscow's initiative with the presidents of Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan and Robert Kocharian, the chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Committee, who was also in the Russian capital while the summit was being held. However, the Armenia-Azerbaijan meeting did not take place due to disagreements surrounding the settlement plan for the Karabakh conflict. One top member official in Aliyev's staff told INTERFAX that the meeting of the CIS heads of state in Moscow on April 15 had been marked by increased political pressure from both Russia and Armenia on Azerbaijan with a view to securing the latter's consent to the Russian initiatives. INTERFAX's interviewee said that the Russian side had hinted that if Russia's plan was not accepted, "Azerbaijan could lose a few more districts." The official did say that Baku's official line on the Moscow initiative was "by and large positive." However, he stressed that the Moscow plan would be fully accepted only in the event demands for the release of Azerbaijani territories seized and the return of refugees, to Nagorno-Karabakh, Shusha and Lachin in particular (the latter are towns in Nagorno-Karabakh which were populated by Azerbaijanis before seizure by Armenian soldiers) be satisfied. The official pointed out that the Russian plan lacked any reference to the return of refugees to these populated areas. He concluded that the CIS summit in Moscow had demonstrated yet again that "Azerbaijan must rely on its own strength to free occupied territories." (INTERFAX Note: Levon Zubranian, advisor to the Armenian president, is of the view that the CIS summit in Moscow on April 15 provided an "excellent chance to achieve peace in Nagorny Karabakh which, regrettably, was lost through Azerbaijan's own fault." He continued: "If Azerbaijan were to accept Russia's peace initiative, each party to the conflict would receive what it wants: Armenia the lifting of road blocks, Nagorno-Karabakh the guarantee of safety for its population and Azerbaijan its territory." The advisor assumed that Azerbaijan's rejection of the Russian option for settling the conflict was proof of the desire of the Azerbaijani party "to achieve a settlement by force.")
