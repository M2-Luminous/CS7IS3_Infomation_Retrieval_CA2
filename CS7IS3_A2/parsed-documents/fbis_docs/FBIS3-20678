And there are several ways to achieve the resolution. If Serbian and Croatian peoples were to act with maturity, they could achieve a historical agreement." According to Dr. Koljevic, based on this "historical agreement" it would be possible to begin peaceful changes of borders. "Alternately, it might also be possible to reach the agreement to give some kind of a very high political autonomy to the Serbs in Krajina, guaranteed by the Republic of Croatia. In any event, it would take a long time for people to accept this. I believe that economic activities will revive with time to contribute to a more rational resolution of problems."
