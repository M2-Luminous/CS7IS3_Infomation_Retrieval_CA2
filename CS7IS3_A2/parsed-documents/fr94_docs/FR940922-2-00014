FR940922-2-00014 FR940922-2-00006 Comment 15 Petitioners argue that interest expenses should be allocated on the basis of cost of goods sold, rather than on the basis of assets, because respondent has not demonstrated linkage between the growers' assets and the interest incurred by the growers. Furthermore, petitioners contend that interest relates not to assets, but to the business operations of the orchards. According to petitioners, this is demonstrated by the fact that of the 20 growers, 11 were unprofitable in their kiwifruit operations during the POR, five were profitable on kiwifruit operations, and it was not possible to tell for the remaining four whether kiwifruit operations were profitable. Petitioners contend that based on these grounds, the interest incurred by these growers must be associated with financing the operations. Respondent claims that interest expenses should be allocated on the basis of asset value and not on the basis of cost of goods sold. Respondent argues that the Department has allocated interest on the basis of cost of sales in a typical proceeding involving a manufacturing company with multiple products because it has been assumed that each of the consolidated lines of business of a respondent have approximately equal operating asset requirements. Respondent asserts that where that assumption of equivalent assets is not true in a particular case, the Department uses asset-based allocation as was done in the antidumping investigations of Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors of One Megabit and Above from the Republic Korea, 58 FR 15467 (1993), and Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber from the Republic of Korea, 55 FR 32659 (1990). Respondent asserts that the growers in this review are in a factual situation similar to that in Man-Made Fiber Sweaters from Korea. DOC Position We agree with respondent but not for the reasons stated. During verification in New Zealand, the Department observed that many kiwifruit growers reside on their farms. In most cases, these growers' financial statements list their private residence as well as orchard-related expenses together. However, during verification, the Department observed that the growers' private residences are not directly related to the cultivation of kiwifruit. Since a grower's residence does not generate a cost of sales, the allocation of interest on the basis of cost of sales would not accurately reflect the amount of interest attributable specifically to the residence of orchard operation. Therefore, we have accepted respondent's methodology of allocating interest expense on the basis of asset value, thus distinguishing between interest expenses attributable to the growers' residence and those attributable to their commercial activities. Accordingly, no adjustment for Growers' 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 20 has been made in the final results. Comment 16 Petitioners disagree with respondent's methodology of allocating G&A expenses for Growers' 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 16, 17, and 20. Petitioners contend that, by using a cost of goods sold ratio based on the kiwifruit COM relative to all other costs, respondent has understated kiwifruit costs and has overstated the total orchard costs. Furthermore, petitioners argue that kiwifruit picking and packing expense should be included in the cost of goods sold. Petitioners urge the Department to recalculate growers' G&A expenses by adding the amount of picking and packing in the total cost of sales. Respondent argues that petitioners' proposal to reallocate G&A expenses by including packing in the COM is without merit. Respondent notes that it is the Department's practice to exclude packing from the COM for the allocation of G&A. Furthermore, respondent contends that it used unpacked COM to allocate among all orchard crops. Therefore, if the Department were to include the cost of packing for allocation purposes in the cost of kiwifruit only, but not for other crops, the results would be biased. Respondent argues that while the growers ultimately pay for packing, NZKMB administers the packing and distribution of kiwifruit from the time it leaves the orchard. Therefore, NZKMB is responsible for the packing process and NZKMB has included its G&A expenses in the COP figures for the kiwifruit. DOC Position We disagree with petitioners that respondent understated kiwifruit costs and overstated the total orchard costs by using a cost of goods sold ratio based on the kiwifruit COM relative to all other costs. Where growers had multiple crops, respondent allocated costs between kiwifruit and other crops. Since respondent used the unpacked COM to allocate costs among all orchard crops, inclusion of packing cost for allocation purposes in the cost of kiwifruit and not for other crops would prejudice the results. Therefore, we have accepted respondent's methodology in these final results. We agree with respondent that normally the Department does not consider packing expense as part of COM for the allocation of G&A. Therefore, we have accepted respondent's treatment of the packing expense. Grower-Specific Comments Grower 1 Comment 17 Petitioners argue that fertilizing, pollination, pruning, shelter, labor, and other expenses for Grower 1 should be recalculated based on the Department's revised ratio of kiwifruit area to total area in the preliminary results. Petitioners further contend that the grower did not include all costs for spraying. DOC Position We agree with petitioners in part. Because headlands, sidelands, and shelterbelts require regular pruning and maintenance, certain expenses such as pruning, shelter, and labor should be allocated on the basis of gross kiwifruit area. However, we disagree with petitioners about the allocation of fertilizer and pollination expenses. The fertilizer and pollination expenses are not applicable to headlands, sidelands, and shelterbelts, hence, we have allocated these expenses over the productive area only for the final results. With regard to the spraying costs, we agree with petitioners that the grower's financial statement does not support the deduction claimed by respondent. Accordingly, we have recalculated the spraying expense for this grower. Comment 18 Petitioners argue that the respondent miscalculated the depreciation expense because its starting point is not an actual depreciation but an amount adjusted for profits and losses on disposal of assets. Petitioners further contend that all depreciation related to kiwifruit reported in the partnership's financial statement also appears in the grower's assets. Therefore, petitioners argue that the full value of the depreciation of the assets should be dedicated to this grower because the assets are directly related to his property.
