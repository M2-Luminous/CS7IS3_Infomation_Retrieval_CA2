"We assess such a proposal of the Ingush side as crude interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of North Ossetia," says Yuriy Bagirov's statement. "Their realization would make a further peaceful settlement of the relations between the peoples of the two republics impossible and reduce to naught the peacemaking work done by the leaders of Russia and the provisional administration; likewise the accords reached in the course of the negotiating process."
