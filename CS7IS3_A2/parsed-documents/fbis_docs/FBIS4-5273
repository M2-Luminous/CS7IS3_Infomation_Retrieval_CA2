The Ginowan city assembly and political parties and labor organizations on Okinawa are increasingly reacting against the crashes by taking measures to protest the crashes. The Futenma Air Station is located in the middle of Ginowan city, and the Ginowan city assembly has held a session of the Committee on U.S. Military Bases. The assembly is expected to hold an extraordinary session on 8 April at the earliest to adopt a resolution protesting against the crashes. At Naha airport, Governor Ota expressed his firm resolve to strongly ask the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency to take measures to prevent a recurrence of such crashes, saying, "If the government does not take a more serious view of the crashes, it will be too late for the government to take steps to prevent them after disasters have occurred." Labor organizations and the Federation of Okinawa Prefectural Trade Unions have staged rallies near Kadena Air Base to protest against the crashes, and this unprecedented situation in which two crashes in a row have occurred is heightening anger and apprehension among Okinawans. Commenting on the crash of a medium-type CH-transport helicopter, the Okinawa Public Affairs Office of the Marine Corps explained on the morning of 7 April that the helicopter, which was involved in emergency landing training, crashed into a runway just prior to landing. The Public Affairs Office said that four crewmen were slightly injured, and that the Marine Corps has begun investigating the cause of the crash after having received reports from the helicopter's pilots. As for the cause of the crash, the Public Affairs Office repeated its conventional line, saying, "The Marine Corps does not make public the results of investigations into this kind of crash. The release of the results is up to negotiations between the Governments of Japan and the United States." In an interview with the OKINAWA TIMES at Naha airport prior to his departure for Tokyo, Governor Ota expressed his anger over the crashes, saying: "The U.S. Forces on Okinawa have repeatedly said that such accidents would not occur. We can no longer permit such accidents to occur near Okinawans' residential areas." In the interview, Governor Ota stressed the need for the government to speedily take measures to prevent such crashes from occurring in the future, saying, "I intend to let the government ask the U.S. side to fundamentally resolve problems arising from U.S. military bases on Okinawa and to ban military aircraft considered to be dangerous from flying over Okinawa." The Okinawa prefectural governor will call on the foreign minister and on the director generals of the Defense Agency and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency to ask the U.S. side to succeed in having U.S. Forces on Okinawa operate their military bases safely and to work to prevent a recurrence of such crashes. The Okinawa chapters of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Social Democratic Party of Japan, and the Japan Communist Party have protested to the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Agency over the crashes involving U.S. military aircraft.
