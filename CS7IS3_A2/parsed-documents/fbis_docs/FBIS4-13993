Narasimha Rao to visit Washington, the U.S. side, in the course of Mr. Strobe Talbott's talks here, sought to convince India that the strategic significance of getting Pakistan to cap verifiably its fissile material production would be far greater than a marginal increase in the latter's conventional arms strength. One aspect of the proposed trade-off, entailing supply of 38 F-16 aircraft, what Mr. Talbott sought to highlight was that the exercise, if successful, would amount to Islamabad "delinking" its nuclear programme from India's. Consequently, New Delhi's security concerns, which extend beyond Islamabad, even the Indian sub-continent, would stand acknowledged with the China factor also being taken care of. The Indian interlocutors weren't obviously impressed by the American logic. It was conveyed in very clear terms to Mr. Talbott and also reportedly to Mr. Robert Einhorn, Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs of the State Department, that the induction of the deep-penetration jets would affect the balance of forces adversely against India in the region, forcing it to take steps in line with the changed situation. Mr. Einhorn has been engaged in Indo-U.S. bilateral discussions on disarmament and international security since 1992. His role in the recently concluded negotiations, which Mr. Talbott preferred to categorise as consultations, was much deeper than that of Ms. Robin Raphel, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State in charge of South Asia. On the sidelines of the talks at the political level, Mr. Einhorn is understood to have had meetings covering the nuts and bolts of the F-16 issue and its security implications for India. The future contours of Washington's new policy of pursuing the nuclear issue separately with New Delhi and Islamabad would depend on the extent to which the Benazir Bhutto regime is willing to play ball. Unless Pakistan accepts the deal, the move would remain a non-starter. It's because of the Kashmir issue that South-Asia is perceived as a potential nuclear flash-point. In recent months, Pakistan has sought to link the two, the message being that the nuclear imbroglio cannot be resolved ahead of the Kashmir question for the need for a deterrent against India was felt due to the situation in the Valley. In November last year, Ms. Raphel, in the course of her visit to Islamabad, had described the linkage drawn by Pakistan between Kashmir and its nuclear endeavour as a "natural line of thought." From accounts available of the latest Pak-U.S. bilateral exchange, it can safely be deduced that Washington's thinking has since changed. "The issue of non-proliferation is so important," Mr. Talbott is reported to have told his Pakistani audience "... that it needs to be discussed very much in its own terms." Against this backdrop, Ms. Raphel, as President Clinton's pointsperson in South Asia, may have problems selling the intended package despite her reputation of being a friend of Pakistan. The rosy side (for India) of the proposed deal, if that, indeed, is the case, also hasn't been lost on the Pak foreign office. It has already spoken about the need to evolve an "agreed and equitable approach" in the U.S. linkage between the delivery of F-16 aircraft and the verifiable nuclear cap. The message emanating from Islamabad is, therefore, unmistakable: the India factor cannot be ignored in Washington's bilateral dealings having a bearing on Pakistan's nuclear option. Said a spokesman of the Pak Foreign Office following talks with Mr. Talbott: "We have now informed the U.S. of our willingness to consider any ideas that might prompt a balance of obligation by India, on the one hand and by Pakistan on the other, although these country-specific obligations could be different in substance." As pointed out by the U.S. official the process is going to be complicated and time-consuming, requiring a lot of work through "quiet" diplomatic channels. However, Ms. Bhutto does not appear to be in a position to accept the quid pro quo, especially not if Army Chief Gen. Abdul Waheed has returned unimpressed from Washington. According to Pakistani Press reports, he was to reach Islamabad before Mr. Talbott and his teammates. Essentially, it's the Pak army which has to weigh the advantages of acquiring the 38 F-16s and some other "toys" against the major nuclear concession being demanded of them by the U.S.. As of now, only the Americans have some assessment of Gen. Waheed's thinking which, for evident reasons, Mr. Talbott refused to share at his Press conference in New Delhi, terming as "confidential" the record dialogue held in Washington. Talking of confidential conversations, one may mention that not much also is known about what transpired at Mr. Talbott's one-to-one chat with Mr. Rao before leaving for Islamabad. Originally planned for Thursday last, the meeting had to be rescheduled for the next morning. Privately, Mr. Talbott is understood to have confirmed to the Indian officials the components of the arms package offered to Pakistan. Besides the F-16s, the offer includes three P-3 Orion anti-submarine warplanes, 15 T-37 trainer aircraft and military-to- military cooperation and training for Pakistani army officers at U.S. war colleges. It's against this background that the Foreign Office is exercising caution and care while working out the details of Mr. Rao's visit to Washington. The basic objective is to avoid any embarrassment to the Premier in terms of the timing of the supplies to Islamabad -- if Pakistan accepts the deal, that is. At his Press conference here, Mr. Talbott was categorical that the gifts offered bilaterally would be delivered "if and only if Pakistan accepts a verifiable cap on its fissile material production."
