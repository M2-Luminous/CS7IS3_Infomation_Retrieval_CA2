In my opinion, the verdict is legal and just, and the penalty is accurately meted out. Xi Yang was involved in a criminal case, which was not complicated. Regarding those who do not know the truth or the procedure of trial by the judicial departments, questions of one kind or the other are understandable. However, some people are trying to seize upon the incident to exaggerate matters and to link this purely criminal case to politics in an attempt to throw mud at China's judicial departments. They are confusing right and wrong by saying that the sentence meted out by China's judicial departments on Xi Yang according to law runs counter to the principle of freedom of the press. As a matter of fact, punishing the crime of stealing secrets and protecting the freedom of reporters in gathering news are two things entirely different in nature. News, news gathering, and legality are entirely different from secrets, stealing, and illegality. We can judge this point from the crime committed by Xi Yang. During June and July of 1993, Xi Yang came to Beijing in the name of covering the Sino-British talks and the establishment of the Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. People in this circle all know that Hong Kong reporters should first submit an application for gathering news on the mainland. As far as I know, neither the XINHUA Hong Kong branch nor the People's Bank of China [PBC] received any application from Xi Yang to cover news about the PBC. Neither did the bank assign its staffer, Tian Ye, to receive Xi Yang. When Xi Yang arrived in Beijing, he was not interested at all in the news he was allowed to cover. Instead, in light of the request of the person in charge of MING PAO, he instigated Tian Ye, deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the PBC, to steal the state's banking and economic secrets, which included the sample of banknotes to be printed by China, the decision of the bank on bullion trading in the international market, and the plan of the bank on interest rate changes which had not yet been published. The document entitled "Explanations on Provisional Method for Foreign- Funded Financial Organizations To Engage in Renminbi Businesses" was labeled "confidential." Did Xi and Tian not know they were violating the law? "Did they 'trespass the forbidden zone' by mistake while covering news?" No. I learned from relevant departments that Xi and Tian were surreptitious during their involvement in these activities. They dared not meet at Tian Ye's office or at the Jianguo Hotel, where Xi Yang was staying. Instead, they met on street corners. To avoid public attention, they neither shook hands on meeting nor bid farewell on parting. If this was normal news coverage, why were they so furtive? Obviously, they had guilty consciences. Regarding this, Xi Yang admitted that "he knowingly violated the law." While engaged in these activities, he also said, he "only received instructions from MING PAO, but never got any approval from the departments concerned." "His lawless behavior has caused unnecessary losses to the country's economy and has interfered in the country's policy of macroeconomic regulation and control. As a Chinese citizen who had lived and worked in the country for years, he knew that the nature of his case was serious, as his lawless behavior incurred enormous losses to the state's interests." When the PBC was investigating the case of China's financial and economic secrets published in MING PAO, the newspaper urged Xi Yang on numerous occasions to return to Hong Kong as quickly as possible. This also proved that the official responsible for the newspaper clearly knew the nature of the case. Since Xi Yang and Tian Ye have violated the law, incurring serious economic losses to the state, it is absolutely necessary to mete out punishment against them according to the law. They deserve this punishment. Otherwise, how can we guard the sanctity of the law? Since reform and opening up, China's relevant departments have enthusiastically welcomed news coverage by reporters from overseas -- including those from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao -- and have provided convenience and created conditions for their normal coverage. In 1993 alone, Hong Kong reporters came to China to cover news on more than 1,000 occasions. However, if a person violates the law, he must be punished according to the law, regardless of his status. As Xi Yang stole and spied on the state's financial and economic secrets, violating China's law, China's judicial organs have meted out his punishment according to the law. This is entirely a matter within China's sovereignty. [Signed] Bao Xin, 18 April
