Boris Yeltsin would reportedly be removed from power as a result of the overthrow and his place would be taken by the current prime-minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. In a Tuesday interview with INTERFAX Stankevich said that the publications reflect "the intentions of some political forces to change the predominant political atmosphere because at the moment the focus of public attention has shifted to the question of national accord." In his opinion this new backdrop does not find favor with forces that can survive only in conditions of acute confrontation and that want to "push the president to some extraordinary steps." The purpose of such reports is "to damage certain politicians and provoke a clash with the president." According to Stankevich, the blow is primarily directed against Chernomyrdin "as the strongest political figure next to the president." Stankevich believes that a blow was also delivered against the Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov who has announced his intention to run for presidency in 1996. At a Tuesday meeting with the press the chairman of the Duma committee for economic policy Sergey Glazyev (Democrat) described Version No.1 of a coup in Russia reported by the media as a crude provocation aimed at plunging the country into chaos. According to him, "the rumors are being spread by the same people who are now trying to discredit the movement Accord for Russia." Together with representatives of several Communist and nationalist parties and movements he signed a statement on the formation of the movement last week. In his opinion, the idea of the new movement is civic peace and harmony, the unification of all constructive forces, including the opposition. "Everything that separates people in different parties is insignificant compared to the current danger to our country," Glazyev stressed.
