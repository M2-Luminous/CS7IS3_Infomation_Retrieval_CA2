Check Investment Funds To Be Banned From Taking Part in the Privatization of Russia's Largest Company"] [Text] The Russian Federal Property Fund has announced the commencement of accepting applications to take part in a check auction to sell the Gazprom Russian joint-stock company. The applications will be accepted from 25 April to 1 May. At yesterday's press conference devoted to the event, State Property Committee Chairman Anatoliy Chubays called the privatization of Gazprom "an absolutely unprecedented event," because, according to his estimates, the auction will absorb at least 20 million privatization checks, that is, at least 13 percent of their total number. Some 40 percent of Gazprom's total number of shares will be kept by the state for three years. Around 34 percent of the stock will be offered for sale at check auctions; 10 percent will be bought by Gazprom at face value; 15 percent will be sold under closed subscription to the Gazprom joint-stock company's workers collectives; and the remaining around 1 percent of shares will be owned by the "Rosstroygazifikatsiya" gas distribution company. A noteworthy feature of the company's privatization is that around one-fourth of all shares will be sold in Tyumen Oblast. The shares of other Russian oblasts range from 1 to 4 percent. The State Property Committee chairman pointed out in the press conference that check investment funds will be banned from taking part in the check auction to sell Gazprom stock, because, Anatoliy Chubays stressed, there are plenty of other attractive targets for the funds' activity. Regarding the possible profitability of Gazprom stock and possible dividends for future shareholders, Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of the company's board, said that he did not expect large percentages, because the shareholders' main advantage would be the growth in the shares' market value.
