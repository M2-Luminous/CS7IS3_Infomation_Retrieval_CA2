Pylypchuk, Ukraine people's deputy] [Text] 1. To stop inflation: 1.1 to close the budget deficit by means of: a) increasing revenues by means of: --abolishing all tax relief to all enterprises except ones employing the handicapped; --reducing tax rates to stimulate economic activity; --shifting to taxing prices (sales turnover), thus eliminating the cause of revenue shortfalls due to corruption; --and, implementing mass privatization, which will raise budget revenues. b) Reducing budgetary outlays by means of: --ending financing of capital investment by enterprises; --liquidating industry management entities and their managerial structures at enterprises (reducing expenditures on management); --and, limiting migration to Ukraine by retirees from other countries. 1.2. To close the foreign trade deficit. a) To increase exports by means of: --abolishing export licensing; --reducing export tariffs; --and, putting an end to mass uncontrolled smuggling of goods out of Ukraine, stimulating the development of export potential. b) To reduce imports by means of: --restructuring the existing Ukrainian industrial complex to produce import substitutions and reduce the dependence of the Ukrainian economy on traditional suppliers; --attracting foreign investors with tenders for the production of import substitutions; --diversifying and converting enterprises of the military-industrial complex; --increasing protectionism in nonessential imports; --implementing competitive sale of convertible currency for essential imports; --shifting from centralized distribution and sale to sale and distribution using free market structures; --dissolving the discriminatory agreement with Russia whereby Ukraine bears the responsibility for the debt incurred by Ukrainian businessmen to Russian ones, while Russia bears no such responsibility; --introducing a system of import preferences for raw materials and advanced technology; --intensifying the exploitation of old, and exploration for new, deposits of oil and gas (as well as other resources); -- --and, developing alternative types and sources of energy. 1.3. To eliminate the imbalance in the supply of goods and money on the Ukrainian market. a) To increase the supply of goods and property, by means of: --turning factories, plants, stores, land and housing into salable property; --increasing the stimulus for raising the production of goods and services by privatization; --conducting industry-based tenders for foreign investors (in the course of privatization) to produce goods which are in short supply in Ukraine; --and, effecting liberalization. b) To reduce an inflation-producing monetary overhang, by means of: --banning the National Bank of Ukraine from issuing unsupported (product-less) currency; --banning the National Bank of Ukraine from selling commercial banks reserves as credit resources; --banning commercial banks from issuing loans to loss-making companies; --ensuring positive borrowing rates (credit policy); --banning the Finance Ministry from deficit-funding government expenditures; --raising the velocity of money; --adopting the practice of seeking guarantees from foreign parties for payments to Ukrainian exporters; --abolishing state orders for foreign purchases; --and, establishing a system of economic sanctions for the sale of Ukrainian goods abroad at dumping prices. To implement monetary reform when inflation is stopped. 2. The introduction of the hryvnya 2.1. Before the hryvnya is introduced, a stabilization fund should be created, to consist of: --hard currency revenues from the sale, by international tender, of unfinished construction projects (based on the state privatization program); --short-term hard-currency loans from the population (for the period of 2-to-5 months); --assistance from the International Monetary Fund; --and, golds and precious stones mined in Ukraine. 2.2. To build capacities in Ukraine for: --stamping coins, printing money and producing special paper and ink. 2.3. To introduce the hryvnya at the start of mass privatization. 3. Privatization. 3.1. To implement privatization in a very short time period by subscription to stocks and property through a single computer network and a unified data bank, which will ensure that: --privatization is not an uncontrolled grab for property; --corruption is eliminated from the entire process; --all citizens of Ukraine have equal access to property, independent of location of the property or place of residence; --due to cross-ownership among east and west and north and south, separatist tendencies are reduced and interethnic tension diminished; --investment is attracted along with privatization; --citizens are compensated for the loss of the purchasing power of money stemming from inflation (by payment in kind); --the privatization process is quickly completed, thus improving stimuli for better work; --citizens' social security is taken care of (with the distribution of property), giving them an opportunity to enrich themselves and the state; --the high level of exploitation and one of the main sources of inflation is liquidated, which is connected to the gap between labor input (or produced output) and wages (at private and stock companies salaries are considerably higher than at state enterprises); --and, at the same time, the responsibility of all workers for satisfying consumer demand for goods and services is increased. 4. Division of power and responsibility at different levels of power. 4.1. The central government will retain the responsibility for: --international relations, macroeconomic policy, defense, basic scientific research and control over the implementation of the constitution and the laws. 4.2. The regions will retain the responsibility for: --local economy and protection of civil order. 4.3. The regions and the central government will bear joint responsibility for: --education, culture, health care and environmental protection. 4.4. The enterprises will have the responsibility for: --applied research; --creation of national income; improving efficiency of economic activity; -- competition and bankruptcy; analysis and forecasts of market conditions; -- independent creation of domestic and foreign economic ties, prices, range of products and services they intend to provide and disposition of profits as well as forms, methods and level of wages (total freedom of enterprise); -- and, the environment. 4.5. Budgets and revenue base will be distributed in accordance to articles 4.1. to 4.4. (budgetary independence). 4.6. The regions will be subordinate, accountable and responsible to the central authority in areas which are funded from the general state budget, in issues of upholding Ukrainian laws and in the implementation of reforms. 4.7. While balance in relations between them is being reformed, mutual support by the legislative and executive power should be bolstered by means of: a) limiting the authority of the President of Ukraine to the functions of the head of state; b) the President of Ukraine has the responsibility of appointing the Prime Minister, with the consent of parliament; c) after its nomination by the Prime Minister, the entire Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is to be confirmed by the Supreme Council of Ukraine; d) if a government resigns, the Supreme Council will immediately suspend its own authority (new elections). This clause will increase the responsibility of the Ukraine Supreme Council both for nominating the Cabinet of Ministers and for cooperating with it (for the state of affairs in the government). Local authorities will function similarly. 5. To ensure reliable social security for the population. 5.1. For the pensioners: --by providing pensions equal to 70 percent of workers' wages; stopping migration to Ukraine by pensioners who are not Ukraine citizens; and, providing special assistance to the handicapped and the poor. 5.2. For large families (poor), to provide child assistance in kind to bring them up to the poverty level. 5.3. To eliminate the negative consequences of the rise in unemployment (beyond the existing system of payments to the unemployed): a) to eliminate absolute unemployment (when the number of existing jobs is smaller than the number of people in the workforce), by means of: --first, extending maternity leave for mothers until the child reaches the age of up to six years. In this case, all budgetary expenditures on preschool care should be passed on to mothers. This approach will help achieve other social goals: the child will get more education and care in the family; --family upbringing and care will reduce disease, improve moral aspects of child rearing and strengthen ties and mutual understanding between children and parents; --second, increasing the number of jobs for underemployed professions using funds from the budget; --and, third, establishing and developing market infrastructure by transforming unemployed collectives into marketing and monitoring services, market study groups, brokerage houses, banks, etc.; b) to eliminate relative unemployment (if in the country overall the number of jobs is greater than the number of people in the workforce): --regional unemployment (in cases when unemployment exists in one region while another suffers from a labor shortage) will be eliminated by means of an accelerated privatization of housing and creation of a housing market. In this case, the unemployed will be able to sell their housing in the region where there is unemployment and buy it where there is a labor shortage. This approach does not require budgetary expenditures; --skills and professions-related unemployment (in cases when a region has job vacancies but job requirements call for different skills or professional qualifications than those possessed by the local unemployed) can be eliminated with the help of budget funds (an unemployment fund) and funds from enterprises, by providing professional retraining for the unemployed. In this area, organizational work will be provided by the Ukraine employment service, once it gets the necessary authority. 5.4. To repay domestic debts to Ukraine citizens. a) To compensate citizens for the loss of value of their savings by means of: --transferring state property in the course of privatization, with the help of privatization certificates, and indexing average annual account balances and using them as funds for privatization. b) To repay USSR state obligations, by means of: --exchanging them for Ukrainian state debt (when it is issued); --indexing the obligations and transforming them into possible means of payment in privatization; --and, in the next four years, repaying in cash the indexed value of the obligations to those citizens who decide not to use them as a means of payment in privatization. c) To repay winning claims in cash and property lotteries of the former USSR, by means of: --repaying monetary prizes in the course of four years, based on the actual value of property that has been won. 5.5. While implementing reforms, to ensure their social orientation in the following areas: --income growth; --increase in the living standard; --opportunities for family vacations, including also abroad; --protection for economic interests of individuals; --social security for individuals; --protection for the family; --inviolate right to housing and other property; --reduction of the fiscal responsibility of the state for individuals and businesses; --development of the paternalistic concern for workers on the part of enterprises; --freedom to choose employment and to dispose of property; --and, environmental protection. 6. Reform of the agricultural sector. 6.1.1. To divide productive land into three categories. 6.1. Reform of land property rights should be carried out based on the following division: --first, land that lies fallow (where kolkhozes and sovkhozes have been dissolved) or where there is no productive population; --second, land that belongs to functioning kolkhozes and sovkhozes which have no hope of repaying their debts; --and, third, land that belongs to economically viable kolkhozes and sovkhozes. a) Land of the first category should be leased to everyone who is willing to become a farmer, for a period of five years. If in five years they become efficient producers, their land will be given to them free of charge, as their property. If they are unable to obtain projected yields for the crops that they cultivate (productive exploitation), they would be able to purchase that land or it would be leased to others for the period of five years; b) kolkhozes and sovkhozes functioning on land of the second category should be offered to divide their land and property, so that those who wish could leave them and become independent farmers. Other kolkhoz members could use their shares to set up cooperatives, collective farms or proprietor and shareholder associations. If members of a kolkhoz agree to this type of reform, the state will assume (write off) its hopeless debts. If they do not, such kolkhozes will be declared bankrupt and their property will be leased to those who wish to become independent farmers (in accordance to the process described in Article 6.1.a.); c) collective farms functioning on land of the third category will not be reformed or reformed only with the consent of their labor collectives (to prevent the repetition of the mistakes of 1930-33, when strong farms and farmers, those who fed the country, were liquidated). However, all agricultural management entities will be eliminated (RAPO, OAPO and others), and agricultural workers will become entirely free and independent in their economic activity. After reform, land owners will decide themselves, in the conditions of a free market and competition, what is the best form of organization for agricultural production: some farmers will join together and perhaps some kolkhozes will split up (of those belonging to the third category of land), but it will be as the result of the natural choice and needs of the owners themselves. 6.1.2. Diversification of farm activities. It is a known fact that underdeveloped nations sell raw materials and not finished goods. The same is true in farming. For example, in November 1993 the state bought 1 kilo of meat for K9,000 and sold 1 kilo of sausage (made of 2 kilos of meat) for K100,000. We propose: a) in 1994, at the initial stage of reform, to instruct the processing industry to pay for processing agricultural raw materials with a share (of up to 25 percent) of finished output. (So that up to 75 percent of prepared sausage, butter, sugar, etc. will revert to agricultural enterprises. By selling finished products, agricultural workers will considerably improve the financial health of their farms.) b) To order from the military-industrial complex (where capacities remain idle) a required quantity of small-scale but fully automated meat processing, butter producing, cheese making, vegetable preserving (canning) and baking plants which would be built on the countryside. To transfer (or auction) some stores to the agricultural sector. In this case, all the profits which today accrue to purchasing, transportation and processing entities, as well as wholesale and retail trade, will go to producers not of meat and corn, but of finished products (i.e., sausage, butter, etc.) on the countryside. In this case, workers on the countryside will no longer need subsidies: their farms will be highly profitable. c) Financial assistance for the countryside. Existing countryside subsidies in the budget should be retained, for the following purposes: --to order fully automated plants for the processing of vegetable and animal products (for the time period necessary to the countryside to build up its own processing base); --for the purchase of agricultural machinery for newly created farms (for a period of one year); --for the purchase of mineral fertilizers and means of chemical protection of crops (herbicides, defoliants, insecticides, etc.) for a period of two years following reform; --subsequently, financial subsidies would be redirected to the development of the social infrastructure. d) To develop full and wasteless processing of agricultural products on the countryside: --feathers, hides, horns, hooves, etc., with the goal of improving the efficiency of production. 7. To safeguard economic security of Ukraine by means of: --diversifying the supplier base; --diversifying markets for Ukrainian output; --diversifying entities involved in foreign business activity; --diversifying functions of enterprise; --building up state supplies and reserves; --freeing up enterprise; --reorienting domestic production toward import substitution; --adopting protectionist policies; --intensifying exploration of domestic deposits, including also of energy sources; --developing energy production using domestic sources; --introducing new, alternative sources of energy; --developing export potential of Ukraine; --de-monopolizing the economy and encouraging competition; --stabilizing the monetary system and introducing currency convertibility; --banning the sale of Ukrainian territory; --improving the living standard of the population by means of reform; --the banking system; --business relations; --the payment system; --state economic regulation; --and, development of property market infrastructure. 8. Economic management in the state sector. 8.1. a) The enterprise manager in the state sector of the economy will be hired on a contract basis and is the only and plenipotentiary representative of the state (as the owner of the property) at the enterprise. He organizes the work of the enterprise within the limits of, and based on, existing laws of Ukraine; --contract provisions and conditions set by the state property fund. Within the constraints set by contract provisions and conditions set by the state property fund, the manager bears sole and personal responsibility before the Ministry of the State Sector of the Economy. b) The manager hires all enterprise employees on a contract basis and can fire any of them for violating contract provisions or based on a court decision. c) The following indicators of efficiency of the use of state property will be used: --productivity growth rate; --growth rate for return on capital; --growth rate for competitive output production; --relationship between growth rates of the salary fund and of output, in comparable prices; --indicators of reorientation of the Ukrainian economy; --import-export balance; --share of output sold domestically in Ukraine. 8.1.2. The Ministry of the State Sector of the Economy has no right to: --establish managerial superstructures over the enterprise; --require the manager to provide any information, excluding specified statistical data; --insist on the implementation of any orders relating to the economic and financial, business or scientific and technological activities of the enterprise; --change conditions of the contract with the manager; --remove the manager if he carries out contract provisions, if the enterprise conforms to established indicators and if the activities of the manager and the enterprise are in accordance with existing laws and fulfill the requirements of the state property fund, based on specified conditions. 8.1.3. The state property fund determines for the manager: --the share of the property that can be used as a collateral. Agreements which exceed the share limit set by the fund are declared null and void at the time of their signing; --and, targets for privatizing enterprise property. 8.1.4. In connection with the transfer to the Ukraine Cabinet of Minister of responsibility for managing the property of the state, to create the Ukraine Ministry of the State Sector of the Economy, the main functions of which will be: --to establish, reorganize and liquidate state enterprises and to approve their statutes; --to hire and remove enterprise managers, in accordance with Ukraine laws and contract provisions; --and, to organize the implementation of planned annual inspections of enterprise financial and economic activities in order to exercise control over effective use of state property. Inspections may not exceed 20 calendar days. 8.1.5. In every enterprise, a supervisory committee will be established, comprised of three persons drawn from its employees, who will function as representatives of, and will be appointed by: --the Ukraine Ministry of Finance, the state property fund and the Ministry of the State Sector of the Economy. The supervisory committee at every enterprise will be set up by the joint decision of the above-mentioned organizations. Members of the supervisory committee can function as such at several other enterprises (excepting competing enterprises). Members of the supervisory committee must be appraised of all contracts of the enterprise, instructions from the manager and financial documents; --they will supervise compliance with laws and contract provisions and analyze the effectiveness of the utilization of property in accordance with the established indicators. When violations are uncovered, they will be obligated to report them to those organizations that have appointed them. Members of the supervisory committee will not be allowed to ask for information from the manager and other enterprise executives or demand explanations from them, but will be able to submit requests for additional information. Members of the supervisory committee will not have the right to give orders to the manager and enterprise employees, but can provide optional advice. Members of the supervisory committee will not be allowed to divulge, orally or in writing, any information which concerns any aspects of enterprise activities, expect to the organizations by which they have been appointed. Those guilty of disclosure of information will be prosecuted. 8.2 Macroeconomic regulation. 8.2.1. Activities in the economic area will be divided as follows: a) the state will not intrude in any way in the business and financial activity of enterprises (state no more than private ones). The state will not be involved in trade (either domestic or foreign). Those functions will be fully transferred to enterprises. b) The state will influence the economic situation in the country only by interest rate, credit, exchange rate and monetary policies, reserve requirements, tax rates and protectionist policy, as well as by means of quotas, preferences and sanctions.
