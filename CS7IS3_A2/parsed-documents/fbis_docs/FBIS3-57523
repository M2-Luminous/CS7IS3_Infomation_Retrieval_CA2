Marchuk, a statement (the text was supplied), containing a request to evaluate President L. Kravchuk's activity during the negotiations with the presidents of the United States and Russia on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. This statement, in fact, accuses the Ukrainian president of violations of the law to the extent of high treason. However, the impression arises that the UNA leadership had not read Marchuk in HOLOS UKRAYINY 12 December 1992 where he insisted on the expediency of Ukraine's staying under the "nuclear shield of Russia," in other words, on the current policy of the total nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. For that reason, I find it inappropriate to demand that Marchuk does the evaluation. This conclusion not only applies to the UNA appeal, but also to the analogous statement by the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]. The validity of the above interpretation is confirmed, at least, by the fact that the transfer to Russia of the "Sword" -- the tactical nuclear weapons -- is known to have been completed on the night of 5 and 6 May 1992. It remains to be hoped that opponents of the Ukrainian president in the ranks of the UNA and UKRP will also agree that the same people must be among those who have planned and those who are implementing the measures for withdrawing the entire "Sword" and "Shield" (strategic nuclear weapons) complex from Ukraine.
