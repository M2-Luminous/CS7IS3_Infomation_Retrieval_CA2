FR940426-1-00018 FR940426-1-00004 2. Particular Distribution Contexts One example of significant changes in securities sales practices that have affected the administration of Rule 10b&hyph;6 pertains to the sale of securities pursuant to issuer stock purchase plans. Presently, Rule 10b&hyph;6 contains an exception for distributions of securities by an issuer or a subsidiary of an issuer to employees or shareholders of the issuer, its subsidiaries, or a trustee or other person acquiring such securities for the account of such employees or shareholders pursuant to a plan. 52 On its face, this exception applies irrespective of the magnitude of the offering or the nature of the selling efforts. Traditionally, stock purchase plans were seen as mechanisms by which employees and shareholders, i.e., persons having a significant relationship with the issuer, could increase their holdings, rather than as major capital-raising vehicles. These distributions have not been viewed as presenting the same incentives for manipulation by the issuer as in other distributions because of the limited nature of the sales, as well as the relationship between the issuer and plan participants. 53 52 Paragraph (e). ``Plan'' is broadly defined in Paragraph (c)(4) as a ``bonus, profit-sharing, pension, retirement, thrift, savings, incentive, stock purchase, stock ownership, stock appreciation, stock option, dividend reinvestment or similar plan for employees or shareholders of an issuer.'' 53 See generally Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16646 (March 13, 1980), 45 FR 18948; Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17556 (February 17, 1981), 46 FR 15133. Today, however, issuer plans often are available not only to employees and shareholders, but also to outside directors, franchisees, customers, and others having varying relationships with the issuer. Moreover, plan distributions may be used as significant capital-raising mechanisms. 54 In the case of plans open to persons other than shareholders or employees, sales of a security to the plan do not qualify for the Paragraph (e) exception. As a result, absent an exemption from Rule 10b&hyph;6, issuers and other distribution participants are required to comply with Rule 10b&hyph;6. Even with respect to plans that qualify for the Paragraph (e) exception, the more recent use of such plans to broadly distribute the issuer's securities may not have been contemplated by the Commission when Paragraph (e) was adopted. 54 See Banks Raising Millions in Equity By Giving Discounts to Arbitragers, Am. Banker, September 17, 1992, at 1. Other changes in the distribution process, such as those arising from the adoption of Rules 415 and 430A under the Securities Act, 55 also have complicated the distribution analysis. 56 55 17 CFR 230.415, 430A. 56 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23611 (September 11, 1986), 51 FR 33242. For purposes of Rule 10b&hyph;6, the Commission has viewed a distribution pursuant to a shelf registration statement under Rule 415 as constituting a unitary distribution throughout the effectiveness of the shelf. Id. at 33243. Question 1.1. Should the Commission continue to define the term ``distribution,'' and if so, should the Commission continue to define the term based on the ``magnitude of the offering'' and the presence of ``special selling efforts and selling methods''? If so, are there identifiable factors that can be used to determine whether an offering satisfies these criteria? Commenters may wish to suggest criteria that distinguish ``distributions'' from ``ordinary trading transactions.''
