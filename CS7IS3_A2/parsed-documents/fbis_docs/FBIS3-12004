Will your government promote the appropriate negotiations? [Fujimori] I believe in the future of integration. We must take concrete steps and not merely deliver speeches because this time is over. There is rapprochement with Chile in every field, and so it would also be a good step. We are ready. [ESTRATEGIA] In what areas are Chile and Peru complementary? [Fujimori] We must study the details, but I believe trade relations could grow enormously, for example, in the agro-industrial and mining-metallurgical areas. [ESTRATEGIA] Will bilateral border problems influence the political decision of promoting an agreement with Chile? [Fujimori] Not at all. We must overcome all these relics. We require a bit more communication and dialogue before we can overcome the inactivity and the arms race which caused so much damage. As I said at the Rio de Janeiro summit, Peru has taken concrete steps to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and we have removed entire battalions from the Chilean border. I do not believe border problems will prevent development between the two countries. The trauma is being overcome. In high schools, a lot was taught about Tarapaca, but now Arica is being mentioned. [ESTRATEGIA] Will Peru seek entry into NAFTA? [Fujimori] Yes, we are preparing for that. Compared with other Latin American countries, our economy is quite open because we have made huge progress. During the past two years, our industries have been transforming at a speed never seen before. We believe we will soon be ready to join and be fully competitive with large blocs. [ESTRATEGIA] Does your administration favor joining large trade blocs like the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]? [Fujimori] Unfortunately, there are various degrees of progress in the economic field. Despite various years of backwardness, I believe Peru has achieved rapid advancement in the past two years. We have removed all subsidies. We have imposed a 15 percent tariff and our economy is totally open. We have surpassed some Andean Pact members and thus had to cancel our participation temporarily. We have achieved bilateral agreements with Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, and we also hope to achieve one with Chile. I first want to consider Latin America as a group, like Mercosur, and then join NAFTA. [ESTRATEGIA] Chilean entrepreneurs have complained of some problems in investing in Peru, specifically in the private pensions area. What progress has been made to solve these problems? [Fujimori] We have profited from the Chilean experience and have removed negative features. Nevertheless, there are some differences involving the Peruvian AFP's [Pension Fund Managing Companies] that we have been attempting to correct. One is the difference between the percentage contributed by the state social security and the percentage contributed by the AFP. The difference involves about 7 percent of salaries. We are studying this issue so that the AFP and the State Social Security will be on the same level. It is obviously more advantageous for a company whose workers are contributing to the state social security to have them under such a state system because its cost is 7 percent less. Nevertheless, I believe there are ways to correct this situation. There has been a delay in the entry of state workers into the AFP system. This has been overcome through a legal mechanism and the reentry of state workers into the AFP has already been allowed with the employer-state contributions delayed until May. This situation, however, will not represent a problem for the AFP. There is another problem involving the jurisdiction of the AFP. The problem involves its investments, which will be overcome through the issuance of Treasury bonds. [ESTRATEGIA] What is the current situation of labor unions in Peru? [Fujimori] They are certainly relevant, and we give them the importance they deserve. The labor movement is currently non-politicized. Most workers do not accept a political affiliation. Of course there are movements that demand better labor and salary conditions, but they do not maintain a political stance. I can assure you we have a labor law that guarantees investments and labor movement will not be obstructive. [ESTRATEGIA] Given a strong inflow of money as a result of the privatizations, you have said your government will reconsider its economic management but without changing the current program. What changes will be made? [Fujimori] Our economic program has certain macroeconomic goals in the field of inflation, monetary expansion, and growth. We foresaw an income of about $1 billion from the privatizations, part of which would go to the national budget. But the situation has changed suddenly and we will obtain more than $3 billion. This probably means long- and medium-term investments could be financed with funds from the Treasury without resorting to costly bank loans. This is small change we are introducing into the economic program. But the rules of the game remain the same; we are considering ways to inject this inflow of dollars into our economy. One way is through medium- and long-term investments in hydroelectric plants or paved highways. We will seek investments with a greater proportion of imported components because we do not want a monetary mass that can exert inflationary pressures. We have enough reserves as result of all these privatizations. [ESTRATEGIA] Privatizations have been your main economic accomplishment, but some criticize that they were carried out too slowly and that sale prices were below the real value of the assets. [Fujimori] It is interesting that the government was right when it established an agenda of privatizations. We were not willing to privatize at the speed some economists demand because we did not know the real value of our public companies. The prices of our public companies are increasing so we will sell them at the appropriate moment. I am sure that a year ago we would have not obtained the price that was finally paid for CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] and Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise]. We also have companies for which no one would have paid anything, like Centromin-Peru [Central Peru Mining Enterprise]. Several important groups now want to buy it. I can tell you more: a cement factory, for example, whose base price was $30 million was finally sold for $67 million. Our public companies now have a real value, there is interest, security, guarantees, and a legal framework to guarantee investments. Above everything, there is an atmosphere of total internal security. [ESTRATEGIA] What economic results do you expect for 1994? [Fujimori] We have established two important parameters: Annual inflation will not be greater than 25 percent and economic growth will be greater than 5 percent; we also expect social investments to be 40 or 50 percent greater than in 1993, that is, about $800 million. Economic growth was 7 percent last year, the greatest in the American continent, and inflation was below 40 percent. We almost complied with our goal which was something like 35 percent. [ESTRATEGIA] What other problems is the Peruvian economy confronting? [Fujimori] I believe we have overcome most of our problems, although we are, certainly, still at a recessionary level, because of the dollar being underrated -- not because of economic problems, but because of drug trafficking -- and because of the relatively high interest rates. We want to uproot those problems. Concerning the exchange rate, we are doing more efficient work, concentrating in antinarcotics actions all the efforts that were previously made in the antiterrorist fight. We hope to significantly stem the flow of narcodollars. Some $1 billion might be currently entering Peru, and this is far too much to be absorbed. Concerning interest rates, we hope privatization of Interbanc and Continental Bank -- two sound enterprises -- will make interest rates drop. [ESTRATEGIA] What reforms do you expect to implement to modernize the economy even further? [Fujimori] Over the next few months there will be no major measures. We will promote farming with measures aiming at stabilizing farm product prices. This entails the adoption of flexible tariffs, so that Peruvian food products like wheat, rice, corn, and milk -- which are also the main imported food items -- remain stable. We want farmers to capitalize. At the same time, we will take care of pacification. Even though it is true that no liberal policy has yet been enforced for the agricultural area, we hope to design one in 1996. [ESTRATEGIA] In a hypothetical case, if you do not run for reelection, don't you think the economic program might be endangered? [Fujimori] (Smiles.) It would be difficult to go backward after the progress we have made. Even though there are always risks, all social sectors support the government policy -- especially the economic policy. The entire reform program that we enforced over a record period has had massive support in the poorer zones of the country. What the government should now do is enforce a social program to end poverty, in order to consolidate all the reforms. This will then guarantee that people will not choose a president who will bring retrogression. [ESTRATEGIA] Some analysts believe that your country is very well, but they wonder: What will come after Fujimori? [Fujimori] The best guarantee is the position of the Peruvian people, who will not agree to retrogression or to a populist or paternalistic policy in the style of previous administrations. [ESTRATEGIA] But if we consider the results of the previous plebiscite, in which the government position won by a small margin... [Fujimori] There were distorting factors that did not reflect the support for the government work. For example, on the death penalty there were negative votes, even if voters were government supporters, or because there was a campaign that distorted some concepts, and this reduced the difference of votes. Yet all polls reveal a majority support, an average of two-thirds, for the president's work, despite the fact that very drastic measures have been enforced. [ESTRATEGIA] Are you going to run in next year's presidential elections? [Fujimori] I have not made up my mind yet, even though the Constitution and the people have called on me to do so. I should make a decision at the beginning of October. [ESTRATEGIA] Could you name your political heirs? [Fujimori] I would rather not talk about heirs, but it is possible to see a wide range of candidates on the political scene, even though they are not yet fully consolidated. In all likelihood the names of some candidates will be known in the forthcoming months. [ESTRATEGIA] There are those who have been mentioning the name of one of your sons... [Fujimori] (He breaks into a hearty laugh) For 2015; Kenji, who is 14 years old, accompanies me on all my trips to the interior and abroad. Some caricatures of him were done at one time, calling him the deputy foreign minister. A public opinion poll conducted by Apoyo among 1,000 entrepreneurs showed that Kenji ranks seventh as the most influential person in the country, followed by the chairman of the Council of Ministers. [ESTRATEGIA] What are the advantages and drawbacks of your administration? [Fujimori] There are no drawbacks. The advantages are that I have party values. There is a leadership, a clear direction; there is no tug of war between political parties. We can thus pursue our political, social, and economic policy without encountering major setbacks. There is no such thing as the typical attacks made by politicians. We can tackle problems rationally, objectively, and in a strictly technical way. This leads to better results, because political considerations do not always prevail over technical ones. The nonexistence of a party structure, therefore, expedites the decisionmaking process. [ESTRATEGIA] What laws that have not been enacted would you have liked Congress to pass? [Fujimori] With regard to the previous Congress, the economic reform would not have prospered, because if it was not Congress, it was the judiciary that kept changing it; or else, the Constitutional Court did it. There is still much to be done at Congress -- articles, laws, legal principles must be reviewed. [ESTRATEGIA] To conclude, what message would you like to send to Chilean investors? [Fujimori] Peru is a country with a future. It can be one of the superstars in the next years. There are good guarantees for making business; we have great natural resources, a growing market that is unexplored. I think that it has enormous possibilities. I would like to tell Chilean companies that our government policy is at present trying to enhance productivity conditions by improving infrastructure. My message is that they become acquainted with our reality, that they embark on new business ventures in Peru, including investments and tourism. This is not just my personal opinion; it is a fact.
