The race for victory in the federal elections on 16 October is "wide open again," Verheugen said in Bonn this evening. Anyone who thinks that the SPD is already down and out has now been "taught a lesson," he said. Verheugen stressed that the SPD is the "clear victor" of the election in Saxony-Anhalt. The government of Minister-President Christoph Bergner [Christian Democratic Union -- CDU] has been "voted out," he said. Verheugen pointed to the "dramatic losses" of the coalition partners CDU and Free Democratic Party [FDP]. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping was also pleased that the Social Democrats in Saxony-Anhalt have achieved such a brilliant result. [passage omitted] Commenting on the FDP's losses, Verheugen said the party is paying the price for its "fraternization" with the CDU.
