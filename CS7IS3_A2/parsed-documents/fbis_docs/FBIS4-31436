Berisha said that Albania is interested in Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] stability. "We encourage the Albanians that they should be a factor of stability for Macedonia, just as we insist that the recognition of human and national rights of the Albanians residing there serves the stability of the Macedonian state itself. In this context, mutual respect between the Albanians and Macedonians is of specific importance," President Berisha said. Mr. Andov appreciated the Albanian policy in the Balkans as well the facilities Albania has created to Macedonia to cope with the Greek embargo. He demanded from President Berisha Albania's support for Macedonia's membership of CSCE, the Black Sea initiative as well as other institutions, whose member Albania is. President Berisha assured the speaker of the Macedonian Parliament that Albania will support Macedonia's membership of CSCE as well as its membership in the Black Sea initiative. "I consider the enlargement of the Black Sea initiative with a new member as a very significant moment," he said.
