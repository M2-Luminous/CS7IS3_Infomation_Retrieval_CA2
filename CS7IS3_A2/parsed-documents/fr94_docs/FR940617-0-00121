FR940617-0-00121 FR940617-0-00026 First, EPA disagrees with the commenter's contention that the nonroad engine definition ``equates'' nonroad engines with nonroad equipment. The nonroad engine definition is written to include only engines, and cannot be read to include equipment. The definition clearly refers only to ``engines used in'' certain applications, not to the applications themselves. Moreover, this definition has been promulgated pursuant to numerous comments received by the Agency, discussed above, that assert that the most appropriate definition of nonroad engine is one that refers to the use or application of the engine. EPA also notes that this rulemaking does not promulgate any standards for nonroad equipment, only for nonroad engines. The only restriction on nonroad equipment manufacturers in this rulemaking is a prohibition on the use of uncertified nonroad engines manufactured after the applicable implementation dates. This prohibition is necessary to enforce the engine-based standards and is authorized under the Clean Air Act. In addition, EPA does not agree that it lacks authority to regulate nonroad equipment or particular applications of nonroad engines. CAA section 213, as well as section 301(a), provide EPA with authority to regulate both nonroad equipment and particular applications of nonroad engines, as well as nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles. Congress used the terms ``nonroad engine,'' ``equipment,'' and ``vehicle'' interchangeably (see, e.g., S. Rep., Legislative History of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Committee on Environment and Public Works to accompany S. 1630, December 20, 1989, at 104&hyph;105). It is EPA's belief that Congress intended nonroad vehicles and engines to be inclusive terms covering all manner and types of equipment not defined as motor vehicles, vehicles for competition, or stationary sources (see, e.g., H. Rep., Legislative History of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Committee on Energy and Commerce to accompany H.R. 3030, May 17, 1990, at 310). There is no evidence that Congress intended to limit the reach of its nonroad mandate to self-propelled vehicles; on the contrary, it appears that Congress used the term vehicle to include any carrier for the engine. Section 213 and the rest of the CAA provide EPA with authority to regulate nonroad equipment and particular applications of nonroad engines in nonroad equipment. The Act provides equal authority to regulate off-highway mobile cranes, which are nonroad vehicles, and lawnmowers, which are nonroad equipment. Moreover, the interpretation of EPA's authority suggested by the commenter would undermine the environmental and public health benefits of the nonroad emission reduction program by creating a gaping loophole. EPA can find no evidence that Congress intended the regulation of certain nonroad engines, vehicles, and equipment that cause or contribute to air pollution, but not the regulation of others. Finally, there is a practical interrelationship between an engine and the equipment that houses it or is powered by it. Equipment or vehicle characteristics may have a significant impact on the emissions associated with the operation of the engine. The nonroad engine definition relies to a great extent on this interrelationship between an engine and a piece of equipment to determine whether an engine is a mobile or stationary source. In the future development of the nonroad program, EPA may determine that it is most effective to test and certify a nonroad engine integrally with its related equipment, rather than separately. Additionally, it may become necessary and appropriate to regulate aspects of equipment to control fuel spillage, evaporative emissions, or refueling emissions. EPA believes that the CAA provides authority for such regulation. EPA does not believe Congress, in giving EPA the authority to regulate all nonroad engines, intended to create an artificial barrier between the engine and the equipment that houses it. Therefore, if EPA determines in future rulemakings that the most effective way to control emissions from nonroad engines is to regulate directly the nonroad equipment housing the engines, EPA shall do so using its authority under the Clean Air Act. V. Requirements of the Final Rule This section provides a general overview of the major elements of the final rule. A general discussion of comments submitted to EPA during the public comment periods is presented in section VI.
