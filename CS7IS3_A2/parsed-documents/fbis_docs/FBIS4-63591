In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that transparent borders would provide the best conditions for relations not only between Ukraine, the Crimea and Russia, but also all CIS states. He regretted that unlike the rest of Europe, CIS countries are moving in the opposite direction, but only to realise with time that they will not be able to do without integration. "The willingness of some Ukrainian politicians to fence off from Russia is conducive to the worsening of the social and psychological climate in society," Filatov said.
