Hong Kong immigration authorities are believed to be assisting them apply for asylum in South Korea. But South Korea is already entangled in a diplomatic row with its northern rival over an increasing flow of defectors heading south-- the incidence of which the Pyongyang government maintains is being fabricated by South Korea. The Hong Kong government has kept a firm lid on details about the two illegal immigrants since they were picked up separately by border patrols at Sha Tau Kok within two days of each other a week ago. The first was detained last Friday, and the other on Sunday. They crossed the border on foot during daylight--one picked up at the fence, the other further across the border. Initially regarded as illegal immigrants from China, the two revealed their identities during questioning. They were then handed to immigration authorities, and are being held at an undisclosed location. A Security Branch spokesman issued only a brief statement in response to questions about the detainees. "We can confirm that two illegal immigrants who claim to be from North Korea arrived in Hong Kong separately on the 11th and 13th of March," he said. "The matter is now being investigated." Security sources have voiced concern that Hong Kong may face a wave of refugees from North Korea as Pyongyang wrestles with economic hardship and food shortages. The Hong Kong Government remains anxious not to disclose details of the detainees in case Hong Kong is forced to become a conduit for North Korean defectors heading for South Korea. The number of North Korean defectors had increased in recent years since Pyongyang's European communist allies began disintegrating in 1989. Since then, 60 North Koreans have been allowed to enter South Korea, mostly through third countries. But South Korea's acceptance of the defectors is exacerbating tensions between the two Koreas. In fact, South Korea has already become a sanctuary for a stream of North Koreans defecting from Russia and China. Hundreds of North Koreans are reported to be wandering through Russia and China after escaping from logging camps in Siberia. South Korea's ambassador to Beijing, Hwang Pyong-tae claimed that in China, five or six people a week tried to defect to South Korea. Late last year, a young man claiming to be a North Korean soldier attempting to obtain asylum in South Korea, was detained in Hong Kong after crossing the border from China. He was sent back to China when the South Korean Consulate could not verify his account.
