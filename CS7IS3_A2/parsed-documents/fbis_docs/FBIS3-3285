He said: There are still weeks for the United States to make a decision on the question of the renewal of most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment for China. He promised he would do his utmost to remove differences between the two countries. He went on to say: "Our policy is that human rights are important, but so are the other issues." These remarks seem to show that there has been some change in the official U.S. approach toward China. Hence, it is being followed with great interest by all sides concerned. As everybody knows, in recent years, the U.S. Government has endlessly brought pressure to bear on China and interfered in the latter's internal affairs by using the human rights issue as a pretext. While visiting China a few days ago, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was all the more fierce and overbearing in a vain attempt to compel China to yield on the human rights issue. Before that, the U.S. assistant secretary of state responsible for human rights made contact with a Chinese criminal released on parole without authorization. This was a violation of Chinese law. This at least shows that at that time, the United States lacked sincerity to improve its relations with China. The Chinese side has denounced the United States' stand on the human rights issue in stern terms and expounded China's attitude toward the issue. As a result, Sino- U.S. negotiations on the human rights issue have reached an impasse. China has rejected the U.S. threat to revoke MFN treatment. Clearly, the human rights demands set by the United States on China do not correspond to the reality in China. It is even more absurd to lump together the so-called human rights issue and the MFN issue. Chinese leaders have clearly pointed out: Differences between China and the United States should be resolved by adhering to the spirit of respecting each other and seeking common ground while reserving differences and through consultations on an equal footing. At the same time, the Chinese also frankly told the Americans that if MFN was revoked, not just China would be hurt, and the United States would be hurt more than China. It would lose the huge Chinese market. The U.S. policy of bringing pressure to bear on China has met intense criticism at home and abroad. At a symposium on relations between the United States and China in Washington on 15 March, eminent American scholars, politicians, and entrepreneurs urged the Clinton administration one after another to continue granting MFN to China. Two former U.S. secretaries of states, Henry Kissinger and Cyrus Vance, opposed linking MFN and human rights. Most speakers at the symposium agreed: Once the United States revokes MFN, this will surely invite Chinese retaliation and lead to a sharp drop in the volume of Sino-U.S. trade. This will not only seriously hinder economic relations between the United States and China but will also harm political relations between the two countries. Using his corporation's own experience as an example, a representative of the U.S. Boeing Corporation pointed out: In the coming 15 years, China will need 800 civilian aircraft, and will thus become the world's third largest aviation market. At present, U.S. aircraft makers are in a favorable position. If the United States revokes China's MFN, European aircraft makers will certainly replace it. It is quite natural that they are dissatisfied with current U.S. policy toward China. In the international community, the U.S. policy of linking human rights and MFN has also met universal opposition. Moreover, even its allies have not followed suit. The fact that the Canadian prime minister announced yesterday that he would visit China soon is the latest proof. It can thus be said that it is precisely because U.S. China policy has run into snags in China, in the United States, and everywhere in the world that President Clinton delivered his mild sounding speech on U.S. China policy the day before yesterday. While welcoming the speech, people will not be so naive as to believe that Sino-U.S. relations will embark on a smooth road hereafter. We maintain: First of all, we must earnestly observe how President Clinton revises his "presidential executive order" on the issue of renewing China's MFN and how he handles the issue practically. China sincerely hopes to establish a normal, friendly, and cooperative relationship with the United States. However, since it differs with the latter in ideology and values, China will not expect too much or cherish unrealistic illusions.
