FBIS4-6247 "dreas075_c_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 North Korea Repatriation of Former POW's in ROK Demanded Repatriation of Former POW's in ROK Demanded Red Cross Group Sends Letter SK1904113294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1100 GMT 19 Apr 94 SK1904113294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, in a letter sent today to Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean Red Cross, urged the South side once again to show a positive response at an early date to the reasonable demand of the North for an immediate repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, prisoners of war. The letter says: The South side in a telephone message December 3 last year turned down the reasonable demand of the North for the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, contending that they did not belong to the category of prisoners of war because of their guerrilla activities and acceptance of nationality. Its wrong attitude and assertion are quite contrary to the humanitarianism of Red Cross. According to international law, those who are arrested by the warring party while in action are to be considered prisoners of war, be they soldiers or guerrillas. Therefore, Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan must be treated as prisoners of war and should have been repatriated under the Korean Armistice Agreement. The South side's refusal of their repatriation on the ground of their nationality acceptance shows that it acts contrary to the humanitarianism of Red Cross, manipulated by some seditious forces that dislike national reconciliation and unity. As you know, Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan do not want to live in South Korea and have already asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to help them in their repatriation to the North. The two daughters of Kim In-so, the sister of Ham Se-hwan in her eighties and other family members and relatives in the northern half of the country are earnestly wishing their repatriation to the North. We hold that the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who are undeniably prisoners of war, must be realised at an early date as required by the Korean Armistice Agreement and the international law on prisoners of war, unhindered by any pretext or condition.
