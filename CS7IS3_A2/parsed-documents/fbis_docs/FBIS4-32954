Specialists at that plant report that the average output exceeds 270 megawatts and that the recent repairs did away with other problems that obstructed the continuous generation of power. A one-month maintenance outage is projected for September, which will allow regulating 50 percent of the turbine valves, clean the boiler, and repair auxiliary equipment. The Antonio Guiteras Electric Plant is the most efficient of its kind in Cuba and has achieved more than 40 percent of its electric production goals for 1994.
