FR940118-0-00010 FR940118-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 4 RIN 2900&hyph;AE11 Schedule for Rating Disabilities; Genitourinary System Disabilities AGENCY: Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final regulation. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its Schedule for Rating Disabilities of the Genitourinary System. This amendment is based on a General Accounting Office (GAO) study noting that there has been no comprehensive review of the rating schedule since 1945, and recommending that such a review be conducted. The effect of this action is to update the genitourinary portion of the rating schedule to ensure that it uses current medical terminology, unambiguous criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review. DATES: This amendment is effective February 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bob Seavey, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In December 1988, the General Accounting Office (GAO) recommended that VA prepare a plan for a comprehensive review of the rating schedule and, based on the results, revise the medical criteria accordingly. As part of the process to implement these recommendations, VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 4.115 and 4.115a in the Federal Register of December 2, 1991 (56 FR 61216&hyph;20). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions or objections on or before January 2, 1992. We received comments from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and VA employees. We have made a number of editorial changes, primarily of syntax and punctuation, throughout the final rule. These changes are intended to clarify the rating criteria and represent no substantive amendment. Generic terms such as ``severe,'' ``moderate,'' and ``mild,'' which preceded various evaluation criteria in the proposed regulations, have been removed. Rather than helping to explain or clarify the specific evaluation criteria which they precede, these terms inject an element of ambiguity not otherwise present. Under diagnostic code 7524, we have deleted the phrase ``other than undescended or congenitally undeveloped'' for the noncompensable evaluation criteria since the NOTE following adequately explains that an undescended or congenitally undeveloped testis is not ratable.
