"These attacks go against the agreement signed by the parties before Onusal," Ramirez Ocampo said. The diplomat explained that as election day approaches, naturally political temperatures increase and more political rallies are held, however, the rallies held this past weekend were very worrisome. Given this, Dr. Ramirez Ocampo said that currently, Onusal is meeting with all the presidential candidates and asking them to watch their language and to recommend to their supporters that they comply with the fair campaign agreement, without verbal or physical violence, signed last year. In addition, he called on the population in general to be calm and to hold democratic elections, like the Salvadoran people and the international community want. Regarding the previously mentioned cases, the head of Onusal stated his organization is acquiring information to inform those involved at a later date. When asked if the commitment made by the candidates is being violated, Ramirez Ocampo clearly said that aside from the aforementioned events, there have been no other regrettable incidents despite the fact that the parties have scheduled political activities at the same times and places. Ramirez Ocampo concluded, "Onusal has been present at 655 political rallies, and it has confirmed that citizens and candidates have observed the commitment made, which will not be affected by the latest incidents."
