FR940428-2-00003 FR940428-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration [A&hyph;401&hyph;601] Brass Sheet and Strip From Sweden Affirmation of the Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand SUMMARY: On March 16, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) affirmed the Department of Commerce's redetermination on remand of the final results of the 1988&hyph;89 and the 1989&hyph;90 administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden (57 FR 2706, January 23, 1992). Outokumpu Cooper Rolled Products AB and Outokumpu Copper (USA), Inc. v. United States (Slip Op. 94&hyph;45, March 16, 1994) ( Outokumpu ). The results covered the periods March 1, 1988 through February 28, 1989, and March 1, 1989 through February 28, 1990. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Valerie Turoscy or John Kugelman at (202) 482&hyph;5253, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 12, 1993, the CIT in Outokumpu Copper Rolled Products AB and Outokumpu Copper (USA) Inc. v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;155 (August 12, 1993), issued an order remanding to the Department the final results of the 1988&hyph;89 and 1989&hyph;90 administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden (57 FR 2706, January 23, 1992). On September 27, 1993, the Department submitted its redetermination on remand to the CIT. On March 16, 1994, the CIT affirmed the Department's redetermination on remand ( Outokumpu ). In its decision in Timken Co. v. United States, 893 F. 2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ( Timken ), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(e), the Department must publish a notice of a court decision which is not ``in harmony'' with a Department determination, and must suspend liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision in Outokumpu on March 16, 1994, which affirmed the Department's redetermination, constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's affirmative final results. Publication of this notice fulfills the Timken requirement. Accordingly, the Department will continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise. Further, absent appeal, or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the Department will amend the final affirmative results of review of the antidumping duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden to reflect the amended margins of the Department's redetermination on remand, which was affirmed by the CIT. Dated: April 20, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10164 Filed 4&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
