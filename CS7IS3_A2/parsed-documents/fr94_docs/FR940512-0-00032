FR940512-0-00032 FR940512-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB74 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Rule To Establish Additional Manatee Protection Areas in Kings Bay, Crystal River, Florida AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes three additional permanent manatee ( Trichechus manatus ) sanctuaries and expands an existing sanctuary in Kings Bay, Crystal River, Florida. All waterborne activities will be prohibited in these sanctuaries from November 15 through March 31 of each year. This final action will prevent the taking of manatees by harassment resulting from waterborne activities during the winter months. The total number of sanctuaries in Kings Bay is increased from three (10.7 acres) to six (39.0 acres) to accommodate the growing number of manatees using the area each winter, and to offset the harassment from increasing public use. This action is taken under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida 32216. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert O. Turner at the above address, 904/232&hyph;2580; or Vance Eaddy, Senior Resident Agent, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 9721 Executive Center Dr., Suite 206, St. Petersburg, Florida 33702, 813/893&hyph;3651. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Crystal River is a short tidal river on the west coast of Florida. Forming the headwaters of Crystal River is Kings Bay, a lake-like body of water fed by many freshwater springs. These springs, because of their year-round temperature of over 74 â—‹ F, provide an essential warm-water wintering area for West Indian manatees ( Trichechus manatus ), a federally listed endangered species. During cold weather, many of the manatees wintering in Kings Bay congregate in an area known as the main spring or Kings Spring, located just south of Banana Island. This location is also a favorite site for skin and scuba divers, who come to Kings Bay for the clear, calm conditions favorable for learning diving techniques, coupled with the opportunity to ``swim with the manatees''. Diver use of this area is especially heavy during the cold winter months when diving is impractical through most of the northern states, and when the opportunity for manatee encounters is greatest. The concurrent use of the main spring area by divers and manatees during cold weather creates a problem for manatees. Manatees are shy, harmless creatures that are easily driven away from warm springs by human activity (Buckingham 1990).
