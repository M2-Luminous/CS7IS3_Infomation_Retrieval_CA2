But critics speak of window dressing. As a researcher who was involved in JESSI, how do you see it? [Kurz] It is more than window dressing, but we must take into consideration that it was not the federal minister who landed us in JESSI. JESSI is, so to speak, an old boys' network, and a minister who is a layman is taken in by the window dressing. The fact is, there is a vast discrepancy between the claims and the results. None of JESSI's big "flag ships" has got off the ground. On the contrary, the fleet has almost sunk already. [Rubner] Can you tell us what the project's most important flag ships were? [Kurz] Apart from the clusters, the joint projects in manufacturing technology, which were also not particularly successful, there are five applications flag ships. These are: high resolution television, digital broadcasting, broadband communications, mobile radio, and safety electronics for automobiles. The high resolution television project has just gone under, mobile radio is firmly in the hands of firms that were not sponsored by JESSI. The problem is that there were several changes of strategy. Industry regarded JESSI as a sponsorship program for itself in which firms need not have clear objectives. [Rubner] Yet the European semiconductor industry still has only a small share of the world market. Surely more must have gone wrong than just a change of strategy? [Kurz] The failings go back 15 or 20 years. The five-year program running until 1996 has at best delayed Europe's withdrawal from the world market. Initially, JESSI was not intended to be a program for capturing the market, but to create the technological basis for the microelectronics industry. Only later were substantial parts of a basic program abandoned to press ahead with applications. [Rubner] Applications are not necessarily bad. Where did JESSI go wrong? [Kurz] If firms are always looking out of the corner of their eye for more competent partners outside of JESSI, there is bound to be failure in applications. [Rubner] With 150 firms involved, does that not entail an enormous amount of bureaucracy? [Kurz] Here we have Europe's old complaint again. The money that was spent on administration could have been put into basic research or given directly to competent firms without them having to find a pseudo-common objective. But all European projects have this problem. [Rubner] Among others, a European CAD [computer-aided design] software program is cited as a successful JESSI project. Why was it worth spending millions on it? [Kurz] I don't understand it at all. But JESSI sets great store by the project partners talking to each other. It would of course have been more honest if JESSI had been called a political integration program from the start. [Rubner] Have there been technically good results? [Kurz] Yes, isolated ones in the areas of the clusters I mentioned. But the question remains whether the progress was not rather the result of ideas from the USA or Japan, or from JESSI. By the way, one particular misjudgment was X-ray lithography. [Rubner] But most experts didn't expect it would be possible to make the 64 megabit chip without X-ray lithography. [Kurz] That isn't the case. There are a lot of predictions about how far optical lithography will go. They were still talking about X-ray lithography in JESSI when the Japanese were already announcing the 64-megabit chip with optical processes. [Rubner] JESSI runs out in 1996. What ought to come then? [Kurz] Certainly not a repetition. We already know how JESSI will end. The people with political responsibility should already be setting up an independent commission of enquiry so that competent experts can talk about the next stage. The most important questions are: What is a long-term research strategy? What is the correct form of involvement for the universities, Fraunhofer Institutes and others? We need new methods to better develop Europe's existing potential. There should at all events be greater [financial] support for basic research, particularly in the direction of automatic mini labs, that is small factories in which special chips, Asics [application-specific integrated circuits] for short, are made. Funding should be awarded solely according to scientific and technical criteria -- not like in JESSI, where industry acted like a society for self-advancement in deciding who would get money.
