"The talks were very interesting and comprehensive and referred to the situation on the ground, the humanitarian situation and the mandate of the UN peace mission in this connection." Expressing satisfaction about today's meeting with Rose at the start of the latter's mission in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Karadzic said the aim of the meeting was for the two sides to get to know each other and explain their basic points of view. "My impression is that regardless of where they come from, high-ranking officers are the ones least prejudiced. Such was the case with all former UNPROFOR commanders and so it is with General Rose, who is willing to examine the situation as a whole and take an unbiased stand which the United Nations personifies. We have always been satisfied with the UN high commands and have never had any objections to their work," the Srpska republic president said. "General Rose expressed satisfaction about the safe passage of convoys across the Serb territory and about the reduced volume of military operations in the Sarajevo zone. We accepted the suggestion that such a trend should be continued, especially at the time of the Olympics and we also accepted a cease-fire during this period and will not carry out any military operations unless we are threatened. "We will try to ensure an increase in humanitarian aid deliveries through our corridors, as our aim is to lessen the suffering of civilians as much as possible. My impression is that our first meeting took place in a very positive atmosphere and I hope that our cooperation will be excellent," Karadzic concluded. General Rose said: "We agreed on the need to make an effort to normalize the situation in Sarajevo and to halt military actions in the Sarajevo area. I think it is in the interest of all of us that the situation is normalized, given the unfortunate experiences of the people living here." He confirmed that the process of replacing UNPROFOR members in Srebrenica was discussed, and expressed conviction that the rotation would be completed without any problems. President Karadzic mentioned that he and Rose also discussed possible dangers which could arise from deliberately staged incidents, especially within the context of the provocations announced by Muslim forces in connection with NATO planes in northeast Bosnia, particularly in Tuzla and Srebrenica. "We agreed that in such a situation we should have each individual case examined by mixed expert groups, because such tricks on the part of the Muslim side are very likely. We will try to prevent this, but if it happens we will insist on a thorough investigation and will be willing to take part in the work of the mixed expert commissions," Karadzic said. "The protection of humanitarian aid routes is within the mandate of the peace forces and we are aware of the difficulties and traps which can present themselves, but we will conduct an investigation in every case and I therefore stress the importance of the deliveries of humanitarian aid across these areas," General Rose said.
