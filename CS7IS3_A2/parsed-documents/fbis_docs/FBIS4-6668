He thus indicated that Japan will not participate in such a naval blockade. While a blockade is meant to ensure the effectiveness of economic sanctions, and no use of force is involved in the objective and mission of such an action, "corresponding measures" are permitted under "certain conditions"--for instance, if the other party resorts to armed resistance.
