Army's Interests Unaffected"] [Text] It has happened: The State Duma has adopted the Law on the Federal Budget for 1994 in its entirety. In the section which concerns us, the military, it can be said that nothing has changed. In point of fact, the debate over defense expenditure was closed back at the second reading. But certain details will probably be of interest to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's readers. Individually, the results of the vote were as follows: 278 for, 80 against, with eight abstentions; 89 deputies did not vote [figures as published do not correspond with referent item]. By comparison with the second reading the number who said "no" to this budget doubled. Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, explained to me that "the abstentions and nonvotes are also votes against. That is how we will look at it. In total 177 did not agree with the government distribution of expenditure and revenue (and therefore with the reduced defense budget)." As for the vote by factions, 81.8 percent of the Russian Agrarian Party, 0 percent of "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy Bloc], 64.1 percent of "Russia's Choice," 73.3 percent of the Democratic Party of Russia, 10.9 percent of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, 79.3 percent of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], 90.9 percent of "Women of Russia," 73.1 percent of "New Regional Policy," and 56.2 percents of deputies not belonging to factions voted for the budget. By comparison with the second reading (compare the publication of the results of individual voting in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA for 16 June) Zhirinovskiy's party has radically changed its stance -- the majority of those who voted for the budget at the second reading today voted against. Sergey Yushenkov told me that in conversation with him Russian President Boris Yeltsin had confirmed his recent press conference statement that the Army will be financially "topped up" from extrabudgetary funds. The only issue now is to ensure that the money is transferred from the Ministry of Finances to the Ministry of Defense promptly and under the requisite controls.
