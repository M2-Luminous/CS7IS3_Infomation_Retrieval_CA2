FR941019-2-00154 FR941019-2-00082 Proposed Modification of Final Judgment Notice is hereby given that defendant United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. (``UATC'') has filed with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin a motion to modify the Final Judgment in United States v. Capitol Service, Inc. et al., No. 80&hyph;C&hyph;407, and the Department of Justice (``Department''), in a stipulation also filed with the Court, has consented to modification of the Final Judgment, but has reserved the right to withdraw its consent based on public comments or for other reasons. The Complaint in this case (filed on May 5, 1980) alleged that UATC and three other Milwaukee motion picture exhibitors had since 1977 engaged in a combination and conspiracy to restrain trade by ``splitting'', or allocating among themselves, the rights to negotiate for films released by motion picture distribution companies, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1. The Final Judgment (entered on June 17, 1983) enjoins the defendants ``from further engaging in any motion picture split agreements, in any form and with any person, in any motion picture exhibition market throughout the United States.'' The Department has filed with the Court a memorandum setting forth the reasons why it believes that modification of the Final Judgment to permit a singular exemption from the Court's injunction for a UATC theatre in San Jose, California to be constructed under the auspices of the City's Redevelopment Agency, would be in the public interest. Copies of the Complaint, the Final Judgment, the defendant's motion papers, the Stipulation containing the Government's tentative consent, the Department's memorandum, and all further papers filed with the Court in connection with this motion will be available for inspection at Room 3235, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530 (Telephone: (202) 514&hyph;2481), and at the Office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Copies of any of these materials may be obtained from the Antitrust Division upon request and payment of the copying fee set by Department regulations. Interested persons may submit comments to the Department regarding the proposed modification of the Final Judgment. Such comments must be received within the sixty-day period established by court order, and will be filed with the Court by the Department. Comments should be addressed to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 555 Fourth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001 (telephone: (202) 307&hyph;5799). Constance K. Robinson, Director of Operations, Antitrust Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25819 Filed 10&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;01&hyph;M
