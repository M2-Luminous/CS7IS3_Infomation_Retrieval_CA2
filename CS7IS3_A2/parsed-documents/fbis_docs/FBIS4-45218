FBIS4-45218 "jptdd023__l94062" JPRS-TDD-94-023-L JPRS Narcotics 9 April 1994 EAST ASIA TAIWAN Number of Drug Users Estimated at 400,000 Number of Drug Users Estimated at 400,000 94WD0358A Taipei TZU-LI WAN-PAO in Chinese 9 Apr 94 p 9 94WD0358A Taipei TZU-LI WAN-PAO Chinese CSO [Text] According to an informal estimate by the Bureau of Investigation, roughly 400,000 people use narcotics in Taiwan. Narcotics analysts in the bureau's Sixth Department say the 1,300 kg of heroin seized during all of last year is sufficient to supply more than 32,000 users for an entire year. And since the amount seized is conservatively estimated to equal only one-tenth of total circulation, the number of narcotic consumers in Taiwan extrapolates to roughly 400,000. Bureau narcotics specialists say that a heroin user needs only about 0.1 g a day of the most refined form of the drug to satisfy his craving, greater use might be fatal, so a user consumes only about 40 g a year. Therefore, the 1,300 kg seized by public security organs last year is enough to supply 32,500 users for an entire year. Nevertheless, most drug-bust suspects are by no means first-timers, admitting involvement in many "deals." Therefore, Sixth Department researchers point out, the amount of narcotics seized by public security units equals about only one-tenth of the total in circulation. Indeed, this estimate is in fact derived from conclusions reached by the U.S. Government from studies of drug seizures and actual trafficking in the United States. Our country's war on drugs is less effective than America's in terms of manpower, equipment, and funding, so "one-tenth" may well be an overestimate of our effectiveness in this endeavor. Extrapolating thus, the amount of narcotics circulating in our country is enough to supply roughly 325,000 users for an entire year. And, given the principle of market supply and demand, there clearly must be more than 320,000 users for there to be such a flood of drugs into our country. Are all our narcotics consumed domestically, or is there transshipment abroad? As to this, bureau drug agents note that no case of transshipment has ever been discovered, our customs officials are very rigorous in their search for drugs, so it is better for traffickers to use neighboring Southeast Asian countries, where the risk of losing one's entire investment is lower than Taiwan for transshipment. Sixth Department researchers point out that using seizure totals to estimate user populations is crude, informal, and inaccurate; but that precise figures for those populations are very difficult to obtain and accurate surveys are impossible; so that there is no choice but to resort to such crude estimation.
