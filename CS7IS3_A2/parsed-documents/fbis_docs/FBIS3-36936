The conference, chaired by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, was attended by heads of ministries and departments and managers of largest oil enterprises of the country. The conference was held behind closed doors, but according to information received by ITAR-TASS, representatives of the oil industry raised the problem of overdue payments to oil and gas enterprises, exorbitant taxes and inadequate price policies pursued by the state in the field of energy resources. It was pointed out that 28 different kinds of taxes are currently levied on one tonne of oil, which makes up 77 per cent of its cost. Besides, new taxes are going to be levied by local authorities in 1994, which will render normal development of the industry impossible. Participants coordinated a package of documents aimed at resolving these problems. The package is expected to include a decree of the Russian president and a number of resolutions adopted by the government which shall be finalized in a week's time. Commenting on the results of the conference, Russian Minister for Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafrannik said that participants adopted a decision to increase the share of free oil sales for oil enterprises. A concrete figure specifying the increased amount of free oil sales will be determined in the near future, Shafrannik said. He pointed out that in 1994, oil exports from Russia are expected to remain at the 1993 level.
