ACTION: Reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: EPA is reopening the comment period for a proposed rule to prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers which was published in the Federal Register of March 9, 1994. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments should be submitted in triplicate to: TSCA Docket Receipt (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;G99, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Docket No. 62134C. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Rm. E&hyph;545, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: 202&hyph;554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : In the Federal Register of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11122), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers. Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before May 9, 1994. EPA received requests seeking a 60&hyph;day extension of the public comment period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information it requested in the proposed rule. EPA believed that providing an additional 60&hyph;day comment period to prepare written comments was reasonable, and extended the comment period until July 8, 1994. The Agency has continued to receive numerous comments from the public although the public comment period has closed. Therefore, in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully, EPA has decided to reopen the public comment period. Written comments must now be received by EPA on or before November 9, 1994. A person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed rule. Any person who submits a comment that contains information claimed as confidential, must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim information confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, the Agency will put the comments in the public docket without further notice to that person.
