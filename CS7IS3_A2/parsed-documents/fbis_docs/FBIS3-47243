On 9 January, a relevant official from the business sector said: We recently received a request from North Korea for the export of rice, maize, and gasoline. Since the United States exports rice to North Korea, I do not see the reason why we cannot export rice to North Korea. According to the annual report recently submitted to the U.S. Congress by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Government, which officially banned export of goods to North Korea, allowed export of grains including rice and some other products from the humanitarian view of point. The total amount of export was learned to be $137 million in seven cases during the fiscal year 1992. Another relevant official from the business sector said that "in addition to the United States, Japan exported even strategic materials to North Korea through the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan. Recently, Japan is actively striving to hold official and unofficial contacts with North Korea to resume negotiations for establishment of diplomatic relations. This being the case, if our economic cooperation with North Korea is linked to the nuclear issue and our export of rice is restricted on the pretext of being a strategic material, it would be difficult for the government to effect its policy to achieve national reunification by making North Korea open itself up." Sin Chang-ho, professor at Chungang University and chairman of the Research Institute of Unification and Economy, also pointed out: Even if North Korea agrees to accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it will require a number of procedures and much time to ensure nuclear transparency. The present situation, in which a clue is found for the solution of the nuclear problem through contacts between the United States and North Korea and between North Korea and the IAEA, is an adequate time for our government to demonstrate flexibility in its policy on economic cooperation with North Korea. Meanwhile, it was learned that the government began to examine the flexibility to be given to the principle of implementing phased economic cooperation according to progress in negotiations over the North Korean nuclear issue and to the degree of solution of the nuclear issue. A relevant government official said: During U.S.-North Korea contacts, North Korea agreed in principle to accept inspection of seven nuclear facilities. Therefore, the necessity arose to intensively examine the first-phase policy which defined "a breakthrough for solution to nuclear issue," the second-phase and the third-phase policies. In particular, if North Korea accepts IAEA's nuclear inspection and responds to the exchange of special envoys, the government will affirmatively review the time of visit to North Korea by businessmen and technicians and their advance to free economic zones in North Korea through third countries including China. In the event that North Korea completely returns to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and accepts the inspection of two undeclared sites by IAEA, the government, regarding this as a "breakthrough for a solution to the nuclear issue," will permit the businessmen's visit to North Korea, as well as the visit of technicians in a bid to invigorate processing-for-wage deals. In addition, the government will resume model projects if North Korea accepts mutual inspections of the North and the South and will resume overall economic cooperation if denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is realized.
