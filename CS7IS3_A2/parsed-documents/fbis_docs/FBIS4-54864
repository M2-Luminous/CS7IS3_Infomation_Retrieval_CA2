Klara Stejskalova reports: [Stejskalova] The talks between the foreign ministers chiefly concerned the Czech Republic's membership in the European economic and security structures. Minister Zieleniec praised Britain's role in involving the countries of Central Europe in the European Union. At the same time, he stressed that we are striving for membership not because we want to be recipients of European aid but because we want to contribute to transformation using our own funds. According to Hurd, the European Union must grow gradually, on the basis of agreements that have already been concluded. The talks also concerned NATO and the Partnership for Peace program. The two ministers praised the role of the United States, saying that its military presence in Europe is the guarantee of stability and that it has played an important part in the recent changes in Central Europe.
