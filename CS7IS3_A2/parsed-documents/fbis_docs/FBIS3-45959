Zhu provided no details about the aircraft, which he said were part of an ambitious "takeoff plan" by his industry in the coming 10-to-15 years. Western military experts said Zhu may have been referring to the Super-7 fighter, which has been on the Chinese drawing board for years. It is an updated version of the J-7, which itself is a derivation of the Soviet-designed MiG-21, they said. The MiG-21 is considered a relatively mediocre craft, mainly because of the forward location of the air intake, which limits the size of the radar. Russia is already a known partner in developing an engine for the Super-7, although it is not known whether it will take part in devising a new radar for it. China has been showing off a model of the prototype at air shows abroad, in a bid to woo a foreign partner. The U.S. firm Grumman Corp. put forward a proposal, but scrapped it after the Chinese military helped quell pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989. "Whatever kind of combat plane they have in mind, the Chinese have to find a partner, because they don't have the technical ability to manufacture a plane of this kind by themselves," an expert said. China has also been urging Russia to sell it a production line for the high-performance and highly rated MiG-31. Zhu also announced that China "will gradually construct a complete research and production system for advanced helicopters." Western experts said this was apparently a reference to anti-tank helicopters fitted with night sights for operations after dark. "However, the Chinese have much to learn before they master this technology," one said.
