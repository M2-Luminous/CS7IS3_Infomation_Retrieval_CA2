FR940922-1-00045 FR940922-1-00008 EPA requests comment on a number of other issues pertaining to such a ``ZEV equivalency'' requirement, and whether the Agency should include such a requirement in the final rule. First, EPA requests comment on whether the OTC's recommendation can be interpreted to include a requirement that the states' programs achieve the benefits of the ZEV sales requirement in addition to the remainder of the recommended LEV program from the new vehicle sector. EPA also requests comment on whether the August 4 letter from the Chair of the OTC supports this interpretation, and the extent to which EPA may rely on such a letter to determine the intent of the OTC's February 10 recommendation. Finally, EPA notes that commenters suggesting this approach have not provided a specific explanation of how the states may adopt it consistent with sections 209 and 177 of the Act. EPA welcomes comments from the public on these legal issues. (d) Particular circumstances of OTC LEV program. EPA believes that its analysis of the contribution from one area to another in the OTR should be understood in the specific context of the OTC LEV program in question here. EPA believes that several aspects of this particular program further support EPA's conclusion that it is necessary to adopt this program region-wide to counteract ozone transport. Many parties have commented that the OTC LEV program should apply on a region-wide basis in order to attain the greatest amount of emissions reductions and facilitate operation of the LEV program. 55 55 See, e.g., letter from Albert Hendricksen, Vice President, United Illuminating, to Mike Shields, U.S. EPA (June 3, 1994); comments to the OTC LEV docket from Gerald Esper, Director, Vehicle Environment Department, American Automobile Manufacturers Association (June 3, 1994); and comments to the OTC LEV docket from Barbara A. Kwetz, Director, Division of Air Quality Control, Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (June 3, 1994). First, new car sales are very much an interstate business, particularly in the northeast where many smaller states are located together. Consumers frequently travel throughout a particular state and to different states to buy cars. To the extent consumers in the more polluted nonattainment areas can continue to buy cars elsewhere in the same state or in other states, then it is especially important that the cars they buy elsewhere meet the strictest emissions standards needed for emissions reductions in the more polluted areas. The interstate business aspect is especially true in border areas of larger states, and can pervade smaller states, such as those in the OTR. For example, according to auto dealers in Greenwich, Connecticut, fifty percent of their sales are to New York residents. Dealers in different states regularly trade vehicles among themselves. Dealers also engage in ``drop shipments,'' where a dealer accepts an order from an out-of-state customer and the vehicle is shipped directly to the customer without ever physically entering the dealer's inventory. To accommodate such practices, EPA has adopted a ``cross-border sales'' policy that in effect permits the sale of cars certified to California standards in states that are contiguous to those that have adopted California standards. 56 Indeed, members of Congress from Maine have urged EPA to extend this cross-border sales policy to dealers in Maine because they claim that 125 out of 170 Maine dealers rely on vehicle trades with Massachusetts dealers. While they explained that those in southern Maine are most affected, even dealers as far north as Bangor trade with Massachusetts dealers. 57 56 See letter from Charles N. Freed, Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, U.S. EPA, to interested automobile manufacturers (Nov. 16, 1993). 57 See letter from Rep. Olympia J. Snowe, U.S. House of Representatives, to Carol Browner, Administrator, U.S. EPA (July 18, 1994); letter from Thomas T. Brown, Jr., Executive Vice President, Maine Automobile Dealers Association, to Sen. William Cohen, U.S. Senate (June 10, 1994). It is important that the states adopt OTC LEV as soon as possible because the air quality benefits from the program will not be realized immediately. This delay in air quality benefits is due to the leadtime requirement in section 177 and the time required for fleet turnover. For the California standards to apply in another state, section 177 of the Act requires that California and the adopting state adopt the standards at least two years before commencement of the model year in which the LEV standards are to apply. Due to the phase-in schedule for the LEV program and the time required for fleet turnover, the maximum benefit for LEV would not be realized until 2028. It is also very important that the emissions sources in question here are mobile. Residents of particular states drive their cars into other states, and may even relocate to such other states. This may be particularly true in the northeast, where there is a high concentration of large metropolitan areas and a very dense transportation infrastructure that allows people to drive into and between these big cities. For this reason, it makes particular sense to ensure to the maximum extent possible that the fleet of cars throughout the region meet the strictest emissions standards needed for emission reductions in the more polluted areas. For these business and environmental reasons, industry and government organizations, including auto dealers and states, have urged that if the program is to be adopted, all states in the region should do so. 58 Requiring that different cars meeting LEV standards be sold in different parts of the same state, in a potential patchwork across the region, could create business difficulties and could also compromise the intended environmental benefits of the program. Indeed, congressional debate over the adoption of section 177 reflected this concern. 59 Presumably due to these concerns, a number of states in the OTR have actually adopted legislative authority or actual regulations to implement the LEV program under section 177 that would go into effect on the condition that some number of other neighboring states in the region likewise implement the program. 58 See, e.g., letter from Robert A. Beck, Vice President, Environmental Affairs, Edison Electric Institute, to U.S. EPA (June 3, 1994); letter from Helene G. Goldberger and Joan Leary Matthews, Assistant Attorneys General, State of New York Department of Law, to U.S. EPA (June 2, 1994). 59 See H.R. Rep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess., 309&hyph;311 (1977), reprinted in Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 at 2776&hyph;78. Finally, EPA believes that its action in approving state volatility controls as necessary under section 211(c)(4)(C) constitutes a precedent for considering business practices to conclude that the program should apply state-wide, even if it may not have been environmentally necessary in that case across the entire state. In that case, EPA approved New York's adoption of volatility controls as necessary throughout New York, even in areas that were in attainment for ozone, in part based on the fact that the pipeline distribution network for gasoline made the supply of different gasoline to different parts of the state difficult for business and for program administration. Therefore, EPA concluded that the need for the program in part of the state justified allowing New York to adopt it state-wide under section 211(c)(4)(C). 60 60 See 54 FR 26030, 26033 (June 21, 1989); 58 FR 12656, 12659 (March 28, 1989).
