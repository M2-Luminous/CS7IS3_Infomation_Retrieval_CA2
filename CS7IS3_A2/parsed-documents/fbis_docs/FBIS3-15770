Moscow's representatives in the UN Security Council and the CSCE have proposed several times that Russia be regarded as the only peacekeeping force in the former Soviet Union's territory. However, although the international community has adopted a cautious approach, Russia's leaders continue to insist on that view. It will be recalled that several international meetings and symposiums have rejected that idea. Russia's military units have been deployed in Georgia with the consent of that Republic's leaders. They have been assigned to end the dispute between Abkhaziya and Georgia and establish peace. However, it is common knowledge that they do not [words indistinct] Meanwhile, Russia's interest in Azerbaijan is gradually increasing. That country's media organs claimed some time ago that Russia wishes to establish a base in Azerbaijan but Baku has failed to approve Moscow's proposal on the matter. The media organs also claimed that Russia's troops will be deployed in Karabakh. That, too, was a wrong report. It is common knowledge that Azerbaijan's leaders are categorically opposed to the deployment of Russia's troops in Karabakh. President Aliyev and several other officials believe that the deployment of Russia's forces may prolong the peaceful settlement of the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan and obstruct the withdrawal of the Armenian armed groups from our republic's occupied territories. In view of that, Baku is opposed to that idea. Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, arrived in our region a few days ago. He was accompanied by Deputy Defense Minister G. Kondratyev. Undoubtedly, their arrival was linked to Russia's deployment of its peacekeeping forces in Karabakh. Baku outlined its position and noted that the deployment of Russia's troops on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be more appropriate. Azerbaijan's residential areas would not be fired on from Armenia and the Republic's people would find an opportunity to live in peace and attend to their daily work. Russia made a new proposal for the peaceful solution of the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan in February. A cease-fire agreement was reached, which would be put into effect on 1 March. Undoubtedly, that was welcomed. Naturally, Russia could have used that agreement to strengthen its influence. Unfortunately, however, we wish to note that the cease-fire agreement was short-lived. The Armenian side violated it, as it has done so several times in the past. Meanwhile, Moscow was expected to warn Yerevan to force it to remain committed to the agreement. It is common knowledge that Russia was eager to participate in the effort made to end the dispute in Bosnia. In fact, it has achieved its objective to a certain degree. Moscow wished to use the experience it gained in Bosnia in Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, it will be recalled that Baku has disclosed several times that it supports the peaceful solution of the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Furthermore, it has confirmed its approach through the steps it has taken thus far. Nevertheless, Azerbaijan's leaders call for the liberation of all the occupied territories and the removal of all the Armenian armed groups from our Republic. It is only then that Azerbaijan can hold talks for the solution of the problem. Moscow is well-aware of Baku's position. It will be recalled that Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev supported Azerbaijan's draft plan and described it as a constructive document that is acceptable to all the sides concerned. However, it seems that Russia is unable to relinquish its ambitions. Moscow must comply with international agreements and law. That is how it can regain its influence.
