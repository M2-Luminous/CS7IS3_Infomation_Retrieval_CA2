[Nakai] There is no doubt that after invading Nanjing, the former Japanese army committed cruel deeds on ordinary Chinese people. Japan has to have a feeling of deep remorse and apology not only for the Nanjing massacre, but also for its numerous acts of aggression and colonial rule during the war. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to deal with severe criticism from various countries about Nagano's remarks? [Nakai] The justice minister is not in a position to take diplomatic action. But Nagano's remarks disgraced Japan's diplomacy and inflicted mental scars on many peoples. Therefore, as a successor to Nagano, I would like to take care of this issue if the prime minister asks me to do so. Mr. Nagano, however, took responsibility for causing trouble to the nation and the cabinet. I think, with his resignation, other countries will understand Japan's view of the war. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Defense Agency Director General Kanda recently made remarks in favor of exercising the right to collective defense. Foreign Minister Kakizawa also expressed a positive stance on enacting legislation for emergencies. [Nakai] It is quite right that Dietmen and the people voice various different views on the Constitution and other issues. But as a cabinet member, I have to protect the Constitution and respect its longstanding interpretation by previous governments. I have no intention to make comments on and participate in the constitutional arguments as justice minister. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the power of the justice minister over the public prosecutor general? [Nakai] I am fully aware that the authority is stipulated by law. But I have no intention to take action to intervene in individual problems. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Currently, such basic laws as the civil law are being reviewed. [Nakai] Things are changing at a rapid pace. Sense of value has also changed greatly. While considering this, the government should, if necessary, revise laws by seeking a national consensus and through in-depth discussions.
