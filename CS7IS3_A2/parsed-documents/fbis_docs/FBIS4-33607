Figueroa expressed Chile's "firm decision" to increase its economic ties with the rest of Latin America, a step that "is not incompatible" with its attempt to join NAFTA, which comprises the United States, Canada, and Mexico. During a news conference in which he was joined by Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Figueroa explained that Chile proposed measures to gradually deregulate the trade of goods, services, and investments between Chile and the Mercosur partners. Figueroa stressed that Mercosur, to which Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay belong, "is an extremely clear opportunity to export Chilean manufactured goods of high added value." Figueroa pointed out that Chile seeks to join, as an "observer," Mercosur's dozen or so "working groups," which establish the trade and economic policies that the four partners of the regional integration agreement must implement. Di Tella, as the Mercosur "pro tempore" secretary (coordination chief), received Chile's formal proposal. He stressed that Chile "has animated" the regional integration agreement's partners. The Argentine foreign minister emphasized: "It represents a very significant step because from now on the great political and economic advancements among the American Southern Cone countries will be even greater, like never before." Di Tella noted that Bolivia is the other Southern Cone country that has shown "great interest" in joining Mercosur, whose full implementation is scheduled for 1995. The Argentine foreign minister said "it would be ideal" to reach an agreement on Chile's entry next year. Carlos Figueroa denied that the Chilean entry proposal had been received with distrust by Uruguay, whose foreign minister, Sergio Abreu, "was one of the most animated." The Mercosur foreign ministers received a preliminary Chilean proposal during the OAS General Assembly that met for two days in the Brazilian city of Belem do Para. The Chilean foreign minister refused to supply more details on the proposal because "it must be reviewed" by the Mercosur partners. Figueroa pointed out that Chile's interest in joining stems from Mercosur's economic potential and its negotiating power with other trade blocs, especially the EU. Figueroa said the Chilean proposal follows agreements with the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) and the Brazilian proposal to establish a regional free trade zone. The Chilean foreign minister is scheduled to meet tomorrow with Argentine and Chilean entrepreneurs who have invested in Argentina.
