Tsukhlo, head of the Market Survey Laboratory of the Institute of Economic Problems of the Transitional Period: "Effective Demand Remains the Most Painful Problem for Industrial Workers"] [Text] According to the assessment of enterprise directors polled, the April slump in industrial production slowed things down a bit. The market surveys made by the Institute of Economic Problems of the Transitional Period are conducted regularly among the directors of industrial enterprises, and pursue the goal of revealing their general ideas on future economic trends. It is worth noting that the opinions of these respondents are more than just opinions, since they can in themselves have a substantial influence on the development of the situation, as feedback. Evaluation of the Current Situation Essentially, the expectation of a further drop has been losing its keenness lately. This was recorded in machine building and the construction industry, while reports of an increase in the scale of output cutback came from enterprises of the woodworking and light sectors. In April, 28 percent of the enterprises rated production stabilization as "normal"; this situation did not suit 72 percent of the respondents, who had retained their output volume. The general slowdown in the recession led to a reduction in the proportion of "below normal" evaluations of the current production volume. Nevertheless, 90 percent of the enterprises in the machine building and light industry were dissatisfied with their output volumes. The answers of "normal" were significant (30-40 percent) in 1994 only in the woodworking and food sectors. Of the enterprises considering their production volume normal, only 42 percent evaluate the demand as the same; for the rest of the respondents from this group, the demand was insufficient. In the 1st quarter of 1994, the demand for industrial goods continued to decrease. The balance remained at the level of the 4th quarter of 1993 (-60 percent). A year ago this indicator was zero, which attested to the stabilization of the demand in the 1st quarter of 1993. The strongest reduction in demand is now noted in machine building and woodworking. Evaluations of the demand during the four months of 1994 remained at an extremely low level: 84-87 percent of the enterprises considered the demand for their products to be unsatisfactory. A critical situation has formed in the machine building plants -- 99 percent of them assessed the amount of demand as "below normal." The maximum proportion of the "normal" answers were obtained in the woodworking industry (15 percent, March -- 23 percent). The reaction to the poor demand was more coincident in April: 56 percent of the enterprises with unsatisfactory demand were prepared to lower production (March -- 50 percent), and 26 percent were prepared to not raise prices (March -- 10 percent). In the 1st quarter of 1994, the enterprises' provision with raw material and materials dropped. In general, this process took place in the light (76 percent of the answers -- "below normal"), woodworking (69 percent) and machine building (68 percent) sectors. In the food industry, 60 percent of the enterprises considered their raw material reserves normal. In April, the poll recorded a small drop in surplus reserves of finished products -- the proportion of "above normal" answers dropped from 59 to 51 percent. The most substantial reduction occurred in the machine building (balance was 39 percent, March -- 49 percent), woodworking (29 percent, March -- 38 percent) and light (61 percent, March -- 73 percent) sectors of industry. Surplus reserves of finished products force 58 percent of the enterprises to decrease production and 33 percent -- to not raise prices. The load of the production capacities on the whole for industry was 54 percent in April (56 percent in January 1994). A reduction in this indicator occurred only in machine building (46 percent, January-- 51 percent) and the light industry (47 percent, January -- 59 percent). Provision with orders for the year, on the average for industry, was cut in half and constituted 4.4 months in April 1994. The maximum reduction took place in the woodworking (from 7.6 to 2 months), light (from 7.3 to 2.2) and machine building (from 8.8 to 3.6) sectors. The enterprises of the petrochemical and food industries reported approximately the same provision as the year before. An increase in the indicator was recorded only in the construction industry (from 5.2 to 5.4 months). Some 54 percent of the enterprises reported surplus production capacities in April 1994 (April 1993 -- 29 percent). Most of these evaluations were obtained in machine building (58 percent, April 1993 --35 percent) and light industry (57 percent, April 1993 -- 27 percent). Effective demand still remains the most painful problem for industry --80 percent of the enterprises indicated it as a restraining factor (January 1994 -- 78 percent). In second place -- a shortage of working capital (61 percent, January -- 62 percent). A shortage of skilled personnel holds a distant third place (17 percent, January -- 19 percent). Predictions and Expectations An increase in expectations of a production slump continued at the enterprises in April: the proportion of "will drop" answers reached 54 percent (March -- 49 percent); given the retaining of predictions of a production increase for 10 percent of the enterprises the balance was -44 percent. Increases in the scope of the recession are anticipated at the enterprises of the light (-71 percent, -40 percent in March), woodworking (-54 percent, -8 percent in March) and machine building (-54 percent, -46 percent in March) sectors. The probability of an increase is retained only in the construction industry. The price predictions of the enterprises changed substantially in April. The proportion of producers not intending to raise prices rose to 26 percent (March -- 8 percent). Anti-inflationary intentions of this sort have not been recorded since July 1992. The minimum inclination toward raising prices is shown by the enterprises of the light and food sectors (balances were respectively +48 percent and +60 percent). In machine building, this indicator dropped to +79 percent (+89 percent in March), and in the woodworking sector -- to +69 percent (+92 percent in March). Predictions of a reduction in employment were recorded in April 1994 among 62 percent of the enterprises (April 1993 -- 30 percent). The greatest cutbacks are likely in the machine building (balance equals -73 percent, -57 percent in the 1st quarter), light (-71 percent, -14 in the 1st quarter) and woodworking (-69 percent, -20 percent in the 1st quarter) sectors of industry. Expected Changes in Production Volume --72 percent of the enterprises are not satisfied with the stabilization of their production. --Demand continues to drop at the former rate. --99 percent of the machine building plants do not have sufficient demand for their products.</graphic> Expected Changes in Prices - The enterprises of the food industry are the best provided with raw material. - Effective demand holds back the production of 80 percent of the industrial enterprises. - Over half of the enterprises expect a cut in their output in the next few months. - No intention to raise prices was recorded for 26 percent of the enterprises in April (March -- 8 percent). </graphic>
