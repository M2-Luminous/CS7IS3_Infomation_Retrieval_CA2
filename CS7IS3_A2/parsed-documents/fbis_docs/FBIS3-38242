The Austrian border authority at the Wullovitz crossing found the three soldiers to be in possession of six hand grenades and one pistol. The soldiers are thought to have brought the weapons back as mementos of their service in ex-Yugoslavia, APA writes. The unit's two transport buses, which had been searched by the border guard, were given customs clearance earlier this evening and the 67 remaining troops continued their journey into the Czech Republic, where customs clearance preceded without problems. The three members of the Czech UNPROFOR unit suspected of small arms smuggling and detained for further questioning this evening, were handed to the Foreign Police Office at Dolni Dvoriste at 2200, Jan Bruzek from the office told CTK. According to Vienna observers, the police action was well prepared in advance which is also proved by the fact that cameramen from Austrian Television arrived immediately on the spot. The Austrian police have refused to tell CTK were the suspicion of arms smuggling by Czech soldiers had originated. All the 70 soldiers were travelling home for a regular leave.
