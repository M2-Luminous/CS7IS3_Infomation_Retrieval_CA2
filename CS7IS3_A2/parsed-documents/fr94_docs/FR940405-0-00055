FR940405-0-00055 FR940405-0-00009 The NPRM The NPRM proposed amending S5.1.1 to permit infant restraints to have a means for enabling the seating surface of the system to adjust during testing so that the restraint's occupant would move from a reclined position to an upright position. Under the NPRM, the movement of the seating surface during testing, relative to the restraint as a whole, had to be unidirectional rotation or translation. The NPRM also proposed that no opening in the restraint structure that is exposed and is larger than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) before the testing shall become smaller during the testing as a result of the movement of the seating surface relative to the restraint as a whole. Comments were expressly sought on the following issues. First, whether movement of the seating surface during dynamic testing should be permitted for child restraints other than infant restraints. Second, whether movement during dynamic testing must occur only unidirectionally in a rotational or translational motion. Third, whether there should be greater leeway in how exposed openings may close. In addition, the NPRM sought comments on whether a change in infant restraint adjustment position during a sudden deceleration should be permitted as a potential way of protecting children from injury that might otherwise result from an air bag impacting the child restraint during a crash. 1 1 For a discussion of potential dangers of an air bag to an infant in a rear-facing child restraint, see 59 FR 7643, February 16, 1994. Comments NHTSA received eight comments on the NPRM. Commenters were Century, Ford, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Congressman Thomas C. Sawyer of Ohio, and three private individuals interested in child seat safety (Messrs. Jerome Koziatek, Donald Friedman and Jonathan Sebring). All the commenters, except Mr. Sebring, generally believed motion in a restraint system will benefit safety. Mr. Koziatek believed that changes in vehicle interiors (e.g., air bags, three-point belts, more restricted occupant space) have made it more difficult for child restraints to protect the child occupant, and that permitting motion will help attenuate the deceleration forces in a crash in a manner that is more beneficial than other means. (He did not specify those other means.) Century emphasized its belief that permitting motion will enable the manufacture of restraints that can transport children with positional apnea. In the more medically correct position. That is, by transporting the child in a more horizontal position, those seven percent of children born that are considered low birth weight will be at a lower risk. Some commenters expressed qualified support. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety believed the idea of movement in a rear-facing child restraint ``has much to recommend it.'' However, the commenter was concerned about possible adverse side effects resulting from the change in adjustment position, such as from abrupt movement of the restraint, and movement that can cause injury to fingers. Similarly, Ford said it ``supports the concept that allowing controlled change of adjusted position during dynamic testing may reap safety benefits, but suggests that further evaluation of the concept be conducted.'' Ford expressed concern about the effect of an abrupt cessation of the movement of the child restraint, such as if the restraint were to rotate into the instrument panel. ``An abrupt stop to the rotation of the restraint, for example, could result in significant dummy neck tension.'' The American Academy of Pediatrics stated that it supports NHTSA's efforts to amend Standard 213 to allow for the development of rear-facing restraints that can safely transport premature and low-weight infants in a less upright position. However, that commenter said there should be restrictions on the amount and type of movement that is allowed, because sudden movement from a horizontal to an upright position can be difficult for a medically fragile child. The Academy was also concerned about protecting the fingers and hands of both the child occupant and adjacent children from injury from exposed openings.
