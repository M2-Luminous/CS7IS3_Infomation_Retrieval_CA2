FBIS4-29404 "dreas117_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 South Korea Government To Continue Cooperation on Sanctions Government To Continue Cooperation on Sanctions SK1706031094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0258 GMT 17 Jun 94 SK1706031094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government, judging that the North Korean nuclear dispute has entered a new phase with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang serving as a turning point, has decided to concentrate on a peaceful solution to the issue through dialogue such as a high-level meeting between Washington and Pyongyang. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, in close contact with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, is closely monitoring Carter's second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il-song Friday. The government will announce its position on North Korea's new sign of reconciliation after President Kim Yong-sam meets with Carter over the weekend to discuss the results of his Pyongyang visit. But the government will continue to push for a U.N. Security Council resolution on sanctions against North Korea if there is no positive change in its nuclear policy. The decisions came at a Unification and Security Policy Coordination Committee meeting presided over by Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku Friday to discuss the overture made by North Korea at Carter's first meeting with Kim Il-song Thursday. In case the high-level U.S.-North Korea talks resume, the government will push to secure the transparency of the North's past nuclear development activities. Carter reportedly said the Washington-Pyongyang talks may resume if North Korea freezes its nuclear program. Preparing for the possibility that North Korea's peace offensive is designed to avoid international sanctions through delaying tactics, the government will continue seeking the cooperation of China, Russia and other countries to gain U.N. Security Council passage of a sanctions resolution on North Korea. Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said the government will reveal its position on developments during Carter's visit to Pyongyang after President Kim is briefed by the former U.S. leader Saturday. The government will concentrate on finding a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue through dialogue, he added. Foreign Minister Han talked over the phone with Secretary Christopher Thursday evening and Friday morning to discuss what Kim Il-song told Carter during their meeting Thursday. "Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci issued a statement this morning as a result of Han's telephone conversation with Christopher," the spokesman said.
