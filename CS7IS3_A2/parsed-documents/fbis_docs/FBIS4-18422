Already at the airport, Zhirinovskiy rejected an image of himself as a nationalist extremist who is moving borders. However, Zhirinovskiy again warned Finland against joining NATO, saying that Russia would safeguard the inviolability of an independent Finland. Arto Nieminen reports: [Nieminen] So he is here now today: Zhirinovskiy, who has been accused of being a nationalist extremist, arrived for a seminar that will discuss Russia's possibilities of getting into the Council of Europe. The seminar may, however, be only a secondary matter as the two-day Russian internal political drama opens tomorrow after a transfer to Finland. Zhirinovskiy was immediately pressed to explain his statements of yesterday that clearly warned Finland against allying itself more closely than now to the West. Now Zhirinovskiy says that Finland can join whatever it wants, but NATO would be an alliance against Russia's interests. Here is Zhirinovskiy with his interpreter. [Zhirinovskiy] The question is, of course, that Finland may join whatever it likes, that is Finland's affair. Russia would like Finland to be an independent, neutral state. Russia is prepared to guarantee Finland's independence and inviolability, but of course, if Finland joins NATO, then that is against Russia's interests and in a possible war situation, military operations will be taking place on Finnish territory too and naturally that is not in Finland's interests, but Finland itself has to decide on these matters. [Nieminen] NATO's Partnership for Peace is also, in Zhirinovskiy's view, only an initial stage of NATO membership. [Zhirinovskiy] It is all a bluff intended for small states. It is like the porch into NATO. [Nieminen] Zhirinovskiy said that he loves Finland, and the Finnish language is sheer music to him, but the Baltic countries were more severely condemned. According to Zhirinovskiy, the Baltic countries are little towns comparable to Monaco and they belong to Russia's territory. Zhirinovskiy also rejected the latest reports on his Jewish background. According to the news agencies, until his 18th year, Zhirinovskiy is supposed to have been called Eidelstein. Zhirinovskiy said that he himself knows best what his name was. However, his memory for names was poor -- Zhirinovskiy called the Finnish president Koivisto until an assistant corrected him. Zhirinovskiy slipped into the Russian delegation as if by accident. The invitation to the seminar was extended before it was known that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would be nominated to the Russian parliament's group of visitors to the Council of Europe. [passage omitted] The seminar opens tomorrow, and it seems that Zhirinovskiy has the clear intention of getting everything out of this seminar that supports the aims of the Liberal Democrats in Russia. This became evident at once; the other members of the delegation already had their work cut out in denying Zhirinovskiy's remarks at the airport.
