During the final congressional session of the week, congressmen approved just one amendment; which grants more power to legislators. Congress will probably vote on the amendment that creates the FSE on 7 February. Yesterday congressmen approved a proposal to invert the agenda and vote on this amendment before others. For lack of quorum, however, everything was postponed until next week. Only an amendment that grants more power to Congress was approved yesterday. As a result of this amendment, congressmen can now summon for questioning by the Congressional Investigation Committees not only ministers but also second-echelon officials and directors of state-owned companies.
