This was done in response to numerous appeals of labor collectives, who believe that conditions for language studies were not created in some places, Parliament Vice-Speaker Nikolay Andronik told ITAR-TASS here today. A parliamentary commission has been set up to analyze the situation. Collectives who feel themselves ready for certification can start it tomorrow. The certification postponement was initiated by the Moldovan Parliament faction of the Socialist Party and the Unity International Movement, who think that "the lack of language knowledge on the part of the Russian-speaking population is often used to remove people from their posts, especially the high ones". In the opinion of specialists, one cannot be forced to study a language. The Christian-Democratic Popular Front, which stands for unification with Romania, and the Bloc of Intellectuals and Farmers did not support the postponement and refused to send their delegates to the parliamentary commission.
