[Hugeux] Is your country suffering from a geostrategic "devaluation?" [Ciller] Quite the reverse. Turkey, the link with the Middle East, the only democratic and secular regime in the region, is more than ever a key country. We have made many sacrifices in our European integration effort. During the Iraqi aggression in Kuwait, Turkey immediately took part in the resistance. But people here are asking questions. Because that did not bring us the slightest support. And yet Greece, Portugal, and Spain received billions of dollars. [Hugeux] Do you see that as ostracism by the "Christian stronghold?" [Ciller] If the aim is to prevent new barriers from being erected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Turkey has an essential role to play. The world is being reshaped. The duel between the market economy and socialism is over. But, we must now turn away from fundamentalism, be it Islamic or Christian. That is the real danger of the next decade. My country can provide a bridge between the two worlds, and hence toward peace. Neglecting it because it is Muslim would be to fuel fundamentalism on all sides. If the Bosnians had been Christians, would Europe have been so passive? [Hugeux] How do you explain the UN failure in Bosnia? [Ciller] It is possible to restructure the institutions. But there is something more serious: a lack of political will. The international community is showing a lack of determination. [Hugeux] Should the embargo on arms destined for the Muslims be lifted? [Ciller] If, as is claimed, we cannot protect them, the least we can do is to allow them to defend themselves. [Hugeux] How would Ankara react if the conflict were extended to Macedonia or Kosovo? [Ciller] In that case, nobody would be able to stand aside. Such a threat is a threat to the world not just to Turkey. [Hugeux] Is this the right time to lift the sanctions against Iraq? [Ciller] We will act in accordance with our allies and will not abolish the embargo on our own account. Even if it does impose a heavy burden on us. [Hugeux] Do you fear a resurgence of Russian imperialism? [Ciller] Helping Moscow to convert to the rules of the market is fine. But does this mean we should ignore the rise of nationalism? Supporting Russia without defending our values there, in the name of supporting a particular individual, may be contributing to this rise in nationalism. And it may feed the temptation to return to the "good old days" in the empire. It is for us to be vigilant. Russia is still the only superpower in the region with nuclear weapons. [Hugeux] Does the breakthrough by the Party of Prosperity (Islamic) in the 27 March municipal elections worry you? [Ciller] Ninety percent of the Turks favor a democratic and secular state. They have been voting in that way for almost 50 years. But there are two reasons for this phenomenon. One is the feeling of having been rejected for too long by our Western allies. The second is the discontent linked with the economic crisis. Reducing inflation and the debt requires many sacrifices. [Hugeux] Why are you giving way to the Army when faced with the PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan)? [Ciller] During the municipal elections, the PKK tried to persuade people not to vote. However, it is in the southeast that the highest participation was recorded. The safer people feel, the more they support us. Let us draw a distinction between citizens of Kurdish origin, whom our Army protects, and the PKK terrorists. Our efforts to promote the economic development of the southeast will shortly be felt. There is one certainty: We will defend our country against any separatist attempt. [Hugeux] Is it necessary to modernize the doctrine inherited from Mustafa Kemal? [Ciller] Of course. But it is not for the government to impose its interpretation of the dogma. It must be broadly debated. The fundamental principles remain: secularism and democracy. And we will not touch that.
