In a press release dated 14 March, the mayor's office, which had just paid three months' back wages to the directors and teachers of the communal schools, the employees of the communal home, and some employees of the Port-au-Prince City Hall, deplores the fact that Deputy Mayor Joseph Gerald Salomon has set himself to prevent the refuse collection workers and the majority of City Hall employees from receiving their paychecks, which have been available for over one month. This press release says the office of Mayor Paul is now working to set up the "Port-au-Prince is struggling" program, the purpose of which is to help improve the living conditions of the population. As a sign of its efforts to restore the proper functioning of the city administration and to allow the employees to receive their wages, the office of the mayor takes this opportunity to publish a letter which Mayor Evans Paul sent to Deputy Mayor Joseph Gerald Salomon and which still has not been answered. The dramatic situation of the city, which the population gave us the responsibility of managing, compels me to write you this letter so as to reach the compromise essential to the rescue of the municipal institution of our capital, writes Evans Paul to Joseph Gerald Salmon. I invite you to regain your self-control and to comply with the norms and principles that you swore to respect on 17 January 1991 when we were installed at the Court House, Paul adds. Beyond our differences and divergences are the fundamental interests of Port-au-Prince society. We have nothing to win, collectively or individually, in this anarchical situation of an administration that does not offer any services to the community. Within the framework of the "Port-au-Prince is struggling" program, I am ready to meet with you -- as a member of the cartel over which I have an electoral mandate to preside -- in order to discuss solutions relating to the problem, writes Evans Paul. I hope you will understand the logic of my steps aimed at normalizing and reinforcing the institutional capability of the city administration to improve the awful conditions of the Port-au-Prince populace. This press release is signed by Evans Paul, president of the Port-au-Prince Municipal Council.
