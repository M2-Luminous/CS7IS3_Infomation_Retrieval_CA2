For the Government's Information: If the Most Urgent Steps Aren't Taken, Serious Science May Soon be Nonexistent in Ukraine''] [Text] Two doctors of sciences complaining of general weakness, fast tiring and noise in their ears visited the Kiev hospital servicing scientists almost simultaneously. An examination revealed that both of the elderly gentlemen were suffering from anemia with, of all things, chronic undernourishment as the cause. Recently I needed an old friend in an urgent matter--a division director in a certain academy institute. I phoned him at work, but there was no answer. An hour later, the same result. When I dialed his home, I heard the voice of my friend. ``What's the matter,'' I asked, ``you sick?'' ``No,'' he said. ``Luckily I'm healthy, but like with all of my colleagues I'm now working as a scientist at home. The institute building isn't heated, and we were let out until spring.'' Here's another fact. It was reported in the Presidium of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences that the issue of reorganizing a number of scientific research institutes in connection with their inability to work under the new conditions is now on the agenda. Yes, something isn't right in the kingdom of science. And judging from everything, the disease won't be cured with mustard plasters, berry tea, and lime blossoms. Medicines of higher efficacy are needed. What is happening with the Academy of Sciences, which just recently stood on one of the top rungs of the social hierarchical ladder? Can something really be jeopardizing the existence of such a mighty and reliable structure? A PRAVDA UKRAINY correspondent discusses these questions with ANU [Ukrainian Academy of Sciences] Corresponding Member Anatoliy Shpak, the academy's chief scientific secretary. Kiyanskiy: What adjustments has the current energy crisis made in the activity of ANU institutions? After all, while historians, economists, philologists or theoretical physicists could work a few months at home when their institutes run out of money for heating, such a routine is not suited to experimental physicists, chemists, materials scientists, and representatives of many other scientific disciplines. Shpak: To our great regret scientists in the humanities aren't the only ones who have to work at home. Our institutions are hundreds of millions of rubles in debt for heat and electric power, and a large number of scientific research institutes in the technical and natural sciences must switch to such a strange work routine, encountered nowhere else in the world. Thus, the temperature in the laboratories and offices of the institutes of colloidal chemistry and water chemistry, microbiology and virology, and molecular biology and genetics has been reduced to plus five degrees Celsius, and the scientists are forced to work at home. I'm afraid that such a ``routine'' will last until May-June. One extremely typical example could be cited here. The allotment of electricity to the Institute imeni Paton was reduced by a fourth. Strange, isn't it? Electric welding without electric power! Even our children are affected by the economic woes. Academy day care centers have closed down for a month (and perhaps more!): There's no money to keep them going. Kiyanskiy: So what happened? Why has science transformed so quickly into a Cinderella? For what reason has it been put on starvation rations? Have the government bigwigs really decided to rectify the country's catastrophic financial situation at the expense of scientists, as if it's impossible to find any other means of avoiding economic ruin? Shpak: That seems to be the case. Judge for yourself: Current financing, and all the more so the prospects for this entire year, are totally inadequate to even our most minimal needs. This pertains chiefly to fundamental research, without which the existence of civilized society is altogether impossible. And all the more so in a country that only recently embarked upon the path of independence. As of today the state owes the academy 40 billion karbovantsy, and this is with regard for the sharply higher prices of fuel. The institutes are presently spending a third of their allocated funds on wages, while practically all the rest goes to energy resources. Our institutions spend hardly any money to obtain modern scientific equipment. And without it, it's altogether impossible to obtain results of any value. What are we here for, if not for that? Recently Ukrainian scientists have been unable to maintain contacts with their own colleagues in the far and near frontier. There's no money for business trips. But why even talk about foreign countries!? It's a problem today just to travel to another city in Ukraine for a conference. The institutes have stopped subscribing to foreign scientific periodicals. And everyone knows, after all, that an information vacuum is contraindicated to science. I know that the fuel situation in Ukraine is totally stressed, but economization and the economy are two different things. To deprive the academy of the needed minimum of energy resources actually means sapping the life blood of entire directions. The research equipment of the leading scientific centers consumes a rather large amount of energy--you can't do anything about that. Consider just the Institute of Nuclear Research. This is a huge complex of unique devices for experimentation in physics, including a nuclear reactor and accelerators. Two-thirds of the academy's associates work in such energy-intensive scientific institutions. It is precisely in such institutes that the country's intellectual potential is created. Kiyanskiy: Just 5 years ago the wages of scientists evoked the unconcealed envy of all other Soviet workers. A doctor of science in charge of a division or a laboratory received 500 rubles, and felt himself to be extremely well-off. How much are scientific workers paid today? Shpak: Before 1 December of last year a doctor of sciences received from 220,000 to 290,000 karbovantsy, a candidate of sciences received an average of not more than 200,000, and a scientific research institute director (as a rule a prominent scientist and a member of the academy) received 370,000 karbovantsy--almost as much as a taxi driver earned. An academician was paid a little more for his high scientific title--10,000 coupons, while a corresponding member was paid 5,000. This amount was enough for one and a half chicken eggs. The pay of scientists was tripled in December, but this is on the average. In general, to be honest, pay is different in different scientific institutions: No special subsidies were allocated to the academy. The institutes are facing a dilemma: pay for building space, or increase wages. Many are trying to find the golden mean. As a result it comes both hot and cold for them, as they say. Such that now even a yardman doesn't envy a doctor of sciences. Some of my acquaintances--people with academic degrees and the highest qualifications--are forced to become taxi drivers for several hours in the morning before work and in the evenings, using their own cars. What choice do they have? Life is making them do it! You can't feed a large family today on scientific activity alone. I can't help worrying when I look at some of our old academicians--prominent scientists who devoted the best years of their lives to science, and who now have to keep a mental tally of how much they spent today on a carton of milk and a can of sour cream, and of how many coupons are left over for tomorrow. The old academician goes to the store, and all he gets is grief: His paltry pension and academy benefits aren't enough for the most necessary things. Need we be amazed that some scientists have decided to leave the country? Unfortunately the most energetic, promising and talented are the ones who are leaving: Young people have no faith in advancement, and in making a career of it in their homeland, they have no certainty in tomorrow. Even venerable scientists are now emigrating. Many of our former compatriots can be found in the West's leading scientific centers, though unfortunately, not only as professors. Kiyanskiy: How many scientists has the country already lost? Shpak: In the last two and a half years over 300 persons left institutes of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences for business trips abroad for a period of over 6 months. Unfortunately one out of every three has not returned. We don't know what many of the scientists who left will do. The terms of their business trips aren't up yet. However, more than likely our institutes will not be seeing some of them anymore. By the way, ``internal emigration'' is no less dangerous. Both young academy scientists and middle-aged people are leaving more frequently for commercial organizations. Science is losing prestige literally before our eyes. The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is certainly experiencing one of the most difficult periods of its life. The situation in the institutes is now extremely complex, and to be honest, the spirits of their colleagues are rather low. It is already clear today, after all, that a large number of our scientific institutions will encounter very serious difficulties this year, and even the question of their very existence will possibly be raised. In all probability, representatives of government structures arguing for ultraeconomical and clearly insufficient financial support to Ukrainian science believe that in the extreme case it could be mothballed until better times. But can it? Of course it wouldn't be difficult to literally freeze places like the institutes of cybernetics or molecular biology and genetics: Their colleagues work in cold offices anyway. But can you really freeze cybernetics, molecular biology, and other disciplines until better times? In 5-8 years they will fall hopelessly behind, and this will retard the entire state's intellectual development.
