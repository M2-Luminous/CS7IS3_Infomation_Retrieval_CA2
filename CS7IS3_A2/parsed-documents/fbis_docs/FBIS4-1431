Good morning, Mrs. de Klerk. If you could share some thoughts with us on this historic day, really. People are buoyant here. [F.W. de Klerk] It's a great day for South Africa. It is the day that we have been working for, for more than five years, really, but specifically, since I became president, I started to work for this day. We promised this day to the people, and with the help, through negotiation, also of others, we've achieved what we set out to achieve. Today is the beginning, really, of a new era. Yesterday already augured it in, but today all South Africans are flooding to the polls. I'm glad that there is such enthusiasm. It augurs well for the future. It will ensure that this government of national unity will be fully representative of all the people, and that those who boycott this election will be clearly identified as a very small minority. It will forge, also, all the people into the nationhood which we need to build. I'm confident that the next five years will be five formative years, in which South Africa will establish itself as a country, which offers great hope to all its people. [Burke, in Afrikaans] A word from you, Mrs. de Klerk? [Marike de Klerk, in Afrikaans] It's a wonderful day to be voting for the new South Africa. We hope that in the new South Africa we will be able to maintain the values which we have cherished up to now as very important, our cultural values, our family values, our religious values, and that there will be room in the new South Africa for everyone. [Burke] Mr. De Klerk, you've always voted here at Arcadia. Has it got a special place in your heart? [De Klerk] Well, I'm voting as a citizen today, not president. Everybody's vote counts exactly in the same manner and has the same weight. This is the nearest polling booth to where I live, to where I work. I've always voted here since I became president and a minister. I also live near here, and I decided not to make too big a show, and to vote where it would be natural for me to vote, and not make a roadshow out of it.
