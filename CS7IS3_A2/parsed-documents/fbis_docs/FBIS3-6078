The prime minister said many factors need to be considered before he could make any decision on the offer. Speaking to reporters at his Hari Raya [end of fasting month] open house in Kuala Lumpur, he said it was difficult to make a decision because many events had occurred since the state elections last month. He said his decision had to take into account the actions of several Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party, PBS] assemblymen who had resigned to join the Barisan Nasional [National Front]. Pairin, who is PBS president, told his younger brother, Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, who is the Bingkor assemblyman and Sabah Foundation director, of his wish to step down as chief minister. Interviewed by reporters at the prime minister's residence, Sri Perdana, this morning, Dr. Jeffrey said Datuk Pairin wants to play a different role and is prepared to withdraw as a means to avoid political crisis. Dr. Jeffrey is expected to convey Pairin's offer to Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir and Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim at a separate meeting in the federal capital tonight. [passage omitted]
