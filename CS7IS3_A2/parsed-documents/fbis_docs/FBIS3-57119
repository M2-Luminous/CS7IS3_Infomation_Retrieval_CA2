The other 37 resolutions, which the government accepted in between the parliament sessions, were sent for consideration to the Saeima (parliament) standing committees. The rejected rule stipulated the setup of counterintelligence services to prognosticate, monitor and neutralize any danger to the national security. The services were also designed to gather information on concrete candidates for important government posts. A heated debate arose when considering the Cabinet resolutions on the Riga local government and the amendments to the law on the status of a local deputy. As reported, the government adopted these norms Jan. 10 after the conflict between local authorities and Russian officers. The rules allow for dismissing any local government head who repeatedly fails to observe laws or Cabinet resolutions. The norms are inconsistent with the principles of a rule-of-law state, according to which an elected person is dismissed only by a court ruling, said Maris Budovskis, of the National Independence Movement faction. If the Saeima had rejected the resolution, Andrejs Rucs, the fired Vidzeme district head, should have been restored in office.
