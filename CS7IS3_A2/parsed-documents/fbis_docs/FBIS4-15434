"Such technical mistakes almost never occur in the world," Birkavs told BNS. Consequently, the motion should be a deliberate action, he noted. Moreover, the interpretation of the incident does not affect the Latvian stance, the premier stressed. "Russia has unveiled plans to establish military bases here. Latvia needs additional guarantees from Russia and from other countries that the bases will not be set up," Birkavs added. "The issue of deployment of any Russian bases on the territory of Latvia is not being raised and does not exist," Yeltsin's spokesman, Vecheslav Kostikov, said in a formal statement, according to The Associated Press. Birkavs predicted that the incident would show the world community how real the threats to the Latvian security are and how much the Baltic country needs international security guarantees. Simultaneously, Birkavs conceded that no country or organization was likely to assume for responsibility for Latvia's security in the near future. It is a gradual process in which Latvia is trying to integrate by safeguarding its security, first of all, itself, the prime minister said. Defense Minister Valdis Birkavs told BNS that Yeltsin's resolution was tailored to find out Latvia's views. Russia stepped back after it sensed the sharp counter reaction, he said. Similar tactics has become traditional for Russia, Pavlovskis said. Russia has said several months ago that it, like the United States, needs military bases abroad but Latvia was never before enclosed in the list of "eligible countries."
