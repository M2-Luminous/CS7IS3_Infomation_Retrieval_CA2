FBIS4-38206 "drnes125_m_94004" FBIS-NES-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 JORDAN Muslim Brotherhood Rejects Accords With Israel Muslim Brotherhood Rejects Accords With Israel JN2806124394 Amman AL-SABIL in Arabic 28 Jun 94 p 4 JN2806124394 Amman AL-SABIL Arabic BFN [Statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood "on the Jordanian-Jewish negotiations and their results"; date not given] [Text] "Men said to them: A great army is gathering against you, and frightened them. But it only increased their faith. They said: For us God sufficeth, and He is the best disposer of affairs. And they returned with grace and bounty from God. No harm ever touched them. For they followed the good pleasure of God, and God is the Lord of bounties unbounded. It is only the evil one that suggests to you the fear of his votaries. Be ye not afraid of them, but fear me, if ye have faith." [Koranic verse] The Jordanian Government has announced, in an unjustified way, its intention to expedite the negotiations with the Zionist enemy, as well as its concern to reach preliminary agreements and detailed agendas in the fields of security, economy, and environment. These agreements were reached in record time and within a few days, as if things were prepared in advance. The announcement of the agenda was accompanied by a new Jordanian negotiating platform which is governed by a new spirit and definitions which were expressed by some officials in a language that is not in harmony with the constants and red lines to which the state committed itself. This constituted real changes in the Jordanian negotiating policy, which will have a negative effect even on the extent of the Zionist "concessions!" over the territories and potentials usurped from Jordan which would be produced by these negotiations. These agreements, agendas, or statements recognize the Jewish enemy in terms of existence, state, legitimacy, and interests, and implicitly free this enemy from usurpation, occupation, and historical hostility. In addition, the enemy will be introduced to the regional states as if it is an Arab state. The cooperation and coordination in the field of economy, water, security, and sovereignty in fact constitute normalization of relations and cooperation with the enemy in accordance with its demands and wishes. Such cooperation is unmatched by any cooperation between Jordan and any other Hebrew [as published] state, or even among the Arab countries themselves. The expeditious signing of these agendas and the statements on separate solutions are an achievement of the enemy's strategy, which is based on Zionist penetration and reaching separate deals with each party, in order to make gains and become the strongest party which can apply pressure and impose whatever it wants on the Arab parties. The Muslim Brotherhood, which announced its rejection of negotiations with the usurper Zionist enemy and of relinquishing any part of land and Arab and Islamic rights -- in view of its understanding of history, the nature of conflict with the Zionists, and the situation of the nation and the region -- reiterates its stand and announces its rejection of all steps, agreements, and agendas, which were announced, and reiterates the following: -- The contents of the detailed agendas on security, environment, and tourism are the inauguration of normalization with the Zionist enemy and the laying down of foundations for cooperation with the enemy before it even acknowledges Jordan's rights and their dimensions, not to mention restoring them. This is considered a consent to the Zionist view and an achievement of its famous slogan: Peace for peace. This leads to wasting the nation's rights to the territories and holy places that the enemy has usurped to establish its entity. This also leads to forcing cooperation and normalization, which are impossible to rescind in case the Zionists refuse to recognize all our rights. All this is a departure from the basis of the negotiations and a risky gamble involving national rights with an enemy well versed in treachery and revoking charters and conventions. --What is taking place reflects a state of anxiousness to approach the Zionist entity first in order to achieve some gains for fear that some may fall in the Zionist lap at the expense of some of Jordan's rights. --What we fear most is for the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations to turn into a Jordanian Oslo accord, which would serve Zionist schemes and meet the Zionist objective of having separate deals, exactly as the Palestinian Oslo accord did. --The declared justifications for this negotiatory acceleration do not give the government the right to take steps for which Jordan will pay in terms of its Arab relations, especially since Jordan is suffering from closed doors with most Arab neighbors. Is it reasonable for the government to run behind Zionist promises and deceptive plans and block its relations with certain Arabs? This is unreasonable, regardless of other's calculations and intentions, which are known by nobody but God. --We believe that what is going on will lead to a separate solution. This is practically the opposite of the comprehensive solution that the government is talking about, regardless of its attempts to justify its acts. We urge the regimes and peoples to face up to those challenges and to maintain the nation's rights, sovereignty, and wealth, which are not the property of a single generation, but of all generations. We realize that the nation's current weakness is a transient state of affairs, which does not justify compliance and relinquishing rights. This weakness can be overcome by resolve, adequate management, patience, and further cohesion, freedom, and justice. Above all, we should hold fast to God's approach and be united under His laws and course. In its long history, the nation has experienced times of greater weakness. It did not surrender, however, but instead maintained a high spirit of jihad and put up a valiant resistance, thus overcoming its weaknesses and emerging stronger, thanks to its faith in God and then to the efforts of its faithful sons. We urge the people to reject all past and subsequent destructive political settlement agreements, not to comply with the enemy's will, and to resist those agreement's subsequent effects. "Call to mind when ye were a small band, despised through the land, and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; but He provided a safe asylum for you, strengthened you with His aid, and gave you good things for sustenance: That ye might be grateful. O ye that believe! Betray not the trust of God and the Apostle, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you." [koranic verse] God is great. God be praised.
