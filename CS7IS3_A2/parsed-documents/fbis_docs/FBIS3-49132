"It is the last viewpoint I am taking into consideration at the moment," he added. Klaus said, however, that such an approach could prove to be no good as "every such interference costs something." "I have an impression that I should play a role of a financier at the moment and start counting how much it will cost," Klaus said. He added, however, that the idea of state administration reform demanded "deeper discussion." The supposition that "all things should always be done closer to citizens, is only half correct," Klaus said. "It is certainly not true that we should conduct foreign policy closer to the people and solve the basic problems of the army and this country's defence closer to the people," Klaus said. He said he firmly believed the government would manage to resolve "the deepest conceptual questions" connected with the reform during January and would meet the timetable set for state administration reform. That means that draft proposal for competitions to be invested into higher self-governing units would be completed, he said. Speaking about the role of the state in society, Klaus said this role should be "extremely small." He added, however, that as a representative of the state he could not consider the state its major enemy but should on the contrary try to do his utmost for the state to function well and bring "something positive to the people." Klaus said that the opportunities for businessmen in the Czech Republic to make a profit without offering the right quality of their goods or services were diminishing and this process was irreversible. He said ethics and morality on one side and a market economy on the other do not exclude each other but are interconnected. "Any attempts to separate these things are bad... because they are the two sides of one coin," Klaus said.
