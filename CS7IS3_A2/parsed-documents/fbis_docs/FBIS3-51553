The election to a four-year term was conducted during Opanal's eighth extraordinary period of sessions, which was held at the Foreign Secretariat's conference room and chaired by Deputy Foreign Secretary Rosario Green. At that forum, the official noted new Opanal Chairman Enrique Roman Morey's willingness to see that the continental agreements against the arms race are fully enforced, and he pledged to foster peace on the continent. Green stressed that Argentina's and Chile's adherence to the Tlatelolco Treaty helped Opanal oversee the faithful compliance of this pact, which calls for banning nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. At the conclusion of the meeting, Ambassador Green hosted a lunch in honor of outgoing Opanal Chairman Antonio Stempel Paris, at which she noted his dedication and effort to free the continent of nuclear weapons. She recalled that the Mexican Government has granted top priority to achieving this goal.
