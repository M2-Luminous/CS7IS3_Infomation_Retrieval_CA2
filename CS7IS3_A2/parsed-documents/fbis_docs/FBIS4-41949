Today at his residence, Ulmanis held a news conference at which he explained the reasons for his decision. I cannot sign a law that as a result of which Latvia will clearly be isolating itself, said Ulmanis. Besides, the president also objects to the fact that no law has yet been adopted regulating the status of stateless persons and foreigners. As already reported, international experts' recommendations do not correspond to Article 14 in the law on citizenship, which provides an annual naturalization quota of 0.1 percent of the number of Latvian citizens in the previous year, starting from the year 2000. Many foreign envoys, too, have tried to convince Latvian politicians that the citizenship law does not correspond to the requirements adopted in Europe. Letters about it have been sent by the governments of the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and France. In Ulmanis' opinion, the citizenship law cannot be ideal, as it is resolving the consequences of the occupation of Latvia; however, the president still favors the law balancing the survival of the Latvian nation and civic harmony. He also predicted that the changes to the citizenship law will after all be two contentious points. Evidently the Saeima's plenary session on it will take place after the visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to Latvia. Ulmanis noted the possibility that the visit could leave a positive impression for the solution of this issue. At the news conference Ulmanis also reproached the Latvian Government and parliament because these institutions had placed the responsibility on him of settling, in place of these institutions, important political issues that exceed the duties of the president provided in the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia. The Constitution does not provide political responsibility to the state president for his activity.
