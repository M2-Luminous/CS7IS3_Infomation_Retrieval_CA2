His government decided to join SITTDEC a few months ago after following SITTDEC's development since its inception about two years ago. We were briefed about SITTDEC and its development today and I think that Cuba will benefit if it joins, he told reporters through an interpreter after visiting the SITTDEC office at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry here. SITTDEC, an agency of the group of 15 developing countries (G-15), set up through Malaysia's initiative, was adopted at the grouping's second summit in Caracas, Venezuela, in November 1991. SITTDEC would help relay business information to member countries to reduce economic dependence on the developed countries. Gonzales, who is leading a seven-member delegation, was earlier briefed by SITTDEC executive director Mohamed Salleh Masduki. Cuba would be the 15th country to join SITTDEC. Gonzales and his delegation arrived Saturday for a three-day official visit. Meanwhile, Mohamed Salleh said Indonesia, India, Argentina, Chile, Jamaica, Senegal, Zimbabwe and Algeria were among countries that had joined SITTDEC.
