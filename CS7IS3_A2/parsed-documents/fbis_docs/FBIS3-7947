This was established by an army inspection headed by Jaromir Novotny, director of the Foreign Relations Section at the Defense Ministry. The inspection found that, according to the applicable tables on issue of arms, the soldiers were armed for peace conditions. "If something happened, each soldier would certainly have some kind of weapon, but we have decided that he will be better armed," Novotny said. He emphasized that the army command also decided that each UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] battalion will have a submachine gun. To date, submachine guns have only been used by the soldiers authorized to do so by the appropriate standards. Novotny stated that the unit will have guided anti-tank missiles at its disposal. The better equipment for the Czech troops will be brought by the 117 soldiers who yesterday left the UN peacekeeping forces training base in Cesky Krumlov for Karlovac in Croatia. [passage omitted]
