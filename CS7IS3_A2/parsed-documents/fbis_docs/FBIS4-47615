FBIS TRENDS-06MAY94--UKRAINE Ukraine: Officers Block Merger of Air, Air Defense Forces Ukraine: Officers Block Merger of Air, Air Defense Forces SUMMARY When the Ukrainian government at tempted to merge units inherited from the former USSR's Air Force and Air Defense Forces into a single service arm, it encountered potent opposition from officers of both services, illustrating that the officers' sense of service identity and concern to protect their traditional military missions have carried over into Ukrainian politics as potent forces. Although the government retreated partially on the merger, postponing it at least until 1996, the government and Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, in particular, seem determined to assert their authority over the services and eventually to force the merger through. The dispute over the merger is taking place against a background of military dissatisfaction over a wide range of issues, including budget shortfalls that the government is unlikely to be able to relieve, making further conflict between the government and the officers probable. END SUMMARY The officers waged a dogged struggle against the government's intention to merge units of the Air Force and Air Defense Forces- -separate services under the Soviet regime--into a single service arm. On 6 December 1991, the Supreme Council approved a Law on the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which specified that the armed forces would consist of three services: ground forces, a navy, and a single "Air Force (Airspace Defense Troops)" [footnote: In both Russian and Ukrainian, the term "airspace defense" (oborona vozdushnogo prostranstva/oborona povitryanoho prostoru) clearly refers only to territorial airspace, and not to outer space.] (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 January 1994). Perhaps in deference to to military opposition, the government was extremely dilatory both in implementing the merger and in publicly making the case for it. Volodymyr Antonets, an Air Force major general, spent several months in 1992 drafting a plan to implement the merger (Narodnaya Armiya, 31 July 1992; Holos Ukrayiny, 4 August 1992); subsequent press reports identified him as the initiator of the idea for the merger (Krasnaya Zvezda, 6 February 1993 and 4 March 1994; Kievskiye Vedomosti, 23 February 1994). However, while Antonets was working on the merger implementation plan, President Leonid Kravchuk issued a decree on military organization which listed the Air Force and Air Defense Forces as separate services (Narodnaya Armiya, 20 May 1992) and appointed separate Air Force and Air Defense Forces commanders, Valeriy Vasylyev (Pravda Ukrayiny, 6 May 1992) and Mykhaylo Lopatin (Narodnaya Armiya, 6 June 1992). Military Opposition to Merger From the beginning, there was clearly strong opposition within the military to the merger. Only days after the text of the Law on the Armed Forces was published, Armed Forces First Deputy Chief of Staff Georgiy Zhivitsa told an interviewer that Ukraine would have separate Air and Air Defense Forces (Narodnaya Armiya, 10 January 1992). Shortly after his appointment as Air Force commander, Vasylyev openly opposed the merger, telling an interviewer that the two services had sharply different functions and that the combined service would give short shrift to the Air Force's function of carrying the war to an aggressor's rear areas and home bases, a function which he said Soviet experience in World War II and Afghanistan had shown to be crucial. Vasylyev also called for the adoption of special emblems and other measures to enhance the Air Force's sense of group identity, and made a rather plaintive plea for the government to be more "solicitous" of the Air Force's needs in general (Narodnaya Armiya, 2 June 1992). Shortly thereafter, Vasylyev's fears were indirectly substantiated in an article by the Air Defense Forces chief of staff, Vladimir Tkachev. Tkachev seemed to envisage the merger as, in effect, absorption of the Air Force by the Air Defense Forces. He argued that a Soviet-style, offensively oriented Air Force was inappropriate to independent Ukraine's purely defensive military strategy. He predicted that, in the new combined air service, some of the Air Force regiments inherited from the Soviet Union would be disbanded and the remaining ones assigned to air defense tasks (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992). Air Defense Forces Commander Lopatin, however, was reported to oppose the merger on grounds mirroring Vasylyev's: He feared that the combined service would in wartime concentrate its assets on the defense of military forces in the field, ignoring the Air Defense Forces' central mission of protecting Ukrainian cities and industrial centers against enemy air attack. Adding a note of national pride to the dispute, Lopatin also deprecated "blind copying" of Western military organizational models (Narodnaya Armiya, 31 July 1992). Delayed Efforts To Implement Merger The government persisted in its efforts to carry out the merger, although high level opposition within the military evidently slowed its progress. A year after the Law on the Armed Services was enacted, Kravchuk finally appointed Antonets the first commander of the new combined Air Force (Airspace Defense Troops) in January 1993 (Holos Ukrayiny, 20 February 1993), with Vasylyev and Lopatin as his deputies for aviation and air defense, respectively (ITAR-TASS, 17 February 1993). The Defense Ministry leadership also at last began to publicly answer critics of the merger. Lyubomir Petriv, the new combined Air Force's first deputy chief of staff for aviation, assured an interviewer that the new service would adequately fulfill both air defense and offensive air combat functions. He also argued that "world experience" showed that air superiority in wartime could be achieved only by the coordination of air defense and offensive operations which the merger would make possible (Demokratychna Ukrayina, 4 March 1993). Opposition Intensifies Six months after Antonets' appointment as combined Air Force commander, Petriv told an interviewer that unnamed officers, in both branches of the new service, were organizing to oppose the merger. He accused them of being unpatriotic and said that they were opposing the merger because, by consolidating redundant command structures, it would eliminate a "considerable number" of jobs. He concluded by calling on them to set aside "parochial departmental or service ambitions" (Golos Ukrainy, 8 July 1993). On 29 July 1993, UNIAN reported that Defense Ministry "discussion" of the merger--supposedly policy since December 1991--had only just begun and that Armed Forces Chief of Staff Anatoliy Lopata was opposed to it. Furthermore, UNIAN reported, Antonets was complaining that "military leaders" were "sabotaging" his directives. In October, Supreme Council member Ihor Derkach claimed that the merger was going so slowly because Kravchuk was unable to control the military (Moloda Halychyna, 23 October 1993). Merger Called Off Toward the end of 1993, the Defense Ministry appeared to retreating. Although in October, the newly-appointed minister, Vitaliy Radetskyy, endorsed the merger (Narodna Armiya, 28 October 1993), the next month Lopata told an interviewer that the merger, while still on track, would take place only "after diligent study and substantiation, and without any haste whatsoever" (Narodna Armiya, 23 November 1993). Finally, in December Radetskyy "suspended" the merger and reduced the combined Air Force staff from 180 to 40 officers, whose only function would be to prepare a "feasibility study" on the merger. Radetskyy reportedly based the suspension on an earlier decree by President Kravchuk (UNIAN, 21 December 1993; Narodna Armiya, 25 February 1994). Plans for the Air Force/Air Defense Forces merger were "premature," Radetskyy subsequently said, and they would be carried out eventually, but not earlier than 1996 (Holos Ukrayiny, 20 January 1994; Ukrayinska Hazeta, 20 January-2 February 1994; Kiev radio, 25 February 1994). The postponement may have been a larger concession than Radetskyy was willing to admit. In his 8 July 1993 Golos Ukrainy interview, Petriv had claimed that opponents of the merger hoped that, if it could be stalled until 1996, the separate service command structures would by that time be so entrenched as to make the merger impossible. Military Targets Antonets Two months after Radetskyy suspended the merger, Kravchuk outraged Air Force officers by appointing Antonets as Air Force commander in place of Vasylyev, who was placed "at the disposal of the defense minister pending future assignment" (Narodna Armiya, 22 February 1994; Kiev TV, 24 February 1994). [footnote: At the same time, Kravchuk gave Lopatin back his old job as commander of the separate Air Defense Forces (Narodna Armiya, 22 February 1994).] Seven senior Air Force generals, including the entire Air Force Military Council, reportedly refused to serve under Antonets and threatened to resign from the service unless his appointment was rescinded (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 23 February, 2 March 1994; Narodna Armiya, 25 February 1994). [footnote: Ukrainian media have not been observed to identify all seven of the generals. Kievskiye Vedomosti on 2 March 1994 listed five of them: Vasylyev, Air Force Deputy Commander Ya. Skalko, V. Varyvoda, and N. Morokhovets--all Air Force Military Council members--and Gennadiy Kolodiy, commander of the 17th Air Army.] Ukrainian and Russian press reports attributed the generals' antipathy toward Antonets to his role in the merger plan, to his active role in the Ukrainian Officers Union (UOU) (See box), and to charges that Antonets was using political connections to displace a respected professional officer. (Post-Postup, 2 December 1993; Kievskiye Vedomosti, 2 March 1994; Krasnaya Zvezda, 4 March 1994; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 17 March 1994). The military newspaper Narodna Armiya wrote that the seven generals' feelings were widely shared among Air Force officers (25 February 1994). The Russian newspaper Kommersant-Daily commented that the incident was symptomatic of military unhappiness with the government over a wide range of issues (25 February 1994). Radetskyy Seeks To Soothe Feelings, Assert Authority Radetskyy responded to the resignation threat by trying to address the officers' concerns while simultaneously reasserting government authority over the military and defending Antonets. He promptly led a delegation of top Defense Ministry officials to Air Force headquarters in Vinnytsya, where he "presented" Antonets to his subordinates and reminded the officers that presidential appointments were not subject to discussion by military officers. During his visit, Radetskyy also fielded questions from Air Force officers, as well as from officers of the Vinnytsya-based 43rd Missile Army, on a wide range of issues and promised to deal with their concerns in such areas as shortages of fuel and spare parts and problems in discipline, combat readiness, safety, and living conditions. He also promised the missile officers that their careers would not suffer as a result of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament (Narodna Armiya, 25 February 1994; Kiev TV, 24 February 1994; Holos Ukrayiny, 26 February 1994). The generals were apparently persuaded to withdraw their resignation threat, at least for the time being (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 2 March 1994; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 17 March 1994). Radetskyy also reportedly showed his confidence in Antonets by including him in a high-level group to deal with the crisis in Crimea (ITAR-TASS, 5 April 1994). Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Bizhan also defended Antonets and confronted Vasylyev's supporters, saying that Vasylyev was removed from command of the Air Force for incompetence (Kiev radio, 6 April 1994; Narodna Armiya, 6 April 1994). Unrest in Military Widespread The Ukrainian military's grievances against the government are long-standing and cover a wide range of issues, as evidenced by Vasylyev's plea for more support in his 2 June 1992 Narodnaya Armiya interview and by the questions which officers posed to Radetskyy during his trip to Vinnytsya. There have been other recent manifestations of military unhappiness with the government: -- A Narodna Armiya correspondent, Lieutenant Colonel Nykyfor Lysitsya, complained in an 18 December 1993 article that cutbacks in flight training as a result of fuel shortages had seriously degraded Air Force pilots' combat skills. 0n 21 February 1994, UNIAN reported that all Air Force combat training flights had been suspended for lack of fuel. -- On 21 February 1994 UNIAN reported that soldiers of a combined arms division stationed near Odesa and an Air Force regiment in Ivano-Frankivsk had gone on strike because they had not been paid. UNIAN also reported that officers at the Kiev Military Control and Communication Institute were circulating leaflets protesting poor living conditions. -- An Air Force regiment in Chernihiv protested to President Kravchuk over shortages of fuel and other supplies, claiming that money was being wasted on non-essential items (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 2 March 1994). -- A military columnist, Colonel Mykola Bilovil, published a scathing personal attack on Radetskyy, saying that the defense minister was lavishing luxuries on himself while the troops lacked basic personal and operational necessities (Ukrayinska Hazeta, 31 March-13 April 1994). Outlook The two services' success in blocking--even if only temporarily- -the planned Air Force/Air Defense Forces merger marks their emergence as a political force to be reckoned with, with a sense of their own institutional identity and interests and the power to defend those interests. Their success evidently emboldened officers to press their perceived advantage by seeking to block Antonets' appointment as Air Force commander. However, their failure to do so indicates the limits of their power for the moment as well as the government's determination to resist making any more concessions. Ukraine's near-catastrophic economic situation will probably make it impossible for the government to assuage officers' discontent over other issues such as military pay and supplies, thus setting the stage for further conflict. The alliance--perhaps of convenience--between Radetskyy and a UOU activist like Antonets suggests that the defense minister may now see the development of the armed services into entrenched interest groups along service lines as a greater threat to his authority than the UOU's attempts to influence military policy, attempts he has previously opposed. Box Biographic Information on Antonets Volodymyr Mykhaylovych Antonets is a career Air Force officer as well as a long-time activist in the Union of Officers of Ukraine (UOU). In February 1992 he was a major general of aviation and commander of aviation for the Carpathian Military District (Krasnaya Zvezda, 25 February l992), and was then appointed commander of the 14th Air Army (Narodnaya Armiya, 21 March 1992). At a session of of the UOU oblast chairmen's coordinating committee, he spoke against acceptance into the armed forces of officers whose loyalty to Ukraine he considered suspect (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 May 1992; Krasnaya Zvezda, 10 June 1992). In a round table sponsored by Narodnaya Armiya, he defended the UOU's then-prominent role in military reorganization (13 June 1992). Critics of the UOU have accused Antonets of organizing medical treatment, on the UOU's behalf, for members of the underground armed Ukrainian Self-Defense (UNSO) organization (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 27 November 1993; Krasnaya Zvezda, 4 March 1994). On at least two occasions, Antonets has spoken publicly against Ukraine's nuclear disarmament (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 20 February 1992; Krasnaya Zvezda, 25 February 1992). In 1992, Antonets drafted a plan to implement the merger of the Air Force and Air Defense Forces, which the Supreme Council had decided on in December 1991 (Narodnaya Armiya, 31 July 1992; Holos Ukrayiny, 4 August 1992). In January 1993, President Kravchuk promoted him to lieutenant general and appointed him commander of a new service arm combining the Air Force and the Air Defense Forces (Holos Ukrayiny, 20 February 1993). After the merger of the two services was called off, Kravchuk appointed him commander of the Air Force (Narodnaya Armiya, 22 February 1994). End of Box (AUTHOR: O'LEARY.
