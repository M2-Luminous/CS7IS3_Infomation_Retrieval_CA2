FR941102-0-00066 FR941102-0-00020 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 97 [DA 94&hyph;1158] Revised Procedures for Filing an Amateur Service License Application AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This Order amends the amateur service rules to provide an electronic filing capability to the volunteer-examiner coordinators (VECs), to clarify that amateur station and operator licensees are authorized as soon as the license data is entered into the Commission's licensee data base, and to reflect other non-substantive procedural changes. This action is necessary because recent modernization of the Commission's data processing capabilities makes it possible to greatly reduce the time it takes for us to grant licenses in the amateur service, and all of the VECs have notified us that they want to begin electronic filing of license application data as soon as possible. The intended effect of this action is to allow successful license examinees to operate their amateur stations as soon as possible. The text of the final rules is at the end of this document. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William T. Cross, Special Services Division, Private Radio Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC. 20554; or telephone (202) 632&hyph;4964. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. This is a summary of the Order adopted October 17, 1994, and released October 24, 1994. The complete text of this Order, including the rule amendments, may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. 2. Accepting from the VECs electronically filed data from applications for new and upgraded amateur operator licenses, will eliminate the time and effort required for the VECs to send, and for the Commission to receive, application documents by mail. As part of their routine operations, the VECs enter the data from the application documents they receive into an electronic form that can be sent at high speed over telephone lines to our license processing facility. This data can be used as received so that our license processors could discontinue manually reentering the data into the processing system. We have been making arrangements with the VECs to enable them to use electronic filing procedures similar to those that have been implemented for certain private land mobile radio services. The FCC Form 610 has been revised to accommodate electronic filing. VECs may also continue to send by mail to our license processing facility the application documents. 3. The decision to grant a license occurs when our license processing facility enters the data into the amateur service licensee data base. Currently, however, the new licensee must delay beginning operation until a license document can be printed, mailed, and delivered. This procedure can result in several weeks delay during which the licensee cannot operate an amateur station. Fortunately, information technology is making our amateur service licensee data base more widely available, thus diminishing the need for an amateur operator to hold a license document before exercising the privileges authorized by the grant of the license. We are amending the rules, therefore, to authorize operation on the basis of the licensee data appearing in the amateur service licensee data base. 4. Beginning in 1995, our new system also will give us the capability to make a timely mailing to a licensee's address of record a renewal short form, filled in and ready for signature. We are amending the rules to allow this form to be used. Because we cannot be certain of delivery of the form to every licensee in every instance, however, we will also continue to allow the Form 610 to be used for renewing licenses. 5. We are also combining into ยง97.509 all of the administering volunteers examiner (VE) requirements that are presently stated in four separate rule sections, and adding new ยง97.511, Examinee conduct, to emphasize that an examinee must comply with the instructions given by the administering VEs. Further, we are amending ยง97.9 to treat Technician Plus as a license class. 6. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to the amended rules because there will not be any significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amateur service may not be used to transmit communications for compensation, for the pecuniary benefit of the station control operator or the station control operator's employer, or for communications, on a regular basis, which could reasonably be furnished through other radio services. See 47 CFR 97.113. 7. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Order, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612 (1981). 8.
