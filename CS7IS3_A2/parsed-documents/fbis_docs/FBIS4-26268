Now, my prediction of 20 years ago is proving correct." Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of the France-China Committee and president of the GEC-Alsthom company, made this point to XINHUA during a recent visit to Beijing. An old friend of China who had visited this country many times, Desgeorges contributed greatly to promoting Sino-French cooperation. He was proud to recall that GEC-Alsthom had established business links with China in the 1950s, and in 1958 signed the first contract with China for locomotives. The company sold China 300 locomotives, which are still running well today. Alsthom had also been involved in the construction of China's thermal and hydro-power electricity plants. "China has been an extremely important market for Alsthom," Desgeorges said. "We earnestly hope to continue to cooperate with China in the fields of energy and traffic now that French-Sino relations have returned to a normal track." Though the Alsthom-China contracts always cover huge programs, Desgeorges was not satisfied. As China needs to strengthen its infrastructure, such as the energy industry, transport and telecommunications, in which fields France is in the forefront, he insisted that the contracts of large programs were not enough to give impetus to the comprehensive development of French-Sino trade and economic relations. More numerous cooperation, that is contracts between Chinese and French medium-size and small enterprises and collaboration in medium-size and small programs, should be implemented, he said. The development of medium-size and small enterprises, which offer large employment opportunities, was of great significance to China, he noted, because it has a lot of medium-size and small business concerns. Desgeorges said the France-China Committee would investigate the situation of French medium-size and small enterprises and provide a list of those interested in China's market in various trades. Desgeorges was in April elected president of the committee of France-China, which was set up in 1979, to develop French-Sino cooperation of industry and trade. It has 200 members, including some big enterprises and groups. The committee will select the best ones to make contact direct with their Chinese counterparts. Desgeorges added that they could cooperate in forms of technological cooperation, trade exchanges, joint management and even opening markets in a third country. He suggested that China may establish a China-France committee as well so as to find Chinese medium-size and small enterprises willing to deal with the French ones.
