The Russian diplomat admitted, however, that Moscow has not officially refused to pull out its troops. Churkin said the Russian Foreign Ministry has adopted a new tactical line, that of ignoring Baltic diplomats' critical statements. "At the recent sessions of the Council of Europe Security Council and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (Russian Foreign Minister Andrey) Kozyrev didn't say a word about his Baltic colleagues, although we don't see eye to eye with them on a number of issues, including observance of human rights," he said. Churkin assured that, as an official in charge of relations with the Baltic states at the Russian Foreign Ministry, he has "no evil intentions" with regard to those countries, and promised to do his best in seeking concrete solutions to the problems that have cropped up.
