He expressed regret over the statement and was not bullish about the development of current Sino-British relations. In an interview with this reporter, Ma Yuzhen made a thorough analysis of the development of Sino-British relations and the disputes caused by the Hong Kong issue in recent years. First, he refuted four points in the statement Patten made when he returned to Britain last week to attend a hearing of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee. 1. Patten accused China of just making a concession in the Hong Kong political structure talks over lowering the voting age. This was at variance with the facts. In fact, China made major concessions in two other matters: Agreeing to let district boards and the Urban Council practice the single seat, single vote system and agreeing to abolish the appointed seats in the Urban Council and district boards before 1997 so as to reach an agreement. "When he spoke at the hearing, Patten distorted China's position in the 17 rounds of talks and ignored the facts. It is unfair to try to overwhelm the other side by distorting its position and viewpoint. If even the most rudimentary rules of political negotiations are not followed, is there any credibility to speak of?" Patten Misleads Britain and the Hong Kong People 2. Patten stated on many occasions that he did not believe that China would dare overturn the three-tier council structure that he was pursuing just out of consideration of the pressure of world opinion. If he does think that, it means he is dreaming. Otherwise, fully aware that China will keep its promises, he still continues to pursue the three-violation uncooperative policy. This way of doing things is utterly irresponsible toward the Hong Kong people and Sino-British relations. In terms of political and legal principles, China can and must disband the three-tier councils in 1997. Patten's remark was designed to mislead Britain and the Hong Kong people. Ma Yuzhen also refuted Patten's analogy of installing panes of glass for the Hong Kong people. He said: "The Hong Kong people have lived in this house without any panes of glass for more than 100 years. Now, when the British authorities are about to leave, they say they will install panes of glass, and in so saying they do not consult the host and residents. This way of doing things is ridiculous. It is an expression of phony benevolence. " Regarding the pressure of world opinion which Patten stressed, analyzing it, Ambassador Ma Yuzhen said: Of the 180 or so countries in the world, most are China's friends and Third World countries. They have experienced suppression by the imperialists. Will they now sympathize with Britain on the Hong Kong issue? China is improving its relations with 20 or so developed countries one after another. Moreover, since they have their own agendas, they will not change their policies toward China in accordance with London's wishes. Patten Tries in Vain To Continue Colonialist Rule 3. Patten criticized China's attitude as being "unreasonable." Refuting the criticism, Ma Yuzhen said: "China's response to Patten is based on an analysis of past events concerning China and Britain in the last 100 years or so and thus is very reasonable. It is really unreasonable for the British side to try in vain to continue its colonialist rule as the 21st century approaches." 4. Patten interpreted the spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration as being "fair and trustworthy elections." Ma Yuzhen pointed out: This is a distortion of the spirit of the Joint Declaration. Deliberately misinterpreting and belittling a document of great historic significance as a document concerning elections in a narrow sense is an act far removed from the spirit of the Joint Declaration. "The spirit of the Joint Declaration lies in the Chinese resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997. Britain must return Hong Kong to China after 1997. This is a matter of sovereignty complete with administration. After the turnover of sovereignty, China will pursue the one-country, two-systems policy and conduct elections in accordance with the Basic Law. China does not oppose either elections or democracy. However, if this is interpreted as the spirit of the Joint Declaration, even though public opinion is misled, those who are familiar with the Hong Kong situation cannot be misled." When it came to the repeated British appeals for a resumption of talks, Ma Yuzhen stated: Let him who tied the bell on the tiger take it off. Unless the British side changes its uncooperative and antagonistic Hong Kong policy and withdraws the first-stage political structure draft which it has submitted to the Legislative Council, the Chinese side must otherwise accelerate its preparatory work, and, through the work of the Preliminary Work Committee [for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and the concerted efforts of the Hong Kong people, China will ensure the smooth transition of Hong Kong. Nevertheless, he stressed: The Preliminary Work Committee is a working organ. It is neither an organ of political power nor a shadow government. Hence, there is no question of replacing the Hong Kong Government. "In the situation in which the British side is not cooperative and there are just three and a half years left until 1997, the only way to guarantee a smooth transition is for the Hong Kong people and Preliminary Work Committee to intensify cooperation." Patten Plays the Same Old Trick Before Quitting the Colony Ma Yuzhen accused Britain of playing the popular-will card with a view to realizing the "three violations." This is a replay of the small trick played by Britain every time in the past when quitting its colonies. The Chinese Government attaches importance to the opinions of the Hong Kong people and this can be seen from the fact that four years and eight months were spent soliciting the opinions of the Hong Kong people regarding the Basic Law, but the British Government has never valued the popular will in its rule over Hong Kong in the last 100 years or so. Ma Yuzhen took over the job of ambassador to Britain in 1991 and has since then experienced the process of Sino-British relations turning from good to bad. He discussed his views. One was that China attached importance to developing relations with Britain and regarded Britain as an important country which carried considerable weight [you fen liang 2589 0433 6852] and maintenance of friendly relations with the latter as being conducive to world peace. "Although there are differences between China and Britain, they have common interests, such as a long-term interest in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The current situation of retrogression is something China does not want to see. China has never done anything harmful to its relations with Britain. The responsibility for this situation does not rest with the Chinese side." Britain Undermines Sino-British Relations The other view was that in approaching Sino-British relations, it was necessary to review past events from a historical point of view. "During the 200 years from the visit to China of a British envoy in 1847 to the coming to Hong Kong of Patten as governor, Sino-British relations have been full of twists and turns. Before the Opium War, it can be said that the two countries treated each other as equals. However, from 1840 to 1949, Britain invaded China using military force five times and China was thus in an unequal position of being invaded and bullied. "In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Britain recognized the state of Manchuria set up by Japan in northeast China and closed the Yunnan-Burma Railway when China was facing the most difficult times. It was after Japan attacked its colonies that Britain adopted a policy of opposing Japan. After 1949, Britain recognized China quite early on. It was not until 1972, when British Prime Minister Edward Heath adopted a farsighted China policy and normalized Sino-British relations, that the two countries began to exchange ambassadors. Relations between the two countries developed smoothly up to 1989, when, together with other Western countries, Britain imposed comprehensive sanctions against China because of the Beijing disturbance." Ma Yuzhen became ambassador to Britain in 1991, when China and Britain resumed contacts between high-level officials. His feelings about his work were that there were quite a few people of foresight in British political, industrial, and commercial circles, and they hoped to strengthen cooperation with China. He has all along worked happily. However, it was a pity that the formerly very good situation of cooperation between China and Britain was undermined by the change Britain made in its China policy in October 1992. An Impact on Cooperation in Other Fields of Endeavor Is Hard To Avoid As far as the current relations between China and Britain are concerned, Ma Yuzhen advised the British Government, which had landed itself in a hole, to stop digging the hole and undo what it had done so far by quoting the former Labor Party Minister Dennis Healey as saying: "When you land yourself in a hole, you must stop digging the hole." However, he added: The termination of Sino-British talks does not mean that the two countries do not have any normal diplomatic channels. The British side has violated the agreements on the issues of political structure and the new airport, adopted an uncooperative and antagonistic attitude, and undermined the cooperation between China and Britain step by step. Consequently, an impact on other aspects of Sino-British cooperation is hard to avoid. He anticipated that it would be hard for Sino-British relations to take a turn for the better in the short term. However, he was fully confident that Hong Kong had a bright future. In 1997 Hong Kong would be able to revert to China smoothly. After 1997, China also will be able to implement sovereignty, the Basic Law, and the one-country, two-systems concept to the letter. "Cast away illusions, have greater confidence, step up preparatory work, heighten vigilance, guard against sabotage, and rely on the motherland." These are words of advice Chinese Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen gave to the Hong Kong people.
