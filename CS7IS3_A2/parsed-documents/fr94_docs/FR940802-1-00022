FR940802-1-00022 FR940802-1-00009 48 CFR Parts 251 and 252 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Government Supply Sources AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Proposed rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense is proposing to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to clarify its policy concerning contractor payments for materials purchased from Government supply sources. DATES: Commments on the proposed rule should be submitted in writing at the address shown below on or before October 3, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comment to: Defense Acquistion Regulations Council, ATTN: Mr. Eric R. Mens, PDUSD (A&T) DP/DAR, IMD 3D139, 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. Telefax number (703) 604&hyph;5971. Please cite DFARS Case 94&hyph;D002 in all correspondence. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Eric R. Mens, (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The DoD Office of the Inspector General issued an audit report on June 3, 1994, (Report No. 94&hyph;119, Accounts Receivable for DoD Material) which addressed problems with contractors which were delinquent in making payments for materials purchased from the DoD supply system. The proposed rule, which is intended to address the problems identified in the Inspector General's report, revises the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) at 251.102(e) to require the contracting officer's authorization for the contractor to purchase from Government supply sources to specifically state the terms of the purchase; adds 251.105 and revises 252.251&hyph;7000(d)(4) to clarify that contractor payments for such purchases are due within 30 days of the Government's invoice; revises 252.251&hyph;7000(d)(4) to clarify that contractors must pay interest on late payments and that failure to pay may result in loss of the authorization to use Government supply sources; and adds 252.251&hyph;7000(f) to provide for identification of the contractor's billing and the Government's remittance address. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the proposed rule clarifies that the Government terms for contractor payments for purchases from Government supply sources is the same as the standard commercial terms of payment in ``net 30 days.'' The rule will only impact those small entities which fail to meet their payment obligations thereby incurring interest on the overdue amount, which also reflects acceptable commercial practice. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) does not apply because the proposed rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

The authority citation for 48 CFR Parts 251 and 252 continues to read as follows: Authority: 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR Chapter 1.
