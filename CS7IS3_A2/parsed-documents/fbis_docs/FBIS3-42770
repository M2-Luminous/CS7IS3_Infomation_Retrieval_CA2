I concluded my report in GAZETA DUKHOVNOY OPPOZITSII for 1-7 October with the words "We have placed our soldiers under the command of deputies of the Supreme Soviet. Be worthy of our soldiers." In the recent elections we nationalists were again forced to place our soldiers under alien commanders because our parties, organizations, and commanders were eliminated from the competition even before the elections--by the tanks of October. By the ban on the activity of our parties. By the Central Electoral Commission in November, with its magnifying glass checking the signatures of "our people" while their people were not checked. We were defeated again by the perfidy and treachery of our allies. And, of course, by our own disagreements. No unified Russian nationalist bloc was ever organized. Because of the absence of nationalists on the ballots, the winners were those who resemble them: the pink (essentially social-democratic) party of Zyuganov, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and Zhirinovskiy's "jurist" party. Again Russia has a parliament without a Russian national party. And no other party can raise the spirit of the Russian people, inspire them to enthusiasm so that the people will raise Russia out of the ruins. We cannot get by without a national revolution. Without a strong national Russian party (it will lead the national revolution-revival) the country will not rise up, and the Russian nation will not survive. In the next few months Russia can expect rounds of fruitless struggle between President Yeltsin and company, on the one hand, and "jurist" and company, on the other, supported by Zyuganov. I say "fruitless" because a victory for Yeltsin in this struggle would be a defeat for nationalist forces and a victory for Zhirinovskiy would also be a defeat for us. Yeltsin has proved himself. But Vladimir Volfovich is a populist, a clever manipulator, and he is just as close to the Russian people as the humorist Zvenetskiy, but he is just as removed from them as Borovoy. Zhirinovskiy on the political scene is a slap in the face of the Russian people and Russia. Is it really not degrading that a former activist of the Jewish movement (my article in NOVYY VZGLYAD, No. 117, and L. Aleynik's article in RUSSKOY MYSL for 15 January 1993) with a focus on Odessa informs us from the television screens of his plans to protect Russians? In essence Zhirinovskiy is a successful Borovoy and Borovoy is a failed Zhirinovskiy. A smart political operator, Zhirinovskiy is dangerous not only because of his alleged "fascism" but also because of the fact that it will take time for the country to figure out that he is another False Dmitriy. (It took me seven months after I first heard of him.) Zhirinovskiy is an enemy of Russian nationalism, he is merely using Russians and the Russian people for personal ends. Russian nationalists must get rid of their illusions today. We must understand that an alliance with anybody at all will be fatal to the nationalists. We have no allies. And we have never had any. It seemed to us that we had them. Zyuganov's pink communists cast us, their allies, aside as soon as they believed that they could function as an independent force. The first to be convinced of their treachery was Alksnis: Back before the elections to the Supreme Soviet of Russia the Communist Party of the Russian Federation promised him their support but they ran their candidate against him. Baburin has also experienced the love of these allies. And during the last elections I had occasion to feel in my bones how they really felt about me. And I was a true fellow traveler of the communists. Enough, gentlemen, from now on the national movement will act independently, and you have proved that you are not our friends. You are protecting your own interests. Thank God our paths will part here. The pink communists will go their way and we nationalists will go ours. It is a pity that this did not happen sooner. We have spent so much time trying to gain your favor and support instead of building our own powerful national party of Russians, of Russia! We walked side by side with you and we sang the same song. But during those black days it turned out that we were your brothers but you were not ours! Well, and so we part. We will no longer increase your ratings by exposing our boys to bullets. After all, who actually defended the Supreme Soviet and your freedom and ours along with it? Who, which organization left more bodies there, in the White House? Who went to storm Ostankino with their bare hands? Your people were not there, Messrs. Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov! The boys who were there were from the nationalist parties and groupings, the ones you shunned like relatives from the sticks and did not invite (or invited through clenched teeth) to your endless meetings. The nationalist youth defended the Supreme Soviet, Khasbulatov, and Rutskoy with their blood. The army did not come to their defense, the Ministry of Security did not come to their defense, but the nationalists, forgetting recent offenses (have Rutskoy and Khasbulatov been branded nationalist-"fascists" for long!), they came to their defense. But we will come no more. Figure it out for yourselves. We will function as an independent force. And against you, just as we are against Yeltsin. If your blood is destined to be shed, let it spill on the unshakeable eternal ideals of the Russian nation and the Russian state. I am confident that among the nationalists there are people who will want to draw lessons from the October tragedy and the tragedy of the elections (and this was a tragedy too) and they will insist on the previous alliances and the typical compromises. But there will not be many of those. The appearance of a powerful new nationalist movement is inevitable. Russia has no future without a national Russian party. Without such a party the False Dmitriys will replace one another, competing for power, and Russia will die. And it is dying.
