This was announced in Paris this morning by Richard Dequesne, a spokesman for the French Foreign Affairs Ministry. The French Government believes that the crisis has ended in Togo, and has decided to resume civil and military cooperation with our country. This cooperation had been suspended at the end of 1992. The French Government noted that, up to now, the long political crisis experienced in Togo did not permit them to engage in palliative measures to cushion the impact of the devaluation of the CFA franc, as was done for all other franc zone countries. These measures were essential to the country's economic and financial balance. The French Government also announced that, to show its solidarity with the Togolese people, it has decided to resume its cooperation, and called on its European Union partners to follow suit.
