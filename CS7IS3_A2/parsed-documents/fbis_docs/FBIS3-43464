At this moment the clashes are continuing in the vicinity of the university. Muriel Pomponne: [Pomponne] Yes, at the moment students and the police are facing one another outside the university. The riot police have just received the back-up of gendarmerie reinforcements in order to contain the demonstrators who have erected barricades with burning tires. The clashes began at about 1630 hours, when angry students burned two vehicles of the U.S. Embassy. The police went into action using tear gas grenades to disperse the demonstration, which was not authorized, and this is when the skirmishes began. Thus, at present they are restricted to the area of the university. During the afternoon the university's 4,000 or so students had attempted to reach the Ministry of Education to demand the payment of nine months' grant arrears. This morning school pupils had organized a sit-in outside the same ministry in support of the same demands. The authorities say that they are prepared to open negotiations and that they are ready to offer payment of six months' arrears during the next few days, in accordance with a calendar that is to be negotiated, but adding: we have a cash-flow problem with paying nine months' grant arrears immediately.
