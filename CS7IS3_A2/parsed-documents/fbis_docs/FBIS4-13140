Since the time this country chose a consistent and clear policy on dealing with events, campaigns and pressure have been directed against it with the aim of ending its sound views and judgment and of dragging it into positions and decisions that many parties have experienced and which would lead to further losses, complications, problems, and damages. Jordan was the first party to call for peace based on justice and comprehensiveness. At a time when Jordan was aware of the requirements of its role in the international community in terms of commitment to charters and resolutions, it maintained both its consistent pan-Arab position on the Palestine question and its demand that the Arab rights be regained as a mandatory condition for peace to be established and maintained. Jordan also believed in the importance of peoples' participation in decisionmaking and self-determination. Thus, Jordan proceeded with its blessed march toward democracy without hesitation and despite all circumstances. Moreover, a wider participation in decisionmaking is being garnered now, and all doors are being opened to a frank and responsible dialogue within the framework of the law. Jordan has thus presented the Arab model of an institutional state. Israel used to claim that it was the only such model, and that there was no regional democracy that recognizes the people's right to power sharing and free choice. When Rabin and Peres level accusations at Jordan and utter threats against it now, the matter becomes clear. This is because, at a time when we are facing both a siege that has been imposed on us since the Gulf war and Israel's intransigence in repressing our kinsfolk in the occupied territories, our verbal expressions can only demand justice and commitment to international legitimacy, and warn against the consequences of dealing with us and with other Arab peoples in a manner which exerts further pressure. The talk about peace and its importance for the region's future and welfare of its peoples has been ours. When we talked about peace in the past, we suffered much in terms of false accusations and slander campaigns. But as others' positions have circumvented justice as part of the desired peace, we can only remain faithful to our positions and principles regardless of campaigns and pressure. These positions and principles will not be sold out, nor will any Arab right in Jordan, Palestine, or elsewhere. This is because we do not accept sellouts in response to threats and pressure out of our regard for all religions, norms, and laws. Selling out will not establish a just peace that will last and be accepted by the people.
