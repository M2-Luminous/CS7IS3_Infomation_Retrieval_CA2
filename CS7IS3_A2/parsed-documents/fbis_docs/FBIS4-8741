The plane burst into flames and fell between Mt. Grebac and the village of Ilovaca, some 15 kilometres west of Gorazde. The pilot bailed out and fell at the Baba hill near Vitkovici on the left bank of the Drina River, in Moslem-held territory, the statement added. The Bosnian Serb command also denied reports that NATO planes on Saturday destroyed a Serb tank which had allegedly been shelling Gorazde. The same source said Bosnian Serb forces were not attacking the town and that Moslems in Gorazde were activating explosive devices to create the impression with the U.N. troops that the town was being shelled by the Serb artillery. The Bosnian Serb command said it had obtained information that Moslems in Gorazde were planning an operation which would cause massive civilian casualties, similar to the one carried out at a Sarajevo downtown market on February 5, and then blame it on the Serbs.
