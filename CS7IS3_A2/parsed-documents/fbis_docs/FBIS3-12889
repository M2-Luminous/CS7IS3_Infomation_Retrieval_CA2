According to these sources, the delegation gave King Husayn an official request for the king's mediation with Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. They asked him to help facilitate the resumption of the Kurdish-Iraqi dialogue on the self-rule negotiations that started in May 1991 with visits to Baghdad by Kurdish leaders Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani. The negotiations came to a halt in July 1992 when the Kurds joined the opposition delegations visiting Western capitals to ask for support to topple the regime in Iraq. The sources said that the Kurds' need to resume the dialogue with Baghdad appears urgent now with the lack of prospects for the Kurdish plan in northern Iraq. This is mainly due to Iranian and Turkish fears over their domestic situations and the possibilities for division and the redrawing of maps in the region, which has not seen stability for dozens of years. It is also due to indications that the international embargo imposed on Iraq could possibly end next June. The Jordanian sources say they do not expect King Husayn to respond quickly to the Kurdish desire out of fear of Arab reactions, especially since he is now in the process of normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Gulf states. He also fears a new failure in his mediations, especially since he has not yet recovered from the failure in his mediation between the parties to the Yemeni crisis.
