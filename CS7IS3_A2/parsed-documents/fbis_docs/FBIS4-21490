Growth might even be necessary to meet environmental challenges. It is not true that the slower the rate of economic growth or the lower the increase in consumer demand, the more productive the growth is. It is the kind of growth that is important, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland writes. In the last few years there has been a renewed debate on the relationship between the pattern of production and consumer demand, on the one hand, and the consideration of future generations, on the other, and on how we can achieve a fairer distribution between rich and poor countries. It is an important debate--and it has caught the attention of many. When working with the World Commission report, ``Our common future,'' this was an important question which has now become a focal point in the international debate following, among other things, the Rio conference. Growing production and demand is not in itself a measure of the increasing wealth of a society. Growth has been necessary to develop our welfare society, and growth is still necessary to meet new, important social challenges. Growth can even be necessary to meet environmental challenges. It is not true that the slower the rate of economic growth or the lower the increase in consumer demand, the more productive the growth is. It is the kind of growth that is important. Much of the economic growth during the last decades, as it is measured, is related to an increased percentage of people being employed, especially among women. An important precondition for this was the expansion of public services, not least in the areas of health, education and day care. In the government's long term plan the prognosis for the Norwegian economy for the next 40 years has been presented. The economic growth as outlined in this plan is much lower than what we have become used to during most of the time period since World War II. However, many people still think it is unreasonable that we want to increase our prosperity from the already high level of today. In this case it is important to realize that one-half to two-thirds of the estimated economic growth up through the year 2000 is caused by an increased level of knowledge and improved organization in production. With such a development, in which there is a considerable increase in the level of knowledge and in which we utilize the technological capability that is being developed both nationally and internationally, it will be increasingly possible to combine an increase in the creation of wealth with an improved environment. It has been estimated that many of the environmentally harmful emissions will decrease in the coming 40-year period, in spite of increased growth. Norwegian industrial concerns are now producing more than ever before, using less energy and raw materials per produced unit, and the production pattern has changed. In a market that just 20 to 30 years ago was dominated by industrial output like iron, metals, fertilizer, and cellulose that was not highly processed, we have today a broader and more modern industry that, among other things, is able to build and equip large and complicated oil installations in the Norwegian territorial section. Just before the war almost 65 percent of labor was spent on the production of goods and materials. Today almost 70 percent of employees work in the service industry. These changes involve a change also in the use of energy, in the use of natural resources, and in the stress caused by both production and demand on the environment. Growth of services means less stress on the environment than does growth in the demand of goods and materials. From 1980 to today private demand for services has grown by 40 percent, while demand for manufactured goods has increased by only 7 percent. This shows how the pattern of demand has changed. With the kind of policy we have prepared we will see a continued shift in consumer demand. There will be more growth in the service sector and less in the production of goods. Increasingly more people will work in the fields of health and welfare; in schools, education, and research; and in cultural areas. Even though we, compared to most countries, invest a considerable amount of resources in these areas, there is no doubt in my mind but that we should increase our efforts even more in coming years. Such a development will also be seen in the way we measure growth in our economy. Growth by itself is not a goal, but a means to meeting important and urgent challenges in the future. According to the estimate of the Long Term Plan both private and public demand will increase in coming years. Growth of private demand will be caused by more people being employed than today, by employees being more productive and by retirees having larger pensions. We might be able to increase the production of goods without a corresponding increase in the number of jobs or in the number of working hours. However, to improve the range of services offered and to meet the increased need in this area, we must plan on an increased need for more labor. An increasing number of people will be working in the field of health, with the elderly and in education. Some people are still maintaining that we should reduce the number of hours worked and lower the retirement age. Should we do this, it would result in lower economic growth and fewer of the problems we see ahead would be solved. It is very important that we engage in becoming involved in reducing the disparity between the economic and social development in our part of the world and the poverty and the need in developing countries. But--it is not the case that reduced growth in Norway simply will result in an increased capacity to alleviate need and poverty in developing countries. On the other hand, it is important that we can turn growth in an environmentally sound direction. Indeed, Norway does not have an especially high private demand compared to other industrialized countries, but we give the most aid per capita to developing countries. In dealing with the environment there are limits to how far each individual country can go alone without running the risk of jobs being eliminated or moved out of the country. Norway is a pioneering country when it comes to, among other things, using fees and taxes to steer production and demand in a productive direction. To make further progress it is first and foremost necessary to coordinate this effort with other countries. Making it increasingly costly for business to pollute will reduce the stress on the environment, while at the same time encourage developing better and more environmentally friendly work-sharing practices among countries and improve the pattern of production within each individual country. However, we must realize that the one-sided use of measures in Norway only will not have the desired effect, either in the effort to improve the environment or in the effort to even out the differences between rich and poor countries. Are we to succeed, we will need obligatory commitments to working together among the various countries.
