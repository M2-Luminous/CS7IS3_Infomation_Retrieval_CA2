The government ultimatum to the mediator has begun to bear fruit. Over the past few hours the government mediating team asked Alioune Blondin Beye to play his true role or else it would publicly expose a number of situations that it regards as incorrect and prejudicial to the negotiating process. The government ultimatum led Blondin Beye to redouble his contacts with National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] men with a view to convincing them to return to the negotiating table at once. The dosage administered by the government representatives worked like a wonder drug. Accordingly, this morning the mediator received in his room the government and UNITA chief negotiators. It is believed that issues relating to the adoption of a working agenda were discussed during the meeting. It is already known that the government is staying put, in that it will only discuss other points of the agenda once the issue under discussion -- the future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel -- has been settled. The UNITA negotiating team appears to be calmer because it already knows what government posts will be assigned to that organization. Yesterday, the UNITA delegation received the government document on this issue. Since silence is golden, the contents of the government document are not known, except that a number of ministerial portfolios have been given to UNITA. The government and UNITA chief negotiators are scheduled to meet the mediator as of 1530 today.
