FR940930-0-00162 FR940930-0-00028 The definition of the ``person who converts'' for the purposes of section 247(c) that will be promulgated by today's rule is as follows. Any entity (kit manufacturer, installer, or other) may apply for a certification for a conversion configuration and receive a federal certificate of conformity. This certifier will be considered the ``person who converts'' under section 247(c) and will assume all responsibility as the manufacturer under sections 206 and 207. If the conversion is performed by an entity other than the certifier, the certifier must provide the installer with instructions for proper installation, and the installer must follow these instructions. While the certifier is responsible as the manufacturer, if the installer installs improper equipment or performs a faulty installation, EPA may hold the installer responsible as well under the tampering provisions of the Act. Under this approach a single party, the certifier, will be responsible for warranting the vehicle's emissions performance, and liability can easily be assigned for enforcement and warranty purposes as under the first option considered in the NPRM. In addition, this approach avoids the disadvantages inherent in the first option by providing industry with the flexibility to determine which business entity is in the best position to provide EPA with the data necessary for certification and to assume responsibilities as the manufacturer. Based on public comment EPA anticipates that in most cases the kit manufacturer will be the certifying party. Since the certifier will assume liability for in-use vehicle performance failures that result from faulty installations, EPA expects that the certifier will develop oversight programs to insure that installations are performed properly and will enter into indemnification agreements with installers. Kit manufacturers would be wholly within their rights to require such indemnification agreements before allowing installers to install their kit. Thus, the result of holding the certifier solely responsible is consistent with the intent of the second option and with public comment in that it provides that the responsibility for certification, and warranty and recall will be distributed equitably among all those responsible for the completion of the final vehicle. Given that under the second option, kit manufacturers would have been liable for any violation (although EPA would have attempted to enforce against the party it believed was responsible), this approach does not substantially increase manufacturers' liability. In addition, enforcement actions by EPA will be simplified and the resolution of warranty claims by vehicle owners will be expedited. EPA believes that this approach best satisfies the need expressed in public comment to provide strict standards of liability in order to instill consumer confidence in the emissions performance of converted vehicles. The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition and the American Gas Association encouraged EPA to establish CFV conversion requirements that are consistent with requirements for all other conversions. Holding the converter solely responsible is also consistent with the approach taken in the Gaseous Fuels Final Rule. As proposed, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) will remain responsible for the equipment that was on the vehicle before it was converted unless the conversion caused the failure of the OEM equipment to function in its role in meeting emission standards. EPA believes that this is necessary because the proper performance of the conversion configuration relies on the OEM's underlying emissions control systems. Also, EPA interprets section 247(c) of the CAA to direct that the certifier of a CFV conversion will not be required to warrant any vehicle for parts or operation existing in the vehicle prior to conversion and not affected by the conversion. Public comment was mixed on the issue of OEM liability, with some commenters agreeing with EPA's proposed approach and others stating that the OEM should not be held responsible for post-conversion failures of OEM equipment due to concerns over the potential impact that converted parts may have on the performance or durability of the original parts. EPA recognizes this concern, and will evaluate in-use enforcement actions that involve an OEM versus converter liability decision on a case by case basis. One indicator that might be used by EPA to determine that the OEM was liable for an emission failure of a converted vehicle will be an emission-related recall action against unconverted OEM vehicles of the same model. The CAA does not specify how the useful life period of converted vehicles should be measured for the purposes of in-use liability. EPA requested comment on this issue, and all of the public comment received suggested that the liability of the converter should not extend beyond the original useful life of the vehicle. Given that the emissions performance of the conversion configuration depends on the underlying emissions control systems of the OEM, EPA agrees with this approach. Thus, the regulations promulgated by today's rule provide that the liability of both the OEM and converter for in-use emission performance will extend to the end of the original vehicle/engine's useful life. This definition of useful life creates the potential concern that fleet operations will satisfy Clean Fuel Fleet Program (CFFP) purchase requirements through the conversion of vehicles that have little mileage remaining in their useful life. If this occurs to a significant degree, CFFP purchase requirements could be met without achieving the emissions reductions anticipated from the CFFP. However, EPA does not expect fleet operators to satisfy their CFFP purchase requirements in this way because of the financial disincentives involved with converting such high mileage vehicles and maintaining them beyond their useful life solely for the purpose of meeting CFFP purchase requirements.
