The protocol supplements a Hungaro-Soviet agreement signed in 1966. The protocol contradicts Russia's ``law on environmental protection,'' a relevant presidential decree and the ensuing order of receiving radioactive waste'' passed by the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry. The Ministry of Environmental Protection has expressed bewilderment in respect of a governmental instruction, which mentioned that it had supported the protocol. According to the Russian legislation, the reprocessed waste products should be returned to the exporting country, the ecologists had warned. But their opinion was not taken into account by the authors of the protocol. The planned burial of 66 tonnes of radioactive waste products from the ``Paksh'' Hungarian nuclear power plant will aggravate the hard situation in such burial places in Russia. The move infringes upon Article 50 of the ``Law on Environmental Protection," which prohibits ``imports of radioactive waste products or materials from abroad with a view to storing or burying.''
