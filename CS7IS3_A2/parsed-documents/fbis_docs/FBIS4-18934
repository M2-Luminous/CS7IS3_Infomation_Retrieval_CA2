The return of the Rally for the Republic [RPR] deputy for the Correze region to the Defense Committee -- which is chaired by Jacques Boyon (RPR, Ain) -- comes at a time when Parliament is getting ready to examine the draft military planning law for 1995-2000. After being submitted to the president of the Republic at the last meeting of the Defense Council on Wednesday 6 April, the document is currently at the State Council stage. It will then be presented to cabinet on 20 April before being publicly debated in the National Assembly in mid-May. Mr. Chirac is to be the RPR spokesman in this debate in which the opinion of the majority may be split along several different lines. Another notable change was the April 2 departure of Pierre Lellouche (RPR, Val de l'Oise) for the Judiciary Committee, after having bid in vain for chairmanship of the Defense Committee.
