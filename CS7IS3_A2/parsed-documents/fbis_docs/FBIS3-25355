The main sticking points are disarmament of the various armed groups and the setting up of transitional institutions ahead of elections supposed to be staged this month. U.N. special envoy Trevor Gordon Somers is chairing the latest closed-doors parley. A marathon six-week session which opened in December made no progress. Delegates said they regarded the new discussions as a "last chance" to sort out their differences. The interim government is at loggerheads with the main rebel movement the Patriotic Front and its rival United Liberation Movement, which are both insisting on getting the key ministries of foreign affairs, defence, justice and finance. The new round of talks is being attended by General John Inienger, commander of the military monitoring force of some l9,000 troops stationed in Liberia by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States since August 1990.
