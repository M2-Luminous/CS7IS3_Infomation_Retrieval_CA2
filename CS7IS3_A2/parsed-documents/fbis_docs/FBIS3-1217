This is the word from Defense Minister Kobie Coetsee. However, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman, these troops will not be deployed inside the homeland. This move follows requests from former Ciskei military leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo that the South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] take over administration of the territory. Ciskei's chief representative at the TEC, Mr. Mickey Webb, made the announcement of Brig. Gqozo's voluntary release of the reins of power to that body last night. Matters came to a head in the Ciskei yesterday when striking policemen took officers hostage in the capital, Bisho. The strikers demanded that Brig. Gqozo address them. However, the former leader said he saw little point in speaking to the men after his resignation. Last night South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei, Mr. Piet Goosen, spoke to the strikers. The border chairman of the ANC [African National Congress], Mr. Smuts Ngonyama, also spoke to the policemen in the early hours of this morning. For the latest in the eastern Cape, it's over to James Barkhuizen.... But I believe we don't have that link at the moment. James has confirmed this morning that Brig. Gqozo was under house arrest. [passage omitted] Well, we have that link now with James Barkhuizen in Ciskei, who is in Ciskei at the moment, and apparently in Brig. Oupa Gqozo's house. Good morning, James. What can you tell us? [Barkhuizen] Good morning. I'm in the brigadier's house, Brig. Oupa Gqozo's house. Brig. Gqozo didn't speak to me up until now, but people working for Brig. Gqozo -- I can't confirm whether they are bodyguards or defense force members; they wouldn't say, but they are at the house -- they say that we must correct the earlier report on the news. The brigadier is allowed to go anywhere. He is not, I repeat, he is not -- according to these people -- he's not under house arrest. The brigadier himself is next to me now. I wonder, Brigadier, would you please speak? It's live on air. Brigadier, can you please explain the situation? [Gqozo] Yes. Hello. [Pockock] Good morning, Brigadier. What can you tell us? [Gqozo] Suzette, I'm definitely not under house arrest as it was reported in the news earlier. [Pockock] What is the position? [Gqozo] The position is that since I have announced yesterday that I'm retiring, I think that has caused a little bit of confusion, and the soldiers received it with mixed feelings. They are definitely outraged that I could just resign like that, when they thought there was nothing really worth the effort. They didn't want me to resign, but I've told them that it is just a matter of resigning 2 weeks earlier. I would have had to resign, anyway, after 27 April. [Pockock] Now what is the position of the strikers at the moment? [Gqozo] The strikers are still holding those people hostage, but I promised them yesterday that I would talk to them at 7.30 today. [Pockock] And what will you be saying to them? [Gqozo] Well, basically I'd like them to release the officers, to go back to work, and let us wait for the TEC people and some officials from foreign affairs to come and discuss the future of this territory. [Pockock] Now we beleive that a woman and a child are being held hostage. Is that correct? [Gqozo] I'm not yet sure where the woman and the child have been taken to, but I was told yesterday night that the acting commissioner of police's wife and child have been abducted from the house, although no one was certain where exactly they were taken to. [Pockock] Now what exactly do the strikers want? What are their demands? [Gqozo] This is what is making me totally frustrated, Suzette. They say they want their pensions paid out now, and you know, it's very impossible. So such impossible demands led me to believe that this was just an excuse to try and do another Bop [Bophuthatswana] on Ciskei, and I thought that the best way to avoid it and to avoid that any losses of life and any destruction of property would be for me to step down before something happened that has happened in Bophuthatswana. I don't think it's worth it. If people would like to have a change of government or a change of scene, I think it's better that we act and preempt that by acting wisely. In this case, I thought that retiring from office and getting the South African Government and the TEC to already put an administration which would ensure that all these grievances are answered, would be the best. I don't think at this moment I've got any power to grant leave gratuities, I've got no power to grant the people all the assurances that they want about their future in a future government. [Pockock] Now, Brigadier, one last question. What is the mood of the people in Bisho this morning? [Gqozo] Very cool. I think the whole night was very quiet and very cool. There is absolutely nothing that shows any excitement or extraordinary activities. Everybody is happy and everybody is waiting to hear what will unfold today. [Pockock] Brig Gqozo, thanks very much for speaking to us this morning.
