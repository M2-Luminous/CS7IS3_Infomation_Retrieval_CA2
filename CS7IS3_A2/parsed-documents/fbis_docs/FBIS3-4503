During the discussion, he pointed out: The PLA should set an example and spur on the masses in building spiritual civilization and thus make due contributions to social stability and promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization. When a deputy from the Guangzhou Military Region, which is situated in the forward place of reform and opening up, and a deputy from the army unit served by Xu Honggang, a heroic fighter ready to take up the cudgels for a just cause, talked about how the troops should do something in building spiritual civilization, Liu Huaqing said: General Secretary Jiang Zemin called on the PLA to set a good example in building socialist spiritual civilization. What should they do to set a good example? In my view, it is first necessary to understand this is an important responsibility entrusted to the people's army by the party and the people in the new historical period and is the great expectations of the masses of the people. All officers and men in our Army should understand the importance of taking the lead in doing a good job of building spiritual civilization and consciously cultivate this habit, starting bit by bit from ourselves. If the Army does a good job in building spiritual civilization, a soldier will become a propagandist or an model who can play an active, promoting role in building spiritual civilization. Xu Honggang is just such a model. Speaking on the need for the troops to set a good example in developing good social conduct, Liu pointed out: Unhealthy practices and evil phenomena should be resisted and held in check. We should be concerned about the weal and woe of the masses, do more good work for them, help them solve difficulties, and help the masses in garrison areas get rid of poverty and become rich. When the interests, life, and property of the masses are harmed, servicemen should step forward bravely and take up the cudgels so that the people can see hope from the fine image of the troops and heighten their confidence.
