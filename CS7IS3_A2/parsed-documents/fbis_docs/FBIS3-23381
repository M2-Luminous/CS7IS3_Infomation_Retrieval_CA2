The Higher Military Court had unanimously sentenced them, together with a third fugitive defendant named Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi, to death in case no. 94/2 of the Military Prosecution Office. The source said that the military prosecution accused the two civilians, who belonged to the al-Jihad Organization, of seizing the opportunity to recruit the conscript in the Armed Forces and agreed to provide him with some explosives to use for sabotaging one of the military installations in his unit. The source added that the two civilians did in fact bring the explosives to the conscript but the latter was arrested and the explosives seized before the operation was carried out. One of his partners was also arrested while the third remains a fugitive. The source noted that the court sentenced the three to death after being defended by four lawyers. He said that the sentences were ratified and then the defendants appealed the sentences. The appeals were turned down and legally rejected and, therefore, the sentences became final and due for implementation. It is recalled that some foreign radios and news agencies had given an inaccurate report on this issue.
