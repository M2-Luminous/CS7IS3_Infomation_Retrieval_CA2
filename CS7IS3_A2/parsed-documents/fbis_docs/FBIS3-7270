FBIS3-7270 "dreas059_h_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 26 Mar 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Singapore Challenges MAS Testimony BK2703122294 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES in English 26 Mar 94 p 27 BK2703122294 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [By Warren Fernandez and Brendan Pereira] [Text] The Attorney-General [A-G] yesterday challenged Tharman Shanmugaratnam's account of a meeting with private sector analysts, saying he could not remember the details when questioned by Internal Security Department (ISD) officers two years ago. As such, his recollection in court of the events of June 19, 1992 was based on a hypothetical situation, said Mr Chan Sek Keong. He said that Shanmugaratnam's testimony on how he acted or handled official documents during the meeting was "given mostly in terms of what he would have done instead of what he had already done." The A-G made these points while continuing his submissions against the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) director of the economics department. The accused's statements to the ISD showed that he could not remember whether he had taken a draft report containing the flash estimate into the meeting with Crosby Securities economists Manu Bhaskaran and Raymond Foo. He also could not recall if the document was covered during the meeting at the MAS building. The A-G said that much of Shanmugaratnam's memory of that meeting was recalled for him by his MAS colleague Chan Chia Lin, a prosecution witness. He said that when the incident arose, Shanmugaratnam had no clear idea of what happened. Two years later, he came to court and gave his version of what he said he recalled. This testimony, said the A-G, was based on a "would have been" situation. He read out a few excerpts of the accused's testimony in court yesterday to illustrate his point. For example, when saying how he handled the draft report during the meeting, Shanmugaratnam said. "From the moment I placed the report down, it would have been covered. I would only have to remove the paper after I lifted it from the table to refer to it." The A-G said that except for one answer, all the others were on the basis of what "he would have done." "The accounts are expressed in terms of a customary or usual behaviour" and cannot refute Shanmugaratnam's admission in a statement that Bhaskaran could have seen the figure of 4.6 per cent from the draft report.
