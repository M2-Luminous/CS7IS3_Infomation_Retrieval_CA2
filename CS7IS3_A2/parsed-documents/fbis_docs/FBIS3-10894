The OECD groups the developed nations. Argentina's entry was formalized after the signing of notes at the OECD headquarters in Paris by OECD Secretary Jean Claude Paye and Argentine Ambassador to France Juan Archibaldo Lanus, thus completing the Foreign Ministry's initial negotiations. Therefore, Argentina has become the first Latin American country to be invited to actively participate in the OECD Development Center, established in 1962 with the goal of favoring an exchange of know-how among nations in order to devise general economic policies. The Development Center groups the democratic countries that have more developed economies; the entry requirements include, among others, the existence of a stable democratic system, respect for human rights, and solid economic stability. The Argentine ambassador to France said: "Argentina's entry into the OECD Development Center is the result of Argentina's change and transformation." The OECD, described as the "Club of the Powerful," was the successor to an organization established to administer the Marshall Plan funds for the reconstruction of countries like Germany and West Europe after World War II. In a communique, the Foreign Ministry emphasized that the document's signing "agrees with the policy implemented by the Foreign Ministry and the government in its foreign relations, involving Argentine withdrawal from the list of nonaligned countries first and now entry into the OECD." The groups Argentina was invited to join are involved in reviewing privatizations, tax policy, and trade relations, among other issues.
