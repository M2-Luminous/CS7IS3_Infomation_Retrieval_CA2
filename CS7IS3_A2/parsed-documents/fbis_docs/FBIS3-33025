Four persons had to be hospitalized. The incident occurred when PRI supporters tried to dislodge PAN members who had seized the municipal palace to demand the removal of Mayor Maurilo Cortazar Aguilar from the municipal presidency. The PRI members organized a march through several streets of Copainala to express their support for Cortazar. Once they reached the municipal building, they tried to dislodge the PAN members. The PAN members repelled the aggression and left the building following the squabble. The state government has appointed deputy commissions to conduct audits in municipalities such as Tuzantan, Huehuetan, and Teopisca, where conflicts exist and where municipal palaces have already been vacated. The Chanal municipal palace was seized by people demanding the mayor's removal. In Cacahoatan, there was a sit-down strike in front of the municipal palace today. In addition, peasant organizations have taken over at least 100 farms in several municipalities.
