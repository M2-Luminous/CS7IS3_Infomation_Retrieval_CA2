Guided by the state development strategy for northwest China, large numbers of scientists and technicians have given up their better working and living environments in coastal areas to work in this remote province. Thanks to their hard work over the past dozens of years, Gansu has laid a solid foundation for the application of science and technology. The province now boosts China's first nuclear reactor, the first satellite launching pad, the only state laboratory housing a heavy- ion accelerator, as well as a number of state key laboratories specializing in research into geochemistry and tundra. In addition, it now has a total of 768 scientific institutions with over 330,000 scientists and technicians. Sine 1987 the province has registered over 4,400 major scientific achievements. Over 260 of these have won state awards and nearly 700 projects have won province-level awards. The scientific achievements have helped the province make an additional 400 million yuan (50 million U.S. dollars) in production value. According to a special survey conducted by the State Science and Technology Commission, the comprehensive scientific and technological capacity of Gansu now ranks ninth in China. Meanwhile, the province has given priority to applying scientific achievements to farm production to upgrade agricultural productivity.
