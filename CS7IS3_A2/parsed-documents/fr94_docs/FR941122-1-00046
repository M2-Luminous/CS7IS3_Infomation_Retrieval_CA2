FR941122-1-00046 FR941122-1-00011 State agencies responsible for the administration of the AFDC and Medicaid programs have already been advised of the availability of Federal financial participation (FFP) necessary to conduct voter registration assistance in public assistance offices in accordance with Section 7 of the NVRA. The Administration for Children and Families and the Health Care Financing Administration will issue further guidance in program instructions as needed to AFDC and Medicaid agencies regarding the implementation of these provisions. All relevant Federal agencies will continue to work closely with each other and with State public assistance agencies toward the successful implementation of this Act. Under Section 9 of the NVRA the Federal Election Commission (FEC) is required to develop a national mail voter registration form for elections to Federal office and to submit reports to Congress to assess the impacts of the legislation each odd-numbered year beginning June 30, 1995. The FEC published an NPRM related to these provisions in the Federal Register on March 10, 1994, 59 FR 11211. The comment period closed on April 11, 1994. Executive Order 12866 Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. Paperwork Reduction Act These proposed regulations do not require any information collection activities and therefore no approval is necessary under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce the impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of these proposed rules is on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect benefits to individuals and payments to States. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.
