The S-42Oi robots have new controls integrated into the robot arm. The company claims this will save production space, which is needed for the usual control box, and will reduce wiring costs. The new robots are said to have better acceleration values and can reduce the cycle time by 20 percent. Moreover, further increase in availability is also achieved by reducing the number of parts, the company reports.
