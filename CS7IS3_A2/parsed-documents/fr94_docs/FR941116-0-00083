ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined that USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval destroyer. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Commander K. P. McMahon, JAGC, U.S. Navy Admiralty Counsel, Office of the Judge Advocate General Navy Department, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400, telephone number: (703) 325&hyph;9744. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 706. This amendment provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy, has certified that USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG 53) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS: Annex I, section 3(a) pertaining to the location of the forward masthead light in the forward quarter of the vessel, and the horizontal distance between the forward and after masthead lights; and Annex I, section 2(f)(i) pertaining to placement of the masthead light or lights above and clear of all other lights and obstructions; without interfering with its special function as a Navy ship. The Judge Advocate General has also certified that the lights involved are located in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based on technical findings that the placement of lights on this vessel in a manner differently from that prescribed herein will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.
