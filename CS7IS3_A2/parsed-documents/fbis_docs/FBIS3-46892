"Exchange rates are a reflection of economic fundamentals, and therefore their stable movements are desirable," the top government spokesman said at a news conference. But he declined further comment, saying the matter should be up to the currency market. Citing the German mark's weakness vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, Takemura said the yen is not necessarily easing but the American currency is firming. Since the turn of the year, the dollar has been trading above 113 yen in world currency markets. It opened Tokyo dealings on Thursday at 113.33 yen, up 0.21 yen from Wednesday's close.
