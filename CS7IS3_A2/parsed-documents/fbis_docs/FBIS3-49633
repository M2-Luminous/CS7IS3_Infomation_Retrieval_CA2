Slovak President Michal Kovac commented on such statements as follows: [Begin Kovac recording] We have noted that representatives of some NATO countries failed to mention the Slovak Republic. Differences in the economic standards of individual countries should not determine whether or not they join Partnership for Peace. We discussed this issue with President Clinton, urging him to exert an influence on his partners in NATO member states so that they stop leaving Slovakia out of this group, either intentionally or unintentionally. President Clinton said that America will not do this, now or in the future, and that he will speak to other representatives along these lines. I think, however, that the whole issue will be resolved simply because Slovakia -- just like the three other [Visegrad] states -- has clearly stated that it is joining Partnership for Peace and is ready to sign the relevant treaties and documents, and to observe them. I think that once this has taken place the issue of omitting Slovakia and so on will have become quite pointless. [end recording]
