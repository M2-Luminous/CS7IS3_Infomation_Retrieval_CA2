ACTION: Recision of closures SUMMARY: NMFS is rescinding the closures to directed fishing for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to fully utilize the allowances of the total allowable catch (TAC) of pollock for the inshore and offshore components in the AI. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), August 25, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907-586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The directed fishery for pollock in the AI by vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component closed on March 18, 1994 (59 FR 13662, March 23, 1994). The directed fishery for pollock in the AI by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component closed on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 10082, March 3, 1994). The Regional Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the allowances of the TAC of pollock allocated to the inshore and offshore components in the AI have not been reached. Therefore, NMFS is rescinding those closures and is reopening directed fishing for pollock in the AI by vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component or the offshore component effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., August 25, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
