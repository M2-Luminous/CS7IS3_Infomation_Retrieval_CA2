In Hebron, a protest rally was staged against the curfew on the town and the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Although there were some clashes in the morning, later in the day the Israeli security forces refrained from intervening. A 28-year-old blind Palestinian from Gaza has died in hospital from wounds after being shot, reportedly in error, by the Border Police. The man, Ahmad Ali, who came from the al-Shaja'iyah neighborhood, apparently got caught up in an exchange of fire when gunmen attacked the Border Police.
