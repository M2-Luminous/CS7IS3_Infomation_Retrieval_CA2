I am analyzing yesterday's round -- 12 deputies were elected from 16 constituencies. It is preliminary information that has to be checked [pauses]... Thus, we already have 90 deputies. Today, over 350 will be elected. [passage indistinct] However, it seems to me that the new Supreme Council will face a need [pauses]... a need to determine its attitude toward the elections on 26 June [presidential elections]. The problem is not in holding or not holding the elections -- I have never [words indistinct]. We have agreed to it, and adopted laws that the elections must be held. However, in my opinion, the main point is to elect an authoritative and strong power built on a distinct legal basis. This is the main point. [pauses] In order to explain this thesis, I will use one example regarding the presidency. Having finally adopted a law on local authorities, the [Supreme Council] session -- we will say it openly -- restored a Soviet form of state management. We do not need to discuss now whether this is good or bad. This is not essential. [The session] has restored it -- it is a real fact. Further, [the session] has ruined -- if the elections are to be held under this law without any adopted amendments -- the executive presidential power. Thus, at a local level, executive presidential power already does not exist. If we are to elect a president with the powers that he has today as head of state and executive power, we will institute at the beginning -- on the election level -- contradictions and a conflicting situation. The president is being elected as head of executive power, but there are no structures for executive power. Therefore, it is not incidental that after the president had been elected, the issue of the creation of presidential structures at local levels emerged. The Soviet form of power was built distinctly -- lower-ranking bodies of power were subordinated to higher-ranking ones without any restrictions; moreover, there was also the Communist Party which, like a pivot, determined the entire structure of subordination. Where the Soviet form of distinct subordination did not exist, there was a distinct party subordination. That is to say, it was a thought-over structure [words indistinct] Now, this is ruined. If so, a question emerges: Why elect a president as head of executive power if he already has no structures -- to make him head of the Cabinet of Ministers? But the Cabinet of Ministers is to be headed by the prime minister, is it not? [unidentified voice answers -- Undoubtedly] Undoubtedly. Thus, the Supreme Council has to determine which president must be elected. It is indispensable. Without this, it will be an unnecessary waste of money and [pauses] effort, which will not be followed by real consequences. If the president is only the head of state, with limited powers, because the Soviet form of power has already been created [pauses]... In the Soviet form of power, presidential executive [power] does not exist, and cannot exist. It follows from polls [as heard] whether we have to elect a president in nationwide elections. Why does it follow? But has he been elected in nationwide elections? It was for the purpose of confirming a strong executive power. By now, you see, we do not have [this power] anymore. One more question. Let us take the same law. You will see that it provides [pauses]... These are representative bodies of power. However, they are delegated with state authority -- at the local level, I mean. Rayons, cities, and oblasts are delegated with state authority. What authority and how much -- there is nothing about this issue. It has been written that this will be determined by a separate law. Then, such a question emerges: What percent [of the powers] will be delegated -- 20 percent, or 30 percent? What percent will be left to the government? If 70 percent of the state powers are delegated, the government will be left with 30 percent. A question emerges: What kind of government must be created -- with 40 ministries, or with 15? What powers will the government have if the current structure is unnecessary due to the delegation of state powers to rayons, oblasts, and cities? I do not say that this is bad. Perhaps, it is good. However, the Supreme Council must adopt a law on the delegation of powers to the local authorities. It is written there that they will be delegated by a separate law, but there is no such law. However, the law on local self-government is in force. In accordance with this law, lower-ranking bodies of power do not subordinate to higher-ranking ones. Again, from the first days, there is no legal and political clarity on how these bodies will work. The last thing. I have even read it in a paper, or have seen it on television that the law provides that the head of the executive power may be dismissed by the Cabinet of Ministers. There is no such provision there. This was in the draft. Someone has read the draft. It is written there that if the head [of the executive power] infringes, he may be dismissed from the post in accordance with the law. Again, there is no law on it. This way, it is necessary for the new Supreme Council to adopt, if we do not want to be laughed at, I want to say it quite openly [pauses]... I do not address it to someone personally, this is a state building. Having resolved at the Supreme Council to build a state according to Soviet [word indistinct] This is the right of the Supreme Council. However, one need all institutes [pauses]... all issues must be determined in accordance with this structure, with regard both to the president and to the Cabinet of Ministers, as well as to the powers delegated to these bodies of power. If the Supreme Council convenes in late April or in early May -- it is a realistic term -- and if all these laws are adopted, then the Supreme Council will be able to determine whether one needs to lose trillions for nationwide presidential elections, or whether the president will be only a representative figure, and there is no need for nationwide presidential elections. That is why those who today are considering running for the presidency have to ponder what presidents they will be if the laws are not adopted. With regard to my person, to my position, I do not want -- excuse my words -- to discuss this issue until these laws are adopted.
