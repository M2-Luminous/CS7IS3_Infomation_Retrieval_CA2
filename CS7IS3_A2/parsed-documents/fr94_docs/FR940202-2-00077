FR940202-2-00077 FR940202-2-00056 Given the severity of this major disaster, as the Executive Director of the PBGC, I have decided to provide relief from certain PBGC deadlines and penalties. For purposes of premium penalties, section 4071 penalties, and standard termination deadlines, this notice is applicable with respect to plans whose administrators' or sponsors' principal place of business, or for which the office of a service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining information necessary to meet the applicable deadlines, is located in a designated disaster area. For purposes of filing requests for reconsideration or appeals, this notice is applicable to any aggrieved person who is residing in, or whose principal place of business is within, a designated disaster area, or with respect to whom the office of the service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to file the request for reconsideration or appeal is within such an area. Premiums The PBGC will waive the late payment penalty charge with respect to any premium payment required to be made on or after January 15, 1994, and before March 15, 1994, if the payment is made by March 15, 1994. The PBGC is not permitted by law to waive late payment interest charges. (ERISA section 4007(b); 29 CFR 2610.7 and 2610.8(b)(3).) Section 4071 Penalties The PBGC will not assess a section 4071 penalty for a failure to file any of the following notices that were, or will be, required to be filed with the PBGC on or after January 15, 1994, and before March 15, 1994, if the notice is filed by March 15, 1994: Standard termination post-distribution certification (PBGC Form 501; ERISA section 4041(b)(3)(B); 29 CFR 2617.28(h) (57 FR 59206, 59233&hyph;34, December 14, 1992); (2) Notice of termination for multiemployer plans (ERISA section 4041A; 29 CFR 2673.2); (3) Notice of plan amendments increasing benefits by more than $10 million (ERISA section 307(e)); and (4) Reportable event notice, except for reportable events related to bankruptcy or insolvency (or similar proceeding or settlement), liquidation or dissolution, and transactions involving a change in contributing sponsor or controlled group (ERISA section 4043; 29 CFR 2615.21, 2615.22, and 2615.23). The PBGC will not assess a section 4071 penalty for a failure to provide certain supporting information and documentation when any of the following notices is timely filed: (1) Notice of failure to make required contributions totaling more than $1 million (including interest) (PBGC Form 200; ERISA section 302(f)(4); 29 CFR 2615.30), and (2) Notice of a reportable event related to bankruptcy or insolvency (or similar proceeding or settlement), liquidation or dissolution, or a transaction involving a change in contributing sponsor or controlled group. For a notice of failure to make required contributions, the timely filed notice must include at least items 1 through 7 and items 11 and 12 of Form 200; the responses to items 8 through 10, with the certifications in items 11 and 12, may be filed late. For a reportable event notice, the timely filed notice must include at least the information specified in 29 CFR 2615.3(b) (1) through (5); the information that may be filed late is that specified in 29 CFR 2615.3(b) (6) through (9) and 2615.3(c) (5) and (6), as applicable. This relief applies to notices that were, or will be, required to be filed with the PBGC on or after January 15, 1994, and before March 15, 1994, provided that all supporting information and documentation are filed by March 15, 1994. Standard Termination Notice and Distribution of Assets With respect to a standard termination for which the standard termination notice is required to be filed, or the distribution of plan assets is required to be completed, on or after January 15, 1994, the PBGC is extending to March 15, 1994, the time within which the standard termination notice must be filed (and, thus, the time within which notices of plan benefits must be provided) and the time within which the distribution of plan assets must be completed. In addition, as noted above, the PBGC is providing relief from penalties for late filing of the post-distribution certification. (On August 24, 1993, the PBGC published an interim rule amending 29 CFR 2617.3, 2617.25, and 2617.28 to provide for extensions of time under the circumstances addressed in this notice (58 FR 44738; as corrected, 58 FR 48600, September 17, 1993).) Requests for Reconsideration or Appeals For persons who are aggrieved by certain agency determinations and for whom a request for reconsideration or an appeal is required to be filed on or after January 15, 1994, and before March 15, 1994, the PBGC will extend the time for filing to March 15, 1994. (On August 24, 1993, the PBGC published an interim rule amending 29 CFR 2606.4, 2606.33, and 2606.53 to provide for extensions of time under the circumstances addressed in this notice (58 FR 44738; as corrected, 58 FR 48600, September 17, 1993).)
