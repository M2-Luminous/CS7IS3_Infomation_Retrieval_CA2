Mrs Alva said this while informing the House during Question Hour that the Election Commission had moved the Supreme Court, seeking a ruling on its authority to take disciplinary action against the officials. (UNI adds from Pune: The Chief Election Commissioner, Mr T.N. Seshan, today warned that the Election Commission would strictly abide by the ceiling on election expenditure and any candidate or political party found exceeding the limit would be dealt with firmly. However, he conceded that the ceiling of Rs 1.5 lakh [rupees] was low and needed to be raised or abolished. He also warned that action under the Indian Penal Code would be initiated against political parties found spending on behalf of a candidate without his consent.) Earlier, a section of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha accused the Centre of protecting officials indicted by the Election Commission for tardy functioning while on poll-related duty. The Election Commission had indicted 28 officials, Mrs Alva said, and, as per the procedures specified in the service conduct rules, the concerned Ministries were making preliminary inquiries to ascertain if regular departmental action was required against them. The House was told that after preliminary inquiries, charges had been dropped against five officials, two had retired, departmental inquiries were being conducted against two, and action had been taken against one.
