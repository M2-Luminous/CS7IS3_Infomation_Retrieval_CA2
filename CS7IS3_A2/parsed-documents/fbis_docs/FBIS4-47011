Grigoryev: "The Central Bank Will Be Selling Curerency Only at the Exchanges" [Text] No institutional changes anticipated on the currency market As reported by the Interfax agency, with reference to Igor Knyazev, deputy director of the Department of Currency Operations of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, in the immediate future the Central Bank "does not intend changing the tactics of regulating the ruble exchange rate and plans to carry out secret intervention through networks of authorized banks." According to Mr. Knyazev in May the Central Bank had already completed several direct transactions in the sale of foreign currency to commercial banks. That is, the Central Bank carried out currency transactions, bypassing all of the Russian exchanges, on the basis of a bilateral agreement with commercial banks. In general, the start of operations by the Central Bank in the sector outside the exchanges evidences recognition by it of serious changes in the institutional structure of the entire currency market. In principle the concentration of the largest share of currency transactions on one (or several) exchange floors is characteristic of an insufficiently developed and a highly centralized financial system dominated by vertical ties. That was exactly the situation in Russia in the past (and still is for the most part). Therefore the conduct of currency conversion operations, ceasing to be the prerogative of state banks, because of necessity needed an organizationally formulated mechanism. The Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, organized by the Central Bank and commercial banks became such a mechanism (by the end of 1993 its turnover exceeded 80 percent of the total Russian market) along with five more regional currency exchanges established later. Until recently the development of the financial infrastructure was reflected in quantitative parameters--a decrease in the cost of business on a consignment basis, evening out of cash and non-cash exchange rates. In March of this year the currency market in the capital was subjected to a peculiar fiscal racket by the Moscow government. One year ago a rise in the cost of conversion operations by 0.1 percent would have been received by the banks, even if without pleasure, at least without serious reciprocal measures. At present, however, all of the main participants of trading on the exchange shifted to direct interbank transactions, limiting their activity at the exchange to mandatory sale of proceeds of their clients from exports. The volume of transactions in the dollar section of the MMVB [Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange] decreased by one half. The slow, smooth, and predictable change in the ruble rate promoted the withdrawal of many banks from the exchange. The point is that during periods marked by a swift drop of the ruble the Central Bank appeared as the only seller of currency, which meant that it was possible to purchase it under "run from the ruble" conditions only on the exchange. At present, however, the market is not experiencing a need for large-scale currency intervention by the Central Bank. Moreover, periodically the rate in transactions outside of the exchange proved to be below the MMVB rate. By the way, it is highly likely that the steady increase of initial demand over supply on the exchange in the course of May is the consequence of skillful manipulation with bids by the Central Bank. After all correspondence of the dynamics of the exchange rate to the inflation rate is a strategic task of the Central Bank and for its achievement the Central Bank may consciously and systematically lower the rate through intervention on the exchange. In that manner the Central Bank suddenly encountered an important tendency--the shifting of the center of currency operations to the interbank market outside the exchange. This presupposes two important conclusions: the result of exchange trading, remaining adequately representative, no longer fully reflects the market correlation of the ruble and the dollar, which means that the mechanism allowing the Central Bank to regulate it grows weaker. That line of reasoning explains the announcement by Mr. Knyazev to the effect that the Central Bank intends to initiate active operations on the interbank market. Naturally, in order to realize that idea it will be necessary to form a limited circle of authorized banks. There are two possible variants of interaction between the Central Bank and commercial banks. The bureaucratic selection of candidates on the basis of subjective criteria (which is indirectly evidenced by the term "authorized banks" itself) creates a rigid structure in which commercial banks will be given the role of agents, or more precisely, brokers of the Central Bank fulfilling its instructions. In this case the Central Bank will retain a monopolistic position on the currency market. If financial indices should become a condition for inclusion in this list then in essence a market of large operators will form with the Central Bank becoming their dealing center. At the same time the Central Bank and commercial banks will become almost equal partners, while rates in transactions will reflect the state of the national currency in the most objective manner possible. Today, however, neither variant is being studied by the leadership of the Central Bank. As reported by Aleksandr Potemkin, director of the Main Currency Administration of the Central Bank, his agency does not see the need for any changes in the mechanism of the currency market. All currency interventions by the Central Bank are carried out and will continue to be carried out through the currency exchanges. As far as bilateral transactions with commercial banks are concerned, the Central Bank only purchases currency, and only the export proceeds subject to mandatory sale. The thing is that with its sufficiently large volumes it is sometimes difficult for the banks to fulfill client instructions by deadlines stipulated by legislation. In such a case the Central Bank helps with the fulfillment of its own instructions at the same time guarding the exchange from a sharp surplus of currency and sudden changes in the exchange rate. (According to Mr. Potemkin, the volume of transactions was not less than $15 million and the exchange rate could have been even worse than the market rate.) With the current inflation and level of monopolization of the banking system, according to Alkesandr Potemkin, it appears to be impossible to organize a liquid interbank market. If the system of currency exchanges provides access to the currency being sold by the Central Bank for almost 300 banks, whereas on the market outside of the exchange the Central Bank will be able to interact with 20-30 banks. That is why with continuation of a sufficiently high rate of inflation transition to a direct interbank currency market is premature. Any sharp change in the financial situation will lead to a drop in its liquidity and even to the curtailment of transactions. Banks which have access to currency will begin holding on to funds purchased from the Central Bank disturbing the market with speculative games. Intervention by the Central Bank through authorized banks will in that manner be transformed into an administrative distribution of currency resources.
