Perhaps this will be the end of disputes between the two countries, which lasted more than two years, about the past. But it would be hard to expect Polish troubles in Lithuania to be over with the signing of the treaty. Attacks on Jan Widacki, the Polish Republic's ambassador to Vilnius, may serve as an example here. Lithuanian nationalists have been accusing him of trying to polonize the Vilnius area, while leaders of the Polish minority have been accusing him of destroying Polish elements there. Attacks on Ambassador "The Polish ambassador to Lithuania does not represent his country's interests well"--this is what Ryszard Maciejkianiec, chief of the Polish faction in the Lithuanian parliament and a member of the leadership of the Association of Poles in Lithuania [ZPL], said recently while speaking in Warsaw before the Sejm commission charged with maintaining contacts with Poles abroad. "His activity exacerbates conflicts among Poles in Lithuania, and also between Poles and Lithuanians." On the other hand, Lithuanian nationalists are also sparing no criticism against Widacki. Seven Lithuanian right-wing parties issued a special statement six months ago in which they said that "Ambassador Widacki, through his activities and statements to the Lithuanian and Polish press, contributes to the Polish national minority constantly making unjustified claims." Ambassador Widacki himself told GAZETA WYBORCZA that he "deserves" the criticism because he publicly refuses to support ZPL leaders whose goal is to enclose the Polish community in a ghetto. "We have been cooperating with organizations that implement a positive program. We support the Polish School Mother Country [Polska Macierz Szkolna] and also Polish folklore and theatrical bands. We have brought in 225,000 Polish books, and we have made a donation to a regional hospital in Soleczniki, in the form of 3 billion zlotys worth of medications," Widacki says. Three Groups of People of Polish Origin The embassy intervenes with the Lithuanian authorities in all cases of violation of rights of Poles, which are guaranteed by European standards and by a Polish-Lithuanian declaration of 13 January 1992. Among others, the interventions concern the dissolved regional councils, a return of land to Poles, and the spelling of geographical names and Polish last names. Recently, there was an intervention in the case of the Lithuanian authorities ceasing to print Polish textbooks. A majority of our interventions were successful," Widacki says. He divides Poles living in Lithuania into three groups. The first, called the incorporationist group, is based on the principle that the current Polish-Lithuanian border is just temporary and that sooner or later the regions will be incorporated into the Polish state. The group is very weak and has few members. It includes the oldest generation and also some extreme activists. A second group, called the autonomy group, has as its goal the establishment in Lithuania of Polish administrative and political autonomy. It has the biggest number of members from among activists in the Polish minority. The third group, one of citizens' integration, is based on the principle of maintaining identity and a cultural and language separation, but, at the same time, it wants to integrate with the Lithuanian society and to occupy posts in the structures of the Lithuanian state. The group is represented the least from among activists for people of Polish origin. Czeslaw Okinczyc, a deputy to the Lithuanian parliament, and also people associated with the ZNAD WILII biweekly and with a radio station of the same name, are members of the group. Who Is Behind Whom Each of those groups looks for contacts with political groups in Poland. The "autonomists," who are the most numerous, first looked for support within the Christian-National Union, followed by the Movement for the Republic. Then they found an attentive ear among some politicians for the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], which is demonstrated by a January letter to Poland's supreme authorities with demands of "autonomy for Poles in Lithuania," which was signed by 82 deputies from those clubs (let us recall that some of those from the SLD who had signed the letter withdrew their signatures before the end of January). Ambassador Widacki explains that supporters of Polish autonomy in Lithuania are demanding that Poland force the Lithuanian authorities to implement constitutional amendments, among other things, and, at the same time, are demanding that their efforts to build autonomy from the rank-and-file level be supported financially. They want money for a Polish health center, a Polish hospital, a Polish university, and so forth. According to Widacki, that is a dangerous position to take because it can only lead to exacerbating the conflict between Poles and Lithuanians. "That is why we will persistently refuse to support building Polish autonomy from the rank-and-file level," Widacki states. In Defense of Individuals I heard similar views in the Polish Foreign Ministry. "Poland wants to protect the rights of minorities--both those living in Poland and Poles living abroad--exclusively based on rights of individuals," says Stefan Meller, a director at the Foreign Ministry's European Department. "But we are opposed to any kind of joint rights--that is, to such rights that lead to recognizing an entire minority as a subject of international law and to granting it political autonomy." "The Polish-Lithuanian treaty is supposed to serve the goal," Professor Meller says, "of having rights of individuals making up the Polish minority in Lithuania observed from every standpoint." --According to Lithuanian sources, there are 268,000 Poles living in Lithuania. The ZPL, even though its membership decreases each year, is the biggest Polish organization. A year ago, it had 14,000 members, whereas, currently, the number of members is 6,000. Apart from that, the Polish School Mother Country is active in Lithuania and has about 1,500 teachers as its members.
