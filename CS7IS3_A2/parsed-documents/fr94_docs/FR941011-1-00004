FR941011-1-00004 FR941011-1-00002 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 113 [Docket No. 93&hyph;039&hyph;1] Viruses, Serums, Toxins and Analogous Products; Standard Requirement for Escherichia Coli Bacterins AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to amend the regulations by adding a Standard Requirement for Escherichia coli bacterins. This amendment would provide a uniform procedure to demonstrate the immunogenicity of reference bacterins made from E. coli master seed bacteria. This amendment would also provide uniform procedures to requalify a reference bacterin for which the dating period has expired. In addition, the amendment would specify the potency test requirements for the release of serials of E. coli bacterins for immunogenicity and potency. The purpose of this regulation is to standardize the requirements for the production and testing of E. coli bacterins for immunogenicity and potency. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 93&hyph;039&hyph;01. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. David A. Espeseth, Deputy Director, Veterinary Biologics, BBEP, APHIS, USDA, room 838, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8245. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Standard Requirements are prescribed in 9 CFR part 113 for the preparation and testing of veterinary biological products. A Standard Requirement consists of test methods, procedures, and criteria which define the standards of purity, safety, potency, and efficacy for a given type of veterinary biological product. Where a Standard Requirement for a product does not exist in the regulations, production procedures and specifications for purity, safety, and potency of a product are provided in an Outline of Production filed with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Once uniform standards for a type of product are established, they are codified in the regulations. Because there is no Standard Requirement in 9 CFR part 113 for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterins, each manufacturer of these products has devised its own procedures, which are usually a part of a filed Outline of Production, to meet the requirements of the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act that all veterinary biological products be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious. Therefore, even though all of the procedures and methods must be satisfactory to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, there are a number of different procedures which are used by firms producing biological products containing E. coli as one of the components. At this time, we are prepared to propose adding a new ยง113.124 to the standards which would contain uniform test methods, procedures, and criteria to be used by licensed manufacturers of E. coli bacterins to provide assurance that these bacterins are immunogenic and potent. Immunogencity The effectiveness of a veterinary biologic to ameliorate disease in animals is of paramount importance to the consumers of veterinary biological products. The test for immunogenicity ascertains the efficacy of a veterinary biologic. Based on experience with immunogenicity tests, the Animal and Plan Health Inspection Service is proposing uniform requirements for establishing the immunogenicity of a Master Reference made from E. coli master seed. This would be accomplished by specifying in proposed ยง113.124(a): (1) The minimum number of pregnant dams to vaccinate and the number of nonvaccinated controls; (2) procedures for challenge of neonates with virulent E. coli ; and (3) the criteria for satisfactory protection against challenge and thereby demonstration of immunogenicity of the Master Reference. The immunogenicity test of master seed bacteria described in proposed ยง113.124(a) would be required of all new product license applications prior to licensure. The test would establish the immunogenicity of the Master Reference used in the relative potency test required for release of serials of biological product.
