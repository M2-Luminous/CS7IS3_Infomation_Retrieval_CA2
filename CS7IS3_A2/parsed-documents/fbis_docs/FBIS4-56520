The new justice was a member of the Court of Appeals in Concepcion. President Eduardo Frei telephoned Judge Ortiz to tell him of his appointment as Supreme Court justice. Judge Eleodoro Ortiz has been on the bench since 1969, when he was nominated as appellate judge in Concepcion under President Eduardo Frei Montalva. He believes the streamlining of judicial processes merits urgent consideration and that judges should be vested with the power of expeditiously passing sentence in less serious crimes. He believes the jurisdiction of military justice ought to be restricted and that the best guarantee for human rights is to facilitate access to the law by the widest sectors. With regard to a possible law on divorce, he categorically asserted: [Begin Ortiz recording] The current system has come under fire because nullity suits are said to be a farce. Nothing will prevent this very farce from continuing unabated with the passing of a law on divorce. [end recording] The new Supreme Court justice declined to comment on the mushrooming of schools of law in the country.
