By so doing, Lubbers is complying with the express wish of the Chamber that the prime minister, in addition to Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn, attend its debate on the matter. Consequently, the originally limited four-day visit by the prime minister will be further shortened by one day. According to the Netherlands prime minister, there is no reason for the Indonesians to feel offended at his early departure. He said he was convinced that he had managed to explain this clearly to his hosts.
