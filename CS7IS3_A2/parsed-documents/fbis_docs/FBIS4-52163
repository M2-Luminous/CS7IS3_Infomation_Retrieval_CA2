SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama will visit the headquarters of Sakigake Tuesday for talks with Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura in a bid to create a political alliance, the official said. The SDP wants to secure Takemura's consent to form a joint parliamentary group between the two in a bid to confront the fragile minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, political sources said. The move, if materialized, might trigger a fresh momentum to start a "second reconfiguration of the political community" by motivating some Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rebels to join their prospective alliance, they said. The SDP has been seeking to bring about a convergence of social democrat forces and liberal political forces. However, Takemura may face some intraparty resistance to the proposed merger with the SDP, as its 15 House of Representatives legislators are former defectors from the conservative LDP that has strongly upheld the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the sources said. The policy stand of the LDP breakaway also clashes with other aspects of the socialists, who have called for a scaling down of the Self-Defense Forces and balked at the proposed expansion of Japan's dependence on nuclear power generation, the sources said. The SDP stormed out of the coalition on April 26 after it was infuriated by the sudden formation of a 130-member parliamentary bloc comprising conservative coalition parties in the lower house following a bitter policy row within the coalition. The SDP has stood up to the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream in the coalition, which has called for a hike in the consumption tax and close security cooperation with the U.S. Forces to deal with a possible contingency on the Korean peninsula. The SDP's Murayama earlier suggested that close cooperation with Sakigake would help alleviate the voter perception of the party as a left-leaning ideological hard-liner, saying, "cooperation with Sakigake will change the image of the SDP."
