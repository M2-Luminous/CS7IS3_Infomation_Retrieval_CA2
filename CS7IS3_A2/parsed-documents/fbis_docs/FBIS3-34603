We will confront any hand that seeks to encroach on the homeland, its security and tranquility, and its citizens' safety. We know we are targeted by many, particularly the Zionist enemy and its terrorist agencies. That enemy thinks the Jordanian land is fertile soil for sedition among members of the one family, its political and intellectual schools, or its various origins. Therefore, our eyes focus primarily on the enemy and its agencies, even if his tools were from within us and not from his own ranks. That is why we also speak loud to warn against leaving any door or window open to terrorism or sabotage by this enemy, or any other enemy of Jordan's stability, march, and national unity. The House of Representatives, which denounced the recent acts of terrorism in our country, was speaking on behalf of all of our people in various positions and from various trends. This Jordan has always been a supporter of the language of dialogue, not the language of bombs; of peaceful arguments, not fighting with time bombs; and of democracy, and not darkness and suppression with bombs or bullets. Our people were shaken by the bombing of two movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa' because they realize that no one benefits from these operations, not even those who carried them out. We do not know what kind of victory can be achieved by burning the seats of a movie theater and what honor can be gained by wounding innocent citizens who happened to be in the theater at the time of the explosion. Confronting any hostile act against our security, peace, and unity is not the responsibility of our security agencies alone, but that of every member of the Jordanian family, each from his own position and according to his own abilities. Each citizen is a soldier for the homeland and each citizen must stand guard for security and tranquility and the enormous achievements scored under them. We know this is a transient wave, but the highest degree of vigilance is required, now and all the time, to guarantee tranquility for our children, security for our elderly, and happiness and peace for our young men and women.
