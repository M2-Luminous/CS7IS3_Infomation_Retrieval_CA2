These documents (511 national identity cards and 606 HCSN affidavit forms) were uncovered by French security services after a search of the homes of two presumed former Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] sympathizers, El-Hadj Chaib Eddour, an Algerian citizen, and Ahmed Seba, an Algerian holding French citizenship. These two individuals had been arrested and questioned on 21 March for their role in a drug trafficking case. Yet more seriously, at Ahmed Seba's home the French police had discovered an Israeli Galil assault rifle, two 9-mm PA loaders, as well as several boxes of shells. All of which would earn him another charge, namely criminal association of being in contact with a terrorist enterprise. However, according to VSD (a French magazine), which broke the background to the story on an exclusive basis in its most recent issue, the discovery of the documents happened accidentally. The origin of this haul, according to this magazine, was an investigation begun in early December into a drug trafficking network. Two different agencies, the general intelligence office [RG] and the Judiciary Police [PJ], had begun an investigation into the same group of suspects, but for two different reasons: the RG was interested in the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] support network aspect, the PJ in a heroin trafficking operation. Until this precise moment, French security forces still did not suspect that they were going to make the extraordinary discovery of the official Algerian documents. It was only after the arrest, on 21 March, of 18 members (including Chaib and Seba) and the search of their premises that the secret was discovered. There was a huge network producing counterfeit Algerian documents. A fair share of these papers were already in envelopes bearing the addresses of their addressees in Algeria. When questioned, Seba would admit that these documents were meant for members of GIA, the terrorist group. He is reported to have stated that he had left them at Chaib's house at the request of a certain Boudjellal Chemellal, a presumed GIA member, and that he had done so under the threat of reprisals against members of his family. Still, according to Seba's admission, Boudjellal was also the owner of the Israeli assault rifle and the load of ammunition. These facts would, in fact, provide concrete evidence for the French security agencies and authorities that the GIA has indeed managed to set up a support and logistic network in France, which is closely connected with drug trafficking. Better yet, French police have even established a connection between this case and certain individuals arrested as part of an operation last November code-named "Chrysanthemum" aimed at circles of sympathizers and activists in France of the former FIS. That evidence is the discovery of a photocopy of the verification order issued on 12 November against Larbi Beddiaf, a member of the FAF [Algerian Brotherhood in France], who was questioned for being [part of] a criminal organization in contact with a terrorist enterprise. Last, it should be noted that Chaib and Seba as well as Boudjellal, for whom the examining magistrate issued an international arrest warrant, are not known and therefore not in the files of the French and Algerian security agencies.
