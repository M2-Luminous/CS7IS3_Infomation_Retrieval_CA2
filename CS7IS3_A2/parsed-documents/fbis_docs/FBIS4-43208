The U.S. Congress has placed the Kurdish problem on its agenda because of our exaggerated behavior and the anti-Turkish lobby's influence. In fact, it seems reluctant to exclude it from its agenda. Obviously, it intends to intensify pressure on Turkey on this matter in the next few years. Unfortunately, the U.S. Congress is unable to separate the Kurdish problem from the terrorist activities that are carried out by the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. It regards the matter as a whole and believes that the terrorist activities are related to "the uprising of a miserable people who have been oppressed for many years, in pursuit of their natural rights and their cultural identity." The approach of the U.S. Congress to the Kurds in Turkey is similar to its sympathetic approach to the Kurds in northern Iraq because it is unable to see the difference between the two peoples. That is why there is confusion on the matter. Tomatoes and potatoes are being confused. However, Turkey has suffered as a result of that approach. The atmosphere in the U.S. Congress is changing, so much so that Turkey may in the future face several resolutions that will completely suspend the military aid programs and ban the use of U.S. arms in southeastern Turkey. These developments are serious. Therefore, we must seriously assess the indications and reconsider Turkey's basic policies. The Administration Shares Congress' Criticism... One of Turkey's basic policies, which should be reconsidered, is related to the U.S. military aid program. It is common knowledge that the U.S. House of Representatives linked 25 percent of the $453 million the Clinton Administration has earmarked for Turkey to the Kurdish problem, the progress Turkey achieves on human rights, and the reports the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon will submit in that regard. That means that Turkey will make progress on the Kurdish problem and the question of human rights, and the U.S. Departments of State and Defense will submit reports to Congress to confirm it. In other words, the U.S. military aid program has been linked to the Kurdish problem and the developments in southeastern Turkey. Apparently a mechanism has been established that cannot be stopped but which can be intensified and broadened very easily. It is common knowledge that 25 percent of the aid program has been suspended. Another half of that program may be suspended in the near future. In fact, the whole program may be completely suspended. No one should doubt that. From 1974 to 1976 Congress linked its aid program to the Cyprus problem. In fact, it went as far as to impose an arms embargo on Turkey at that time. Nevertheless, the embargo was lifted after a short time because the U.S. Administration opposed it and supported Turkey's struggle to change Congress' mind. However, that situation is different now. On the contrary, the Clinton Administration has encouraged the U.S. Congress. It is true that it does not wish to have its aid package reduced. However, it supports every statement that is made in the Congress on the Kurdish problem and the question of human rights. That includes the criticisms leveled against Turkey on the two matters. The U.S. Administration and Congress have a common approach in that regard... Meanwhile, the influence of Congress on the Clinton Administration must also be taken into consideration. That has made things even more difficult. The Clinton Administration clearly fears the U.S. Congress on the question of human rights. In fact, it is as if it has surrendered to Congress. It seems impossible for the U.S. Administration to wage a struggle against it on that matter. Military Aid Will be Completely Cut... Congress has reduced the U.S. military aid program to Turkey over the course of many years. In fact, the program will be completely cut in a few years because it is deemed unnecessary after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Furthermore, the economic situation in the United States requires the cancellation of that country's economic aid programs. That has already been outlined by U.S. officials. This means that the future of the military aid Turkey receives is not very bright. A time will come when no country, including Turkey, will receive military aid from the United States. In view of all that, it is becoming more and more imperative for Turkey to move to reject the conditional aid package at this time. 1. Although the bill on the aid package has been approved by the House of Representatives, it may be turned down by the U.S. Senate. That is a strong possibility. Nevertheless, the link has been established and the House of Representatives will maintain it. Meanwhile, the Senate committees will debate the Kurdish problem in detail in the next few weeks... The rejection of the aid package by Turkey would remove one of the important trump cards in the Congress... It would be regarded as an important reaction. 2. It is understood that the aid package, which has been reduced to $341 million, will be further reduced to $250 million. That will be the amount of the contribution the United States will make toward the F-16 project in Turkey. It will be in the form of a credit. However, Turkey can easily acquire an equal loan from the international money markets with similar conditions. That means that Turkey does not stand to suffer any material loss if it rejects the reduced aid package. 3. It is unthinkable that the U.S. Administration may decide to abandon the F-16 project. In view of that, it will definitely try to redeem what it contributes to the project by another way. Turkey must reject the present form of the aid package if it wishes to avoid a problem in its relations with the United States (because each and every cut or condition creates tension), obstruct further pressure in the future, and avoid being pushed here and there by the U.S. Congress. That Will Not Suffice To Resolve the Problem... Here is a factor we should keep in mind: Even if Turkey decides to reject the military aid package, it will be unable to rid itself of Congress if it fails to change its basic policies. Rejecting the aid package would be a short-term reaction. However, our general approach to the Kurdish problem and the question of human rights is very important. Ankara will be confronted with serious problems if the U.S. Congress moves to take action against Turkey because of them. We felt obliged to warn against such a state of affairs. It is up to Turkey's leading officials to take the necessary measures.
