The orbiter will observe the sun's activity as part of the joint Russian-Ukrainian Koronas-I project. The project leader, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Viktor Orayevskiy (director of the Institute of Earth Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation, in Troitsk, Moscow Region), emphasized that this was "the first cooperation project between the Russian and Ukrainian Academies of Sciences after the collapse of the USSR." The orbiter will hopefully provide new insights into the Earth-sun interaction, the sun corona and the impact the sun activity makes on the Earth ionosphere. Earlier space stations of this kind were named Interkosmos and carried equipment supplied by the East European countries. The station is expected to stay at least three years in service.
