According to an analysis of some 1,200 letters received by a Shanghai city youth problem hotline from young people in 27 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, there are 14 types of psychological problems besetting China's middle school students. The report issued by the hotline divided the problems into the 14 types shown in the adjoining chart. According to the analysis, of the problems listed, the most prominent were "new life complications" "at a loss about or stymied by life" and "reversals and attacks." A second year middle school male student (the equivalent of our fifth year middle school) said in his letter: "I have heard that people with money are happy; that people with learning are in dire straits, that the children of high officials use their connections and go by the back door, that the gifts from civilians can make an official rich... Is this all true? Hearing other people talk about this being inevitable in society, that we are the naive ones, how is one to adjust to this society?" If one says that the mainland middle schoolers' problems like being "stymied by life" are primarily the effect of society, then the cause of problems like "reversals and attacks" and "having a crush on someone" obviously is that the majority of them are middle school students are single-child homes, who are normally over-protected, have experienced few difficulties and who are psychologically ill equipped to withstand or endure any hardship. A Miss Wang who states that her study record has been consistently excellent, after failing a small exam wrote in her letter: "God is treating me so unfairly! My failure is wholly unbearable!" For the same reason another student wrote: "I am a piece of garbage! What are other people going to think of me? The stench of my rotten name has wafted afar." The thing that worries the concerned experts is the problem of "early love" among middle school students -- which everyone had always kept close watch over -- has recently begun to appear again as "having a crush on someone" and including secret heterosexual affairs with older people such as the parent of a classmate, a teacher, a famous singer, or some master of ceremonies, etc. It is a symptom of increasing personal and psychological immaturity.
