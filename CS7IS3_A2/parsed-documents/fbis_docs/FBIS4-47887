Such centers include hospital, air, and naval bases, as well as barracks. The report presented to the UN Security Council says that soldiers have had to stay in their assembly areas for long periods because of demobilization delays. The UN secretary general's report also mentions delays in the scrapping of some 155,000 militia and other (?paramilitary) forces, and it adds that a lack of air transportation helped paralyze that process in March, though half of the weapons declared by the government, in the hands of the paramilitary forces, had been collected in April.
