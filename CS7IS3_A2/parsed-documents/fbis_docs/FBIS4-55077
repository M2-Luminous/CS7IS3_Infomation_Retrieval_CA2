[Zhelev] The reforms are not being implemented. Until now the land could have been returned five times. [Petrova] Who is responsible for this, Mr. President? [Zhelev] The executive power is responsible. Three governments wasted their time and did not accomplish anything. According to my assessment, the land that Berov's government really returned amounts to only 10 percent. What DURZHAVEN VESTNIK published about the land that has really been returned does not correspond to the truth. (Editorial note: According to the most recent data published by the National Statistics Institute, previous owners have claimed 52,520,000 decares of agrarian land. Some 28,877,000 decares have been returned to private owners, and this represents 47.4 percent of the total land that has been claimed.) What the newspaper refers to is rather acknowledging ownership without issuing an appropriate document or determining the borders of the plots. [Petrova] Will returning the land, a reform to which you attribute great importance, really stimulate the development of our economy? [Zhelev] Naturally, there will be only a few people who will be able to establish solid agrarian companies. In the next 5-10 years in Bulgaria the cooperative form will be the dominating one. [Petrova] Mr. President, after this somber assessment of what has been achieved in the last four years, what is your forecast regarding the cabinet's fate after the Easter recess? [Zhelev] I refrain from any forecast. This is a complex issue. [Petrova] What makes you uneasy and prevents you from answering? [Zhelev] This is the business of the parliament. We are a constitutional state, despite the fact that our constitution is not perfect. [Petrova] Does Bulgaria need a new or a reshuffled government? [Zhelev] I refrain from answering, but I think that reshuffling the government is not the correct road. We must have early elections. [Petrova] When do you think the Bulgarians will be ready to head for the polling stations? [Zhelev] (laughing) If you want to wait for the Bulgarians to be ready for new elections.... Even when the mandate of this cabinet expires the Bulgarians will not be ready for new elections. [Petrova] Then? [Zhelev] The parliament members will not want to lose their privileges -- salaries, Mercedes cars, immunity, and influence over the mass media. The trade unions, the extraparliamentary forces, and public opinion must be activated. They must prepare the ground for early elections. Otherwise the current parliament will do everything possible to reproduce itself. This also is the reason why the parliament refuses to dissolve during the two months that precede the elections. No deputy will be held responsible for corruption as long as he is protected by immunity. [Petrova] Is it true that you will personally support the candidacy of Dimitur Ludzhev as prime minister of a caretaker or normal cabinet? [Zhelev] Ludzhev is not interested in being the prime minister in a caretaker cabinet. This will be the most stupid thing he could do, namely, to waste his possibility to enter the parliament because of serving 2-3 months as the head of a caretaker cabinet. I think that Dimitur Ludzhev is a capable politician. He could achieve a lot if he has a stable team. [passage omitted] [Petrova] Mr. President, who is the greatest criminal in Bulgaria? [Zhelev] (laughing) Not I.
