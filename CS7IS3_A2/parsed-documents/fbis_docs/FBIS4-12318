FBIS4-12318 "drnes067_l_94001" FBIS-NES-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Peres, Sarid, Palestinians React to 'Afula Attack Peres, Sarid, Palestinians React to 'Afula Attack TA0604150394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1400 GMT 6 Apr 94 TA0604150394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Here is an initial Palestinian reaction to the attack in 'Afula: Nasri Yusuf, head of the Palestinian military delegation to the Cairo talks, told our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus that the fact that acts of violence continue is very saddening. He added that the Palestinians do not support such acts, and make every effort to put end to violence in the region. The remarks were made after the Palestinian military delegation held a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that no one can guarantee that the attack in 'Afula will be the last. At the same time, every effort will be made to cut off the arms of the murderers and harm the terror organization which aspires to murder all that is good in the Middle East. Minister Peres further said that grave incidents had been expected, but the attack in 'Afula was graver than could be expected. He added that the government will make security-related decisions, and rejected the opposition parties' demand that a commission of inquiry be set up to investigate the incident. Such murders took place when the Likud was in power, and even before the peace talks started, Peres said. [In a live telephone interview on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 6 April, Foreign Minister Peres says: "I do not believe that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] asks or needs 'Arafat's permission to carry out such attacks. For the time being, 'Arafat is not on the ground here. When he enters the region, we will examine his conduct in the region under his jurisdiction." Asked about the opposition demand to suspend the negotiations with the PLO in the wake of the attack, he said: "I see no connection between the two issues."] Minister Yosi Sarid said that the circumstances of the attack in 'Afula will be thoroughly studied. He rejected the demands that the peace talks be suspended claiming that the terrorists should not be given a prize for their acts. At the same time, he said, we must fight terrorism to the end. Deputy Agriculture Minister Walid Sadiq condemned the grave attack in 'Afula, and called for restraint. Deputy Health Minister Nayif Musaliha said that the terrorists intend to murder the peace process and the relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Knesset Member [MK] Yosi Katz, deputy chairman of the Labor faction, said that the bloody attack proves that the government must go on with the peace process, and not be deterred by attempts by extremists to torpedo it. Meretz faction Chairman Ran Kohen called on the prime minister and the PLO head not to retreat, and to speed up the exit of Israelis from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] faction Chairman Tawfiq Zayyad condemned the attack, saying that it poisons the atmosphere and harms the political process. The National Religious Party said that the 'Afula attack is the outcome of the Rabin government's policy of groveling. Moledet said that the 'Afula massacre is an indication of what is to happen once the recipe for peace, prepared by the government and the PLO, is implemented. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that MK Ravitz of the United Torah Jewry demanded that the prime minister set up a state commission of inquiry to examine the events that led to the attack in 'Afula. Likud MK 'Ovadya Eli, who used to be 'Afula mayor, demanded that peace talks be stopped at once, and that their continuation be made conditional on a Palestinian commitment to prevent additional acts of terror from taking place.
