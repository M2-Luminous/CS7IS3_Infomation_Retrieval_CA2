In the wake of soldiers dispatched to Bukavu, Zaire, to enter the western part of Rwanda, a full medical and surgical infrastructure is ready to be set up. Jean-Noel Ferre, a general with the French Army Medical Corps, outlined the technical details of the operation to Jean-Pierre Boris: [Begin recording] [Ferre] This infrastructure is made up of a surgical team, with two surgeons and an anaesthetist, two medical teams including two doctors each, a 50-bed hospital section, a laboratory unit and an X-ray unit. [Boris] What about the surgical unit? [Ferre] The surgical unit is a simple surgical unit which can only carry out emergency surgery. It is manned by three doctors, two surgeons and an anaesthetist, six fully qualified nurses, and three soldiers. This gives you a broad picture of the infrastructure we are setting up: On one hand a surgical unit for the troops, in case of fighting; and on the other hand a medical unit that includes a surgical team and two medical teams -- with laboratory and X-ray sections -- to cater to the refugees.
