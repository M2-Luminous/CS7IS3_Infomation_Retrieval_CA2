FBIS4-33352 "drlat108_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-108 Daily Report 31 May 1994 MEXICO Secofi Official on NAFTA, Tariff Exemptions Secofi Official on NAFTA, Tariff Exemptions PA0406044194 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 31 May 94 p 45 PA0406044194 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Report by Robert Gonzalez Amador] [Text] Hermino Blanco Mendoza, under secretary for international trade relations at the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat (Secofi), acknowledged yesterday that Mexico's productive sector has expressed its opposition to attempts to lower tariffs in advance on 155 goods included in the Free Trade Pact (TLC). The official stated that, following discussions between Secofi authorities and Mexican manufacturers, "very few articles will undergo tariff exemptions adjustments, since the position adopted by Mexican manufacturers and farmers is not to negotiate with respect to this aspect." Yesterday, Herminio Blanco participated in hearings by the Senate's Trade and Industrial Development and Foreign Relations Commissions in which he provided an explanation with respect to the status of the free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa Rica. Departing from the hearing's agenda, Angel Sergio Guerrero, Durango State PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] senator, said that lowering duties in advance on 155 items included in the TLC -- announced in the 22 May Official Gazette -- "would be similar to substantially modifying the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA], which is of concern since adjustments have been suggested by one of the parties to the agreement." The senator asked: What's the reason for this attempt to propose tariff exemptions in advance? The Secofi official explained to the PRI senator that "there should be no apprehensions because the treaty allows lowering tariffs in advance if requested by one of the parties and if the other two are in agreement." Blanco added that Secofi had analyzed the issue ever since the announcement was published in the Official Gazette. He also indicated that Secofi is expected to conclude discussions on the issue by 23 June. However, Blanco pointed out that the position adopted by the country's productive sector is not to negotiate lowering tariffs in advance. Under Secretary Blanco stated that of the 155 items on which tax exemptions had been proposed "per Mexico's request," 107 were proposed by Mexico, 43 by the United States, and seven by Canada. These items represent a "relatively low bilateral trade flow," which represents 3.8 percent of Mexico's exports to the United States and 2.8 percent of U.S. sales to Mexico. The U.S. counterpart, Blanco added, requested tariff exemptions for items such as potatoes, beans, cheese, and wine. However, Mexican growers pointed out that exemptions in advance are unthinkable in these cases. Hermino Blanco explained to the senators that the final outcome of this process will be that "very few items will receive tariff exemptions before the dates established by the free trade agreement." In a meeting with federal representatives, Hector Teran, a PAN [National Action Party] member and Baja California senator, indicated that along the northern border "there are problems realizing the benefits of the free trade agreement." He also voiced his doubts with respect to the ever-growing trade deficit's being profitable to the country, saying that, on the contrary, the imbalance in the exchange of goods could undermine the currency's parity during the next few months. In reply, Blanco pointed out that the trade deficit, which totaled $4.317 billion during the first quarter, is natural and indicated that Mexico is a country that imports capital goods and raw materials essential to its development. He added that this past April, for the first time, monthly exports to the United States surpassed $4 billion. He also proposed that Secofi exercise more vigilance in order to expedite export transactions, although he insisted that, regarding deregulation, "many things have changed favorably." During the hearing, which was presided over by Hidalgo Senator Humberto Lugo Gil, PRI bloc coordinator in the Chamber of Senators, 10 legislators intervened to request more information with respect to the free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa Rica signed this past 5 April by both nations' presidents. In his presentation before the question and answer period, Herminio Blanco Mendoza pointed out that, as a result of the agreed upon trade liberalization program, Mexico will be able to export, starting on the day the treaty comes into force, all goods that Costa Rica does not produce. Thus, 70 percent of nonagricultural Mexican sales to that nation and 75 percent of Costa Rican exports to Mexico will be tariff-free. In reply to a question by Morelos Senator Angel Ventura Valle, the Secofi official said that agricultural exports from Costa Rica to Mexico will not harm national production. Costa Rican coffee and plantains were excluded from the agreement, and the elimination of tariffs on Costa Rican corn and beans will be implemented in 15 years, he added. Sinaoloa Senator Gustavo Guerrero said that produce growers in his state worry about the possibility of illegal transshipment of tomatoes, potatoes, lettuce, and other produce from the United States to Mexico. Blanco Mendoza said that the rules on the origin of products specified in the agreement are clear. He added that Mexican authorities, in coordination with national producers, will ensure that this type of illegal practices do not occur. Herminio Blanco Mendoza said that the trade agreements reached on the American Continent in past years constitute a firm step toward the establishment of genuine regional trade integration. "After decades of speeches there is finally progress," he added.
