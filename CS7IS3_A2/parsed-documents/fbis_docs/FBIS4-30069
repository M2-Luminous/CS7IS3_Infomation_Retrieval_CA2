The Authority asked 102 division deputy director-class officials at ministries and agencies to judge the relationship between politicians and the administration. These young and prospective officials have received the Authority's administrative training from January to April. Seventy-seven percent said "There are problems under the present conditions" and urged a change in the relationship, 50 percent cited "weak political leadership over the administration" as a problem, and 49 percent supported the statement that "The administration interferes with matters which should be handled by politicians." Eighteen percent said that political pressure is "too high." Multiple answers were allowed, so responses add up to more than 100 percent. But only 17 percent voiced optimism that the political world will actually undergo major change during the next 10 years, while just 6 percent said so for the administration. "Certain changes" in politics are anticipated by 54 percent, and in the administrative sphere by 45 percent. Almost a third believe that nothing will change in politics, while 49 percent fear that the administrative system will remain the same. "The answers show that there is hope for a change of the current conditions as well as the awareness that such change will be difficult to realize," an authority official said in analyzing the survey results.
