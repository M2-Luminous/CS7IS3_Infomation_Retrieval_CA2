FR941221-1-00037 FR941221-1-00012 B. RMW Exception RSPA received several comments on the ANPRM claiming that the regulations imposed by RSPA overlap, and sometimes conflict with, regulations/guidelines established by other agencies, which unnecessarily increases costs and confusion. One commenter suggested that inconsistencies should be eliminated between Federal and State regulations governing RMW. Another commenter stated that overlapping regulations clearly increase non-compliance; however, the associated costs are difficult to assess. One commenter asserted that current Federal regulations do not appear to be financially burdensome but do complicate compliance. One commenter claimed that overlapping Federal regulations are not so much burdensome or costly, as that they are largely ignored. Another commenter stated that varying medical waste regulations increase the volume of waste that must be specially handled. Many commenters requested consolidation of the regulations. More specifically, commenters stated that the appearance of multiple labels on a package of infectious substances causes unnecessary confusion to transport workers and emergency responders. One commenter claimed that multiple labels contribute to the mismanagement of medical waste by transport workers and emergency response personnel. Several commenters recommended that one label is sufficient to communicate the hazard. One commenter suggested that the CDC ``BIOMEDICAL MATERIAL'' label and the OSHA ``BIOHAZARD'' marking should be allowed only on stationary materials and equipment. Some commenters recommended that RSPA adopt the UN Recommendations label for infectious substances because it is internationally recognized. One commenter stated that appropriate worker training would eliminate much of the confusion experienced by transport workers and emergency response personnel. RSPA recognizes that overlapping Federal regulations for infectious substances and RMW cause confusion and result in frustrated shipments. Therefore, RSPA is proposing to provide an exception from the HMR labeling and packaging requirements for RMW, transported by private and contract carriers, that is packaged in a packaging that complies with OSHA requirements, is rigid, conforms to the general packaging requirements of 49 CFR 173.24 and 173.24a, and is marked with the OSHA ``BIOHAZARD'' marking. This exception would be limited to transport by private or contract carrier because these carriers generally transport RMW exclusively and have the demonstrated ability to implement appropriate handling procedures which offset potentially lesser packaging integrity. RMW that is offered for transportation and transported by common carrier would be subject to the packaging requirements of §173.197. RSPA invites comments on this matter. Other than this exception for RMW, RSPA is not proposing in this NPRM to accept other agencies' labels or markings in place of the label or marking requirements for infectious substances packagings. The ``INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE'' label is internationally recognized, is required under the ICAO Technical Instructions for transport by aircraft, and is consistent in size and appearance with DOT's other hazard warning labels. Unlike OSHA's ``BIOHAZARD'' marking, the DOT label conveys the class number of the material, emergency information in the event of a spill or incident, and has minimum size requirements to ensure its visibility. C. Miscellaneous RSPA is proposing to relocate the exceptions for biological products and diagnostic specimens in §173.196 and the definition and exceptions for RMW in Appendix G to part 173 to §173.134 to ease compliance. Also, in response to a question concerning use of the term ``diagnostic specimen'' versus ``clinical specimen,'' many commenters recommended that RSPA continue using ``diagnostic specimen'' instead of ``clinical specimen'' because the term ``diagnostic specimen'' is commonly used in industry. RSPA agrees and would retain the terminology. RSPA is proposing to amend the terminology used in the incident reporting requirements in §171.15 from ``etiologic agents'' to ``infectious substances (etiologic agents)''. RSPA has received several requests for clarification as to whether infectious substance packagings that successfully pass the tests in §178.609 must be certified and marked. According to §173.196, packagings for infectious substances are required to be capable of passing the tests in §178.609. These packagings are not required to be marked and certified. RSPA is proposing to add a provision in §178.609 that clarifies that packagings conforming to this section are not subject to the marking requirements of §173.503. However, the eighth revised edition of the UN Recommendations prescribes packaging certification marking requirements for infectious substances packagings. Therefore, RSPA may propose similar requirements in the interest of international harmonization, in future rulemaking action. (See Section VI of this notice.) RSPA would clarify in §173.134 that Division 6.2 materials other than RMW are not assigned a packing group. RMW would be assigned to a Packing Group II performance level. D. Air Transportation In response to a question in the ANPRM, RSPA received comments concerning shipments of RMW by modes other than highway. Commenters stated that RMW is transported predominantly by highway; however, other modes of transportation also are used. Some commenters reported that used sharps are transported by air through the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ``mail-in'' sharps program. RSPA received a petition requesting an amendment to the HMR to permit the transportation of similar quantities and packages of RMW by aircraft other than in mail. RSPA also received comments from a number of health care facilities located in rural areas, e.g., Alaska, requesting that the regulations facilitate transportation of medical wastes by aircraft. The commenters stated that health clinics in remote areas are only accessible by air or water. Commenters reported that it is not practical for the air carriers to provide cargo-only flights.
