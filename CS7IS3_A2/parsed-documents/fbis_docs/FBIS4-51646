FBIS4-51646 "dreas084_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 North Korea Diplomat: Fuel Rod Replacement Cannot Wait Diplomat: Fuel Rod Replacement Cannot Wait OW2904120194 Tokyo KYODO in English 1112 GMT 29 Apr 94 OW2904120194 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 29 KYODO -- A North Korean diplomat said Friday [29 April] the replacement of spent fuel rods at a nuclear power plant cannot be postponed and replacement of the rods will go ahead with or without the oversight of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "If the production of electricity is to continue, then it is necessary to change the fuel rods... The matter of changing the fuel rods is in no way related to the agency (IAEA)," said Tae Chong-chae, a minister at the North Korean embassy in Beijing. Last week North Korea invited IAEA inspectors to view the removal of the rods at an experimental nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, a key nuclear facility suspected by the west of producing weapons grade plutonium. The IAEA has yet to respond to the invitation and is awaiting Pyongyang's response to IAEA demands concerning the history of the plant. A team of IAEA inspectors sent to North Korea in March returned to their home base in Vienna claiming that North Korean officials had interfered with their two-week inspection, leading to a further deterioration in the yearlong standoff over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program.
