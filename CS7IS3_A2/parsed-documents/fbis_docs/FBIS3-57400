As previously reported, Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas Jarmalavicius, leaders of the underground Lithuanian Communist Party, were arrested by Lithuanian and Belarussian officials in Minsk and brought to a Vilnius prison Jan. 15. The arrest and the extradition of the two communist leaders to Lithuania caused a political storm in Belarus. Some high-ranking Belarussian officials face dismissal. Stanislav Shushkevich, chairman of the Belarusian parliament, told the Russian Ostankino TV Sunday [22 January] that Belarusian authorities had no right to extradite Burokevicius and Jarmalavicius to Lithuania. Viktoras Markovas, chief prosecutor of the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office, said on Lithuanian radio Monday that the problem in Belarus is dominated by political motives and in fact is an attempt to oust the leadership of the Belarusian Interior Ministry and the KGB. The Lithuanian official said "what was undertaken, was done in strict accordance with the requirements of the agreement" on legal assistance. Markovas was among those who drafted the agreement. The chief prosecutor said all necessary extradition documents were presented to the Belarusian side in advance, Belarusian officials considered the request and agreed to extradite persons who are not citizens of Belarus and are punishable according to the Belarusian law. In Markovas' opinion, Belarusians should have assisted the Lithuanian side even more and to help transport the alleged criminals to Lithuania. Burokevicius and Jarmalavicius are charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government and premeditated murder. If convicted they face from 15 years in jail to capital punishment. As a result of a military aggression in Vilnius Jan. 13, 1991, 13 civilians were killed and around 700 injured defending state institutions from Soviet tanks.
