And a friend from press circles asked someone to pass on the word to me that: "Your statement was too intense, being much too damaging to your image!" I received phone calls from certain friends, some telling me about public and international reactions, some expressing support, and yet others indirectly reflecting differing views, making the well-meant suggestion that the future statements should emphasize deportment. And I also received certain "letters from the people," expressing support and encouragement. Bao Yugang [0545 3768 0474] also sought me out to express support: "While you have spoken very well, and it was about time, certain Chinese as well as British friends also agree with you." He also said that: "Good principles also say that you have spoken well!" Later, Jardine Matheson's Simon Kaise expressed to me directly his dissatisfaction with the British Hong Kong government's method of representative government, sympathizing with my statement. While I had expected differing stands and reactions, I had never anticipated the reaction to my sense of propriety, particularly to my deportment. So I learned my lesson, and strove to prevent its recurrence on future public occasions. This "storm about my statement" also aroused the attention of Beijing, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the [State Council] Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) sending me telegrams asking what I had said. My colleagues in our branch of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (NCNA) were quite tense, wondering whether the inquiries meant that a mistake had been made. So I reported the news record to the MOFA, the HKMAO, the CPC Central Committee, and the State Council, as well as consoling my colleagues that there was no need for concern, as the matter had not been handled wrong. Even if it had and Beijing criticized us, I was responsible, as "the statement was mine." The MOFA's diplomatic language of "considering both sides and speaking around the issue" was essentially noncommittal, showing China's conflict in dealing with my statement. When the British side criticized my statement at a meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the Chinese side's chief representative, Ke Zaishuo [2688 0961 3617], responded that this was "unfair," differing from MOFA's tacit consent, and stretching to convey China's position. I considered that he might have used such a "neutral" term only because he either was not obeying MOFA instructions, or had not received them (which possibility was not great). I believe that he felt very awkward. When Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378] [chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and director of the HKMAO] later visited Hong Kong, he asked me: "What did you say at the time?" After I had told him, he had nothing further to say. (In fact, his question was unnecessary, as I had already reported by telegram, as well as attaching the news account.) I knew that his view differed, so did not discuss it further. And when a reporter asked him on a public occasion his view on the "storm about my statement," he did not take a stand. At a cocktail party given for him by industrial and commercial circles, when Mauridge of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (generally known as the West's Chamber of Commerce, as its members were mostly British merchants) "complained" to him, criticizing my statement, Ji Pengfei actually said nothing despite the fact that I was standing not far from them, making me feel that he had gone a bit too far. But at a luncheon after he had spoken with Hong Kong Governor Wilson, when someone again mentioned the "storm about my notes," he finally made the statement that: "As it seems to have motivated Britain to dovetail' with us, it did have an impact." While Ji Pengfei was visiting Hong Kong, the news came from Beijing that the "storm about my statement" had also set off a "storm" in Beijing, with the MOFA and the HKMAO complaining about me to the Central Committee and State Council, arousing the attention of the Central Committee. At a meeting of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, Wan Li said that: "I have read the whole text of Xu Jiatun's statement, and believe that it contains no problems." So it seems that the support of figures, such as Wan Li, kept the storm from blowing up in Beijing. At a meeting with Deng Xiaoping in the first half of 1986, he asked me: "Did you not make a statement that aroused controversy?" While I did not know if he was referring to its internal or external controversy, I said: "Yes. It caused much trouble." Whereupon Deng said: "You were not wrong. If you had not made that statement, allowing Britain to go on as it had, Hong Kong would have certainly been thrown into chaos." State Councilor Gu Mu was at that meeting with Deng. When I returned to Hong Kong and discussed the matter with my NCNA colleagues there, they suggested that: "You ought to write a report to the MOFA and HKMAO, to let them know about this." While my colleagues' idea was a very good one, I felt that it was unnecessary, as I had always felt that I had done nothing wrong. One month after the "storm about my statement," Britain expressed acceptance of the principle that representative government would be dovetailed with the Basic Law, even though much mutual controversy still remained over the political system issue. After this, in the course of the drafting of the Basic Law, both sides entered a stage of cooperation.
