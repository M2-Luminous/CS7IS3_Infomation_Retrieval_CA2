He said this when he met Tuesday the visiting military delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by Choe Kwang, member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the Workers' Party of Korea, vice-chairman of the National Defence Committee of the DPRK and chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army. Jiang Zemin said friendship between China and the DPRK is one provided, consolidated and developed by the respected leader of the Korean people Comrade Kim Il-song together with Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and other revolutionary veterans of the Chinese people and forged in blood. Noting that the two countries are friendly neighbours in the lips-and-teeth relationship, he said the two parties, two countries and two armies have traditional relations of friendship. He stressed that further strengthening and developing such relations -- past or present -- is always of great significance. "The Chinese party and government regard their friendly relations with the DPRK important, and are satisfied with the development of the relations between the two parties and two countries," he added.
