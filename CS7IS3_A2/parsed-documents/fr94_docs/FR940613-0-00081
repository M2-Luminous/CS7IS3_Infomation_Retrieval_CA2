FR940613-0-00081 FR940613-0-00015 * * * * * National Network (NN). The composite of the individual network of highways from each State on which vehicles authorized by the provisions of the STAA are allowed to operate. The network in each State includes the Interstate System, exclusive of those portions excepted under §658.11(f) or deleted under §658.11(d), and those portions of the Federal-aid Primary System in existence on June 1, 1991, set out by the FHWA in appendix A to this part. * * * * * Nondivisible load or vehicle. (1) As used in this part, nondivisible means any load or vehicle exceeding applicable length or weight limits which, if separated into smaller loads or vehicles, would: (i) Compromise the intended use of the vehicle, i.e., make it unable to perform the function for which it was intended; (ii) Destroy the value of the load or vehicle, i.e., make it unusable for its intended purpose; or (iii) Require more than 8 workhours to dismantle using appropriate equipment. The applicant for a nondivisible load permit has the burden of proof as to the number of workhours required to dismantle the load. (2) A State may treat emergency response vehicles and casks designed and used for the transport of spent nuclear materials as nondivisible vehicles or loads. * * * * * §§658.13 and 658.15 [Amended] 9. In the list below, for each section indicated in the left column, remove the citation indicated in the middle column from wherever it appears in the section, and add the citation indicated in the right column: ␣ 1Section 1Remove 1Add 658.13(d)(1)(i) 658.5(k) 658.5 658.13(d)(2)(i) 658.5(k) 658.5 658.13(e) 658.5(e) 658.5 658.15(b) 658.5(i) 658.5 658.15(c) 658.5(g) 658.5 10. In §658.13, paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) are redesignated as paragraphs (e), (f), and (g), respectively, a new paragraph (d) is added, and new paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(5) are added under redesignated paragraph (e) to read as follows: §658.13 Length. * * * * * (d) No State shall impose a limit of less than 45 feet on the length of any bus on the NN. (e) *␣*␣* (4) Maxi-cube vehicle. No State shall impose a length limit on a maxi-cube vehicle, as defined in §658.5 of this part, of less than 34 feet on either cargo box, excluding drawbar or hitching device; 60 feet on the distance from the front of the first to the rear of the second cargo box, including the space between the cargo boxes; or 65 feet on the overall length of the combination, including the space between the cargo boxes. The measurement for compliance with the 60- and 65-foot distance shall include the actual distance between cargo boxes, measured along the centerline of the drawbar or hitching device. For maxi-cubes with an adjustable length drawbar or hitching device, the 60- and 65-foot distances shall be measured with a drawbar spacing of not more than 27 inches. The drawbar may be temporarily extended beyond that distance to maneuver or load the vehicle. (5) Beverage semitrailer. (i) A beverage semitrailer is specialized equipment if it has an upper coupler plate that extends beyond the front of the semitrailer, but not beyond its swing radius, as measured from the center line of the kingpin to a front corner of the semitrailer, which cannot be used for carrying cargo other than the structure of the semitrailer, and with the center line of the kingpin not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer (exclusive of rear-mounted devices not measured in determining semitrailer length). No State shall impose an overall length limit on such vehicles when operating in a truck tractor-beverage semitrailer or truck tractor-beverage semitrailer-beverage trailer combination on the NN.
