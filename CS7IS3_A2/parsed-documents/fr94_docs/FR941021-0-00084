ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense is revising the Defense FAR Supplement to implement revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;21 (58 FR 39996) that permit predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions to be applicable for a period of up to four years. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Linda W. Neilson, (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background On July 26, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget published revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;21 (58 FR 39996) which include an increase in the period of time for which predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions may be applicable. Pending revision of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to conform the language to the revised OMB Circular, the Defense FAR Supplement is amended to permit use of predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions for periods of up to four years. The Director, Defense Procurement, issued this final DFARS rule by Departmental Letter 94&hyph;018, October 18, 1994, to expedite DoD implementation of this revision. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act DoD certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the rule merely implements OMB Circular A&hyph;21 as it relates to predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this final rule does not impose any new recordkeeping, information collection requirements, or collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
