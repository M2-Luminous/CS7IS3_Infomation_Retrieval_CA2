So, what are the priority aims you are setting yourselves? [Kovalev] The first package of bills the State Duma will adopt urgently concerns the economic sphere of our state's life. What concept are we proceeding from in doing this? Nowhere in the world is there such a thing as a free market, an absolutely free market. Therefore, if we strive for a free market, we are going nowhere -- mankind has long gone elsewhere. There exists a regulated market, and moreover, I am going to utter a word which is not at all popular in our country at the moment -- a market which can be planned. [passage omitted] It is important to overcome the crisis resulting from nonpayments; it is important to restore economic ties that have been severed. If necessary, the question of the composition of enterprises may be raised. [passage omitted] Now about some of our plans in more detail. It happens that the military-industrial complex plays an important role in our country's economy. One can be critical of such an orientation of our economy in the past, but nevertheless this is a fact which we cannot disregard. Therefore, our goal is to rebuild the high technology market and to reestablish our status on the world market. [Perfilyev] Judging by your attitude to economic issues and to how reforms should be carried out, the State Duma should have no problems with the government and with the policy of reform currently being pursued by Viktor Chernomyrdin? [Kovalev] The Russian Federation State Duma will have its own point of view on these issues. As for the new government, we are planning to hear a report of the chairman of the Council of Ministers on this matter. I think this will help to clarify many points and to determine the Duma's standpoint with regard to the present government and to the economic development of the country as a whole. [passage omitted] We also have a number of questions to the government, some of them not too pleasant. One of them concerns privatization. We consider that the issue of privatization should be viewed from a broader angle. [passage omitted] We consider that other forms of reorganization and denationalization are possible. More specifically, a large group of deputies believes that the fixed capital of enterprises could be transferred to work collectives which would be responsible for its operational management, while the products made by those work collectives should certainly be their property and be fully owned and disposable by them. [Perfilyev] Valentin Alekseyevich, many officials in our country have undertaken to fight crime but somehow their attempts have always fallen through. Will the State Duma be able to do anything in this respect? [Kovalev] I can give you my own view on why those laws have never worked. The reason is that they have not been aimed to affect the causes and conditions from which crime springs. [passage omitted] Our viewers should know that issues of fighting crime are in the focus of attention of the State Duma. At this time we are preparing a large package of special proposals aimed at combating corruption and fighting organized crime. Possibly as soon as next Friday we shall discuss a number of amendments and additions to the criminal code. The amendments will include expanding the limits of self-defense [weapons and devices] [Perfilyev] You attend all the sessions and have inside information about the life of the State Duma. Would you like to sketch a collective potrait of the State Duma for our viewers? [Kovalev] The people who have been elected are people who act and not just talk. They know how to work and how to translate their words into deeds. So I think the Duma has very good prospects.
