This is how our interview with Nabil Sha'th began. He is the man who eased relations with Israel, the untiring negotiator of the Gaza and Jericho autonomy, and now the first PLO minister to install himself in the Gaza Strip, with a task about which he himself has strong reservations: laying the foundations upon which to construct "our path toward liberty." [De Giovannangeli] From Cairo to Gaza: What balance can be drawn, on a human and political level, of this "return home?" [Sha'th] I could begin by listing the thousands of problems I must deal with each day, the most varied requests I must deal with. But this statement, however true it may be, does not take account of the heart, of the most intimate of sentiments. In fact, no difficulty may overshadow the happiness felt in returning as a free man to Palestine, the land of my ancestors: No exile, even the most "gilded" one, can be worth the land one has always dreamt of living in, the land one has always fought for. Today Gaza is beginning to breathe in an air of liberty, and this is the starting point upon which to reconstruct. [De Giovannangeli] Is the air of liberty that you refer to also being "breathed" in Jericho? [Sha'th] The issue is much more complex for the West Bank, and in many ways worrying. We run the risk of living in "provisional liberty" subjected to intolerable controls and restrictions. Jericho cannot become a ghetto, surrounded by the Israeli Army, and isolated from the rest of the West Bank. We will discuss this situation over the coming days with the Israeli negotiators. We must immediately face the 26 issues that have remained unresolved: from delimiting the autonomous region of Jericho to completing the liberation of the Palestinian prisoners, and extending the autonomy to the rest of the occupied territories. Not taking sides could seriously damage the peace process. Due to the Israeli attitude, we are two months behind on the second phase of the negotiations. On the other hand, the date of the Israeli withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories has nothing to do with the successful implementation of the accord on autonomy, but forms an integral part of the accord itself, nine months after the signing. Of course, we cannot wait five years to see if the accord works. [De Giovannangeli] You refer to "provisional liberty": Is this a critical observation made only with regard to Israel? [Sha'th] No, unfortunately it is a more general statement that also has to do with the responsibility of the international community. What we have been asking for, especially to the West, ever since the day after the signing of the Washington accords, has been real solidarity. That is, an opportunity to be able to demonstrate to the two million Palestinians living in the territories that peace is not just a signature but a substantial improvement in material living conditions, new employment opportunities, health care, education. [De Giovannangeli] And instead? [Sha'th] Instead we found ourselves in front of an amazing series of conditions placed by the West and by international organizations. Not only is the aid that was foreseen taking a long time to materialize, but it is also tied down to requests for guarantees that are unyielding to the point that they disguise a mistrust in our capability and willingness to use this aid for public needs. We are ready for any checks, but we must first be placed in a condition to work. [De Giovannangeli] What aid are the territories currently most in need of? [Sha'th] I would definitely say financial aid to make the Palestinian police work at full capacity and to start with the construction of basic infrastructures -- roads, the sewage network, health centers -- in Gaza and primarily in the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip. It may seem "unpoetical," but at this moment peace for the Palestinians "means" livable homes, street lights, hospitals with equipment, and factories. To put it in one word, a "respectable" life. Because oppression does not just mean an Israeli soldier. [De Giovannangeli] What is the most demanding challenge facing the Palestinian leadership today? [Sha'th] Working in a kind of "cultural revolution" mentality. We must transform the PLO from a liberation movement to the embryo of a new class of leaders that are capable of building an independent and really autonomous state and not only of opposing military occupation. This gamble invests each one of us. [De Giovannangeli] In your opinion how should the fundamental character of the future Palestinian state be? [Sha'th] It must be a democratic and pluralist state on a political and economic level as well as on a cultural and religious one. In this regard, however, we are not starting from scratch: The history of the Palestinian people, of the PLO itself, has been a history of cohabitation between Muslims and Christians, Marxists and Liberals. We must view the diversities existing within us as a precious common wealth, to be exploited to the utmost, starting with the institutions. I know well that this model of a state is an anomaly in the panorama of the Arab world, and the hostility with which certain regimes have looked at the accords with Israel also arises from an awareness that the Palestinian experience may become an "embarrassing" example for everyone. But this does not worry us, instead it fills us with pride. [De Giovannangeli] How do you judge the willingness demonstrated by Rabin in welcoming the "pilgrim" 'Arafat in Jerusalem? [Sha'th] It is undoubtedly a step forward if compared to the absurd events of former weeks. One thing is certain: 'Arafat will go to pray in the al-Aqsa mosque, and this day is near. Let me add that both Rabin and Peres know very well that discussions on the final status of Jerusalem have simply been postponed and that our objective remains that of making the "Holy City" the capital of the two states.
