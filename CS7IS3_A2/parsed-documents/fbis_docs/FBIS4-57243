Nevertheless, Vargas said this problem must first be solved politically and that the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry has started to take specific actions to this end. "The defense minister visited the area and listened to the local residents' complaints and fears. He told them the Army is prepared to defend them, as it is its responsibility," she said. According to the Army's official version, the problem is that there is no definite border between Guatemala and Belize. This has not led to an armed confrontation between the two armies, however, the source said. Maj. Vargas reported that the Guatemalan and Belizean troops stationed along the border area hold "peaceful" relations and avoid incidents. It has been reported from Peten that combined British and Belizean troops continue to harass and intimidate hundreds of peasant families living in the area. The source added that these two armies have used sophisticated equipment, such as the Harrier plane, specially designed for heavy fighting. On Tuesday, the peasants intimidated by these actions presented to the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office a petition reporting that foreign troops had entered their communities to evict them and seize their property. Sebastian Tux, leader of the affected communities, told this newspaper that Belizean soldiers arrived at their homes and ordered them to leave because the territory belonged to Belize.
