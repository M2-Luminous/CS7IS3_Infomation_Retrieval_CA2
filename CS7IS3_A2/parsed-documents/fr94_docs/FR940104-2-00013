SUMMARY: On September 21, 1993, President Clinton signed the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, that merged the Commission on National and Community Service, ACTION, and the newly established Civilian Community Corps, to create the Corporation for National and Community Service. The Corporation is presenting a series of regional workshops in Washington, DC, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, to provide application assistance to organizations applying for national and community service program grants. Functioning as a service ``venture capitalist'', the Corporation will provide funding on a population-based formula and competitive basis for national and community service programs, and as a clearinghouse of information and technical expertise for service initiatives nationwide. To encourage broad participation in national service, the Corporation is conducting this series of workshops to support the application of high quality, national service programs and service-learning K&hyph;12 and higher education programs. Approximately $189 million will be available to these programs, to assist in the planning, operating and replicating of national and community service programs. The primary audience for these workshops will be those applying directly to the Corporation, including State Commissions or alternative entities, State educational agencies, higher education institutions, Indian Tribes, territories, Federal agencies, professional corps, national nonprofits, and multi-State organizations. State Commissions will be responsible for providing technical assistance to local applicants applying to their States. In addition, those local nonprofits organizations, government agencies, Indian Tribes, and higher education institutions interested in applying for Summer of Safety should attend. For those who are unable to attend the workshops, the corporation will be sponsoring other assistance programs, including tele/video-conferences and printed material.
