They cordially held a forum with Fang Zuqi, political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, and other leading comrades in which they happily reviewed the Army's friendship with the government and the people and jointly discussed matters of vital importance on double-support work. During the forum, Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju first extended New Year's greetings to the leaders of the Nanjing Military Region on behalf of the Shanghai municipal party committee, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the people of Shanghai. They also extended season's greetings to all commanders and fighters in the military region. After giving a briefing on economic construction and spiritual civilization in Shanghai Municipality, Comrade Wu Bangguo said: Under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the people of Shanghai have proceeded simultaneously in economic construction and spiritual civilization in accordance with the party Central Committee's directive on carrying out both tasks simultaneously and paying equal attention to both. They have made every effort to ensure success in both tasks. Troops in the Nanjing Military Region, especially those stationed in Shanghai, have contributed tremendously to promoting the two civilizations. Last year, the Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government launched commemorative activities on the 30th anniversary of the naming of the "Good 8th Company on Nanjing Road," viewing such activities as an important measure for promoting socialist spiritual civilization. Such activities played an excellent role in inspiring a hard-working spirit among the people of Shanghai and in advancing the two civilizations. Partly because of soldiers' contributions, Shanghai has made fairly rapid progress in economic construction and spiritual civilization over the past two years. Just as the song "The Moon on the 15th of the Lunar Month" goes, your feats take up half the chapter of military exploits. On behalf of the Shanghai municipal party committee, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the people of Shanghai, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the commanders and fighters in the Nanjing Military Region. Comrade Huang Ju said: Army units have supported the most difficult tasks during the most difficult periods in Shanghai's economic construction. Commanders and fighters were among those undertaking difficult tasks, such as blowing up the dam in the Taipu He to release the water, expanding the Yanggao Road, and building the Yangpu and Nanpu Bridges. Shanghai Municipality has a fine double-support tradition, which we should inherit and carry forward in the interest of greater unity between the Army and the government and between the Army and the people. On behalf of party committees, government departments, and all commanders and fighters in the Nanjing Military Region, Comrade Fang Zuqi expressed heartfelt thanks to the leaders of the Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government, as well as to all people in Shanghai, for their concern and support for Army building. He said: It was very heartening to see Comrades Xiaoping and Chen Yun in very good health [fei chang jian kang 7236 1603 0256 1660] on the television newscast featuring Shanghai municipal party and government leaders offering New Year's greetings to them. On behalf of commanders and fighters in the entire military region, please extend our regards to Comrades Xiaoping and Chen Yun and wish them long lives. This is the greatest wish of the vast numbers of commanders and fighters. Comrade Xiaoping spoke highly of Shanghai's work, and we were very glad to hear that. Shanghai Municipality has not only developed rapidly in the economic field but has also made phenomenal gains in double-support work. National defense education has been legislated in Shanghai. Activities launched by Comrade Jiang Zemin while he worked in Shanghai to encourage leading cadres to "spend a day in military barracks" have not only been institutionalized but have also expanded to include entrepreneurs, teachers, students, non-CPC people, and the broad masses. These activities have become an important means for conducting mass education on national defense. Shanghai Municipality has actively taken various measures to solve practical problems and render practical service to troops, such as resettling demobilized and retired soldiers, helping military dependents settle down and seek jobs, helping soldiers' children enroll in kindergartens and schools, assisting troops in training dual-purpose personnel, and improving logistical operations. It has done a great deal of useful work in this respect. Improved double-support work has greatly benefited military units. We are keenly aware that difficulties, however formidable, will not unnerve us, given the party's correct leadership, the worthy masses, and the Army's good relationship with the government and the people. It is the sacred duty of the People's Army to defend and build the motherland. We are duty-bound to carry out the large-scale construction of Shanghai. From now on, we should continue to do more work, and the Army and the people should work together to further defend Shanghai and carry out the large-scale construction of Shanghai. Leaders from the Nanjing Military Region, Shanghai Municipality, and relevant departments attending the forum included Yan Zhuo, Xie Decai, Wang Yongming, Lan Baojing, Chen Bingde, Wang Tongzhuo, Wang Chuanwu [3769 0278 2976], Sui Shengwu, Xu Wenyi, and Zhou Yupeng. Prior to the forum, Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, and other leading comrades from Shanghai Municipality braved the rain to call on veteran comrades in the Nanjing Military Region, such as Comrades Du Ping, Xiang Shouzhi, Fu Kuiqing, and Liu Anyuan, in the company of Lan Baojing, deputy political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region. They extended New Year's greetings to the veteran comrades, wishing them good health, long lives, and a happy New Year.
