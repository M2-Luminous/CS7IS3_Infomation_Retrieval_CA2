This is entirely unreasonable. This is a wanton violation of the sovereignty and dignity of our Republic and an unpardonable strong-arm act to stifle our socialism. The U.S. House of Representatives also carried a "resolution" urging the readjustment of the schedule of the "Team Spirit" joint military manoeuvres this year and "strengthening of the combat power" of the South Korean puppet army. This revealed again the sinister intention of the United States to contain the DPRK by force of arms. This can be easily judged from the facts that Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, blared that "the United States does not rule out military sanctions against North Korea" in a hearing at the subcommittee of Asian and Pacific affairs of the U.S. House of Representatives on the 9th of June and Hamilton, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, next day said the U.S. had no other option but to fight and that it was necessary to increase the potentials of the U.S. troops in South Korea and the puppet armed forces. If the United States chooses a reckless adventure, ignoring our repeated warnings, we will take a decisive self-defensive measure. The United States must clearly see our unshakable will and resolution and immediately stop the adventurous war provocation moves.
