In this respect, we must clearly see that the Serbian side is definitely not the one that harbors any interest in prolonging the crisis and even less in complicating and deteriorating it further by producing such horrendous pictures of war. The perpetrators should be sought among those who have been, even so far, staunch opponents of the peace process or the factors that on several occasions did everything they could to postpone, prolong, or thwart this process. In any case, the investigation, which we expect to be meticulous and objective, should establish not merely the physical executor, but also the side that was behind the executor, that appears as the chief obstruction to the progress toward peace. Understandably, all this could have been avoided and we would not have needed to watch all these pictures of war -- neither the less bloody ones nor these most horrific ones -- had the peace that was so readily on offer for acceptance in Geneva been accepted wholeheartedly by those who care about peace. [Colovic] Mr. Minister, can this event influence, and to what extent, the ways of the further resolution of the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and also on the territories of former Yugoslavia? [Jovanovic] You see, with its drama and dimensions, this horrendous crime can be misused by the opponents of peace to further endanger the peace process and justify the policy of force, that is to say, the war option as the only way out of this situation. On the other hand this terrible accident can act as a last warning to all who have maintained a reasonable approach toward the Bosnian crisis, namely, that the postponement of peace is no longer counterproductive, but also criminal, and that we must concentrate on the peace process and bring it to an end in one or two swipes. I hope, we hope, that the voices of sobriety and responsibility will prevail and that this accident will, at the same time, be the last large-scale accident in this war and that a lesson will be learned from all this that will expedite the peace process and bring it to a finale as soon as possible.
