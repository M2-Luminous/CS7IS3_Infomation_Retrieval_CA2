"As the world has changed dramatically after the collapse of the Cold War structure, our country's handling of defense and security must change as well," Hosokawa said in welcoming the nine panel members. He called on the group to discuss new defense policies "from a stance that takes into account the changed international situation, technological progress and economic and human resources." The panel is expected to put forward recommendations until July for a revision of the national defense program outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976. The program calls for the government to maintain security arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale invasion. Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies, including Japan's future role in United Nations-led peacekeeping operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the defense agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995. The panel groups Kuniko Inoguchi, a Sophia University professor, Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador to the United States, Bank of Tokyo Chairman Toyoo Gyohten, and Makoto Sakuma, former chairman of the Joint Staff Council. The other members are Seiki Nishihiro, former vice minister for the Defense Agency, Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of ASAHI Breweries Ltd., Shinji Fukukawa, vice president of Kobe Steel Ltd., Ken Moroi, chairman of Chichibu Cement Co., and Akio Watanabe, an Aoyama Gakuin University professor.
