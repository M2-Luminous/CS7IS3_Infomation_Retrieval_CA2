In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Baltin's spokesman Andrey Grachev said the commander hopes that President Boris Yeltsin and President Leonid Kravchuk will solve the problem soon and find the only correct decision reflecting the military, political and economic possibilities of the two countries. Baltin believes that the dependence of military and political tasks on the economic situation is crucial for solving the Black Sea Fleet problem. Russia and Ukraine have no big disagreements, while those that exist can be solved by political means, the spokesman quoted Baltin as saying. The fleet commander considers himself subordinated to both presidents and agrees all his decisions with them, Grachev continued. He voiced concern about unilateral decisions concerning the Black Sea Fleet by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, stressing that the Russian side remains adherent to the Massandra Agreements which must be observed. Commenting on Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's proposal to Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Crimea, Grachev said that should such a decision appear, the Black Sea Fleet commanders will provide Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol with firm guarantees of the security of their southern frontiers.
