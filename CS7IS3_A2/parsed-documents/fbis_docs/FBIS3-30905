Let us hear what Vuk Draskovic stated to POLITIKA Television after the meeting with President Milosevic: [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] You were with President Milosevic. Can you tell us what you discussed? [Draskovic] We discussed the reasons for the delay in the formation of the parliament, which is a peculiar form of obstruction. I informed the president of the fact that this obstruction cannot be overcome without a political agreement. To the president's words that he favored a government of national unity, I replied that, regarding the SPO and DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia], we want more than that; national unity. However, in this, the SPO, naturally, wishes to carry some of the responsibility for the atmosphere in the parliamentary life of the country -- Serbia and the federal state. Regarding government, we do not wish to take part in any government, be it republican or federal, and this was my stance. [end recording]
