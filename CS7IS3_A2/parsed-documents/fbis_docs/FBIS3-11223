The objective is to join forces against drug trafficking along the Amazon border region and get Brazil off the UN list of countries used as transit routes by drug cocaine. Brazilian Federal Police Superintendent Mauro Sposito has said the strategy of Operation Blockade was discussed with Venezuelan, Peruvian, Colombian, and Bolivian military leaders during the Sixth Military Exchange meeting last week. So far only Brazil and Venezuela have formally agreed to participate. These two countries are at the start of the cocaine route that begins in Colombia and ends in the United State and Europe. The Colombian Army could lend its support to this project. Sposito said this will be essential if the operation is to be successful. Operation Blockade will be conducted on four fronts. First, Tabatinga and Manaus river police patrols will intercept the cocaine that is shipped by the Amazon River. Second, enforcement actions in Colombia will be monitored. Third, flights of aircraft will be placed under surveillance: With the help of the Air Force, the Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, ESSO, and Shell, the Federal Police will control the air space thus repressing traffickers who move cocaine by air. The fourth front has been in action since November: Radio frequencies used by drug traffickers are being monitored from Tabatinga and Tefe. This led to the arrest of two drug bosses in Belem.
