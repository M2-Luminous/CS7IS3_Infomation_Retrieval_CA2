After attending commemorative activities in Zhengzhou and Lankao on the 30th anniversary of Comrade Jiao Yulu's death, Hu Jintao, accompanied by Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee, inspected some villages in eastern and northern Henan from 14-18 May. He visited some village and town enterprises, as well as some peasant households, and was very pleased to witness rapid economic development, remarkable improvements in peasants' lives, and strong motivation among cadres and people there. In Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, and Zhengzhou, Hu Jintao held informal discussions with responsible persons from city, county, township (town), and village party organizations, during which they studied ways to strengthen and improve party building, especially the construction of primary party organizations in rural areas. During his cordial conversations with grass-roots cadres and people, some peasants remarked that "we are quite satisfied with our lives now," upon which he said admonishingly: "While it is good to be satisfied, you should not be complacent. Do not neglect hard work, thrift, and arduous struggle after you have become better off. Although the economy has developed, you should keep breaking new ground and aim for an even higher level of development." Upon hearing peasants' complimentary remarks that "the party's policies and leadership are good," he said: "Given the party Central Committee's good policies and sound grass-roots bodies, coupled with concerted efforts by all to achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living, there is great hope for building a new socialist countryside." During his informal discussions with local and grass-roots leading comrades, Hu Jintao pointed out: The situation across the country is now favorable as both the leadership and the rank and file of the entire party are accelerating the pace of building a socialist market economic structure in accordance with the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The situation in Henan is also favorable. A decade of practice, as well as some advanced typical experiences which we have come across over the past few days, fully attest to the fact that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- including his thinking that it is imperative to uphold and improve the party's leadership, as well as to strengthen and improve party building, in carrying out socialist modernization -- is entirely correct. During our current efforts to further consolidate and improve on the favorable situation, deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability, we should also rely on the party's correct leadership, as well as on the efforts by party organizations at all levels and the broad ranks of CPC members to unify and rally people so that the party's correct policy decisions will be translated into conscientious popular actions. The party holds the key to maintaining its basic line for 100 years without wavering; it also holds the key to deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability in accordance with the demands of the basic line. Success in party building will provide a fundamental guarantee for success in the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Hu Jintao noted: Building up the party in strict accordance with its basic line is a fundamental experience in this respect during the new period. To apply this experience, we should now strengthen all facets of party building, improve the standards of governance and leadership, and heighten the rallying power, appeal, and fighting skills of party organizations at all levels, while closely linking these efforts with the way we deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability in practice. In building up the party, we should take overall interests into account, submit to and serve overall interests, improve party building by maintaining and promoting overall interests, and consolidate and expand overall interests by strengthening party building. On strengthening and improving primary party organizations in rural areas, Hu Jintao said: Primary party organizations in rural areas should rally and lead peasants and people toward a fairly comfortable standard of living, vigorously develop the rural economy, enrich the collective sector of the economy, encourage hard work as a way to prosper, follow the path of common prosperity, develop the "two civilizations," and build a new socialist countryside, taking these efforts as their own fundamental tasks. The key to accomplishing these tasks lies in building up the leadership bodies and in selecting qualified leaders. With good leaders, we can unify a group of people who, in turn, can spur on all villagers; we can also constantly open up new avenues, and bring rapid changes to the less developed villages. We should show concern for and cherish village cadres, inspire their initiative, and support and protect hard-working comrades. Particular efforts should be made to step up the training of township and village cadres in accordance with local conditions, so as to improve their quality in an all-around manner. In light of the realities in rural areas, we should institute an incentive-based mechanism by which qualified personnel of remarkable caliber at the grass-roots level will show their talent and perform meritorious services. We should take effective measures to ensure a steady source of village cadres to replenish the existing pool. We should devote major efforts to cultivating active elements and recruiting party members from among outstanding youths at the forefront of production in rural areas, so as to expand the unduly small ranks of young party members in the countryside. In keeping with the new situation brought on by changes in rural development, we should make timely and reasonable adjustments to the way we establish primary party organizations, actively explore an effective means to establish various village-level organizations as part of a complete network with party branches as the core, and promote the experience of "setting up organizations in accordance with the law, administering villages on the basis of established organizations, and exercising democratic management," so as to gradually institutionalize and standardize the work of various village-level organizations. In closing, Hu Jintao said emphatically: We should earnestly strengthen and improve our leadership over primary organizations in rural areas. Both the party Central Committee and party committees at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels should devote themselves to building up primary organizations in rural areas. County (city) party committees should all the more carry out this task unremittingly and effectively. Accompanying Hu Jintao during his inspection tour were Zeng Qinghong, director of the CPC Central Committee's General Office, and Zheng Keyang, deputy director of the CPC Central Committee's Central Policy Research Office.
