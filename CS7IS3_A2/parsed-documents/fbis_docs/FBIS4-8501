It would certainly be interesting to talk with him about a wide range of problems in our foreign policy, but, during our short meeting, we limited ourselves to the most topical problems connected with his assuming the office of foreign minister. The new government, as you said, is considering dealing with our relations with our main neighbors, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The government believes it is our main task. [Kukan] Of course, our relations with the Czech Republic are being built now. To normalize them--in which we are interested, as is the Czech side, I believe--we have to sort our problems that have remained open. When we start again with a clean sheet, so to speak, our situation will be easier. I am not going to speak about details, but you know that the problem of gold and other issues is involved, as is quite well known. We are conducting complicated and difficult negotiations, and it is our concern not to damage Slovakia's interests. We will not be able to sort out many of the problems within six months, but we do not want to wait. We must devote our full time to them. Both successor countries to the former CSFR must learn how to live in the new situation and adjust to it because there are historical links and interests, in my opinion. The real situation will force us to cooperate in the future. But then, our cooperation will have a new quality, based on the decisions of both countries. [Horsky] As regards our relations with Hungary, the chief of Slovak diplomacy confirmed that he wants to create a peaceful atmosphere without emotion, which is needed to keep the dialogue running. [Kukan] We would be happy if there were a similar reaction in Hungary. We expect no miracles because our relations are complicated and burdened by the past, but there are things we can solve within six months. They are contained in the government policy statement. The most important thing is that we do not want to lose communications with Hungary. [Horsky] When asked whether there is a real possibility for a treaty on good-neighborly relations being concluded with Hungary, or at least its principles, Kukan provided a diplomatic response. [Kukan] I do not see it as unrealistic. I do not mean the treaty itself. Regarding these principles, there is such a possibility. [Horsky] The second problem of our foreign policy is that we want to integrate into Western political and economic structures. In this connection, we are interested in what you are going to discuss tomorrow with [U.S.] Deputy Secretary of State for Eastern Europe Talbott. [Kukan] As you know, Mr. Talbott is very close to President Clinton. They studied together and have personal contacts. This is not the only reason we believe his visit is so extremely important. His visit is a certain signal in the situation that has arisen in Slovakia. According to our information, he wants to explain to us thoroughly and analytically the current position of the United States toward the countries of Central and East Europe because it has recently changed slightly after being criticized. On the other hand, he will certainly listen to our opinions on our integration into Western structures. Apart from this, he will be interested in the development of the economic situation in Slovakia and in conditions for the arrival of entrepreneurs from the United States and the influx of U.S. capital. These two issues are his priorities. [Horsky] But the United States is only one of the NATO pillars, albeit the stronger one. What will the situation look like with respect to the European Union [EU] and its military component, the Western European Union [WEU]? [Kukan] In the political sphere, we are interested in EU membership. Our association treaty has been ratified by two countries, and our task is to have the other EU countries do the same so that we might do the same thing that Hungary and Poland did on Friday [8 April]--submit an application for EU membership. [Horsky] As regards security matters, Minister Kukan said: Our signature on the Partnership for Peace plan is a step toward full membership in NATO. Only reality will show us how this mechanism will function. As far as the WEU is concerned, we are interested in permanent observer status.
