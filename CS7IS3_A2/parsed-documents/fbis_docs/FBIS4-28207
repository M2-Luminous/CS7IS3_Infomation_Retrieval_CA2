In another report on cargo loading and unloading at Phnom Penh port, the paper cites a port official as saying that after the government implemented its policy of a market-oriented economy, the work in the 1993-94 period has improved. He added that due to a protracted war and since security has not yet been thoroughly ensured, the present volume of goods passing through the port is only 2 to 3 percent of the total 6,184,000 tons in the 1960-70 period. The amount of goods loaded and unloaded at the port between 1979 and 1993 is 1,870,503 tons.
