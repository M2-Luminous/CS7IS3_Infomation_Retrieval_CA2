He said Japan and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to get the deadlocked framework talks back on track because both sides shared the view that it is undesirable to keep tense economic and trade relations "drifting" since that would hurt overall bilateral relations. Tokyo and Washington also reached the accord because it deepened understanding about each other's positions on the trade negotiations, he said. Kuriyama said the greatest problem regarding economic and trade relations between Japan and the U.S. is that there is a lack of mutual trust. Japan fears the U.S. will try to apply numerical targets to measure the openness of Japan's market and threaten sanctions if that target is not met, while the U.S. mistrusts Japan as a country always vowing to do something and then not, he said. Opinion polls in both countries also show that trust and respect toward each others' nations are waning, Kuriyama said, attributing the reason to the failure of the framework negotiations in February. The trade framework talks is aimed at boosting mutual understanding, he said. Kuriyama, who is in Japan from Monday through Saturday, said he carried a message to Emperor Akihito from U.S. President Bill Clinton welcoming the imperial visit to the U.S. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko are scheduled to visit the U.S. from June 10 to 25. Touching on concerns abroad that Japan may come to possess nuclear weapons, Kuriyama said he tries to sweep away such concern by explaining Japan's nonnuclear position and the Japanese people's feeling on the matter. The ambassador said it is impossible for Japan to possess nuclear weapons because an overwhelming majority of the people are against it and because Japan is a member of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and, therefore, has an international obligation not to possess nuclear weapons. Also, not a single country among Japan's neighbors support Japan possessing nuclear weapons, he said.
