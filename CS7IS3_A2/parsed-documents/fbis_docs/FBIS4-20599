At the National Aerospace Laboratory, various types of scramjet tests have been conducted for 5 years. Of these, the tests involving air intake and compression have been focused on aerodynamic characteristics research. This research was a study of scramjet startup characteristics at minimum operation. Figure 1 shows the shape of the air intake model. Shape parameters that determine the aerodynamic characteristics are represented by side wall leading edge inclination (_a_) and contraction ratio (CR). These two parameters were incrementally changed to seek startup boundaries, and along with this, aerodynamic characteristics in the startup/non-startup transition zone were investigated. Figure 1: Air Intake Model The experiments were conducted in a mach 4 blow-down tunnel at the Kakuda laboratory. For the experiments, 30 models with different shapes were prepared and inflow boundary layer thickness was varied by attaching them either to a flat plate in the wind tunnel (Case A) or directly to the wind tunnel wall (Case B). Boundary layer thickness was about 1/8 of model height in Case A, and about 1/2 of model height in Case B. Wall pressure and pitot pressure measurements were taken to reveal aerodynamic characteristics. Also, to make flow composition visible, schlieren observation was used for inside the air intake and oil flow was used for the surface flow. Figure 2 is a schlieren photograph of the flow at the time of startup/non-startup. Oblique shock waves which can be clearly confirmed at startup time become blurred at non-startup time as they face the lower flow. This is because the separation shock waves that are generated on the ceiling wall at non-startup time substantially change the internal part of the flow. Figure 3 shows how this looks when observed by the oil flow method. In this figure, Line A corresponds to where the oblique shock waves created by the sidewall are reflected and Line B corresponds to a new separation line which the separation shock waves create on the side wall surface. As the CR increases, Line B gradually moves from the inner part of the air intake to the upper flow, and finally moves in front of the air intake. Figure 2: Model Internal Schlieren Photograph Figure 3: Oil Flow Photographs of Side Wall In this manner, changes in the shape of the air intake side wall change the separative state of the ceiling boundary layer, and when this happens, the separation shock waves change the flow in the internal part of the air intake. The transition of this flow follows changes in the location of separation shock waves and, in the case of the axisymmetric air intake, it is impossible to fully observe the startup state with just the flow speed in the throat section, the narrowest part of the flow path. Therefore, the startup characteristic of each air intake was evaluated by using two criteria for grouping, as shown in Figure 4. One is grouping by location of separation shock waves. At startup time, the separation shock waves are near the throat (circles in the figure). They moves to the forward edge of the air intake (triangles in the figure), and finally jump out in front of the intake (squares in the figure). Aerodynamic performance (total pressure recovery rate, captured flow volume rate, etc.) gets worse as the separation shock waves move, but throat flow speed does not necessarily become subsonic. The other grouping is simply when the average flow speed in the throat is above (unfilled shapes in the figure) and below (filled shapes) the speed of sound. In terms of the role of transmitting the supersonic flow to the combustor, the states represented by solid triangles and squares in the figure can be said to be fully non-startup. Figure 4: Startup State Groupings As seen in Figure 4, startup generally is difficult toward the advance angle, which tells us that startup is difficult when CR is high. The model with leading edge angle of almost 0ï¿½ and high CR in particular can be easily shifted to a completely non-startup state. Moreover, when compared to Case B, which has a thick boundary layer, Case A has a broad full startup zone, but it has a narrow transition zone, and changes in shape cause rapid change in state. Incidentally, total pressure recovery rate (ratio of total pressure in main flow and average pressure in throat) at startup is 40 - 70% for Case A, but it is 20 - 45% for Case B because of strong influence of the boundary layer, which has low total pressure. In the future, studies will be done on air intake shapes that will, in accordance with the needs of the combustor, achieve prescribed pressure increases at the throat surface while suppressing ceiling wall separation. These tests were conducted as part of joint research with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
