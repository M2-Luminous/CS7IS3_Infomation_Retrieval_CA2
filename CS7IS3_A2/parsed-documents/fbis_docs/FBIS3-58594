This is the end of the message sent by the head of state to Giovanni Spadolini [speaker of the Senate], and to Giorgio Napolitano [speaker of the Chamber of Deputies], along with the decree dissolving the Chambers. "Unmistakable facts made it necessary to dissolve the Chambers," the president wrote. Scalfaro mentioned in particular the referendum of 18 April 1993, when an overwhelming majority of voters demanded new [electoral] rules, and the 1993 administrative elections, which showed there had been deep changes in relations among parties.
