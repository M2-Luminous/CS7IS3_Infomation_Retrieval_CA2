Homeland defence chief Maj-Gen H S Turner branded as "cheap propanga" a CITY PRESS newspaper report on Sunday saying a 22-man detachment of MK members had been formed in Bophuthatswana. The members, some of whom were allegedly involved in the abortive 1988 military coup to topple President Lucas Mangope, had defected from the homeland's army. The "Bop Platoon" was introduced during the ANC army's 32nd anniversary celebrations in Krugersdorp recently. MK's western Transvaal Chief of Staff Kagiso Ramatlhoko said the group had undergone military training under the auspices of MK. He told CITY PRESS the unit was based in the homeland, but he declined to disclose its location for security reasons. Gen Turner dismissed the report as a "sham story". "The Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] rejects allegations concerning the so-called defection of BDF members to the MK," he said. "The BDF considers the allegations cheap propaganda...It is again emphasised that MK activities in any form will not be tolerated in Bophuthatswana."
