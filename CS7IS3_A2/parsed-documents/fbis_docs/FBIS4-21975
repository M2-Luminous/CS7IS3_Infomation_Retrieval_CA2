Office workers come to work, answer phones, and operate the office as before. In a telephone conversation with the Hamas office, Muhammad Nazzal, head of the movement, said that the office exists and is operational, "but unfortunately, I cannot make comments to your newspaper because it is our policy not to speak with Israeli elements." Jordanian sources in Amman have reported that the king's decision regarding Hamas has remained unchanged but, as far as they know, no practical steps to restrict the movement's activity have been taken so far. According to them, the heads of the movement were summoned for a discussion with the heads of the Jordanian intelligence who asked that Hamas media activity be reduced.
