The British side Thursday unilaterally published a White Paper entitled "Representative Government in Hong Kong", to disclose the contents of 17 rounds of the Sino-British talks held last year, despite of an understanding it reached with China not to disclose to the public the contents of the negotiations. The daily newspaper "TA KUNG PAO" in an editorial said that "the White Paper was designed to deceive the public to believe that the controversy between the two sides is concentrated on the development of democracy in Hong Kong." However, the editorial said, the essence of the Sino-British controversy doesn't lie in whether or not there should be democracy in Hong Kong but in whether the agreements and understanding already reached between the two sides should be honored. Although the White Paper is compiled by the British side according to its needs, it can be seen clearly between the lines that the British side failed to confirm the principles set in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and understandings and agreements reached between China and Britain. The British side had agreed that the Sino-British talks on the arrangements of Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections should be conducted on the basis of these documents, understandings and agreements, the editorial noted. Another newspaper "WEN WEI PO" said in its editorial "A Complete Fraud" that in the White Paper, the British side tried to cover what it has done in undermining the Sino-British talks and escaping from the historic responsibility it should bear. Recalling the political development on the Hong Kong issue over the past few years especially since Patten took office as the governor in 1992, the editorial said, "what the British side has done is nothing but a complete fraud." "HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY" in a commentary said that as the foundation for Sino-British cooperations on the Hong Kong issue has been seriously undermined, adverse impact is inevitable in political, economic and other fields. For example, it said, the Hong Kong stock market suffered a sharp drop as a result of Patten's announcement to publish the White Paper and push ahead with his reform package on Thursday.
