The Lewis and Clark Forest Plan provides direction for the use of stipulations to be attached to leases in order to comply with Forest Plan goals and objectives. As outlined in the Forest Plan, no-surface occupancy (NSO) is recommended for lands where oil and gas development could conflict with riparian values, wetlands and floodplains, as well as on slopes greater than 60%. The Forest Plan calls for no-surface occupancy to protect existing uses such as powerlines, irrigation canals, and cemeteries, and developed recreation sites, as well as the area above Gibson Dam on the Sun River. Areas identified in the Forest Plan as Research Natural Areas also require the NSO stipulation. The Ford Creek Plateau area on the Rocky Mountain Division would be available only for no-surface occupancy leasing for the first decade of the Forest Plan. The Plan also identifies areas for which timing restrictions on activity would be stipulated to protect resource values such as threatened and endangered species habitat, sensitive species habitat, big game seasonal ranges, and raptor nest sites. NSO is recommended in areas where more than one key wildlife habitat is present and the combined seasons of use leaves no opportunity for oil and gas occupancy. In addition, the Lewis and Clark Forest Plan identifies resource concerns requiring special operating constraints, such as landtypes susceptible to moderate-severe cut-bank failure potential, semi-primitive recreation areas, Experimental Forests, and municipal watersheds. A stipulation controlling surface use would be applied to leases with these resource concerns. Under the Forest Plan, stream segments eligible for ``wild'' status under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 will not be offered for lease. Most of these stream segments are within existing wilderness areas, but on those segments outside of designated wilderness on Forest, lands unavailable for lease include areas within 1/4 mile either side of segments of the South Fork of the Sun River, the Dearborn River, and North Fork Birch Creek. Public participation will be important to the analysis. Part of the goal of public involvement is to identify additional issues and to refine the preliminary issues identified above. People may visit with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. However, two periods are specifically designated for comments on the analysis: (1) During the scoping process and (2) during the Draft EIS (DEIS) comment period. During the scoping process, the Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. A scoping document will be prepared and mailed to parties known to be interested in the proposed action by February 25, 1994. The agency invites written comments and suggestions on this action, particularly in terms of identification of issues and alternative development. In addition, public open houses will be held during the scoping period: on Monday, February 28 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Kings Hill Ranger District Office in White Sulphur Springs, MT; on Wednesday, March 2, from 6 p.m. until 9 p.m. at the Great Falls Civic Center in Great Falls, MT; on Monday, March 14, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Holiday Inn in Missoula, MT; on Tuesday, March 16, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Little Flower Parish in Browning, MT; and on Wednesday, March 17, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Choteau Public Library in Choteau, MT. In addition to the proposed action, a range of alternatives will be developed in response to issues identified during scoping. This includes the no-action alternatives required by NEPA in which no leasing would be authorized at this time. The Forest Service will analyze and document the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of all alternatives. Stipulations will be developed to mitigate effects and protect other resources, and the effectiveness of those stipulations will be assessed.
