[De Posadas] Last year we forecast a decline in our trade balance deficit. We assumed imports would level off because our country cannot continue this rampant buying spree abroad. Capital goods and durable goods are not imported forever. We calculated that the trade balance deficit would level off through a reduction of imports. We are now seeing an increase in exports, especially to the Brazilian market. We are seeing price increases in some products like rice, wool, and meat. Rice prices have increased substantially, wool prices have increased slightly, and there is a good market for meat. Exports to Brazil increased about 30 percent last year and it is believed that the current stabilization program will cause price adjustments in Brazil and increased trade. [Vilas] The latest published government management results show an exponential increase in government spending, which has gone up by 25 percent. How does the government view this? [De Posadas] Last year's investments have been carried over to this year. Current expenditures have not increased; investments account for most of government's expenditures and we have already set a ceiling on them. Moreover, tax collections exceeded original estimates by nearly $11 million. [Vilas] How can the government fix investment levels? [De Posadas] We are working on a decree to fix government investments. We have again spoken with executive board members from public enterprises urging them to adjust their investments to what has been budgeted. The total amount that the central government and public companies will save totals some $150 million. And yet, this year's investment levels will be higher than last year's, which in turn exceeded benchmark levels. We have to undertake this to ease the pressure off accrued expenditures, which have a bearing on the entire economy. [Vilas] The United States has increased its interest rates to stave off inflation. Argentina has followed suit to prevent the loss of international reserves. Is Uruguay contemplating increasing interest rates to help its fight against inflation? [De Posadas] It is unfeasible to set interest rates in a country the size of Uruguay. Besides, we have a very open market with a considerable inflow of capital to date. What do we stand to gain by increasing interest rates? Nothing. What is the use of increasing interest rates for transactions in pesos? It will only make investors turn to the peso in droves. They will sell dollars; thus exerting more pressure on the exchange rate and triggering an increase in reserves. It is not worth it. [Vilas] Is there a project to place Uruguayan debt bonds on other markets, like Japan for example? [De Posadas] We are studying that possibility. We must follow a similar line of reasoning as before. Given Japanese interest rates, we must assess if it is really worthwhile. We pay very low interest rates. The degree of acceptance or trust in Uruguayan securities is very high. It would be attractive, though, to gain a foothold in another market. [Vilas] Industry Minister Eduardo Ache proposed a debt-for-investment swap in order to attract capital. How does the Economy Ministry view this initiative? [De Posadas] He had that idea. I have not seen any concrete project on it. The subject should be carefully considered because it has a very high cost for our country and we must analyze if it is cost-effective.
