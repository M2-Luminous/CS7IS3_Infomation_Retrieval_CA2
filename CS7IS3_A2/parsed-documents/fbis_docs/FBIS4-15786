As always, the enemy again used the talks on a temporary cease-fire to revive its spent forces, and by misleading the international community it greatly strengthened its troops for a new round of offensives. Employing some 2,000 troops and armored cars, the Armenians launched an attack against Gulistan in Geranboyskiy [Shaumyanovskiy] Rayon and Talish [in northeast of Mardakertskiy Rayon] yesterday morning. The enemy temporarily gained the initiative in certain places during the battles. Following a fierce artillery barrage today, the Armenian infantry troops launched an attack against our army's positions along the Terter-Agdam line at 0630. According to reports, the battles are continuing. The border settlements in our republic's Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy Rayons came under artillery shelling today from the military bases in the Armenian Republic.
