The Central Bank of Nicaragua announced that annual accumulated inflation reached 10.58 percent during the last 12 months and that the cordoba had fallen 6.55 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar. According to the Central Bank, the aforementioned levels are in accordance with monetary adjustment policies applied by Violeta Chamorro's administration to control inflation, which reached 55,000 percent in 1990, the highest in the world. In January 1993, Nicaragua's economic authority decided to implement a 20.34-percent "macrodevaluation" of the cordoba and establish a 1 percent monthly fluctuation mechanism. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2105 GMT 15 Feb 94) Oscar Aleman, director of the Foreign Trade department of the Economic and Development Ministry (MEDE), announced that Nicaragua had decided to stop granting licenses for the importation of Costa Rican dairy, canned, and grain products until that country decides to lift its import restrictions on similar items from Nicaragua. Aleman said the decision does not constitute a trade war but is a "tit for tat" situation because while Nicaragua allowed the unrestricted entry of Costa Rican goods, that country did the opposite. The foreign trade director added that before making the decision, the economy minister had contacted his Costa Rican counterpart and requested unrestricted passage for Nicaraguan goods. The Costa Rican minister explained that the call for restrictions was made by the private sector for reasons of competition. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 16 Feb 94 p 1, 8)
