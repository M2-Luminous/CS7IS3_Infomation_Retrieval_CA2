What do you have in mind exactly? [Dhlakama] We are experiencing a very serious problem. Although it is I alone, as leader of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], who is raising this question, I think that the Mozambican people and other opposition leaders support my view because it is right. In August last year, I drew up a small blueprint with a view to creating something to be known as the Economic and Social Council. [Santos] Basically, what is the Economic and Social Council? [Dhlakama] It would be a small body made up of members from Renamo, the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo], and unarmed opposition parties. What was my idea? It was aimed at freeing my brother Joaquim Chissano from criticism. He and his government have been accused of corruption and diverting state funds. Frelimo cannot prove that it is not doing it. That is why I proposed this council. [Santos] What was President Chissano's reaction? [Dhlakama] He went to the extent of saying that that would be a coup d'etat. I said it would not. I told him that I was suggesting the creation of the council not because Renamo signed the General Peace Accord, but because we are part of the opposition and we are presently in a transition period. My concern at this moment, as leader of the opposition, is to be truly sure that the Mozambican Government is not misusing state funds. No one can assure me now and say: Look, Dhlakama, remain calm. That is not happening. Can anyone say that what I am saying is political propaganda? No, it is not. I think it is now clear why the government does not want to approve such a council. That is why, in my electoral campaign, I want to accuse the Frelimo government of diverting state funds and misusing state vehicles. The state and the party are not one and the same thing, but party members here receive state vehicles. What is happening in Mozambique today is exactly the opposite of what is happening in other countries. In other countries, state vehicles have their own registration number, but here no one knows which are state vehicles and which ones are not. [Santos] Very soon, state vehicles will bear the word "state". [Dhlakam] Yes, the government is going to do that, but I do not know when. In the meantime, they are using the vehicles and will continue to use them. They are violating government rules. It is not only vehicles; there is also the question of money. For example, I do not know how many billions and billions of meticals are in our banks. I also do not know how many billions of meticals the government is withdrawing daily from these banks to sustain its policy. Now, how can President Chissano assure me saying: Look, my brother Dhlakama, that is not happening. He cannot. I want him to tell me: Dhlakama, you are lying, because we are not misusing state money and we are not diverting investment funds. Here is the proof. That is why I continue to demand the creation of an economic and state council or a body with any other name. It could, for example, be called an economic commission. What I want is that this body should be able to control us and assure us. [Santos] What is your fear? [Dhlakama] My fear is: I belong to the opposition. It is not because I do not have money. Even if I had billions and billions of dollars, I would not allow a party to use state funds. People can say that I am saying this because Renamo does not have money. That is not the case. Even in the United States or any other country, no opposition party would allow the government to misuse state funds. That is a the rule. Here in Mozambique, people do not understand. They think Dhlakama is raising this issue because his party does not have money. They want benefits. That is not the case. We do not even want to rule with the government. What we want is to end this misuse of funds and vehicles. President Chissano says he is working for democracy. He says he is making changes to usher in democracy. He is not telling the truth because a democrat is open. He puts the cards on the table and says: Look, I am not corrupt. I do not do what you say I do, and here is the proof. Or he may say: I was in the wrong, but now I have stopped doing that. Unfortunately, Chissano cannot say this. He is still creating conditions for me to continue to point an accusing finger at him. I like President Chissano very much. He is a very good friend of mine. We signed the General Peace Accord together, but there are things that he does not accept. It is not because he does not want to. [Santos] What is the reason then? [Dhlakama] I understand. The Frelimo Party is a very heavy machinery. It has about 100 orthodox Marxists who do not believe in democracy. I continue to insist the government should create this opening, because we are in a transition period and we are going to hold elections this October. I fear that the government may be using state funds to buy vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, flags, and pamphlets for its political propaganda. [Santos] Does the Renamo president have proof or not? [Dhlakam] It is not a question of proof. As an opposition leader, I have to be concerned with the government's actions. I shall only stop to criticize the government when President Chissano says: Afonso Dhlakama was wrong. Let us investigate. As long as he does not do that, I shall continue to criticize the government, with proof or no proof. I want him to tell me that I am not saying the truth. Then, a commission should be created which will contact bank managers, even the president himself, to prove that the Frelimo Party is not using state funds. [Santos] This commission you are proposing would more or less be a body to inspect government activities? [Dhlakama] My brother, I would not exactly put it that way. Now that we are in a transition period, this council would work to control all funds. For example, let us suppose that even today Great Britain announces that it is going to give Mozambique $25 million for economic rehabilitation. It will be giving that money to the Mozambican state and not the party. It will be giving this money to be used for economic reconstruction, to rehabilitate towns, and so on. Who is going to tell me that that money will not be diverted from rehabilitation projects that would benefit the people and be used to buy vehicles for the Frelimo Party? [Santos] Don't donors try to ensure that the money they give is used correctly? Do they not investigate? [Dhlakama] It is somehow difficult. We have many instances where money has been misused. I am a Mozambican and was in the bush for 16 years. Donors themselves know that even if they do investigate, they cannot do it fully. What's more, it is not only a question of controlling foreign investments in Mozambique. There is a need also to control our own money. I belong to the opposition. I do not know how many billions of meticals are in our banks. I want to know. It is not because I want that money. I just want to know how many billions of meticals we have. I fear that the Frelimo Party may be misusing that money. If the government says Dhlakama has no right to know, then that is not democracy because they can misuse this money whenever they want. There is no democratic country worldwide where opposition concerns are not satisfied. [Santos] You are, therefore, accusing the government? [Dhlakama] I am not accusing Frelimo of stealing money. I am only demanding that Frelimo should stop misusing funds if it has been doing so in the past. For it to stop, we should create mechanisms, such as an economic and social council. [Santos] Your main concern now is to establish this control mechanism? [Dhlakama] Yes, that is my concern. I do not know how many billions of meticals the state is getting daily through taxes, import and export tariffs. Who is controlling this money? Where is it? The Mozambican Government should be accountable to Parliament, but it is not saying anything. The Assembly of the Republic belongs to Frelimo. That is my concern. What is more, we have thousands and thousands of houses. You know that with independence, houses were nationalized, and although the rents are not high, but taking into account that in all houses throughout the country people must pay rent, the Administration of State-Owned Buildings is receiving billions and billions of meticals monthly. Where is this money and how is it being used? All these houses belong to the state. [Santos] With regard to vehicles, do you have proof that they are being bought with state money to be distributed to Frelimo members? [Dhlakama] The government is distributing new vehicles. People, like directors, state officials, Frelimo Central Committee members, who did not have cars before the signing of the General Peace Accord, now have Land Rovers and Mercedes Benz. If we total these vehicles, there are hundreds and hundreds of them, costing billions of meticals and millions of dollars. Where is Frelimo getting this money? Is it really getting this money from its funds as a party? If that is the case, then, let it prove it. That is not all. With independence, companies were nationalized and most of these companies belong to the state. These companies are making money. Who is calculating these companies' profits and in what projects is this money being used? If it is in the bank, who knows how much it is? Vehicles continue to be bought. They continue to be distributed. Frelimo has already ordered more than 600,000 bicycles and motorcycles for its political propaganda. [Santos] You could be confusing this with what the government is ordering for the electoral process. The government has the responsibility to organize the electoral process. Do you not think all these bicycles and motorcycles were ordered so that they can be used by the electoral commissions? [Dhlakama] No, no. All these things are not for the government to organize the electoral process. They are meant for the Frelimo Party itself. [Santos] For the electoral campaign? [Dhlakama] Yes, for Frelimo's electoral campaign. That is why, I am talking about bicycles, motorcycles, and money here. This has nothing to do with the National Elections Commission [CNE]. The fund for the CNE's operation comes from donations from the international community. I, as the leader of the opposition, have a representative in this body. My concern is to know where Frelimo gets its money. [Santos] Perhaps from its companies.... [Dhlakama] I agree that any party can have its companies. Frelimo has members who already have their own private companies. We have nothing to do with that. If there is a minister who has a company and gives his profits to the Frelimo Party, we have no problem with that. We are also going to do that. So that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about all these buildings that we have. For example, the Rovuma Hotel gets thousands and thousands of dollars each month. We hear that the hotel belongs to the Frelimo Party. How is that possible? How did the Frelimo Party buy it? From whom and when? All we know is that all the hotels in the country were nationalized. [Santos] But your concern, Mr. President, are the thousands of dollars from the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] that end up in Frelimo coffers? [Dhlakama] If we count all the months that have passed, we shall see that thousands and thousands of Unomoz dollars have ended up in Frelimo coffers. [Santos] Now, you do not believe that the Rovuma Hotel belongs to Frelimo Party? [Dhlakama] I do not believe that it belongs to Frelimo, because I know that it is one of the hotels that was nationalized by the state. Now when the government says that this or that belongs to the Frelimo Party, that raises questions: When did the party buy it? Who received the money, to confirm that the Frelimo Party has truly bought it? There are many questions that we can raise. My concern is that the Frelimo Party should stop using state funds. If it wants to continue using state funds, then these funds should be divided among the parties -- the Frelimo Party, Renamo, and all other opposition parties. The Frelimo Party is not the state. It is just a party. [Santos] Is this situation the result of the single-party system that existed in the country, where the party was confused with the state? [Dhlakama] That could be the case, but Frelimo now is grabbing everything. [Santos] Everything? [Dhlakama] Yes, everything. For example, now there is confusion. We do not know what belongs to the state and what belongs to Frelimo. Houses were nationalized in favor of the state. Now, we see Frelimo ministers privatizing them among themselves. Everyone knows this. Frelimo knows that with a multiparty national assembly, everything must be made clear. What are they doing? They are grabbing everything, and this worries me. Things here are privatized among Frelimo party officials. For example, they say that they want to sell a state building for 3 billion meticals. A common citizen cannot even get 10 million meticals. This is only meant to deceive people. Someone could win the bid, but where is he going to get 3 billion meticals? [Santos] He can go to the bank.... [Dhlakama] He will keep going to the bank for three or four days without getting any money. Then they will tell him the deadline is over. Since you have no money, you cannot buy the building. But when it is a Frelimo official, it is just a matter of lifting the telephone and calling the bank. He does not even need to withdraw the money. He will just fill the forms, and then register as having bought the building. That is not democracy. [Santos] It is corruption? [Dhlakama] It is not even corruption. It is not. It is disorganization and total disrespect for the Mozambican people. [Santos] And opportunism? [Dhlakama] They want to take advantage of everything. They continue to take advantage. I think this is to deny our people democracy. They fear democracy, because a person who does not fear democracy creates conditions for others to operate. For example, we were all against "apartheid" in South Africa, but our black brother Mandela, African National Congress [ANC] president, is now participating. [Santos] In the case of Mozambique, the participation that you are referring to, would be a transitional government? [Dhlakama] Mandela is not in a transitional government. He does not have ministers in the white government, but a mechanism has been created to control everything. Today, the white government can no longer use 20 rands from the state funds without the ANC saying yes. When Mandela makes this demand, it is not because he does not trust the white government. This is what it should be in democracy. He does not want the white government to use state funds, and the entire international community supports Mandela's stand. Why is my stand not also supported? Is the South African democracy different from ours? [Santos] Regarding the creation of an Economic and Social Council, does the president of the republic continue to think that it is a coup d'etat? [Dhlakama] Now, I do not know. I raised this issue one week ago, and yesterday (Friday) I read in the newspaper that he is out of the country. That was his reply at that time. [Santos] You mean last August? [Dhlakama] Yes, last year. He told me in a conversation, as a brother, that that would be a coup d'etat. I said: No, Mr. President, it is not. That is democracy. You are being criticized and how can you tell the people not to criticize you? I even said to him: I am insisting on this to save your image, Mr. President. [Santos] You mean the Renamo president wanted to save the image of the president of the Republic? [Dhlakama] Yes, certainly, that is what I want, because I am always criticizing him. When will this bad image then disappear from the people's minds? Only when he says that he is tired of being accused of doing something that is not true. [Santos] But of what do you accuse him exactly? [Dhlakama] I say his government is using state funds. When he says that he is tired of being accused of doing something that he is not doing, then a commission should be created, made up of some economists from Renamo and the opposition. This commission will go to the bank and see the figures, it will see the state vehicles and then say: "Look, we are not using these vehicles for political campaign. We are using them as state vehicles." I agree that an administrator needs to have a Land Rover, as a state official, but I do not agree that a Frelimo Party first secretary in a district should move about saying: Long live Frelimo. I mean.... [Santos] Is it not the same thing for a Frelimo Party first secretary to have a vehicle and a Renamo provincial delegate to also have a vehicle and move about.... [Dhlakama] That is not the case. It is only now that Renamo is trying to buy vehicles. There are not even 20 vehicles. Our delegates move about on foot because we do not have vehicles for them to visit districts. We now want to buy vehicles for the party. [Santos] But are there Renamo delegates with vehicles? [Dhlakama] It is possible that there are delegates with vehicles, but the vehicles are identified as theirs. If there is a Frelimo secretary who has bought a vehicle with his own money, we have no problem with that. What we know up to now is that all Frelimo Party officials use state vehicles. That is why the government does not even want to come up with a registration number to identify these vehicles as state vehicles. [Santos] In brief, this concern is because of elections. Do you think elections will still be held in the country this October? [Dhlakama] My concern is not only because of elections. This concern was presented last August. The cease-fire came into force in 1992. I was waiting to come to Maputo to present this concern. I could not do it from Maringue. When I came here for the first time, I presented my concern. Answering the last part of your question, I believe we shall have elections in 1994. [Santos] Even with delays in confining troops? [Dhlakama] It is true that the confinement process is behind schedule, but it is Frelimo that is delaying the confinement process. It does not want to confine its troops. [Santos] What is the reason? Do you have any explanation? [Dhlakama] Since I do not belong to Frelimo, I do not know the true reason behind this behavior, but I believe it is because of disorganization in the army. I do not want to make a serious accusation that Frelimo may be preparing another war, because it does not possess the capacity to do it. A Mozambican Army does not exist now. It does not exist. All that Frelimo has are men with weapons. There are thousands of men with weapons, military ranks, and so on. But an army, as an organ, does not exist. I know that Minister Chipande does not know where his troops are. I know that the chief of the General Staff does not know where his troops are. Army Chief Tobias Dai does not know where troops are. Military commanders live in apartments with their families while soldiers are scattered. [Santos] That means therefore that the problem of delay in confining troops is not a political problem? [Dhlakama] First, I am saying that it is a problem of disorganization. Who gives orders to whom? Who begins to give orders? For example, President Chissano, who is the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, gives orders to whom? Does he give orders to the defense minister, the army commander, or the chief of the General Staff? These in turn, give orders to whom? To the provincial commanders. But where are they? They live in apartments while the troops are in barracks.
