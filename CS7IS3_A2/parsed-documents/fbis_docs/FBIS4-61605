The Russian Foreign Ministry sent a written message to Baku with this purpose. Azim Dzharahmedov, the employee of the Russian Embassy in Baku has affirmed that fact. According to him, Mr. Churkin, the first deputy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, has sent a letter to the Russian Embassy to Baku asking for starting consultations with the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry for setting up the free economic zone between Azerbaijan and Dagestan. Mr. Dzharahmedov pointed out that means establishing of joint-ventures, stock-companies, and organization of by-border trade. Russia suggests creating a commission that will carry out work on realization of corresponding proposals. The commission will consist of ministries' chiefs and also the Dagestan Prime-Minister. Mr. Dzharahmedov said the positive decision will be beneficial both for Azerbaijan and Dagestan since only in the Derbent region are 75 thousand Azerbaijanis and in the northern regions of Azerbaijan are dozens thousand Lezgins, Avaries and Lacks. As Mr. Dzharahmedov said "a creation of free economic zone will keep and reinforce historical and cultural ties between two neighboring countries."
