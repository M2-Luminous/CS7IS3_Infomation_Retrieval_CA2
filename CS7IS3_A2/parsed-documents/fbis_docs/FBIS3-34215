In a statement made today, the Arab League General Secretariat called on the Security Council to use all possible means to restore peace to this republic according to the principles of law and justice and not the policy of aggression and occupation. In its statement, the Arab League General Secretariat emphasized that it is following with extreme concern the tragic developments in Bosnia and the Serb forces' continued killing of unarmed civilians, especially the tragic incident that led to the killing and wounding of 263 Muslims when Serbs shelled the capital of Sarajevo yesterday.
