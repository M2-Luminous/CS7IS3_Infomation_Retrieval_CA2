Singh, 79, was rushed to Kathmandu aboard an army helicopter from Bharatpur in Chitwan district, 160 kilometres (100 miles) southwest of here, after falling from a revolving chair and suffering a dizzy spell, the source said. He had been on a political tour campaigning against Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala. "The supreme leader has regained consciousness," the source said. A team of eight doctors is looking after Singh while another group scanned the posterior part of his head and neck using a CAT-Scan machine to check for internal bleeding, said the source. Many of Singh's sympathizers gathered outside the hospital to inquire about his condition.
