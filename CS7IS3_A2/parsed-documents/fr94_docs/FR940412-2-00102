The meeting will be closed to the general public. This action is being taken to ensure that potential bidders on the assessment are not given an unfair advantage by attending this meeting. A bidders conference will be held at a later date as part of the RFP process to ensure bidders have an opportunity to gain a full understanding of the assessment needs. The second set of meetings will be the Commission's Aerosol and Visibility, Modeling, Meteorology, and Emissions Subcommittees. The Aerosol and Visibility Subcommittee main agenda items will be to establish the bounds of natural background visibility distributions in the transport region, and update other work plan tasks. The Modeling Subcommittee's agenda will focus on reviewing proposed modeling protocols. The Meteorology Subcommittee's primary agenda items will be to compare back-trajectory model results and to develop a synoptic characterization for the years 1982&hyph;1992 for the Grand Canyon region. The Emissions Subcommittee, finally, will focus on approving the 1990 emissions inventory, and work on micro and future base inventories. The subcommittee meetings are open to the public.
