The financial markets briefly reacted to this slight loosening of monetary policy with higher rates, but they quickly calmed down. While the lowering of the Lombard rate was no surprise for most dealers on the market, only a few observers had predicted a lower discount rate. In the afternoon the central banks of other European countries -- including Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark -- reduced their prime rates. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer expects the interest rates for customers of banks and savings banks also to go down, depending on the market situation. Tietmeyer justified the reduction of the prime rate above all with the declining inflation rate. In the course of the year the Bundesbank expects another decline, so that during the second half there might indeed be a "two in front of the decimal point." As an important reason for easing tensions on prices, he cited the latest wage agreements. In addition, by continuing its policy of slow interest-rate reductions, the Bundesbank wants to make a contribution to stabilizing the financial markets and thus also to consolidating the trust of foreign investors in the long-term stability of the German mark [DM]. In contrast, the policy of rapid interest-rate reductions, as recommended by critics of the Bundesbank, could revive fears of inflation, which would damage confidence in the German mark Tietmeyer announced that in the future, too, the Bundesbank will stick to a policy that is, above all, oriented toward the development of the money supply. In the long term, the connection between the growth of the money supply and the acceleration of inflation remains unchanged. He said that the high growth rates at the beginning of the year had been distorted by special factors. In the course of the year a decline of the growth rate of the M3 money supply is expected. Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said it is possible that the increase in the money supply will be between 4 and 6 percent during the fourth quarter of the year, as intended by the Bundesbank. In addition, the Central Bank Council decided to pass on DM18.26 billion of the Bundesbank's net profit of DM18.83 billion, after allocation to the reserves, for the past business year to the Federal Government, as the Bundesbank's owner. In the afternoon, FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel announced that DM11 billion of this sum would be used to repay state debt.
