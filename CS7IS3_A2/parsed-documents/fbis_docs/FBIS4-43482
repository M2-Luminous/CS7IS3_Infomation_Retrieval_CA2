In 1993, three rounds of negotiations with Ukraine were held on the basis of these negotiating directives. On 7 March 1994, the EU Council of Ministers agreed to extend the negotiating directives in order to meet a number of Ukrainian requests, notably in order to reflect the prospect of future free trade agreement. The enlarged mandate has enabled both sides to conclude the negotiations and initial the agreement today. The partnership agreement will replace the trade and cooperation agreement of 1989 between the EC and the Soviet Union as far as Ukraine is concerned. Details of the Agreement General principles: The agreement underlines the importance of democratic values, respect for human rights and the principles of a market economy as essential elements of the partnership established between the European Union and Ukraine. The parties also consider it essential for future prosperity and stability in the region of the former Soviet Union that regional cooperation should be continued and strengthened. The agreement establishes the prospect of a future free trade area. In 1998, Ukraine's progress towards a market economy will be assessed in order to see whether negotiations can begin towards free trade. The preamble to the agreement states that support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine will contribute to safeguarding peace and stability in Central and Eastern Europe and the European Continent as a whole. Political dialogue: the agreement foresees an intensive political dialogue, opening the way for meetings at the highest political level whenever appropriate Trade in goods: In addition to the prospect of eventual free trade, both sides will offer each other "most-favoured-nation" (MFN) treatment, giving each other trading terms as good as those offered to other trading partners such as those in the GATT. Quotas will be removed, in line with the Community's new commercial defence policy, while specific agreements will be negotiated for coal and steel products and trade in nuclear materials. An agreement on trade in textile products is already in force. Labour conditions: The agreement calls on the parties to prevent discrimination between legally employed workers, and provides for cumulation of pension rights for Ukrainian workers legally employed in various EU member states. Establishment and operation of companies: The agreement establishes a liberal regime with Ukraine, offering MFN treatment or national treatment (i.e. treatment as good as that offered to domestic companies), whichever happens to be most favourable, when EU companies establish and begin operations on Ukrainian soil, with limited exceptions. Services: The agreement aims at a progressive liberalisation of the cross-border supply of services between the parties. Maritime transport: Each side will offer the other national treatment for access to ports which are open to international trade, as well as for the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services, related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and loading facilities. Payments and capital: For trade in goods, each side stipulates that imports may be paid for in freely convertible currency. This important measure prevents European exports from being submitted to general requirements on the use of local currency. In the case of direct investment, companies will be free to repatriate their profits in freely convertible currency, and no new foreign exchange restrictions will be introduced after the agreement enters into force. Competition: The agreement lays down a number of principles aimed at gradually increasing free and non-discriminatory competition. Intellectual property: Regarding the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights, the agreement provides that Ukraine will bring its levels of protection up to EU standards within five years of the agreement coming into force. Economic cooperation: The agreement lists 25 areas where both sides favour economic cooperation in future. They are: industrial cooperation, investment promotion and protection, public procurement, standards and conformity assessments, mining and raw materials, science and technology, education and training, agriculture and agro-industrial sector, energy, civil nuclear sector (including cooperatIon on the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster), environment, transport, space, telecommunications, financial services, money laundering, monetary policy, regional development, social cooperation, tourism, small and medium sized enterprises, information and communication, consumer protection, customs, statistical cooperation, economics and drugs. Cooperation in these fields may be supported as appropriate by technical assistance from the EU through the TACIS [technical assistance to CIS] programme. Institutional framework: The agreement finally establishes an institutional framework for future cooperation including a cooperation council that shall meet at ministerial level once a year, as well as a parliamentary cooperation committee.
