President Berisha said: "I called you to this meeting as representative of the EU troika, and the same information will also be sent to the Belgian Foreign Ministry asking you to inform the governments of the EU member countries of the following: "Albania has the necessary documentation that the Greek terrorist commando came from the territory of Greece, and after the crime, that is, the massacre in the recruits' garrison of Peshkepia e Siperme in the early hours of April 10, 1994, in which it killed Captain Fatmir Shehu (age 34, born in Tepelena) and soldier Arsen Gjini (age 20, born in Seman) and wounded many other soldiers, out of whom three very seriously, the commando returned to the territory of Greece in the direction of the border crossing point of Argjirohor. "The Greek military uniform of the criminals, the professionalism of crime, the objects found, which are part of the equipment of the special units, prove the argument that the Greek commando belonged to the special units of Greece, or had a special training. The Albanian Government, in its April 10 note addressed to the Greek Government, although it blamed the Greek Government for the incident, as the terrorist commando came for its territory and returned to the same place, asked the Greek Government to find out and punish the authors of the crime, as it might not be directly responsible for the incident. But, press releases of the Greek Government not only did not show regret for the incident, but we learned that this responsibility laid on the Greek Government was interpreted by the government of Athens as a contradiction of the Albanian note. "Just as in the case of the fire opened by a Greek war-ship against an Albanian motor boat in the Albanian territorial waters, in the Bay of Saranda on January 4, 1994, that of the Greek mine sweeper in the Albanian territories near the Cape of Qefali on March 10, of the two Greek armed soldiers who entered Vidohova on March 12 and threatened Albanian citizens, or that of the killing of Alfred Muco, 20 years old, by Greek patrols on March 21, Greece has chosen to deny the fact giving no official response. "In revenge for the dispatch of the general consul from Gjirokaster, who along with indecent activity has acted contrary to the post of the consul he was holding without having the approval by the host country, in complete flagrant opposition to Article 12 of the Vienna Convention, Greece did not expel our consul in Athens but the first secretary of the Albanian Embassy in Athens. "In these conditions, Albania is not going to follow a policy of revenge by expelling from Tirana serious Greek diplomats, but on the basis of Article 11 of the Vienna Convention which says that 'In case a clear agreement does not exist about the number of the embassy staffs, the host country may ask that this number be in the limits it considers as reasonable and normal, taking into consideration the conditions existing in that country and the needs of the said mission,' asks from the Greek Government to take all measures so that within ten days it has the same number of diplomats in Tirana as the number of Albanian diplomats in Athens, respectively 6 diplomats, otherwise this number must be defined on the basis of a bilateral agreement. "Albania asks the Council of Ministers of the EU to demand from Greece to give an official answer on the event. "Albania is for dialogue, but it will not accept the meetings offered without having received an official reply from the Greek Government for the grave terroristic act. "Albania demands from the Council of Ministers of the European Union to verify all the above terroristic acts and voices its readiness for full cooperation with these commission. We also agree that this task be trusted to the existing observers commission of the EU that is observing our northeastern border, but since the chairman of the turn of the commission for this six month period is a Greek official, according to recognized principle of the international law, he will not be a party in the judgment. "We also ask the Council of Ministers of the EU to demand from Greece to put an end to these acts condemnable by the UN charter and which runs counter to the Maastricht principles of which Greece has promised it will observe. We would like to assure Greece that Albania is resolute to cooperate with the EU and its member countries, the countries of the region and Greece and all other countries that are interested in the lowering of tension and the stability in the region."
