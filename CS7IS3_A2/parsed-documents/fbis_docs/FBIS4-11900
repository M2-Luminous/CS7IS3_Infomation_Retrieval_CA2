[passage omitted] The refusal of countries such as Israel to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty makes countries who have signed the treaty feel that their cooperation with the IAEA does not provide them with any kind of guarantee against a threat posed by the countries who are not members of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That matter has not only created an obstacle in the way of cooperation between the Middle Eastern countries and the IAEA, it has also created a problem for international cooperation in that context. The acknowledgement of the IAEA spokesman of that problem reveals the fact that if this situation is not addressed, it is not possible to pin much hope on the nuclear nonproliferation programs. At a time when America, together with other countries and in cooperation with the IAEA, is exerting pressure on countries such as North Korea in order to facilitate the inspection of its installations suspected of prohibited nuclear activity, the signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty expect that pressure is also exerted on countries such as Israel who have not signed the treaty and have not accepted any nonproliferation commitment, so that they accept nuclear nonproliferation. Undoubtedly, that measure would serve international peace and stability as it can reduce obstacles in the way of nuclear nonproliferation.
