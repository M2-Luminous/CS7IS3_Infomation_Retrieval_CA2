They have been working in Kazakhstan for three years in accordance with agreements that were signed as a part of a German credit line. They are building international, intercity, and local telephone exchanges in 10 regions of our republic. Last year, such exchanges were built in Zhezkazgan, Arkalyk, Aktau, and Kostanau. They are assembling equipment in Petropavlovsk, Kokshetau, Karaganda, Shymkent, and Ust-Kamenogorsk. A satellite direct communication line has been built recently to connect Akmola and Frankfurt-on-Main. They familiarized the president with the results of their activities in Kazakhstan and suggested a draft plan for joint work in future. According to the business representatives, the communications system in Kazakhstan must be privatized. The earlier it happens, the bigger the profit will be for the republic. Telecom, a joint Kazakhstan-German venture, has been set up. It installs electronic international switchboard systems. The German side also spoke about the increase in investments to the republic. Nazarbayev assured German representatives of his support. With regard to the privatization of communications systems, the president said that an international tender is due to be announced soon for the right of foreign companies to cooperate with enterprises of this branch of industry. He expressed hope that German companies will participate in the tender. Also attending the meeting were Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko and Foreign Minister Saudabayev.
