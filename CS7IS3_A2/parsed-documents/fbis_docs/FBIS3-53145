"A drafting committee (on military issues) has started to write down the subjects on which we agree and the security questions on which differences remain," Israel delegation spokesman Colonel Ami Gluska told AFP. "The delegation head to the committee on civilian issues are doing the same," he added. The military committee, made up of a jurist and a military officer from either side, met in a ninth floor suite of the Hilton hotel at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba where negotiations resumed on Monday. Foreign ministry legal adviser Yoel Singer and General David Agmon, a chief-of-staff adviser on the intifadah, were drafting a document with Camille Mansur, an international law professor, and Palestine Liberation Army General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Yahya. The four face the main issues which have delayed application of the September 13 autonomy deal -- the size of the Jericho enclave and the control of borders and crossings between the autonomous areas and Jordan and Egypt. Israeli General Gadi Zohar, head of the military administration in the West Bank, and Palestinian businessman Jamil Tarifi, met to draw up a list for the civilian committee which covers the transfer of powers to the Palestinian authority for health, education, direct taxation, social welfare and tourism. The decision to draft a list of points was taken by Israeli deputy chief-of-staff General Amnon Shahaq and the PLO's Nabil Sha'th during a lengthy tete-a-tete in Taba on Tuesday morning. It followed the suspension of negotiations on December 29 when the PLO denied an Israeli claim that a written understanding had been reached in Cairo on border crossings and Jericho. Menawhile the Palestinians continued to demand an access to the Dead Sea and several religious sites south of the Jericho enclave. "We are no longer talking about square kilometres for Jericho," Palestinian spokesman Hasan 'Asfur said. "We are demanding that certain positions in the region be under Palestinian control, such as religious sites, access to the Dead Sea, private land and areas inhabited by Palestinians," he said. Iasraeli spokesman Gluska told AFP there was "no agreement with the Palestinians on the boundaries of the Jericho territory because there is nothing new in the PLO proposals." [passage omitted]
