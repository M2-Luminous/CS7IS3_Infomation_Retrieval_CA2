[Perez de Cuellar] I am deeply grateful to all the national Peruvian sectors that have asked me to run for president. In addition to being an honor and a distinction, it also constitutes a challenge that can only be accepted after a period of mature meditation. It is not that I am avoiding this political commitment; during my 10 years as UN secretary general, I engaged in politics and have witnessed the work of eminent politicians. Out of a deep sense of responsibility, I am compelled to carefully weigh the pros and cons of this decision. Let me assure you, however, that I will inform you very soon whether I have decided to run for president. [Paredes Castro] If you run, will it be as an independent or for a given party? [Perez de Cuellar] I am, and have always been, a political independent. I was a member of the Peruvian diplomatic service for nearly 40 years and as such was obliged to be politically independent. Being a confirmed democrat, however, I am not adverse to political parties. I do not exclude them nor ignore them because they have the indispensable duty of guiding the people, representing them and defending their interests. Political parties are the essence of democracy. Specifically, to answer your question, I would choose to be an independent candidate. [Paredes Castro] How do you view the country's situation? [Perez de Cuellar] It would take a long time to fully answer your question. There have been important improvements in the last four years: The country has been reinserted into the international economic community, a certain economic stability has been achieved, and terrorism has been considerably reduced. We are still faced with many serious problems: Increasing unemployment, a serious stagnation of our exports, agriculture and mining face a difficult situation and, worse still, the impoverishment of the majority is increasing. All this undermines the success of the current economic model. I wish to make it perfectly clear that this is not a question of changing our macroeconomic policy which is in line with an almost universal trend. I must remind you that while I was the UN secretary general in 1990, I helped President Fujimori to enforce this policy in Peru. We must avoid becoming fanatical or ultra-neoliberal, and especially careful to avoid becoming more fanatical than the leaders of the World Bank or the IMF. I believe we must streamline public expenses without altering the macroeconomic balance; we must increase social spending and invest in Peruvian citizens. If we are to safeguard and consolidate what has been achieved in economics and in domestic security, we must immediately pay heed to our social emergencies. [Paredes Castro] Could you give some examples? [Perez de Cuellar] The first thing that comes to my mind is education. To invest in education is to invest in the future. Education is the key to sustainable development. Youth should be a priority area for upcoming Peruvian administrations: We must train for the future, and this starts in schools and universities. Preferably we must center our attention on teachers. What is the point of building schools if we lack teachers? What if the teachers we have available are discouraged and poorly paid? Education is, undoubtedly, one of the least favored areas in Peru. Decentralization is another concerning issue. The executive branch must delegate power at the departmental, provincial, and district levels. Mayors elected by the people should have the means to undertake the needs of their cities and residents. I believe decentralization is the best way to achieve integration. I would also like to mention the need to consolidate basic institutions like the judiciary, the Armed Forces, the National Police, and the Diplomatic Service, which must adopt their own institutional regulations and must refrain from arbitrary measures and avoid becoming politicized. [Paredes Castro] How do you assess appeals for a national consensus? [Perez de Cuellar] In view of the serious problems affecting the country, a national consensus is indispensable. By consensus I mean different or opposing national opinions should agree on common national objectives. This does not entail a unanimous decision or a majority decision. Through negotiations, each group should yield something toward a desired general agreement. I believe the next president should strive to achieve a consensus with Congress and thus solve the serious problems affecting the country. The interrelation of the branches of government will give Peru lasting stability and the governability it needs. Moreover, we should not overlook the advantage of consensus among the government, business, and labor. [Paredes Castro] You have mentioned clear electoral rules. What do you have in mind? [Perez de Cuellar] We have already reinserted our country in international economic circles. We must now reinserted it as a democracy at the continental and international level. To achieve this we must enforce an impeccable democratic system and an irreproachable implementation of human rights. The free expression of the will of the people is the basis of democracy. If this will is to be undisputed, we must have absolutely clean elections with very clear rules of play and absolute guarantees of impartiality. This involves the Electoral Court, the Armed Forces, and the National Police, which is fulfilling its role of safeguarding security through its arduous fight against terrorism and drug trafficking. [Paredes Castro] Reports of your candidacy continuously appear in the press.... [Perez de Cuellar] Ever since my candidacy was mentioned, I have met in Lima and here, in Paris, with numerous fellow Peruvians whose ideas and views I have heard with great interest. I want to explain, nevertheless, that for the time being the only reports and opinions that reflect my thoughts are those which I make personally, like in this interview.
