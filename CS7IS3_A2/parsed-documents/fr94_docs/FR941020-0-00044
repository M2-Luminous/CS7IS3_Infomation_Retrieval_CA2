ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: On November 23, 1992, the State of Florida through the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER) submitted revision to the Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), chapters 17&hyph;296 and 17&hyph;297, Soil Thermal Treatment. This revision restricts soil thermal treatment facilities to process contaminated soil as defined in chapter 17&hyph;775, F.A.C., Soil Thermal Treatment Facilities. Additionally, on January 11, 1993, the recodification of the F.A.C., 17&hyph;2, was submitted to EPA. This recodification merely renumbers the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP) to match the F.A.C. numbering system. DATES: This final rule is effective December 19, 1994 unless someone submits adverse or critical comments by November 21, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Joey LeVasseur, Regulatory Planning and Development Section, Air Programs Branch, Air, Pesticides & Toxics Management Division, Region IV Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Soil Thermal Treatment Facilities Soil thermal treatment facilities in Florida had been regulated by evolving FDER guidance which originally allowed asphalt plants to treat contaminated soil. Previously, the FDER's guidance set a particulate matter (PM) emission standard of 0.08 grains per dry standard cubic foot corrected to 50 percent excess air (gr/dscf @ 50% EA), which required a minimum of 95 percent destruction of the volatile organic compounds (VOC), and fugitive dust to be controlled through wetting of the soil. This emission standard limited the amount of toxic chemicals emitted through the destruction of VOC's to ensure that such emissions were considered safe for the public. At this time, there are 9 stationary and 20 mobile soil thermal treatment facilities with valid FDER construction or operation permits. Because of regulatory inconsistency within the FDER guidance, a financial disadvantage was caused on the facilities equipped with afterburners, due to the cost of purchasing and operating air pollution control equipment. In addition, the facilities operating without afterburners emit excessive amounts of VOC and toxic compounds. To correct this situation the FDER initiated rulemaking for these soil thermal treatment facilities. This rule revision adds specific air pollution control and performance standards to replace the guidance that was being used by the FDER as follows. The F.A.C., chapters 17&hyph;296 and 17&hyph;297, Soil Thermal Treatment rule restricts soil thermal treatment facilities to process contaminated soil as defined in chapter 17&hyph;775, F.A.C., Soil Thermal Treatment Facilities. Petroleum contaminants in the soil that may be treated in these facilities are all forms of gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, grades 2 through 6 fuel oils, crude oil, bunker C oil, residual oil, as well as nonhazardous petroleum-based lubricating, mineral and hydraulic oils containing no polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). None of these petroleum products are classified as hazardous waste. The rule revises the particulate matter emission standard contained in the guidance to 0.04 grains per dry standard cubic foot. It requires volatile organic compounds from the soil to be exposed to a minimum temperature of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit for a minimum length of one second. The rule also contains a 100 parts per million, by volume, dry basis, emission standard for carbon monoxide and requires wetting or containment of the treated soil to control fugitive dust.
