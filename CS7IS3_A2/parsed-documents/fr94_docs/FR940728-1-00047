FR940728-1-00047 FR940728-1-00014 Upon application for submission of alternative data, the Commission may relieve a carrier from full compliance with Part 552 and permit it to submit alternative data. The carrier receives a benefit from this service because of the significant time saved in not preparing detailed financial statements. The proposed fee for processing such applications is derived as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1Dollars Direct Labor Cost $82.99 Indirect Cost 82.58 Fully Distributed Cost 165.56 Proposed Fee 5165.00 5All proposed fees are rounded down to the nearest dollar. Upon application for extension of time for filing, the Commission may grant reasonable extensions of the time limit prescribed for filing the statements required by Part 552. The benefit the carrier receives from this service is that it is not subject to the time constraints in the rule. The proposed fee for processing such applications is derived as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1Dollars Direct Labor Cost $27.89 Indirect Cost 27.75 Fully Distributed Cost 55.64 Proposed Fee 55.00 Upon application for waiver of detailed reporting requirements, the Commission shall grant a waiver of the detailed reporting requirements to carriers that have earned gross revenues of $25 million or less for the reporting period in a particular trade. The carrier receives a benefit from this waiver because it does not have to prepare detailed financial statements. The proposed fee for processing such applications is derived as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1Dollars Direct Labor Cost $51.87 Indirect Cost 51.61 Fully Distributed Cost 103.48 Proposed Fee 103.00 Part 522 defines general rate increases (``GRIs'') in the domestic offshore trades, and describes the financial and operating data required to support GRIs (section 552.2(f)). The specific benefit to the filer of a GRI is the potential for increased revenues. 6 This benefit derives directly from a Commission finding that the particular rate of return generated by a proposed GRI is reasonable. In making this finding, the Commission conducts an extensive analysis of the supporting data, and develops its own benchmark figures for comparison with the filer's calculated rate of return based on its proposed GRI. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to assess a filing fee for GRIs in the domestic offshore trades to cover the full cost of analyzing the reasonableness of a proposed GRI. The proposed fee is derived as follows: 6 An additional benefit accruing to carriers operating in the domestic offshore trades is that potential entrants, by law, are restricted, i.e., foreign-flag carriers are prohibited from operating in the domestic trades. See section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, 46 U.S.C. app. 883. ␣ 1␣ 1Dollars Direct Labor Cost $5,990.64 Indirect Cost 5,960.69 Fully Distributed Cost 11,951.33 Proposed Fee 11,951.00 The Commission recognizes the special circumstances present in the domestic offshore trades regarding the price leadership role played by certain carriers, and invites comments on alternative methods for assessing the Commission's cost of analyzing the reasonableness of GRIs in these trades. Agreement Filing Fees The processing of agreements benefits the filing parties because of the concomitant antitrust immunity conferred by the Shipping Act, 1916 (``1916 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app 801 et seq., and the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1701 et seq. There are strong similarities between FMC agreements and those ICC agreements for which fees were assessed in Central & Southern. Agreements enable joint ratemaking or cost-cutting measures to accrue to the benefit of the signatory parties. The sales revenues or cost savings, or both, can add up to millions of dollars for one carrier, let alone several carriers. Such savings far offset the proposed filing fee for an agreement that enables carriers to accomplish such monetary gains. Savings to carriers and others in excess of the fee amounts can also be realized even through routine arrangements to share office space, equipment, staff and supplies. Accordingly, fees are being proposed for various agreement filings. Agreement filings accompanied by an Information Form must be analyzed for compliance with statutory requirements under section 6(g) and section 10 of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1705(g), 1709. In the domestic offshore trades, certain types of agreement filings require a detailed justification 7 that must be analyzed for compliance with statutory requirements under section 15 of the 1916 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 814. These types are submitted to the Commission for its review, and, under the 1916 Act, approval. The proposed fee for processing such agreements is derived as follows: 7 Proponents must demonstrate that their agreement is required by a serious transportation need, is necessary to secure important public benefits, or will further a valid regulatory purpose of the 1916 Act. See Federal Maritime Commission et. al. vs Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien; 390 U.S. 238&hyph;253 (1968). ␣ 1␣ 1Dollars Direct Labor Cost $703.24 Indirect Cost 699.72 Fully Distributed Cost 1,402.96 Proposed Fee 1,402.00 Agreement filings that do not require an Information Form must be analyzed for compliance with statutory requirements under section 10 and section 6(g) of the 1984 Act. In the domestic offshore trades, agreement filings that do not require detailed justification must be analyzed for compliance with statutory requirements under section 15 of the 1916 Act. These are submitted to the Commission for its review, and, under the 1916 Act, approval. The proposed fee for processing such agreements is derived as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1Dollars Direct Labor Cost $348.76 Indirect Cost 347.02 Fully Distributed Cost 695.78 Proposed Fee 695.00 Agreement filings reviewed under Delegated Authority are processed administratively without direct Commission review, and do not require the filing of an Information Form under the 1984 Act. The proposed fee for processing such agreements is derived as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1Dollars Direct Labor Cost $177.13 Indirect Cost 176.24 Fully Distributed Cost 353.37 Proposed Fee 353.00
