A wave of rallies is again spilling out onto the streets of Russian cities, there is a search again for who is right and who is wrong, while politicians still busy themselves only with disparaging one another and wasting time on fruitless discussions. This was demonstrated especially graphically during the sad half-year commemoration of the October 1993 tragedy. In this situation we--a party of the middle class, a party of stability, legality, and patriotism, a party that rejects extremism--proclaim once again that we intend to strive for civil peace and well-being through concrete deeds. Within the framework of our economic program we are preparing radical reform of the taxation system and agricultural production. We are implementing projects in the area of culture, sports, education, and health care. During these difficult days for Russia we are undertaking a new initiative capable of becoming a basis for cooperation between all political parties and other public associations for the purpose of consolidating Russia and achieving civil peace. We are opening a special account, money from which will go to help families of those who died in the October 1993 clashes, regardless of whose side they were on. The Majority Party is making a contribution to this account, which will enable us to provide at least 5 million rubles [R] for each family. We urge citizens of Russia, parties, and other organizations to contribute to the extent possible, thereby showing a true desire for civil peace. Let those representing different views bow their heads at the yet-not-erected monument to the victims of the October tragedy and take a step toward one another. By 1 June of this year we promise to make public the names of parties and other associations and the names of citizens-participants in the noble action, and invite them to take part in the observer council, which will distribute the money collected. In the month of June all money deposited into the special account will be transferred to accounts of those for whom they are intended, as well as spent for commemoration of the victims of October events. Our particulars: KB KhELP, correspondent account 115161600 of the Moscow Oblast main administration's clearing center of the Central Bank of Russia, interbranch turnover No. 211004, account 700008, the Majority Party. When transferring money, please make the notation: participation in the "October-93" action. Our address: 6, 2 Ochakovskiy Lane, Moscow 119361. Telephone 430-70-80. [Signed] On behalf of the Majority Party Political Council, Majority Party Chairman Vyacheslav Grechnev ROSSIYA supports the initiative of the Majority Party and intends to print the names of its participants. National reconciliation is only possible when mercy toward the fallen becomes a national affair.
