FR940720-1-00008 FR940720-1-00003 Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;48&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;320 series airplanes. The DGAC advises of a recent incident involving a Model ATR42&hyph;300 in which loss of a propeller and engine gearbox damaged the fuselage in the right-hand propeller plane of rotation. The DGAC also advises that a modification was implemented in the elevator control cables during manufacture that reduced the maximum physical separation between the elevator controls and the monitoring equipment. This reduced separation could allow severing of the elevator flight controls in the event that debris from an engine burst or propeller failure were to strike the fuselage. This condition, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. Aerospatiale has issued Service Bulletins ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0068, and ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0069, both dated January 25, 1994, that describe procedures for rerouting the wiring between the normal mechanical pitch controls and the normal electric pitch trim controls, and between the normal mechanical pitch controls and the pitch trim dissymmetry monitoring equipment. Accomplishment of this modification is intended to restore maximum physical separation between the elevator controls and the monitoring equipment. The DGAC has issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;205&hyph;052(B), as revised by Erratum, dated February 2, 1994, to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of §21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the wiring in the elevator controls and the pitch trim dissymmetry monitoring equipment. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. The FAA estimates that 110 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 49 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $296,450, or $2,695 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Aerospatiale: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;48&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model ATR42&hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;320 series airplanes; as listed in Aerospatiale Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0068 and ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0069, both dated January 25, 1994; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 3 months after the effective date of this AD, modify the wiring in the elevator controls and the pitch trim dissymmetry monitoring equipment, in accordance with Aerospatiale Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0068 or ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0069, both dated January 25, 1994, as applicable. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on July 13, 1994. S.R. Miller, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
