The current long term plan was drawn up in June 1987, however, mirroring the great changes in the domestic and international situation with regard to nuclear power, such as the steady progress of Japan's nuclear power development (starting with the fuel cycle operations in Rokkasho-mura in Aomori Prefecture), the end of the East-West Cold War, rising fears over the proliferation of nuclear arms, and increased awareness of the global environmental problem. In July 1992, the Atomic Energy Commission decided to carry out a revision of the long term plan, and established, under its own auspices, a Long Term Plan Specialist Committee. It was decided to establish five subcommittees under this Specialist Committee, the General Subcommittee, the First Subcommittee (light water reactor utilization), the Second Subcommittee (nuclear fuel recycling), the Third Subcommittee (nuclear non-proliferation and international aid), and the Fourth Subcommittee (technology development), and to set up various working groups within the subcommittees to consider the following problems: the First and Second Subcommittees to jointly look at radioactive waste countermeasures, the Third Subcommittee to look at nuclear non-proliferation countermeasures, and the Fourth Subcommittee to look at nuclear ships, high-temperature engineering research and experimentation, and the nuclear power workforce problem. Currently, studies are being carried out in the various subcommittees. Furthermore, in view of the increased popular interest in nuclear power policy, which has been caused by factors such as the domestic and international situation with regard to nuclear fuel recycling, a broad range of opinions is being sought on the development of nuclear power from experienced scholars in areas other than nuclear power as part of the long term plan formulation process. It is thought to be significant that such views are to be reflected in the long term plan. A Long Term Plan Round-Table Group has been established in the Specialist Committee that is composed of professionals in fields other than nuclear power to discuss, in connection with this revision of the long term plan, just how our country's nuclear power development should take place. The primary points to be discussed in connection with the revision of the long term plan include: - looking forward to the 21st century, the formulation of a long term and flexible nuclear power development system; - the coexistence of the peaceful use of nuclear power and nuclear non-proliferation under the new world order following an end to the Cold War; - international aid as one of the advanced countries which possess nuclear technology, the promotion of worthy guiding projects and basic research in countries with emerging technology, and the development of fundamental technology; and, - expanding the public's understanding of the necessity of nuclear power from the point of view of the dealing with international issues such as the energy problem and the environmental problem. These are issues that will be discussed from the point of view of general topics connected to this revision of the long term plan. However, it is possible that the following important issues could be raised in connection with nuclear fuel recycling: - the necessity of nuclear fuel recycling and a reconfirmation of its significance; - the revealing of a rational nuclear fuel recycling plan, which has flexibility in its entirety, starting with the plan to develop fast breeder reactors; and, - the revealing of a nuclear fuel recycling plan that clearly shows that it can receive acceptance both domestically and internationally, based on factors such as the global situation with regard to nuclear non-proliferation. As stated in this article, within an international situation that is undergoing radical change, this revision of the long term plan is extremely important in order to, while following the ideals laid down by the basic law on nuclear power, continue to obtain the understanding of the citizens of Japan and the international community, pursue the development of nuclear power (starting with nuclear fuel recycling) and, at the same time, plan for the securing of stable energy supplies and the promotion of the development of advanced technology, bring forth the renewal potential of nuclear power, and positively contribute to international society as a peaceful user of nuclear power. The Atomic Energy Commission is in a position to, looking forward to the 21st century and in conformity to the climate of the times, listen to the views of various sectors with regard to the formulation of a new long term plan which incorporates basic guidelines on nuclear power development and specific policies on its promotion which our country should adopt.
