No details have emerged on the causes and outcome of this clash, which occurred near the former president's residence. The machine-gun fire had stopped by midmorning but there were still signs of tension in the area, an Army officer said. Defense Minister Raymond Damase Ngollo has held a meeting with members of the Army High Command and officers from the north of the country, who are close to General Sassou-Nguesso, to study ways and means of ending the clashes, the same officer added. Security forces have been deployed in Mpila to check the activities of armed robbers, who have been attacking the goods trains of the Congo-Ocean railway company, the police said. Police presence has been stepped up since the death on 3 April of a soldier, who was killed by a stray bullet during a shoot-out between security forces and the "cobras," the nickname of Gen. Sassou- Nguesso's armed supporters. His supporters are opposed to the presence of the security forces in Mpila and fear that this could serve as a pretext to attack the residence of the former head of state, who is presently in his native village, Oyo, 600 km north of Brazzaville.
