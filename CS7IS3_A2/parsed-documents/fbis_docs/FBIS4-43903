In a statement by the Bundestag Group Chairmen's Conference in Weimar on Tuesday [21 June], the successor organization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] is called extreme-left and a danger to democracy. The chiefs of the CDU and CSU groups demanded that political action be taken against the PDS with all democratic means. The declaration, which was unanimously adopted in Weimar, says that the PDS has to be combated in the same way as the extreme-right Republikaner. The SPD is particularly requested to do this. "It is part of the SPD's historical omissions that it does not dissociate itself from extreme-left forces clearly enough." The SPD merger with the Communist Party of Germany into the SED in eastern Germany in April 1946 had disastrous consequences for many upright Social Democrats, it was stated.
