This time we interview Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. As is known, the Free Democrats received 19.74 percent of the votes in the 8 May elections and remain in contention in second place. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Preparing for the second round of the elections, you keep emphasizing that you do not wish to change the tone of your campaign. However, you would like to throw light on the differences between the programs of the Socialists and the Free Democrats. In your view, what are the main differences? [Kuncze] We primarily start from the premise that only a liberal economic policy can find a way out of the current state of the country's economy. This means a strict budget austerity policy on one side and tax reductions and tax allowances to stimulate investment on the other. Conditions for growth have to be established, and when Hungary has economic growth then this will lay the foundations for increased living standards. It does not work the other way round. We are aware of how various people live in this country and, with this in mind, I say that it is impossible for some sharing to be launched because this would result in upsetting the balance or in having to levy extra taxes. This can be an important difference because, although the economic program of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] prepared by Laszlo Bekesi contains similar elements, it is a big question whether the party's core will stand by it and the trade unions led by Sandor Nagy will support this or something else. The citizens' attention has to be directed to the fact that the SZDSZ is only able to implement its ideas if it gets adequate authority to do this. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Does this mean that there is a negotiating basis as far as economic programs are concerned? [Kuncze] This is possible, meaning the program of Bekesi. To what extent it is possible to agree on the principles represented by the SZDSZ on this issue is a always a big question. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Do you agree with the left-wing intention that the preferential share purchase program [KRP] and privatization should be stopped? [Kuncze] Applying the KRP in too broad a circle means considerable costs to the country. Therefore, this cannot be further extended. We agree with ensuring an adequate range of assets in exchange for compensation notes. As a matter of fact, the KRP does not mean additional resources for the enterprises and it does not even mean real owners, and this is why we do not wish to continue it. As for privatization, our view is that stopping it is out of the question. It has to be carried out with more determination and faster then now to hand over the assets to private ownership as soon as possible. It is necessary to change the institutional system, to apply more privatization techniques, and to ensure social control. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] What role do you intend for the State Property Management Corporation [AVRT] and the State Property Agency [AVU]? [Kuncze] We did not agree with establishing the AVRT and we would also have placed the AVU under parliamentary control. We still have the same intentions. We believe that the two institutions should be amalgamated. It will also have to be considered whether we need such a large amount of state assets as at the moment is prescribed by law. Almost all aspects of the privatization laws will have to be amended. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Is there a contradiction here? Would parliamentary control slow down the processes? [Kuncze] We are always questioned about this because people interpret this as meaning that parliament would make the privatization decisions. This is not so. One level of parliamentary control is that parliament will appoint the participants of privatization, the assets that are to remain in state ownership, and the general asset policy guidelines. The second level is that a deputy from each of the parliamentary parties should be delegated into the supervisory committee of the asset management organization that is to be set up. We are not saying that parliament will constantly be examining every single case. As all parties will participate in the supervision, social control will be ensured because the parliamentary parties as a whole represent a significant part of society. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] In your view, is the country's economic situation indeed more tragic than four years ago? [Kuncze] Successes and failures have both characterized the past four years. I do not think it is correct to say that the country only had successes but I also consider it unacceptable that only failures existed. Accordingly, the country's economic situation is diverse. Some positive and very many negative phenomena exist. I see the breakdown of the internal and external balance and future dangers from this as most problematic. The government that came to power four years ago had countless opportunities to act -- compared with this, the room for maneuver is significantly smaller now. This is why the next government will be in an incomparably more difficult situation. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] As for the first round of the elections, there did not seem to be too much cheering by the SZDSZ. Nevertheless, you are still in contention, in second place.... [Kuncze] The Free Democrats have had a successful result. More people voted for us on the lists than four years ago, and our candidates are still in contention in 162 places. The reason we were not cheering in our headquarters in Merleg Street is that we had more or less expected these results, and, at the same time, we know that the second round can considerably influence the final results. In my view, the MSZP received too much support from the voters, and I would not find it fortunate if the Socialists acquired too much power. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Under what conditions and with what proportions can a possible MSZP-SZDSZ coalition become a realistic idea? [Kuncze] The ability to coordinate programs is the most important point of view. If the MSZP acquires an absolute majority on its own, this will mean that the SZDSZ does not have the necessary weight and, in this case, it would be rather difficult for us to enter into a coalition. In this case, I would not even support doing so. If the Socialists do not have the majority, then the Free Democrats will be under certain constraints because, if we did not enter the coalition, new elections would have to be called. As for issues of personnel, I regard these as of secondary importance. I do not want to talk about myself. However, it is a fact that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn is unacceptable to the SZDSZ as prime minister. As for proportions, getting 25 percent of the parliamentary seats would already mean a serious influence for the Free Democrats.
