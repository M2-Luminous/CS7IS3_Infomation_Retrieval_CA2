Cindoruk was replying to questions from reporters at Amsterdam airport, where he stopped off on his way to The Hague to attend the European parliamentary speakers conference. The TGNA speaker pointed out that Turkey has legal ways to strip people of their parliamentary memberships. If there is a contradiction, he said, it can be set right through an appeal and judgment. Cindoruk stressed that the TGNA respects and is loyal to the Constitution and the law. Replying to a question on attempts by the deputies who are abroad to gain the status of exiles, the TGNA speaker said that Turkish law and justice must be trusted. We want all our citizens to be in Turkey, he said, and we want these deputies to come to Turkey to pursue their rights. Cindoruk pointed out that one cannot sit abroad and demand that an injustice -- if one exists -- be righted. He said: If they are right, why should they live abroad with crimes attributed to them? Cindoruk stressed that Turkey has the mechanisms of parliament and public opinion to prevent the passage of unjust decisions. Replying to a question on relations between the DEP and the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terror organization, Cindoruk said that while trying to crush an antidemocratic gang of bandits, Turkey exercises its sovereign rights within the framework of democratic rules. He stressed that nobody can defend a gang that kills innocent people or those who support that gang.
