Public Participation You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: •Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426; •Reference Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;6&hyph;001, et al.; •Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Jeffrey Gerber, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Room 7312 Washington, D.C. 20426; and •Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, D.C. on or before November 4, 1994. If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Gerber at the above address. Becoming an Intervenor In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered.
