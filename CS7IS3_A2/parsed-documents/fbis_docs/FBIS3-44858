As the evening lights were lit on New Year's Day, Deng Xiaoping, sitting in a car, inspected two of Shanghai's busy commercial streets, which had taken on a new look after thorough renovation. His car slowly drove past Nanjing road and Huaihai road, which were shining brilliantly with neon lights, to stop at the five-star New Jinjiang Hotel, from the top floors of which one can overlook the entire city. According to a source who was at the site, at about 1900 on New Year's Day, accompanied by his family, Deng -- healthy and spry -- walked steadily into the spacious lobby of the New Jinjiang Hotel. Foreign guests staying at the hotel and people seeking diversions were strolling or chatting leisurely in the lobby, which was permeated with a warm and auspicious atmosphere. People congratulated themselves on their good luck to see personally the elegant demeanor of the chief architect of China's reform and openness. As always, Deng Xiaoping came to Shanghai when winter began, and stayed at a hotel where he used to live every time he was in the municipality. Compared with previous years, he came earlier this year. It has been reported that, accompanied by his beloved daughter Mao Mao, Deng Xiaoping inspected the magnificent Yangpu Bridge on 13 December 1993. According to a reliable source, it was drizzling that day as his car drove to the cable-stayed bridge that stretches over the river, with the roaring winds audible inside the car. Even given these weather conditions, Deng Xiaoping, at his advanced age of 90, got out of the car in high spirits and, braving the wind and rain, walked steadily for more than 20 meters on the broad surface of the bridge, halting now and then to view the landscape on both shores of the Huangpu Jiang.
