The economic situation's indicator increased by 2 percent compared with what it was in February of this year. Those are the conclusions drawn from the most recent research poll by the Main Commercial School's Institute of Economic Development. The production output indicator increased substantially over the month of March. Enterprises are predicting that the trend will continue over the next three to four months. An increase in the in-flow of new domestic orders, which has been reported by enterprises, is also a positive phenomenon. All signs are that we will have a similar situation over the course of the next three to four months. After its January increase and a stabilization in February, the indicator of price increases on ready-made products experienced a drop. Enterprises are predicting a slowdown of the rate of increases of prices on their products also over the next three to four months. Last month, a decrease of reserves of ready-made products was reported, even though the reserves' levels were rising on a regular basis beginning in December 1993. The indicator of production of merchandise for exports rose for the second month in a row; the same applies to the portfolio of new export-bound orders. This kind of rate should hold over the next few months. The rate of growth of unemployment decreased in March, and the financial situation of enterprises improved slightly. The increase in production levels, the increase of domestic and export orders, the decline in the levels of reserves of ready-made products, and an investment revival--all these are signs of permanent economic growth occurring in Poland.
