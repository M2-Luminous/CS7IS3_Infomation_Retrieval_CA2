According to reports from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Ningbo, many transnational corporations have invested in local basic industry projects and high-tech projects. Last year, more than 10 transnational corporations launched investment projects in Beijing, and large projects exceeding $10 million each numbered more than 200. Shanghai has signed more than 200 project agreements with more than 120 transnational corporations. One-third of the world's 100 largest corporations have made investments in Shanghai. The investment by transnational corporations in Ningpo exceeded $6 billion, and large projects exceeding $10 million each numbered more than 40. The number and size of investment projects in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen also has increased substantially. In recent years, hundreds of internationally famous transnational corporations made investments on the Chinese mainland. These include Motorola, General Motors, IBM, Xerox, Concord [xie he 0588 0735] Johnson and Johnson, Exxon, and Morgan [mo gen 2302 2704], of the United states; Unilever and Pilkington Brothers [pi er jin dun 4122 1422 6855 7319], of Britain; Volkswagen and Simens, of Germany; Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sony, Seibu, Ito-chu, and Kumagai Gumi, of Japan; Bell, of Belgium; Phillips, of the Netherlands; and Zhengda [2973 1129], of Thailand; as well as some transnational corporations based in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The transnational corporations that have taken quick action first set up some small and intermediate-sized enterprises and also sought new opportunities for major investment projects. Many large corporations have planned to launch major investment projects in the fields of petroleum, car making, the chemical industry, and shipping, and have worked out long- or intermediate-term investment plans. For example, the three large oil companies -- Texaco, Shell, and Exxon -- have participated in offshore oil development projects in the East China Sea. A U.S. corporation planned to invest 10 billion yuan in China's petrochemical industrial, radio communications, and shipping projects. Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the U.S. Boeing Corporation have cooperated with China's aviation industries in manufacturing YSX passenger planes. Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa has invested over 10 billion yuan in developing Shenzhen's Yantian Port and Shanghai's container terminal. The transnational corporations are making huge long-term investments in China mainly because they are attracted by the tremendous market potential and the lasting economic charm of the Chinese mainland. In the past 15 years, although foreign investors have signed investment agreements with a total value of $200 billion, the foreign-funded enterprises still account for a very small proportion of China's national economy. The yearly foreign investment accounts for only 2.2 percent of China's aggregate investment. On the other hand, the cumulate investment made by transnational corporations in China accounts for only 1 percent of their overseas investment. At present, the more than 50 U.S.-based transnational corporations that have made investments in China account for only one-tenth of the more than 500 transnational corporations in the United States. China still needs funds and technologies in many fields of development, and still has great potential for attracting foreign capital. Transnational corporations may have a vast market in China. Since last year, in order to strive to join GATT and to converge with international practice, the Chinese Government has unified the foreign exchange market, and has partly opened China's domestic market. The policy for attracting foreign investment also has been gradually adjusted and perfected in order to attract transnational corporations to set up their Asian or Asia-Pacific regional headquarters inside the Chinese mainland and to encourage foreign investors to invest in high-tech and capital-intensive projects. Foreign companies now are allowed to set up investment corporations and joint-stock companies in China. The scope of opening up to foreign investment also has been broadened. All this has opened up various new channels for transnational corporations to invest in China.
