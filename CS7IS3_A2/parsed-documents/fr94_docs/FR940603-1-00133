FR940603-1-00133 FR940603-1-00009 The following provisions shall not limit the generality of the above requirements: (a) The Seller will at all times keep the premises free from accumulations of waste material or rubbish caused by his employees or work, and at the completion of the work he will remove all rubbish and all his tools, scaffolding and surplus materials and will leave his work ``broom clean.'' (b) The Seller will perform work in such manner as to maximize preservation of aesthetics and conservation of natural resources, and minimize marring and scarring of the landscape and silting of streams. There will be no depositing of trash in streams or waterways. Herbicides, other chemicals or their containers will not be deposited in or near streams, waterways or pastures. The Seller will follow, under the general direction of the Purchaser, the criteria relating to environmental protection as specified herein by the Purchaser. (c) The work, from its commencement to completion, or to such earlier date or dates when the Purchaser may take possession and control, shall be under the charge and control of the Seller and during such period of control by the Seller all risks in connection therewith and the materials to be used therein, whether owned by the Seller or Purchaser, shall be borne by the Seller. The Seller will make good and fully repair all injuries and damages to the work or any portion thereof under the control of the Seller by reasons of any act of God, or any other casualty or cause whether or not the same shall have occurred by reason of the Seller's negligence. (i) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Seller shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Purchaser and Purchaser's directors, officers, and employees from all claims, causes of action, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) for personal loss, injury, or death to persons (including but not limited to Seller's employees) and loss, damage to or destruction of Purchaser's property or the property of any other person or entity (including but not limited to Seller's property) in any manner arising out of or connected with the Contract, or the materials or equipment supplied or services performed by Seller, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier. But nothing herein shall be construed as making Seller liable for any injury, death, loss, damage, or destruction caused by the sole negligence of Purchaser. (ii) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Seller shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Purchaser and Purchaser's directors, officers, and employees from all liens and claims filed or asserted against Purchaser, its directors, officers, and employees, or Purchaser's property or facilities, for services performed or materials or equipment furnished by Seller, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier, and from all losses, demands, and causes of action arising out of any such lien or claim. Seller shall promptly discharge or remove any such lien or claim by bonding, payment, or otherwise and shall notify Purchaser promptly when it has done so. If Seller does not cause such lien or claim to be discharged or released by payment, bonding, or otherwise, Purchaser shall have the right (but shall not be obligated) to pay all sums necessary to obtain any such discharge or release and to deduct all amounts so paid from the amount due Seller. (iii) Seller shall provide to Purchaser's satisfaction evidence of Seller's ability to comply with the indemnification provisions of subparagraphs i and ii above, which evidence may include but may not be limited to a bond or liability insurance policy obtained for this purpose through a licensed surety or insurance company. (d) Monthly reports of all accidents will be promptly submitted by the Seller, giving such data as may be prescribed by the Purchaser.
