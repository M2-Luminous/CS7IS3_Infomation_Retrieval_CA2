FR940912-0-00058 FR940912-0-00010 Because of the change to §24.16(d) discussed above under the Discussion of Comments, a definition for ``participating group'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(14)) is no longer needed. Accordingly, in §24.16(b), paragraphs (15) and (16) are redenominated paragraphs (14) and (15), respectively. 24.16(c)_Application and bond Although the interim regulations did not make any changes to the provisions of §24.16(c), because this section references Customs ``employees'' rather than Customs ``Officers'', the term ``employee'' in paragraphs (1) through (3) is replaced with the term ``Officer'' to reflect the new restricted application of §24.16, as amended by the COPRA provisions of the 1993 Act. This change is made to make the provisions of paragraph (c) more harmonious with the rest of the provisions in §24.16. 24.16(e)_Overtime pay In paragraph (2)(i) of §24.16(e), the second sentence regarding the rounding off of overtime work performed in increments other than a full quarter hour is deleted because it seeks to address a problem that is subject to negotiations under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act. In paragraph (2)(ii) of §24.16(e), the last sentence is revised by deleting the words ``for the work assignment'' after ``reports'' and adding the words ``as assigned'' to make it clear that overtime pay is now restricted to hours assigned and worked. 24.16(f)_Commute Compensation In paragraph (3) of §24.16(f), the last sentence regarding the treatment of certain overtime work to prevent the inappropriate payment of commute compensation is deleted because it represents a regulatory attempt to correct a scheduling issue. The district director is responsible for and has discretion in scheduling appropriate overtime assignments. In paragraph (4) of §24.16(f), a stylistic change is made in the first sentence (changing the reference from ``he'' to ``the officer'') and a modification is made in the second sentence (allowing less than all overtime assignments to be treated as one continuous callback assignment) to give management more flexibility in the assignment of overtime work. 24.16(g)_Premium pay differentials For the reasons given above concerning recasting three provisions in §24.16(b) because the terms defined encompassed similar elements pertaining to compensation, the three provisions in §24.16(g) pertaining to premium pay _paragraphs(g)(1) (Holiday differential), (g)(2) (Sunday differential), and (g)(3) (Night work differential)_are recast to employ a parallel construction for ease of readability and to add clarity to their exclusive meanings. In paragraph (1)(iv) of §24.16(g), the first sentence is revised and a second sentence is added to make it clear that where only one assigned shift is worked and any of those hours occur during the 24-hour calendar day of a holiday, the entire shift will be designated as a holiday and compensated at the holiday rate of pay. Also, a new paragraph (vi) is added to clarify the compensation computation where only a portion of a regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, holiday shift is worked. 134.55_Compensation of Customs Officers and employees In paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of §134.55, a grammatical change is made to clarify which regulatory provisions (COPRA or FEPA) are applicable to provide compensation for which Customs personnel. The change provides that the COPRA compensation provisions of §24.16 are applicable regarding overtime compensation and premium pay for Customs Officers, and that the FEPA compensation provisions of §24.17 are applicable regarding overtime compensation for other Customs employees. Conclusion In consideration of the comments received, Customs believes that the interim Pay Reform for Customs Inspectional Services regulations, published as T.D. 94&hyph;2 in the Federal Register on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68520), should be adopted as a final rule with certain changes thereto, as discussed above and set forth below.
