The causes are hotly debated. But one thing is very clear -- Asia is likely to take front seat in the plunge towards an epidemic of AIDS by the turn of the century. What is even more chilling to realise is that Pakistan is sleeping as disaster approaches. According to the Asian Development Bank, only one of several institutions to have predicted a grim future in this regard, the number of AIDS cases in Asia is expected to surpass those in Africa in the next couple of years. By the year 2000, Asia will be home to more than half of the people of this world who are infected with HIV, the virus that inevitably leads to AIDS. These estimates are based on the current rate of growth of the incidence of infections in this part of the world, and the attitudes that prevail in countries towards the disease. For the most part, governments' reaction in Asia range from complete apathy and ignorance to hostility towards the disease and its victims. This is further based on the perception that AIDS is limited to certain groups of people, those that Asian societies keep at arms length. Some individuals believe that AIDS is God's way of dealing with such people, and some think that it is God's wrath descending on western immorality. Pakistan for one is reacting very slowly to the AIDS crisis, its authorities and society perhaps believing that the borders of the country will keep out the full scale assault that is currently underway in neighbouring countries. India is estimated to have about one million HIV infected people today, though given the fact that most of these people are unaware of the time bomb within them, they are probably spreading the disease more rapidly than can be calculated with any certainty. Suffice to say that the situation is very serious. Belatedly, Indian authorities are waking up to the realities, and AIDS awareness campaigns are being pursued with some sense of urgency. The biggest hurdle in the way is ignorance, which makes information dissemination difficult is a society where taboos don't allow candid exposure to such issues. Not surprisingly, the problem is even greater for Pakistan. Though we have only a few hundred reported cases, they are growing rapidly, and most HIV infections are unreported or unknown even to the infected people. Much of the world is observing AIDS week currently, to focus attention on the issue and spread awareness of the danger. In most of Asia the awareness effort has been limited almost exclusively to the more affluent and more liberal segments of society, with walks and high level seminars putting in their usual token show. The most vlunerable sections of the populace, the proverbial masses, as always remain untouched by such publicity stunts. Ironically, they will be the first to be touched, indeed knocked down, by the virus. It is not simply a matter of physical health that confronts us here. For developing countries like Pakistan, it would be devastating to be burdened by the heavy costs, both human and financial, that would follow a full scale spread of the disease. AIDS right now is spreading among all creeds, classes and ages, and both sexes, simply because those who carry the virus don't know that they do, and those who catch it from them are unaware of the precautions that they must take for their own safety. In its wake, AIDS is leaving a devastating trail of human suffering, and it is only the fault of ignorance. Unless Pakistan acts now to curb the unpending assault, the costs later on will put out of our reach not only physical health, but also any economic prosperity that may be appearing on the horizon today. Our health authorities have so far failed to make any impact in spreading AIDS awareness to where it is needed most. It is frightening to know that almost all donated blood in the country is unscreened for the HIV virus, which means that hospitalised patients all over the country who may need blood transfusions are at risk of contracting the virus. This indicates the gross apathy of the concerned authorities towards the health of the people. No doubt, the individuals assigned to the task are fully aware themselves, and genuinely concerned about the immediate threat, but they have so far failed to initiate even those safeguards that would minimise the risks for unsuspecting patients. Why? We need an action plan, something perhaps on the line of National Conservation Strategy and the environmental mass awareness programme, to impart education about AIDS. Perhaps it can be combined with family planning, since that too is dealing with some generally taboo subjects. What is important to understand is that our illiterate masses are not going to be able to read about the disease, they must be told about it. It will take a major grass roots and multi-media effort, and it can't wait.
