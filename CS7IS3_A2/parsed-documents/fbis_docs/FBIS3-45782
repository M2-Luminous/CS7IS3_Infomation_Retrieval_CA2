"China's gross national product (GNP) has doubled during the past decades, but its environment has not deteriorated accordingly, and in some areas environmental pollution has even been reduced," the official said. Speaking at an international symposium on the environmental protection action plan, Zhang said that it still remains an arduous task for China to create an ideal environment in the coming years because of its huge and growing population and rapidly expanding economy. According to statistics, China's nearly 1.2 billion population grows by 15 million each year on average, while its cultivated land is shrinking at an average rate of 300,000 ha [hectares] each year. The per capita share of the major resources in China, such as fresh water, cultivated land, forest, grassland and important mineral resources, is much lower than the world's average. Gao Guangsheng, an official from the State Planning Commission, said that the total amount of standard fuel and metal consumed each year by China will be twice as much as the total consumed by the world in 1970 if China's economy continues to grow rapidly in a traditional development pattern and China's per capita GNP reaches 4,000 U.S. dollars by the mid-21st century. "Obviously, the traditional development strategy is in no way acceptable to China," said Gao. He said that China has been paying close attention to the experiences drawn by developed countries and mapped out a strategy for sustainable economic and social development. In response to the earth summit meeting in Brazil in 1992, China has made up "10 countermeasures on the environment and development", "China's Agenda 21", a strategy for China's sustainable economic and social development in the coming century, and "China's Environmental Protection Action Plan" in the past two years. "China expects more cooperation with other countries and international institutions in environmental protection since China lacks expertise and investment in those regards," Zhang said. Also present at the seminar were about 60 environmental experts or officials, including some from Britain, Germany, Denmark, Canada and China, and some foreign diplomats in China. The four-day seminar was jointly held by SBEP, the State Planning Commission and the State Foreign Experts' Affairs Bureau.
