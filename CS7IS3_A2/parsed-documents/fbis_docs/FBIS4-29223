Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today says: This eloquently proves that it does not want to truly solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but is trying to stifle the DPRK militarily on the pretext of the "nuclear development". It is entirely wrong for the U.S. to put military pressure on the DPRK over the "nuclear issue". The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cropped up when the U.S. deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea and resorted to nuclear threat against the North. The United States has turned South Korea into the largest nuclear base in the Far East, targeting its Asian strategy against the Korean peninsula. Owing to the nuclear war moves of the United States, South Korea has turned into a most dangerous hotbed of a nuclear war in the world and the Korean people have to live under a constant nuclear threat of the U.S. thus the United States gave rise to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and is gravely threatening the DPRK with nuclear weapons. Yet it is increasing military pressure on the DPRK over its "nuclear development". This is a shameless act which reminds us of a guilty party filing the suit first. The DPRK's nuclear activities, in view of their peaceful nature, cannot be a pretext of pressure. Its nuclear activities are designed to solve the problem of energy badly needed for economic construction and the DPRK's atomic energy facilities strictly serve this purpose. There is nothing else in its nuclear activities. Nevertheless, the U.S. is putting military pressure on the DPRK on groundless charges. This tells that the United States has not yet given up the scheme to stifle Korean socialism with strength. In view of the sincere efforts made by the DPRK till now for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. military pressure cannot be justified. For a peaceful and fair solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, we have consistently called for dialogue and negotiation and made a signal overture for a package solution to the issue. If the United States had come out to the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks and the nuclear issue had been solved in a package deal, the state would not have developed as now. The DPRK's reactor core refueling cannot be a pretext of military pressure. We urged the International Atomic Energy Agency five times to take measures needed for core refueling and notified the U.S. side that, if a package solution were achieved and the unique status of the DPRK removed, though belatedly, we could allow all the routine and ad hoc inspections including the selected preservation of fuel rods even in the course of core refueling. Facts show that the failure to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is wholly attributable to the United States and some dishonest quarters of the IAEA secretariat. The criminal attempt to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula while blocking its solution can never be tolerated. The Korean people who regard independence as their life and soul would decisively react, if the United States ventured a military provocation against the DPRK over the nuclear issue.
