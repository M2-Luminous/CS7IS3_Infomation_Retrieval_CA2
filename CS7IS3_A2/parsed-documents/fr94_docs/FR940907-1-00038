ACTION: Proposed rules. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') today is publishing for comment proposals to require disclosure with respect to security ratings in prospectuses under the Securities Act of 1933 and material changes in security ratings on Form 8&hyph;K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposals specify the disclosure necessary with respect to ratings, whether disclosed voluntarily or pursuant to the new requirements. Today's proposals are intended to improve the quality and timeliness of security ratings disclosures provided to investors and the financial markets in prospectuses and periodic reports, and to reduce the potential for market misunderstanding and confusion over the scope and meaning of security ratings.

Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;24&hyph;94.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is publishing for comment proposed Item 202(g) of Regulation S&hyph;K 1 and proposed Item 202(d) of Regulation S&hyph;B 2 under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') 3 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') 4 to require disclosure of solicited security ratings assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (``NRSROs'') to registered securities or any rating, whether or not assigned by an NRSRO, that is used by a participant in the offering, and to mandate the disclosure necessary in connection with any discussion of ratings, voluntary or required, in prospectuses. The Commission also is publishing for comment new Item 9 of Form 8&hyph;K 5 under the Exchange Act to require disclosure of material rating changes. The Commission is proposing to rescind its policy on voluntary security ratings disclosure set forth in Section 10 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B, 6 and is proposing technical amendments to Rules 134(a)(14), 7 430A, 8 and 436(g) 9 under the Securities Act. 1 17 CFR 229.202(g). 2 17 CFR 228.202(d). 3 15 USC 77a&hyph;77aa. 4 15 USC 78a&hyph;78jj. 5 17 CFR 249.308. 6 17 CFR 229.10(c) and 228.10(c). 7 17 CFR 230.134(a)(14). 8 17 CFR 230.430A. 9 17 CFR 230.436(g). I. Background A. Disclosure of Security Ratings_Current Policy In 1981, the Commission, recognizing the importance of security ratings to investors and to the marketplace, reversed its historic policy of precluding disclosure of security ratings in registration statements, prospectuses, and other offering documents. 10 The Commission adopted a policy that permits, but that does not require, issuers to disclose in Commission filings security ratings assigned by rating organizations to classes of debt securities, convertible debt securities, and preferred stock. 10 Securities Act Release No. 6336 (Aug. 6, 1981). While adopting the policy in 1981, the Commission set forth its views on ratings disclosure in Regulation S&hyph;K, Item 10(c), 17 CFR 229.10(c), in connection with adoption of its integrated disclosure system in 1982. Securities Act Release No. 6383 (Mar. 16, 1982). The policy distinguishes between security ratings assigned by NRSROs and those assigned by other rating organizations. 11 The most significant distinction is the provision allowing the inclusion of a security rating by an NRSRO in a registration statement without having to provide a written consent from the NRSRO to be named as an expert for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act. 12 Any non-NRSRO rating organization must furnish a consent and take on expert liability under the Securities Act if its rating is included in the registration statement and prospectus. 13 In addition, under the policy, issuers may disclose a rating in tombstone advertisements on a limited basis, provided that the rating is assigned by an NRSRO. 14 As part of the same initiative, the Commission incorporated eligibility criteria based on ratings by NRSROs into its short form registration forms under the Securities Act. 15 In doing so, the Commission noted that investment grade securities typically were purchased on the basis of interest rates and ratings. 16 11 For purposes of the policy, the term ``NRSRO'' has the same meaning as used in the Commission's net capital rule, Rule 15c3&hyph;1. 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1. In so doing, the Commission noted that the purposes underlying the voluntary ratings disclosure policy differ from those underlying the net capital rule, but did not believe that a different meaning of NRSRO was necessary. The process by which rating organizations are recognized as NRSROs is discussed in the companion ratings concept release issued by the Commission today which solicits comment on the Commission's role in using the ratings of NRSROs (Exchange Act Rel. 34616 (Aug. 31, 1994)). 12 15 USC 77k. See also 17 CFR 230.436(g). 13 See Robert A. Stanger & Co. , SEC No-Action Letter (Nov. 7, 1986); See also Securities Act Release No. 6383, in which the Commission adopted the integrated disclosure system; 17 CFR 436(g). 14 See Rule 134(a)(14)(ii) under the Securities Act. 17 CFR 230.134(a)(14)(ii). 15 See Securities Act Release No. 6383; Forms S&hyph;3 (17 CFR 239.13) and F&hyph;3 (17 CFR 239.33). 16 See Securities Act Release No. 6383. Underlying the Commission's change in policy and the disclosure guidance it provided in its policy statement was an understanding of rating practices and disclosures as they had developed through the 1970s. In announcing the policy, the Commission noted the significance and usefulness of security ratings, as shown by the use of ratings ``by investors, by market professionals in establishing the appropriate price and yield for a particular security and by regulatory bodies, including the Commission.'' 17 17 Securities Act Release No. 6336. Even before the Commission adopted its 1981 ratings disclosure policy, the Commission relied on or permitted disclosure of ratings in other contexts. The first regulatory use of ratings was in the Commission's net capital rule, which allows broker/dealers reduced deductions from net capital for certain holdings rated in certain investment grade categories. 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1. In addition, the Commission used ratings in certain of its rules under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') and permitted disclosure of certain ratings in investment companies' registration statements. See, e.g., Rule 10f&hyph;3 under the Investment Company Act. 17 CFR 270.10f&hyph;3. The policy release also noted the extent to which state legal investment laws for banks, savings and loans, and insurance companies incorporated security ratings.
