The question of transforming the G-7 into the G-8 is one of the key questions at both the talks held with the head of the Italian Government, who we know will chair the June G-7 summit in Naples, and at meetings in Washington, where Chernomyrdin's interlocutors will include President William Clinton, albeit (as the situation stands at the time of the departure from Moscow) with the qualification of "conditionally." From the Russian premier's viewpoint Russia has "already progressed a long way" regarding the question of whether it will add itself to the G-7. But the official formation of the G-8 is a matter for the future which goes beyond the bounds of the Naples summit. "I see no difficulties as regards political questions," Chernomyrdin said, answering my question. "As for economic questions, we are not forcing our way in, we are perfectly well aware that there are difficulties on which we ourselves have some work to do today." When these difficulties have been overcome is when, as far as can be understood from the premier's comments, the G-7 will become the G-8. "This," he stressed, "is the next stage." True, Chernomyrdin did not specify whether Moscow hopes to overcome this obstacle by next year's summit scheduled in Canada. In Washington, to where the premier is flying to participate in the third session of the Russian-U.S. economic and technical commission, which he heads jointly with U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, our delegation will strongly raise a question which has gone unanswered for too long: When do the Americans and the West as a whole intend to finally lift the restrictions on business contacts with us which persist from Cold War times? Let me recall that at the summit meeting in Vancouver in April last year Clinton solemnly promised to do this without delay. Over a year has elapsed. "This is simply unsettling us all," Chernomyrdin said. "Not only us but also the Americans are losing out because the restrictions are being maintained.... We want to work on equal terms, we are not asking for anything that would make us an exception. We have wishes, like everyone. Of course, we will not tolerate discrimination against Russia." Although the premier did state that he hopes that a solution will nonetheless be found, I personally have doubts as to how serious the Washington administration and U.S. Congress are about this. The doubts are strengthened, in particular, by the U.S. Department of Commerce's recent statement, which defined the 10 most promising emerging markets from the viewpoint of U.S. interests. This list includes Brazil, Indonesia, India, Turkey, South Korea, and Poland. But not Russia. In order to promote U.S. interests in Indonesia, for example, a special strategic group has already been formed which includes representatives of 22 ministries and departments. In other words, if we are talking about the level of interest shown by the Americans, Jakarta has reached a level which is still unachievable for Moscow. Let me add that in relation to China, which is also on this list, Washington is prepared to waive literally any of its principles, including those linked to guaranteeing civil rights and freedoms, so that it does not lose this market and becomes established and prevails in it. But as for us this attitude is once again something unrealistic. It must be specially stressed that the mood of U.S. business circles plays a colossal role in the extent to which the Washington administration is complaisant in its dealings with Beijing. The fact that Clinton effectively ignored human rights violations by the Chinese authorities and is going to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status is indicative of the powerful pressure put on the White House by, among others, the Boeing aviation corporation, which, were it not for this status, could have lost tens of billions of dollars. Those meeting with Chernomyrdin in the United States -- who, besides Washington, will visit Detroit (in order, among other things, to support our team in the football World Cup) and Los Angeles and San Francisco -- will include leaders of Boeing and other U.S. aviation giants. I wonder to what extent they are going to want to mount an intensive campaign of pressure on the White House in order to break into Russian markets and open up U.S. markets for Russian products. Another noteworthy point on the Russian premier's itinerary: the Livermore Laboratory, the very same one where the most advanced weapons, including nuclear and space weapons, have been and are still being developed. Chernomyrdin will become the first Russian of such high rank to visit this laboratory, in order -- as far as can be ascertained -- to thoroughly discuss questions of defense conversion and those about which he prefers not to talk for the moment. "We are discussing those problems," he just told me, "about which it was prohibited to think previously." It is to be hoped that some light will be shed on this subject as well by the end of the visit. U.S. reporters who accompanied the premier to the airport asked a question which evidently interests U.S. politicians much more than the visit itself at the moment: Are there any differences of opinion between Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin? The reply was categorical: "There are no differences between us. There were not any initially, there are none now, and there will be none. It is impossible to work in the midst of differences. The line being pursued by the government and president is a united line. I better than anyone else can confirm this today."
