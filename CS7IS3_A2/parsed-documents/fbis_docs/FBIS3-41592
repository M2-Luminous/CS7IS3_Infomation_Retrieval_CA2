However, ``the problem has grown worse since the government's distribution of land to people demobilized from the Resistance and the Army,'' said the departmental representative of IRENA [Institute of Natural Resources], Maurice Gutierrez Pascuas. The regions most hurt by this logging are Sapoa, Cardenas, Ostional, Escalante, San Juan del Sur, and La Chocolata. In these places 300,000 trees will be planted to halt desertification. ``The turnover of lands to demobilized combatants has worsened the problem, as there is no control over them, and they are often highly unstable persons who will resort to violence,'' said the IRENA representative. Environmental protection campaigns must make the campesinos and people in general more aware. ``We are not refusing to let them use the wood, but the forests must become a perpetual and sustainable resource,'' continued Gutierrez. No Institutional Communication Ometepe Island is one of the national parks that has been declared a nature reserve. ``In this reserve there is a lot of poaching of animal species,'' and we are unable to cover the entire territory. ``We appealed to the Army, and that is how we were able to seize thousands of turtle and bird eggs. In the La Flor Reserve we are working with the police and we have managed to wipe out contraband.'' The IRENA representative criticized the lack of communication between independent government agencies. The department's environmental problems worsened when the National Institute for Agrarian Reform--at the order of the central government--distributed lands to demobilized combatants without consulting them. ``Former members of the Resistance and of the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] cut down trees in order to plant and to sell wood.'' For future actions, ``there should be better internal communication,'' Gutierrez said vehemently. He praised the efforts of student environmentalists, for with their help we have achieved many goals. ``The secondary school Ecological Brigades have done a great deal of work,'' and soon we will plant 20,000 trees in Ometepe Island. Finally, he appealed to the entire community to avert the desertification of Rivas. ``The people must realize that we have to protect the environment in order to avoid what happened in Occidente, which had relied on the cultivation of cotton as a single crop: desertification.''
