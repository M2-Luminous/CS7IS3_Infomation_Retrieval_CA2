He said he expressed his personal view. The official government position is delayed, obscure and inadequate, according to him. According to him, the policy pursued by the Macedonian authorities, of putting obstacles to normal good-neighbourly relations, could lead to a review of the Bulgarian position, and a firmer Bulgarian stand on Macedonia.
