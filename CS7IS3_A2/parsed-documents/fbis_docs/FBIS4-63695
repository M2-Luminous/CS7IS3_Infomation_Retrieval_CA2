This appeal has been prompted by the fact that international parliamentary figures and blocs from various European and other countries have recently sent letters to the speaker of the Kurdistan National Council, the Kurdistan parliament, in Irbil. The letters call on him to hold a parliament meeting to discuss problems resulting from the current crisis and the regrettable clashes in Iraqi Kurdistan and provide solutions for them. The speaker of parliament responded to these letters, explaining the situation as it really is. Respected listeners; Our people's friends from the members of world parliaments are, of course, right. What they demand should be achieved because logically it is the best way out of the crisis if there are attentive people with sound eyes and ears. However, the facts on the ground are both comic and tragic. The Kurdistan parliament is besieged by war. To make what we say more explicit, we say: 1. On a momentous hour the night of 3-4 May 1994, the fighters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] headed for the parliament building in Irbil. After disarming and beating the parliament's guards, they occupied the building and plundered some of the furniture. Then they went to the roof of the building and transformed it into a trench for confrontation and battles. 2. Despite bilateral [as heard] attempts and other attempts within the framework of the Kurdistan Front, the PUK fighters continued to occupy the building. 3. In a report disseminated worldwide on 20 May 1994, REUTER correspondent, Mr. (Alistair Belloc), said that the PUK fighters are occupying the parliament and other government buildings in Irbil. 4. The PUK fighters attacked a number of ministries and government departments, especially the finance and education ministries. They broke doors and looted some furniture. They placed barricade over the roofs of these buildings. 5. Fighters of the PUK are establishing barricades and checkpoints on streets leading to the parliament and Council of Ministers buildings, as well as the education, finance, culture, and other ministries which are adjacent to each other and very close to the parliament building. Thus, it is very difficult to hold a parliament meeting in this tense atmosphere and amid these military measures. Naturally, we warmly welcome initiatives and appeals by our friends from world parliaments and parliamentary blocs in various countries. We support presenting problems and tackling them in parliament because this is the natural solution of the problem. But how can a meeting be convened under the shadow of arms and in a tense atmosphere? Therefore, we propose that all fighters should withdraw as soon as possible from the roof and from inside the parliament building, that the protection of the building should be restored to the original guards entrusted with protecting parliament, that the stolen furniture be restored to the building, that the fighters leave all government departments, and that the barricades and checkpoints should be removed from all roads and streets leading to the parliament and Council of Ministers buildings. Only then will there be an appropriate atmosphere to consider convening the parliament so it can exercise its natural legislative role in an atmosphere of security and freedom.
