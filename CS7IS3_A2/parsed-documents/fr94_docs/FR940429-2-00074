ACTION: Notice of Debarment, Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation. SUMMARY: This notice advises of the debarment of Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation (hereafter ``Commonwealth Aluminum''), as an eligible bidder on Government contracts and subcontracts or other modifications of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts. The debarment is effective immediately. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Annie Blackwell, Director Program Policy, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave., NW., Room C&hyph;3325, Washington, DC 20210 (202&hyph;219&hyph;9430). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 10, 1994, pursuant to 41 CFR 60&hyph;741.29(b)(3), the Acting Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards (``Assistant Secretary'') issued a Final Decision and Order: (1) Finding Commonwealth Aluminum in violation of Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 793), and its implementing regulations; and (2) debarring Commonwealth Aluminum, its officers, subsidiaries, and successors, as eligible bidders on Government contracts and subcontracts or other modifications of existing Government contracts or subcontracts, if the company fails to comply with any provision of the Order within the specified time periods. The Final Decision and Order required Commonwealth to give the complainants, who are identified therein, offers of employment and award them appropriate seniority and all other applicable benefits in accordance with the Final Decision and Order within 60 days of receipt of the Order. It is now in excess of 60 days from the date Commonwealth received a certified copy of the Final Decision and Order. None of the complainants identified in the Final Decision and Order have received offers of employment, appropriate awards of seniority and all other applicable benefits. Therefore, it is necessary to commence the debarment process. This debarment will remain in effect until Commonwealth Aluminum satisfies the Assistant Secretary that it is in compliance with Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act and the regulations and orders issued thereunder which have been found to have been violated. A copy of the Final Decision and Order is attached. Signed April 21, 1994, Washington, DC. Shirley J. Wilcher, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
