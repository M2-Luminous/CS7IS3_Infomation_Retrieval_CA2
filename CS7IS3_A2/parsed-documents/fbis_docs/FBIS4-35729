In their meeting, the king rejected Israel's request to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports. [Begin Hecht recording] The birth of the peace process approximately one year ago was accompanied by impressive political dividends: bonuses from Washington, cries of hallelujah from Western capitals, and mainly public expressions of friendliness from Arab states. Over the past few months, enthusiasm seems to have waned and the region's capitals are giving Jerusalem the cold shoulder. Among other things, this has been reflected in opinion polls by a sharp drop in the percentage of public support for the peace process. Jerusalem is in need of some fireworks and King Hassan of Morocco told Foreign Minister Peres that he was not the address. I can be friendly towards Israel, the king explained, our security services can readily cooperate with each other, but the time is still not ripe for diplomatic relations. The king stressed that his unique status in the Arab League permitted him to act effectively on regional issues and establishing diplomatic relations with Israel would, in his opinion, terminate this state of affairs. This week, the Moroccan king received Labor Knesset Member [MK] Rafi Edri on two occasions. On the first occasion, Edri was accompanied by Mrs. Feldman, the mother of soldier Tzvi Feldman who has been missing in action since the battle of al-Sultan Ya'qub. The king promised to do all he could, stressing that this matter was beyond politics and that he considered it an important humanitarian effort. In their second meeting, Edri handed the king a letter from Prime Minister Rabin. King Hassan surprised MK Edri when, in a rare gesture, he awarded him the Moroccan officers' order, which is a very highly regarded commendation. Shim'on Peres hoped to score some tangible political achievements in Rabat; however, all the signs indicate that he will have to be satisfied with a profuse display of sympathy. It is nevertheless possible that Hassan may accede to Peres' request to host an international economic convention in Rabat within the framework of the multilateral process headed by the foreign minister.

The report points out that "These senior officials categorically denied that the trip was designed to set up a back-channel for talks with Syria," noting that "Israeli officials insist that the Hassan-Peres meeting should be seen in a bilateral, economic context."]
