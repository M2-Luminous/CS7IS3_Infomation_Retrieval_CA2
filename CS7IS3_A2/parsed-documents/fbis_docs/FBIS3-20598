Analysis and Summary of Xinjiang's Current Cotton Industry"] [Text] Xinjiang's cotton industry, which had been brilliant, now faces the straits of a "cold winter." People look forward to the coming of spring. The cotton industry in Xinjiang enjoyed a good time for production and sales in the eighties, making it one of the "three types of high" industries of high output value, high profit, and high income, and jumped to the status of one of the region's pillar industries. The implementation of reform has pushed cotton industry enterprises into the market. Now the cotton industry is finding it hard to survive, lying where the mountains and the rivers end--at the end of its resources, anxiously anticipating the coming of new hope. Looking at the regional cotton industry's output for January to September, the forecast for 1993 was for a 3.89 percent decrease from 1992. Among the major cotton products, estimates were that only 700,000 units of yarn would be produced, an 11.81 percent reduction from 1992; only an estimated 210 million meters of cotton cloth accomplished, down 6.51 percent from 1992, and at the level of a decade ago; only an estimated 39 million meters of printing and dying cloth, a reduction of 28.55 percent from 1992, and only slightly higher than the output of 30 years ago. Up to the end of September last year, the gross industrial output value achieved was 960 million yuan, a reduction of 19.13 percent for the same period in 1992. The cumulative loss for the cotton industry was 120 million yuan. The cotton industry's fall from its previous brilliance to its current difficult situation is due to the following factors: --The scale of the national cotton industry is too big, with gross supplies exceeding demand, so products accumulate badly. In 1980, China had 17.80 million spindles of cotton yarn; in 1990, this had increased rapidly to 42 million spindles of cotton yarn, while the practical demand was for just 27 million spindles. In the past decade, the spindles in storage occupied over 40 percent of the year's requirement. --A heavy burden of "triple debt" and declining efficiency led to enterprises' shortages of operating funds. Based on Cotton Bureau statistics, cotton enterprises currently owe more than 300 million yuan to cotton and gunny companies for raw material, and owe over 500 million yuan to cotton plants outside the region. Combined with enterprise losses, it has led to shortages of capital, forcing some enterprises to stop or cut back on production. --A lower level of equipment and production quality and standard. At present, the regional production scale is up to 100 thousand spindles, with only 4.6 percent having world advanced equipment, while 17.4 percent of them being equipments which should have been eliminated before the founding of new China or in the fifties. Enterprises lack staying power, and their products noncompetitive. --There is a big shortage of transportation. Two-thirds of Xinjiang's cotton products are sold outside the region, which is about 120,000 tons of cotton products going out of Xinjiang every year. The market is focused chiefly along the Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang areas; a shortage of railway cars makes transportation difficult, which seriously affects enterprises' production and sales. --Unstable teams of enterprise staff and workers. Low economic efficiency causes low income among staff and workers, so there is a serious outflow of technical mainstays. --A lot of work is urgently needed to bring a "brilliant spring" in the cotton industry. One way of accomplishing this is through earning foreign currency by export. It is only by stressing the production of high standard, high quality, and high level products can enterprises create international markets. In 1993, as a new force suddenly coming to the fore, the Kuerle Cotton Plant did extraordinarily well in its pursuit of exports. From January to September, they exported 6,399 tons of cotton yarn, with an export value of 20.62 million yuan, which constituted 40 percent of Xinjiang's total. This greatly increased efficiency, and the 1993 forecast is for losses to be down 55 percent from last year. Enterprises change patterns and styles in order to survive. The Shihezhi Bayi Wool Spinning Plant took the lead in establishing a new enterprise management guidance principle of "taking the market as the leading direction, taking sales as the head, taking efficiency as the focal point." They carried out self-decision operations, self-responsibility for profits and losses, and self-planned development, put over 40 million yuan into technology replacement, introduced advanced equipment, finally spinning 65-80 high-tech yarn, and a high-woof, light, thin, product of about 300g for the south China market. By developing new products, they created an output value of 139 million yuan from January to September last year, leading the enterprise onto a good circulation track. Pay attention to the enterprise, dig out its internal potential, increase income while cost-cutting, reduce expenditures on raw materials, and realize efficiencies from basic enterprise management. Favorable policies are sorely needed. For the cotton industry, Xinjiang has the obvious shortcoming of poor location, so it can compete with inland enterprises only through good quality and low price. Last year's cotton price rise no doubt was a case of "snow added to frost" for the cotton industry. The government should: extend favorable policies on technology replacement, loans, and investment; reform the cotton supply system, reducing middlemen by guaranteeing the supply of raw materials; and, in addition, absolutely prohibit price rises in cotton circulation links to help enterprises get through these difficult times and get on a good circulation track. If these things are done, for Xinjiang's cotton industry the snow will melt, the rains stop, the winds cease, and the spring breezes blow again.
