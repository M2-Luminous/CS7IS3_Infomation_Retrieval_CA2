He said the service in the Catholic Church for the slain communist leader showed the importance of the Church in the struggle for change in South Africa. He said Mr Hani had been one of South Africa's most important revolutionaries. Outside the church, Mr Mandela addressed about 300 people. "We want a better life for all our people without exception. We are the only organisation in this country which has been in the forefront of building a national unity. And this audience indicates our success. We have all communities represented here. I hope to come here and thank you after April 27 (election date)," he said. ANC supporters formed a guard of honour outside the church where they hoped to catch a glimpse of Mr Mandela as he left the church grounds. The group of about 400 men were armed with traditional weapons and stood silently with their fists raised in a black power salute on either side of the road. The armed men were dressed with sheets and blankets under which many of them hid their weapons. They were reportedly from surrounding squatter settlements on the East Rand. Peace monitors and ANC marshals formed a human chain between the men and the middle of the road through which the Mandela convoy was expected to travel.
