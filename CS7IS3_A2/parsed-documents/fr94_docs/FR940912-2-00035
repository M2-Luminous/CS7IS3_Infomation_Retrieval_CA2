FR940912-2-00035 FR940912-2-00031 V.W. Smith Oil, Inc., 5/3/94, LEE&hyph;0081 V.W. Smith Oil, Inc. (V.W. Smith) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering this request, the DOE found that the firm was not suffering gross inequity or serious hardship. On February 28, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied. No Notice of Objections to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the DOE within the prescribed time period. Therefore, the DOE issued the Proposed Decision and Order in final form, denying V.W. Smith's Application for Exception. Interim Order Hunt Oil Co., 5/3/94, LEN&hyph;0086 Hunt Oil Co. filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the requirement to file Form EIA&hyph;782B in which the firm sought relief from filing the form. In considering the request, the DOE found that interim exception relief was necessary to alleviate a serious hardship to the reporting firm. Accordingly, interim exception relief was granted. Although the reporting requirement did not create the hardship, it aggravated the situation faced by Hunt. Refund Applications ASARCO Incorporated_Ray Unit ASARCO Incorporated, 5/3/94, RF272&hyph;13526, RD272&hyph;13526, RF272&hyph;25467 The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two Applications for Refund filed on behalf of ASARCO Incorporated_Ray Unit and ASARCO Incorporated in the crude oil special refund proceeding being disbursed by the DOE under 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined that the refund claims were meritorious and granted a refund of $175,157. However, the DOE denied a portion of the claim, because it was based on gallons of petroleum products covered by price escalator clauses. The DOE also denied a Motion for Discovery filed by a consortium of States and two Territories and rejected their challenge to the claim. The DOE denied the States' Objections, finding that the industry-wide econometric data submitted by the States did not rebut the presumption that the Applicant was injured by the crude oil overcharges. Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)/Idaho, 5/4/94, RM21&hyph;268 The DOE issued a Decision and Order approving a Motion for Modification of a previously-approved second-stage refund plan filed by the State of Idaho (Idaho). In its Motion, Idaho requested the authority to use $175,096.29 of its uncommitted Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) second-stage refund monies to fund four projects in Idaho's State Energy Conservation Program. The DOE affirmed the timely restitutionary benefits of the plan to promote the efficient use to energy in Idaho. The DOE also identified the proposed recipients of those benefits (the people of Idaho) as a substantial segment of injured consumers of refined petroleum products. The Idaho plan was thus found to satisfy the criteria for a second-stage refund restitutionary program. Accordingly, Idaho's Motion for Modification was approved.
