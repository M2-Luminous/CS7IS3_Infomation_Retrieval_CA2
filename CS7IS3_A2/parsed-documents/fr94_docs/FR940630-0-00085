FR940630-0-00085 FR940630-0-00035 The chart entitled ``Analytical Methods'' in §141.89(a) contains typographical errors in the methodology listing for orthophosphate. The chart was printed correctly in the preamble (56 FR 26510). The corrected chart is included in this notice. In addition, EPA is updating the chart to refer to methods at §141.89(a) which are contained in the current editions of (1) EPA drinking water methods manuals, (2) Standard Methods, and (3) the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Annual Book of Standards. Compared to the earlier version of a method, the version now cited at §141.89(a) is the same. EPA method 300.0, which had been published individually, is now reprinted in a manual issued by EPA in 1993. EPA methods 200.7, 200.8, and 200.9 are now reprinted in a manual published in 1991. The EPA methods, the methods in the 18th edition of Standard Methods, and in the 1993 ASTM book contain changes to the previous versions that are typographical, grammatical, or editorial in nature. The inclusion or republication of methods in new manuals or books requires the following changes to footnotes at §141.89(a). Footnote 1 is updated to include the NTIS order number. Footnotes 2 and 3 are updated to the 18th edition of Standard Methods and the 1993 ASTM book, and are renumbered as footnotes 3 and 4. The methods in footnotes 5, 6, and 7 are contained in the manual cited at the new footnote 2. Footnote 6, which explains when to digest water samples for total metals, is revised slightly to be identical to the same explanatory footnote for other metals, which is found at §141.23(k). Footnote 9 has also been renumbered as footnote 6. Footnote 8 has been revised to cite the manual which now contains Method 300.0. Footnotes 7, 9 and 10 are reserved. Footnote 11 has been added because that method is now found in a different reference. The Practical Quantitation Levels (PQLs) for lead and copper are defined in §141.89(a). EPA has received input from State drinking water programs and laboratories that the value of these PQLs are not clearly stated in §141.89(a)(1)(ii) and that it is unclear whether the numbers in paragraphs 141.89(a)(3) and 141.89(a)(4) refer to the PQL or one-half the PQL. The PQLs are 0.005 mg/L for lead and 0.050 mg/L for copper. The basis for these PQLs is discussed in the preamble to the final rule (56 FR 26511). EPA is revising §141.89(a)(1)(ii) to clearly reflect the PQL of 0.005 mg/L for lead in subparagraph (A) and the PQL of 0.050 mg/L for copper in subparagraph (B). In addition, EPA is revising §141.89(a)(3) to consolidate §§141.89 (3) and (4) and to reference the lead and copper PQLs defined in §141.89(a)(1)(ii). Section 141.90(g) requires that any monitoring data collected in addition to that required by 40 CFR part 141, subpart I (The Lead and Copper Rule) be submitted by the end of the reporting period. This could be construed as inconsistent with the other paragraphs of §141.90, which require that monitoring data be submitted within ten days of the end of the monitoring period. The ten-day delay is allowed for processing, collating and reporting of data. EPA did not intend this inconsistency. To make §141.90(g) consistent with other reporting requirements in §141.90, EPA is amending §141.90(g) to allow ten days for submittal of additional data.
