Kim, the first civilian chief executive in more than three decades, spent the first year of his administration cleaning up irregularities and corruption, most committed during the two previous administrations led by Army generals. In the second year, Kim obviously wants to embark on the construction of "a new Korea," through reconciliation and harmony through dialogue. Viewed from this angle, many believe Monday's presidential get-together will provide an auspicious and extremely well-timed beginning. The luncheon, to be attended only by Kim and former presidents Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, is expected to draw keen public attention as it could provide an opportunity for Chon and No to make up their personal animosity. Asked the meaning of the meeting, presidential spokesman Chu Ton- sik said, "don't we all know without someone elaborating on it?" Politicians are free, of course, to attach any significance they wish to the lunch, Chu added. The invitation of Choe to the meeting can be viewed purely as a courtesy. But with Chon and No, both former presidents were wrongdoers when Kim was leader of a democratization movement in the 1980s. Even after the Democratic Liberal Party was formed in 1990 through a merger of three political parties, including No's ruling Democratic Justice Party and Kim's Reunification Democratic Party, there was continuous friction between No and Kim, who was the DLP chairman, especially during the process of selecting the party's standard bearer. Seen from this viewpoint, Monday's meeting is a gesture for reconciliation on the part of the current president. Immediately following his inauguration, Kim defined the so-called Dec. 12, 1979, affair as "a coup d'etat-like incident," putting Chon in a tight position for leading a group of lower-ranking Army officers against their superiors and grabbing power. Kim also ordered an investigation of the construction of the Peace Dam by Chon's administration and possible irregularities in the Yulgok military buildup program under No's administration. In the process, many came to fear that a peaceful and amicable transfer of power from one president to the next may be impossible in this country, and the successor will always expose the misrule and irregularities of his predecessor. It was during this process that close friends Chon and No became estranged, with Chon imposing exile on himself in a remote Buddhist temple and harboring bitter feelings against No for not protecting him and his administration from a public outcry. As for Kim, the president must realize that he can no longer afford to cling to "past affairs" if his administration is to march forward and begin to show the "tangible benefits" of having civilian government to the people following a year of reform and anti- corruption campaigns. Kim must also realize that he now stands at the point where he could and should recruit support and take advantage of "the experience" of the former presidents for effective execution of national policy. Unless he shows the magnanimity by which to reconcile with his erstwhile persecutors and have harmonious relations with them, he will find it difficult to appeal to the people for reconciliation and unity, especially within his own party.
