FBIS4-30575 "dreas124_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 25 Jun 1994 South Korea Paper on DPRK Media Denouncing ROK, U.S. Paper on DPRK Media Denouncing ROK, U.S. SK2606013394 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean 25 Jun 94 p 5 SK2606013394 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO Korean BFN [By Yu Yong-ku] [Text] With the 28 June preliminary contact for South-North summit talks and the 8-11 July North Korean-U.S. high-level talks just ahead, the North Korean authorities' remarks slandering the South and the United States have diminished. However, North Korea continues to denounce South Korea and the United States through its media and broadcast from the truce line to the South. This makes people wonder about North Korea's real intention. North Korea's domestic Central Broadcasting Network and Pyongyang Radio to South Korea recently carried commentaries berating the United States for aggravating tensions and denouncing the ROK for preparing for a war, citing the U.S. Forces' moves on and around the Korean peninsula and U.S. officials' remarks on the North Korean nuclear issue. The North Korean broadcasting services stress each day that the situation on the Korean peninsula is "on the brink of war," denounce the United States for preparing "the second Korean war," regard the ROK's strengthening of its alert posture as a "war maneuver for a northward invasion," and do not hesitate in making such unsparing words as "war to war" and "South Korea will not be safe, either." With important talks ahead, it is hard for us to understand a North Korea that continues to denounce its counterparts. However, we do not have to pay serious attention to this since such North Korean attitudes are not new. North Korea has never stopped slandering, not even during South-North high-level talks, working-level contacts for an exchange of envoys, or North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. This is aimed at having an advantage in negotiations. That is, by continuously expressing its strong position, North Korea intends to have its counterparts make concessions. This is also aimed at preparing to cope with a possible worse situation in the contacts with South Korea and the United States. North Korea believes that, in order to safeguard its system, it should prevent the people's ideological stir even if the outside situation changes somewhat. In light of the fact that the North Korean people are all the more urged to unite around Kim Chong-il on the occasion of the anniversary of the Korean war, it seems that North Korea's denunciation of South Korea and the United States has an internal political purpose to strengthen Kim's position. This is proved by Pyongyang's radio special talk on 22 June that stressed, "Let us overwhelm the enemy in the serious political and military confrontation without gunfire and firmly defend the national sovereignty by upholding General Kim Chong-il." As they announced the resumption of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks following North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a victory of Supreme Commander Kim Chong-il's determination, the North Korean media are probably preparing to attribute any successful result of the upcoming dialogue with South Korea and the United States to North Korea's intransigence under international pressure to defend its sovereignty.
