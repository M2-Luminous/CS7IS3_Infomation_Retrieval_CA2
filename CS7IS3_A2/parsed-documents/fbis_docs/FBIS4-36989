This is the question being raised today. The prime minister's visit to the United States is a matter of honor to the ruling and the opposition parties. The opposition parties had raised questions in the parliament with the apprehensions that the Narasimha Rao government would probably succumb to the American pressure on the stalemate on signing Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, human rights, and the Kashmir issue. Their voices in the parliament convinced the prime minister that he should clearly apprise the Clinton administration of the Indian stance on these issues and should return home without succumbing to any pressure. Besides, being a prime minister with a slight majority in the parliament, Narasimha Rao was in a suicidal situation, if he would bow down to any such pressures. It is a matter of gratification that Narasimha Rao was firm on very important issues and clarified India's points in his address at the American Congress. Now nobody can find fault with the prime minister and say that he failed in putting forward national issues. Another significant feature is that the prime minister made his position amply clear. Does this mean that the differences with the United States have been completely overcome? No. We have presented our contradicting views in a slightly different manner at the talks held with the U.S. President. In other words, we have made it clear that we will be by and large friendly even though differences of opinion persist. At the Indo-U.S. summit-level talks, differences existed, especially on Pakistan and the nuclear weapons issue. President Clinton's statement confirmed that he endorses Islamabad's views and Benazir Bhutto's statements that Pakistan does not supply arms to the extremists to help the secessionist forces in Kashmir. At the same time, the United States did not accept Pakistan's contention that India does not have any right in Kashmir, as the extremists have an upper hand there. It has supported the view that Pakistan and India should hold bilateral talks under the Simla agreement. This indicates the United States position that it wants to support neither Pakistan nor India in this matter. Besides saying that Kashmir does not belong to India, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel also spoke about human rights abuses in Kashmir. Islamabad has also been voicing the same concern. However, now the issue of human rights abuses rears its head in Washington infrequently. Washington does not want to have too much discussion with India on the human rights issue. Now, the United States has retraced its steps from criticizing India on the human rights issue. This shift in stance was noticed earlier at the UN Human Rights Commision conference in Geneva. There, the U.S. representative did not support Pakistan's resolution against India, and he kept quiet. Thus, the United States' behavior of changing its stance whimsically on the issue of human rights abuses is not a surprising thing nor something new. Earlier, there was strong criticism against the Chinese Government for cracking down on innocent students at Tiananmen Square in 1989. However, when it was the question of commercial cooperation, the United States did not hesitate to grant Most Favored Nation status to China. On the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] issue, the gap between New Delhi and Washington has not been bridged. This issue was not included at the Washington talks as India has been saying that the NPT was discriminatory. It clearly shows that both countries have different perceptions on this issue. However, the United States wants to resolve the nuclear nonproliferation issue through talks at the regional level. This implies the United States' position that Pakistan and India can hold talks on the issue. However, India is of the view that this issue should be discussed nor resolved at global level. In other words, India's stand is that nuclear nonproliferation cannot be achieved by the reduction of nuclear weapons by some countries through regional-level or bilateral talks. Therefore, although differences persist between them, the United States and India have come to the conclusion that the issue should be resolved through continuous bilateral talks. Nuclear nonproliferation is the most significant element of the Clinton administration's foreign policy. However, the behavior and activities of the corporate bodies in the United States have a say in the final decision of the Clinton administration. That is why the United States had to play a dubious role and devise its policies in China's matter. As far as India is concerned, in the joint statement issued by President Clinton and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, both countries expressed their willingness to strike a "new partnership". This term has not been used with any member of the Atlantic family. [sentence as published] It can be construed that the interest evinced by American megacompanies to grab India's colossal markets and encourage investment there is the cause for issuing this term. Keeping this in mind, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao called on the directors of megacompanies in New York, Houston, and Washington during his visit. This approach has never been used by any other prime minister of India. These meetings were arranged as a prelude to the meetings in coming years, maybe within a few months. American companies are making efforts to grab the opportunities available in India before the companies from the European Community or Japan take the initiative and seize the markets. Following the mega American companies, nonresident Indians are showing keen interest to invest in their motherland in this regard. After great calculations, Indian authorities speculate that the nonresident Indians will also invest in a big way, if American companies start investing in Indian markets. That is why, in various states, local affinity is getting stronger. The tendency to invest according to the origin of the investors such as Bengalis, Gujarathis, Punjabis, and Maharashtrians, is becoming conspicuous now. With a view to bring American capital to the country, the prime minister has extended an invitation to the nonresident Indians to invest in India. This has been viewed as an act of gambling. Any outside intervention is a matter of great anxiety to the Indians. When the gigantic American companies like Ford, General Motors, or Exxon establish their sway in India and if, out of a sheer sense of patriotism, there is a call for sponsoring only indigenous goods in the country, it cannot be easily rejected. Because, when economic forces join political forces to gain influence and if politicians back it, it will be a challenge to the honor of the country. Under these circumstances, corruption at higher levels will assume alarming proportions and will bury the system of democracy itself.
