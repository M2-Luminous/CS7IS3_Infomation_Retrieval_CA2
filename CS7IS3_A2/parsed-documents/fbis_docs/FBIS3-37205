The anthems of Great Britain and Russia were played. A guard of honour and a military band marched past the tomb. The traditional wreath-laying ceremony was an expression of the British people's gratitude to their ally under the anti-Hitlerite coalition, to the country that had saved mankind from fascism. Duddley Pound, First Lord of the Admiralty of Great Britain, wrote to Admiral King, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy, on May 18, 1942, that he deemed it necessary to render every possible aid to the Russians at that difficult time. These words attested to the British people's deep realisation of their allied duty. The British have contributed immensely to the aid rendered the Soviet Union in those years. It was marked by unprecedented scope, courage and solidarity. As many as 78 famous northern convoys, totalling about 1,500 transport ships, had sailed thousands of miles to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk through extremely dangerous waters during the four years of the Great Patriotic War. They delivered food and military hardware, ammunition and medicines to the Russian people. Russia will never forget that Great Britain had sacrificed the lives of many of its sons to help its Russian allies.
