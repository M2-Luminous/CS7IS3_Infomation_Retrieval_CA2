Sha'th told AL-HAYAH over the telephone yesterday that the Israeli response "which we might receive from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's office by fax or phone will deal with two fundamental points: first, the number of Palestinian police elements, their weapons, and their authority. Second, the number of international observers and their nationalities. If we get something that satisfies us, the agreement will be signed tomorrow, Tuesday, in Cairo, and a timetable will be drawn up immediately to implement this agreement, then we will move to complete the negotiations concerning Gaza and Jericho." He pointed out that "utmost precedence is at present given to security arrangements to Hebron. We will not complete the talks on Gaza and Jericho before we finish with this issue. And if Rabin is expecting us to begin the self-rule negotiations tomorrow, it means that he is going to offer us a satisfactory reply on Hebron today." He pointed out that Israel "is agreeing -- in principle -- for the first time to implement a Security Council resolution, even though some of the details have not yet been completed." He ruled out a meeting between President Yasir 'Arafat and Rabin "at present." However, he said that this will be on the cards "when we reach an agreement on all outstanding points." Well-informed Palestinian sources in Tunis have told AL-HAYAH that the PLO is demanding the participation of U.S., Russian, and Egyptian elements alongside the Norwegian elements in the provisional international observation force in Hebron, while Israel offers to accept only 20 Norwegian observers armed with pistols together with 30 elements from the International Red Cross Committee and 50 elements from the Palestinian police. The sources say that Israel wants the occupation authorities to be the authority to which the Palestinian police should refer, and it refuses to allow the international observation force to report to the cosponsors of the peace process, that is Washington and Moscow -- which is unacceptable to the PLO, which for its part believes that any effective foreign measures in Hebron require "hundreds of international observers, Palestinian police elements, and an international authority that guarantees implementation of Resolution 904 and hence a nonrepetition of the attacks on the people of the city." The sources ruled out the possibility that the differences between the two sides in this connection will be settled "today or tomorrow." They believe that "this may require a meeting in Cairo between 'Arafat and Rabin before any measure is implemented, whether with regard to Hebron, Gaza, or Jericho." The sources confirmed reports released over the past two days by more than one Israeli and U.S. official regarding the entry of Palestinian units into Gaza and Jericho "within days." They said that Israel has informed the PLO of its willingness to "immediately hand over to it the points the Israeli Army has evacuated in Gaza and Jericho. This could take place within 10 days. Thus it can be said that the implementation of some aspects of self-rule will begin before 13 April." [passage omitted]
