It would seem that the people, tired of political extremes, should have supported the Civic Union's "centrist" position. On top of that, your bloc had the support of numerous public organizations, including the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR]. So what is the reason for your poor showing at the elections? [Volskiy] To be honest, we did not entertain any particular illusions. And not because we doubted our program. On the contrary--we firmly believed in our particular motto: "reforms without shock." It has proven its correctness and vitality over the past two years. The evidence of that, among other things, is that our opponents also borrowed many planks from our program, and even some members of the government began to utter such words as social protection, state regulation, support for different forms of ownership. Many understood that reforms cannot be conducted at the expense of the people's material well-being, turning them into meek cogs. And, finally, it is unreasonable to present the "shock therapy" as the sole possible way of transition to a market. It appears, however, that we have not been able to gauge precisely the degree of the public's expectations, the depth of society's fatigue, and have not been able convincingly to present the alternative we offered. I also think that we have not conveyed in a sufficiently argumented way and convincingly enough our ideas to those who form public opinion: journalists, politicians, and experts. We have not exposed the myths about centrism, which sometimes was portrayed as a sort of camouflaged anti-reformist stance, or almost as a "bureaucratic fifth column." Of course, such characterizations--sometimes deliberately dishonest, sometimes superficial, sometimes naive or conformist, have not added to our popularity among the voters at a time when they were being promised that already on 13 December everything would be different. By the way, that date is long past. What has changed? [Loktev] With which political parties and coalitions that have received the majority of votes will the Civic Union deputies form a bloc in the Duma? [Volskiy] Civic Union representatives in the Duma, elected in single-seat districts, are geared for constructive work. Least of all would I want to speak about this work in terms of "bloc" positions, struggle and victories, "storm and attack," because in the final count among the losers inevitably will be the people and their interests. We are willing to support and will support any realistic and substantiated draft laws aimed at advancement of real reforms beneficial for all Russians who produce something, regardless of the form of enterprise's ownership. Civic Union deputies will not impose confrontation and intolerance. We want to be consistent to the end and not divide deputies into "ours" and "not ours," or, God forbid, into fascists and anti-fascists. It seems to me that regardless of convictions, the prevailing qualities in the Duma should be competency, professionalism, a high degree of responsibility and understanding of our common duty to the people and the country. But, of course, our constructive stance is clearly delineated: stability, justice, and progress. [Loktev] Do forgive me, but this triad of terms, while sounding great, does resemble a populist slogan. What specifically do you mean by these high-sounding words? [Volskiy] In our understanding, stability means that the reforms are weighted and thought through; that we reject "great leaps," violence, and revolutionary expediency. Justice is when a majority of the population can live rather than just survive. Progress is when Russia is being reborn, not degenerating--whether in the economic sphere, science, culture, or education. Within this rather broad framework, we are ready to cooperate with anyone who is imbued with a desire to act for the good of Russia, of the people of our motherland--not striving to invent more illusions or loud slogans, or being concerned about their own benefit. So that our voters would feel real changes for the better instead of being hoodwinked by empty, unrealistic promises. [Loktev] Much has already been said about the "Zhirinovskiy party's phenomenon," the reasons for LDPR's [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] success at the elections. Still, what is your opinion on the subject? [Volskiy] I would like you to get me right. I think that the LDPR's electoral success is a serious alarm bell, first and foremost for the authorities. The authorities in Russia are losing authority. Presidential edicts and government decrees are being ignored. Banditism has been "ennobled" by calling it "racketeering," and these very racketeers in front of everybody, including the militia, insolently and with impunity engage in shooting, extortion, robbery, and murder. Law enforcement agencies passionately register: the chairman of the Rosselkhozbank is killed in broad daylight; a joint-stock company director is killed; someone else is killed.... If this continues, Russians will soon be going from home to work at a run: Attention, this side of the street is exposed to fire.... And then comes a man who promises to strangle crime by setting up courts-martial and executing gang leaders on the spot by firing squad. Well, I guess when the authorities do not sound alarms in this respect, some voters begin to think that Zhirinovskiy offers at least some hope. Let us look at another part of our problems. Have not some "reformers" fanned up the confrontation and intolerance in the society, have they not ignored demonstratively a sharp intensification of social contracts, have they not disregarded the vital social needs of millions of Russian citizens? Have not our people been subjected to humiliation? they have been labeled derogatorily as sharikovs [rabble], lumpens, sovoks ["new Soviet men"]. And the subjects of this derogatory name-calling are mostly those who feed the country, nourish it, keep it warm, those who heal and educate us.... I am convinced that the election results do not provide a sufficient reason to call someone publicly a fascist and frighten us with historic parallels. The country has a president, a Constitution, an office of the procurator general, judges, and laws. Personally, I do not believe in the possibility of the country "going fascist;" in my opinion, our people possess strong immunity against the brown virus. [Loktev] Enough about politics. Let us move on to a topic close to you: industry and production. As is known, Arkadiy Ivanovich Volskiy is the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [RUIE]. This job by itself prompts you to "ring all the bells" in connection with the extremely difficult situation in the economy, submit to the government proposals capable of at least halting somewhat the disintegration of key industrial sectors.... [Volskiy] Not a day goes by, probably, without us receiving yet another piece of alarming news of partial or complete stoppage of enterprises. Tractor production at the Kirov plant has been suspended until 1 February; workers have been sent on an administrative leave. Several hundred K-700 "Kirovets" tractors are standing, ready for shipment, in the plant's yard, worth a total of R10 billion. The customers, mostly Russian agricultural enterprises, cannot take delivery of the products, because they cannot pay. The Altaysk, Volgograd, Vladimir, and Lipetsk tractor plants are idle, as well as the Taganrog combine plant. The Krasnoyarsk automotive trailer plant, too. Rostselmash is working on an irregular schedule. The general decline of production in agricultural and tractor machine building already has reached 30 percent (as compared to last year). The Gorkiy Auto Works alternately comes to a halt and then back to life; the assembly line of my home enterprise--the ZIL [imeni Lenina Auto Works]--moves only four days a week, and even that only for one shift. Work week has been cut at the VAZ [Volga Auto Works]. In the middle of December approximately 12,000 plant workers were sent on the administrative leave. What is lurking behind these separate facts is the specter of unemployment, which threatens to materialize within the next few months into a fully tangible army of the unemployed. Already now, if we use the International Labor Organization methodology, 3.8 million persons in Russia should be counted as unemployed; this is 5 percent of the able-bodied population--not 1 percent (750,000) as official statistics tell us. If we count potentially unemployed--those not fully employed, people on administrative leave, and so on--their total number will come to 7.8 million, or slightly more than 10 percent of able-bodied population. The RUIE had warned as early as in the summer that unless urgent measures are worked out, unless the circulatory system of our industry is revived, in the fall and winter enterprises will stop, and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of workers, technicians, and engineers will find themselves on the street. Our warnings were shrugged off; we were told that inflation was going down, production was stabilizing, the reform had passed its critical point, and everything would start improving any time now. That is, we were sounding all the alarms, but all we heard in response was that the RUIE was attempting to turn things back to the command-administrative system and appease the directors corps. You may shrug us off, but you cannot shrug off reality. We did not engage in empty criticism. The RUIE submitted a score of proposals to both the government and the Supreme Soviet. For instance, we proposed immediately to begin implementing targeted programs of retraining those who had lost their jobs, and start creating additional jobs through the development of a public works program. We also proposed--and these proposals are still topical--to work in the direction of freeing the economy from being overrun by middlemen, especially speculators. Speaking of unemployment, we believe that there still is time to avert the catastrophe by combining the efforts of the government, entrepreneurs, and trade unions. In particular, it is necessary to codify not only in a law, but also in a sort of an agreement among entrepreneurs, a statute that in changing the form of ownership, an enterprise's specialization, or even a bankruptcy, a one-time cutback in the labor force should not exceed 20 percent of the total. We also believe it necessary to establish special funds for assisting the unemployed, their retraining, as well as settling accounts with those enterprises that owe back wages and pensions. A natural question comes up: Do these proposals indeed perhaps lead to a slowdown of reforms or their curtailment? No, and once again, emphatically no! You will not find in any RUIE document even a hint at it. The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs has always supported and will support energetic implementation of economic reforms. But we have always said, keep saying, and will do so in the future, that the mechanisms of reform implementation absolutely have to take into account the specifics of Russia and our current reality. Otherwise, we will have a sharp rise in social tension in the country; we will see the number of opponents of the reforms multiplying, and a threat to the reform itself. [Loktev] Right before the new year, A. Chubays, the chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for the Administration of State Property, said: The Russian program of privatization has been fulfilled. And this was not an unsubstantiated statement--it was supported by impressive figures. Do you agree with such an appraisal of the privatization process? [Volskiy] If you look at the figures, it appears to move on at a speedy pace. In my opinion, however, what is happening in the sphere of privatization of plants and factories in Russia is the restoration of the Yugoslav model of "workers self-management," and in an inferior form, at that. I believe that privatization methods must be brought closer to a truly market approach; however, it should be done without sharp moves, so as not to destroy not only the former socialist system, but also the future capitalist one. The substance of privatization measures we offer is in tying it in with the interests of production, its stabilization and increased effectiveness. The system of these measures is very extensive; among them are extending the deadline and the range of use of the vouchers, making it possible to convert them into privatization bank deposits to be subsequently used for buying out land, purchasing apartments, construction and repair of housing, payment for medical services, and so on; to permit reciprocal ownership of shares of industrial and trade enterprises; to stimulate the creation of industrial-financial groups, including with the participation of supplier enterprises from near-abroad. [Loktev] Many specialists in the VPK [military-industrial complex] believe that a lot has been done wrong in the defense industry conversion, and that had we continued selling arms at previous levels, we could have had our own hard currency lifeline for the reform. In your opinion, will Russia be able to regain the positions it has lost in the world market of armaments? [Volskiy] My personal opinion is as follows: Of course, arms sales were very lucrative for the former Soviet Union and could be for Russia as well; it would allow for the attraction of the means we need so much for modernization and structural restructuring of the industry. However, as you well understand, it is extremely difficult to regain lost positions in world trade--the competitors are not sitting and waiting complacently. Besides, we should not forget our obligations to the world community. I think that Russia should not set its interests against those of maintaining world peace. At the same time, our diplomacy should urge Russia's partners to adopt the same approach and act accordingly. It is also necessary to go ahead with the conversion process, but do it sensibly and in a thought-through manner. I want to remind you that defense orders have drooped off by 67 percent, and our Armed Forces are half their former size. In these circumstances, it is important to retain the advance positions in science and technology we have already achieved, and meet the needs of defense with high-quality and, to the extent possible, the best armaments in the world. Let us not create another illusion, however, that the defense industry allegedly is capable of solving all our economic problems. We cannot avoid a large-scale structural restructuring and modernization of the entire production base, including agriculture. And defense production should take its strictly defined place among all others. At the same time, the state must understand that, having created a gigantic defense industry, it has certain obligations to it and to the people employed there, and has no right to abandon them to their own devices under the pretext of noninterference in economic matters. Yes, we need to scale down defense production, but not destroy the advanced scientific and technical base. I personally would like to see Russian automobiles, steel, tires, television sets, and other such items become as famous in international markets as our tanks, submachine guns, anti-aircraft missile systems, multiple missile launchers, and fighter aircraft. [Loktev] Arkadiy Ivanovich, a last--and as they say, frontal, question: If offered, is the RUIE willing to "delegate" its representatives into the government? [Volskiy] We are willing to take part in the government, but naturally, the government that would share our philosophy of reforms without shocks and unnecessary social costs. We are ready to undertake most decisive steps and reforms, but on the principle "Measure seven times before cutting." I would also like to use this opportunity to wish TRUD readers our most sincere good wishes and congratulations for the New Year.
