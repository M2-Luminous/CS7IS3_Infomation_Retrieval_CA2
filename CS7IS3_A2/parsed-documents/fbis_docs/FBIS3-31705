To judge by the frequent visits by international representatives, one would say that better days are ahead for Mostar. There is less and less firing in the city, and the talks on establishing an EC [European Community] administration over Mostar have been stepped up. Last night (Albert Benabu), UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] head for civilian affairs, held talks with members of the Mostar War Presidency, while today they held two hours of talks with (Fernando Sanchez Rau), head of the Spanish mission, and (Morris Mono), head of the French mission. Smajl Kvaric and Alija Alikadic, representatives of the Mostar authorities, stressed that the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities in Mostar supported the efforts of the EC to establish an EC administration over Mostar, but under certain conditions, which they had detailed last night in a written reply to General (Bo Pelvas), special envoy of Mr. Stoltenberg. These conditions are as follows: Mostar has to be an open city, and it cannot be a part of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, nor its capital; conditions have to be created for the return of the refugees and displaced people; in order for talks to continue with the Croatian side under international auspices, free entry of all humanitarian convoys has to be guaranteed, electricity has to be supplied to the eastern part of the city -- which has been without electricity for eight months -- water has to be restored, the Ploce-Mostar-Sarajevo humanitarian corridor has to be opened, medical evacuation of the seriously wounded from the city has to be allowed, [word indistinct] hospitals, medical and civilian premises have to be respected, and all prisoners have to be released.
