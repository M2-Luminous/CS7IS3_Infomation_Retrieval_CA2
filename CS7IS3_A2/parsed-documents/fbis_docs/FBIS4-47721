According to witnesses, public and private transporters resumed operations Monday [2 May], even if the schools, markets, hospitals and health centres of the northern outskirts of Bujumbura remained closed (following the outbeak of the crisis in October 1993). The Armed Forces during last week moved the populace to search all the houses of the Kamenge District and seized all the weapons illegally held by its inhabitants. No detail has been given as for the number of weapons found. Meanwhile, the death toll from the disturbances in the district has also not been specified, perhaps because of the large numbers killed on both sides. Observers have said, however, that 14 anti-tank rockets, all kinds of pistols, AK-47s and automatic rifles were seized. According to official figures, about 10,000 people affected by the police search were held for 24 hours, in poor conditions, in the capital's large "Prince Louis Rwagasore" Stadium of the capital last week. The new head of state, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, visited them on Saturday before they were released.
