The final details were decided during a meeting last night among President Itamar Franco, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economic team, six other ministers, and the counsel general in Planalto Palace. The final details of the provisional measure to implement the URV were decided last night during a meeting in Planalto Palace that lasted nearly nine hours. Three subjects were decided during the meeting: First, the minimum salary value as of tomorrow will be $64 or $65. Social Security Minister Sergio Cutolo, who also attended the meeting, recalled that with the URV, pensioners and retired workers will obtain an average increase of 17 percent. It has also been decided that the Labor Ministry will begin preparing a law on collective labor bargains. Finance Minister Cardoso has said that with the implementation of the URV, workers will no longer need to struggle to recover their lost purchasing power because this will no longer happen. In the future, they will struggle for real wage increases. Minister Cardoso said the provisional measure to establish the URV, which is published today in the Official Gazette, includes mechanisms to stop abusive price increases. Prices will not be converted into URV's. The minister guaranteed that this does not represent a price freeze. [Begin Cardoso recording] In case of price abuses, the provisional measure includes a provision that allows the Finance Ministry to summon private or public oligopolies and companies to explain why their prices surpassed the average price increase of the previous four months. We will then discuss how these oligopolies can transform their prices into URV's. Oligopolies are also free to resort to their industry associations to achieve a negotiated solution. There will be no price freeze, but there will be a mechanism to force those who commit price abuses to lower them in keeping with normal market costs. [end recording] The finance minister said the economic program is supported by the whole government. He said that neither private or public sector workers will loose their purchasing power with the conversion of their salaries into URV's based on the average increases of the previous four months. The finance minister said the main objective of the URV is to recover the workers purchasing power. The finance minister will today meet at 0830 [1130 GMT] with the chief editors of the main newspapers, radio and television stations to give a detailed explanation of all the changes that will come with the implementation of the economic stabilization plan and the URV in people's lives.
