The fact that the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has concluded consultations for an honorable peace in Chiapas -- consultations that resulted from the talks in San Cristobal de las Casas -- is an indication of the EZLN's sense of responsibility. As everyone knows, the EZLN's CCRI- CG [Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Movement - General Command] has declared itself in permanent session to discuss the opinions received and to make a response, which would be made known to the public. Therefore, we are at a crucial stage of the peace reconstruction process. The communities that were consulted were precisely those that decided to go to war. The fact that these communities have been consulted on the possibility of peace is in itself a political fact of the utmost importance. Of course, the conclusion of the consultation does not mean that a new step in favor of peace has been taken. Three strategic possibilities are presented as an outcome of the Chiapas conflict. The first one is that decisions by the sides, accidents, or social events foreign to the sides lead to an act of belligerence in the future. The second one is that the current situation, which has prevented war, might continue by the will of the sides as a result of new political decisions and the continuation of the truce, that is, by mediation and communication. The third possibility is that, as a result of the EZLN's current decision to hold consultations and the Mexican Government's own decisions, a new step can be taken to construct peace, which can increase security for the Chiapas community, the Mexican Army, the EZLN, and the country in general. The point we have reached is the result of a special effort for peace on the part of the government, the Mexican Army, the State of Chiapas, the Mexican Congress, the Chiapas Congress, the Higher Court of Justice of Chiapas, the Mexican society, and the EZLN, as well as mediation and the communities. All of these political forces have unanimously supported peace. This is not the time to wait with our arms crossed. If the required steps are not taken before the August elections, it will be very difficult to make any headway in the future. To consolidate progress in the peace process, today, I presented to the president of the Republic a confidential report on the status of the conflict and the political actions that the government can take, indicating the solution that I regard as the most appropriate considering the causes of the uprising and the solution that can protect the interests of society and the Mexican State. In this report, I requested the president of the Republic's support for decisions that might represent a new response of harmony to the EZLN's probable answer. In addition, today, I sent to the EZLN General Command a confidential communique mentioning the points that would increase the tranquility of society and the Mexican Army, reassure the EZLN itself, and represent a significant contribution for the peace process. Society is not asking to have the sides confront one another in a dilemma of peace or war. Instead, society demands a clear, unambiguous demonstration, such as the demonstrations at the beginning of the year, which made it possible to stop the war. On the one hand, society asks for a public expression -- with nonbelligerent actions -- of the EZLN's commitment for a political solution. On the other, society asks for a full definition -- with nonbelligerent actions -- on the part of the Mexican Government. No one should grow impatient in this decisive hour. For this reason, I hereby appeal to all political, social, and civil forces, economic sectors, national leaders, and the local and international media, to join their voices in support of the peace process. The possibility of a new step forward in the peace process is, not only in the hands of the EZLN, but in the hands of the government and civil society. This is the time for those truly concerned for peace to express themselves.
