To the sincere sons of our Yemeni people in Aden, the economic and trade capital. To those who defeated colonialism and upheld the values of truth, justice, and equality. To those who have been afflicted by the gang of a new brand of party dictatorship and by the elements of the clique of repression, apostasy, and secession. To the faithful ones who fight and struggled for a free Yemeni life but reaped instead slavery, oppression, and tyranny and paid a high price for the worst and most horrible Marxist and atheist experiment, which spread repression, nationalized property, and confiscated rights and liberties and forced on the good elements, even in the Socialist Party itself, ideological estrangement, homelessness, and harassment. To those who offered dozens of relatives as sacrifices to end the nightmare of the militias and to escape the massacres of the killers in the Socialist Party leadership for over 27 years of totalitarian regime, which severed the sinews of love between one brother and another, and between father and son, and destroyed the bridges of trust among the groups of society and shook people's confidence in themselves and in their ability to get rid of the party's shackles, of its rabid dogs, and the torture in its dungeons. To the free Yemeni people in the brave city of Aden--military and civilian, shopkeepers and laborers, men and women, boys and girls. To those who were at the forefront of the masses who on 22 May 1990 shouted long live the unity, and raised the banner of unity and democracy, and wiped out the partition and its deplorable remnants. To the fathers, brothers and sons; to the mothers and sisters, we ask you to take a firm, unwavering stand against the barbaric trap that has been set for you by the secessionist elements in the Socialist Party. Beware of them and know that the Armed Forces and security forces are your own forces, the forces of constitutional legitimacy, the protectors of unity and democracy. Therefore, these forces are to be trusted in caring for your life, security, and stability because they are responsible for the life of the entire people. Therefore, we are confident that you will always be with them, especially today when they are embarking on the heroic path and confronting the latest chapter in the plot of the secessionist gang, which the is taking of the tranquil life in Aden as a trench to protect it from the just punishment of heaven and from people's will. This gang is endeavoring to drag the Yemeni Armed Forces into storming this trench at the expense of your security and stability, a thing which this gang failed to realize, thanks to the astuteness of the political leadership of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, who has been issuing firm instructions to the Armed Forces' brave brigades and battalions and to the splendid men of the homeland's protectors that they should not be dragged into the plot prepared by the sanguinary elements of the Socialist Party, which aim to destroy the proud city of Aden in the wake of their utter and expected defeat. O free brothers, you are aware of the secessionist gang's hatred toward Aden and its inhabitants. You are aware that this sanguinary plot is an extension of the policy of destruction that the Socialist Party devils led on 13 January 1986. That is why we appeal to you to take the initiative, foil the plot, and join the trench of defending unity and democracy under the fluttering banner of constitutional legitimacy, and to face the secessionist gangs firmly, bravely, with conviction, and with an unwavering stand. We appeal to you to rob all those who rebel against constitutional legitimacy at any opportunity and to extend all kinds of support and backing to your heroic sons of the Yemeni Armed Forces, who will uproot the elements of apostasy and secession with God's backing and your support. They will eliminate those who endanger the homeland and bargain at the expense of the supreme people's interests. O free brothers, let the people's will, which is the will of justice, proceed with daring, strength, and capability. Let your cry roar and let us work together along the same path to save the unionist city of Aden from the secessionist plot so that it will remain safe and free and an honorable landmark of the new Yemeni homeland, which now belongs to the procession of the free world, thanks to its unity and democracy. Accursed be the plotters, the enemies of God and the people, the enemies of unity and democracy, and the enemies of life and democracy.
