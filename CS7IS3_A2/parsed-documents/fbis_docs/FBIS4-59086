Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid has formed a high-level delegation from the League's Secretariat led by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, assistant secretary general for military affairs, and assigned it to exert efforts to stop the fighting there, but the closure of the Sanaa airport precluded the arrival of the delegation. During the telephone conversation, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid underscored the interest of all member states to end the fighting and find an appropriate settlement of the Yemeni crisis that could ensure the unity, security, and stability of Yemen.
