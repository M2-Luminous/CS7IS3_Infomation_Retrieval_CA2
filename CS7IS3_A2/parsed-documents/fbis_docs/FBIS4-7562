The measure, announced without warning on March 3 by the Slovak government, immediately imposed the tax on all consumer goods from all countries. It was the second trade barrier thrown up by the Slovaks in three weeks. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, rushing to protect his country's exporters, responded with a 3 percent devaluation of the Czech crown in relation to the clearing ECU (the European Union's currency unit for trade payments between the two republics). The move effectively made Czech goods 3 percent less expensive in Slovakia and Slovak goods 3 percent more expensive in the Czech Republic. Slovak Finance Ministry officials described the tax as an attempt to raise money to shore up the country's trade deficit with the Czech Republic. They said it would remain in place for six months. "It's only temporary," said ministry spokesman Miroslav Polacek. "We have to get a better position for the balance of payments for the Slovak Republic. It's not for the defense of our internal market." Since the Czech-Slovak monetary union ended in February 1993, Slovakia has run a consistent deficit with the Czech Republic. Bratislava paid Prague $100 million to cover its deficit for December 1993 and January 1994. In February, however, Slovakia did not owe the Czech Republic anything, according to a spokesman for the Czech National Bank. Klaus said he recognized the move as "legitimate," but added that the two sides should reevaluate their customs union, the special arrangement that allows the two countries to be treated as a single trading bloc. "[The customs union] will exist," said Czech government spokeswoman Klara Pospisilova, "but probably the rules will change." Officials would not comment on details of possible changes, but Klaus will likely meet Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar next week. The new Slovak tax also raised the hackles of the international community, which had previously voiced loud opposition to a Slovak measure introduced on February 11 that suddenly required that certificates of quality for foodstuff imports be presented at the border. "We are not opposed to the measure as such. We are aware of their economic difficulties," said Gerhard Sabathil of the European Union's Prague delegation. "[But] there's a clear obligation of the country to consult such measures beforehand with the EU. And as we told them this three weeks ago when they introduced the certificates, it's really disappointing."
