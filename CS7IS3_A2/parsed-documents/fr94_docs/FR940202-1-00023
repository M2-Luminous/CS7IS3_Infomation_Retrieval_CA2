FR940202-1-00023 FR940202-1-00011 Regulations at section 433.139 govern State payment of claims where TPL is involved. There are two methods of paying claims for recipients with known TPL: The cost-avoidance method and the pay-and-chase method. Under the cost-avoidance method, the Medicaid agency does not initially pay the claim, but rather returns the claim to the provider with information necessary for the provider to bill the third party. Under the pay-and-chase method, an agency may pay the total amount allowed under its payment schedule and then seek recovery from the liable third parties. The agency must initiate recovery within 60 days after the end of the month in which payment is made. Most States that implement the requirements in our regulations at section 433.138 achieve significant Medicaid savings. Whenever third party resources can be utilized instead of Medicaid, both Federal and State taxpayers save money. In some instances, however, TPL requirements are not cost-effective. Some States have reported very poor results in terms of identifying new TPL leads through trauma and diagnosis code edits. There are reports that some codes never yield TPL. Currently, States may obtain a partial waiver from HCFA of the requirement in section 433.138(e) to take action to identify those paid claims for Medicaid recipients that contain diagnosis codes 800 through 999 (except that no State has to pursue information concerning code 994.6, motion sickness). Under section 433.138(e), the State may obtain a waiver from complying with the requirements for specific codes. In section 433.139(e), we also permit a State to request a waiver from HCFA of the cost-avoidance method of paying if the State could document that the pay-and-chase method was at least as cost-effective as the cost-avoidance method. The State is required to revalidate its cost-avoidance waiver request every 3 years and notify HCFA of any event that may change the cost-effectiveness of the waiver. When these requirements were established by HCFA, the Medicaid TPL program was in its infancy. Many States were not pursuing TPL or only recovering TPL passively; that is, making recoveries when contacted by a provider or attorney who was making a third party settlement. We believed there were tremendous untapped TPL resources that were not identified by States. Therefore, the initial regulations were broad and did not allow States discretion to decide whether or not to perform required TPL activities based upon their cost-effectiveness. For this reason, we issued TPL regulations which we have now determined were too prescriptive and, at times, duplicative. On February 27, 1987, we published in the Federal Register (52 FR 5971) a response to State comments regarding cost-effectiveness of our discretionary regulations at sections 433.138 and 433.139. We stated that we would reevaluate these requirements if we received substantial complaints. This rule is consistent with that statement. Currently, the majority of the States have aggressive and comprehensive TPL programs and have reported substantial savings from TPL activities. However, program experience has identified situations where some activities required by our regulations duplicate some State agency requirements in identifying new TPL leads. Also, situations have been identified where some of our requirements in regulations are not cost-effective; that is, States can reasonably expect to spend more to perform a TPL activity than anticipated or realized savings in that activity. It is for these reasons that we now propose to offer States the opportunity to request waivers from the unproductive activities that are not mandated by statute, and for which States have superior methods for accomplishing the same objectives as our regulations. II. Proposed Revisions The provisions of this proposed rule would allow States to request a waiver from requirements in section 433.138(c), (d)(4), (d)(5), (e), (f), (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4) or section 433.139(b), (d)(1), and (d)(2) that are not explicitly mandated by statute when it is found that performing the requirement is not cost-effective. A nonstatutorily required activity would be eligible for a waiver if the cost of the required activity exceeds the TPL recoupment and the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher cost, the same objective as another activity that is being performed by the State. The proposed provisions would allow States to perform TPL operations more efficiently and at a greater savings to the Federal Government. Duplicative efforts (and higher costs) would be eliminated when States have already identified third party resources through another more cost-effective means. It should be noted that HCFA's financial participation in State Medicaid Management Information Systems costs, including costs related to data matches we require States to perform, may be as much as 90 percent. Therefore, it is not in the interest of the Federal Government to have States perform activities which are either duplicative or nonproductive.
