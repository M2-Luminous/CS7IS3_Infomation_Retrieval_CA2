The phenomenon has often been discussed but rarely has there been such clear evidence of it happening. The self-censorship at the territory's television stations has now got to the stage where material relating to sensitive subjects may be cut, even when it appears to reflect the official Beijing view. ATV's decision not to screen a film in commemoration of the June 4 massacre is illogical. There is even less logic in the decision made by ATV as it should know well that some material in the programme actually purported to show there were no killings on Tiananmen Square itself. Self-censorship is not driven by logic. It is driven by fear. Its proponents are always having to second-guess the powers they are trying to impress. Braver organisations would be tempted to push the limits of Beijing's tolerance, attempting to see how far they can go without provoking an angry reaction. Paradoxically, silence from Beijing makes the self-censors more timid. When in doubt, runs their creed, cut it out. Such timidity will be counterproductive in the end. The journalists who quit are not the only losers. The Hong Kong public are also deprived of a programme which after all may not be as offensive to Beijing leaders, who have occasionally shown flexibility, as ATV management thinks. The TV stations must recover their self-respect or they will drag others down with them. They should have the courage to broadcast sensitive, not malicious, material. Showing a documentary recording a historical event would not necessarily mean ATV is anti-Beijing. By choosing not to screen it, ATV has alienated and disappointed the public.
