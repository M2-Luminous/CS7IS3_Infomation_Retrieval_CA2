Albanian Television's many viewers in the city of Dibra e Madhe point out the fact that RTSh is being jammed. The jamming stations installed on the border with Albania many years ago are still being kept in action throughout RTSh's broadcasting time. In the past, when barbed wire divided the two Dibers and during the "ideologic war" between Albania and Yugoslavia, television-jamming was part of the systems that ruled in both countries, although Skopje Television was never jammed in Peshkopi. Now, with freedom of the press and information, freedom of movement, and advancing democratic processes, the attitude and action of the Macedonian side in jamming RTSh is totally anachronistic and incomprehensible. It is also impossible to understand why Macedonia is pursuing the old-style politics and practice of isolating the Albanians by jamming RTSh on purpose, at a time when Albania has opened all its doors and windows to Macedonia. Let us not go into the extremely cold response to the introduction of the Albanian press and literature in the Albanian regions of Macedonia. Our government is aware of these problems, because they have been raised in public on other occasions. It is regrettable that, where they are concerned, it still pretends to be blind, deaf, and dumb.
