The PGR agents captured 21 of its members, who were found to have in their possession approximately a ton of pure cocaine, which they were attempting to market in the neighboring state of Quintana Roo. This announcement was made at a press conference today by the PGR's state representative, Antonio Tiro Sanchez. The report added that six late-model cars with Quintana Roo plates were also seized, as well as a fuel tanker that was hauling the alkaloid. The operation began at dawn last Sunday, when the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] intercepted a tank truck in the vicinity of the settlement of Escarcega, Campeche. Owned by the company Traga, Adjustable Capital Corp., with license plates 045TX9, it was carrying 22 gas cylinders containing 711 kg of cocaine. No armed confrontations were reported in this seizure, during which Gilberto Erick Gomez Ortega, Felipe Corro Alcantara, Daniel Soto Vargas, and Antonio Reyes Cabanas were arrested. All are members of the organization led by Bermudez who were guarding the shipment in an imported luxury car with Quintana Roo plates URD8679. According to the bulletin issued by the PGR, from the preliminary statements made by Antonio Reyes Cabanas while in custody, the police obtained the names of those who were to receive the shipment by sea in the neighboring town of Chetumal. They also learned the identities of the subjects waiting for it in Cancun, Quintana Roo. PJF personnel in Chetumal arrested Antonio Ordonez Rodriguez and Gregorio Barradas Montero. Meanwhile, in Cancun, they captured Jose Luis Sierra Rodriguez, of Spanish nationality; Luis Carlos Pinto Camacho, alias "Ramiro Vazquez Perez"; and Humberto Segundo Montenegro Freyre, alias "Alberto Rodriguez Garcia," or "Alberto Garcia Aleman," the latter two of Colombian nationality. Also arrested were the Mexicans, Benjamin Reyes Cabanas and Mario Fuentes Perez, from whom three late-model cars with Quintana Roo plates were confiscated. The statements from those under arrest made it possible to intercept, early Monday morning, a vehicle being driven along Itzaes Avenue in the city of Merida in Yucatan State. Riding in it were nine persons who were guarding 199 packages containing nearly 400 kg of cocaine. Tiro Sanchez revealed that the nine subjects arrested were members of the ring led by the Colombian, Antonio Bermudez, and answer to the names of: Gustavo Adolfo Ayala Ramos, Jorge Alonso Uraga Paez, Manuel Olmeda Gutierrez, Luis Vega Rivas, Alberto Vega Rivas, Jorge Peraza Bernal, Jose Espinoza Dominguez, Cipriano Beltran Madueno, and Hernan Valdez Apodacas. Two cars and a passenger van were seized from these drug dealers. The official denied that any confrontations had occurred during the arrests. He claimed that, after the case records are completed by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, those responsible, with the items and equipment found in their possession, would be placed at the disposal of the authorized judge.
