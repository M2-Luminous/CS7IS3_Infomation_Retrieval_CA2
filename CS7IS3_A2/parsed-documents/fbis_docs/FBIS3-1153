They are expected to appear in court within days. According to opposition spokesman Abass Youssouf, these arrests are a simple maneuver orchestrated by President Said Mohamed Dhojar's regime to destabilize the opposition. Here is Abass Youssouf speaking to Mohamed Yusufu Saliou. [Begin recording] [Youssouf] One has the impression that what they really want is to put political leaders under arrest so they are looking for an excuse. The very day of the arrests the government issued a communique over the radio attacking [words indistinct] and myself. So one has the impression that the government is panic-stricken and is simply seeking to arrest people. [Saliou] In the face of this situation what is the reaction of the opposition that you represent? [Youssouf] The opposition [words indistinct] because the radio is gagged by the government. There is no (?written press), they closed down all the radio stations close to the opposition, and we in Moroni have called dignitaries and religious leaders to meet on 22 and 23 March to deny the allegations. We plan to hold a rally on 23 March, and it will be followed up with other rallies in Grande Comore to try to explain the situation to the people. We have convened political leaders [words indistinct]. [Saliou] So in your opinion, there was no plot, but it is rather the state which is trying to arrest opposition leaders with flimsy excuses? [Youssouf] Oh yes, that is quite clear to everybody. Even as far as the people are concerned, you can be sure. [end recording]
