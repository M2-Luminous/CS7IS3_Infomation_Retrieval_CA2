He described the talk as constructive, saying that despite differences between China and the United States on issues such as the most-favored-nation status, both sides have the same wish, which is that this problem would be solved properly and prevented from interfering [gan rao 1626 2371] in the development of relations between the two countries. Qian Qichen said: One of the international trends at present is strengthening relations with China. He said: The normalization of Sino-France relations carries great significance.

Qian Qichen said: He had a talk with the French leader in an harmonious atmosphere and achieved satisfactory results. Consensus was reached on many issues and both sides stressed complete normalization in Sino-French relations. On his tour of six African states, Qian Qichen said that many African countries are developing countries and have very good relations with China.
