The MOU provides for a number of military contacts and exchanges with the aim of developing jointly areas of practical co-operation on a wide range of defence-related matters. This is the first time a Romanian Defence Minister has visited the United Kingdom since the break-up of the Warsaw Pact. Mr. Tinca's visit, and the signing of the MOU, is seen as a part of the ongoing process of strengthening security and stability in Europe, and is entirely in line with the ethos of the recently unveiled Partnership for Peace initiative. Both nations welcome Partnership for Peace as a useful means of building a closer relationship between NATO and countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Whilst in London Mr. Tinca will have discussions with, amongst others, Admiral Sir Jock Slater, Vice Chief of the Defence Staff and Mr. Moray Stewart, Second Permanent Under Secretary. He will also visit Royal United Services Institute and have talks with representatives of the UK Defence Industry. Mr Rifkind said: "I am very pleased that a MOU covering bilateral defence contacts has been agreed. Its signature should herald a new phase of more structured and substantial co-operation between us."
