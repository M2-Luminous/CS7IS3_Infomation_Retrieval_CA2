According to Alemann, who is an economist, membership in NAFTA would not be a good thing for Argentina. He asserts that the United States wants his country to join the hemispheric trade bloc because Argentina represents a large market for U.S. goods and because Argentina does not have the problems that plague Mexico. Alemann points to an unidentified study which states that the incorporation of Argentina into NAFTA would mean, in present worth, a $900 million increase in U.S. exports to Argentina as opposed to an increase of less than $100 million in Argentine exports to the United States.
