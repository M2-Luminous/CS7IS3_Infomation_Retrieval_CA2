However, with the increase in large numbers of foreign-invested enterprises, the number of law violations related to such enterprises is also increasing. Because of this, personalities of economic circles and even of academic circles have put forward this question: Are we using foreign capital or are we being used by foreign capital? An article entitled "Cool Thinking in Foreign Capital Fever" published in the "Economic Square" column of the latest issue of ZHONGHUA WENZHAI [China Digest] has incisively raised this question, which must not be neglected, urging people to think and observe calmly. The article points out that one of the inharmonious shadows is "false joint ventures and deceptive practices," that is, some enterprises are only joint ventures in name, but are enjoying preferential treatment for joint ventures. In recent years, many cases of this "false Sino-foreign joint venture disease" have been found and the "disease" seems to be spreading. In these false joint venture enterprises, the foreign side is usually not committed to investing, but collects one-time "service charges" or takes in regular "cooperation fees" of a certain percentage. What is particularly worthy of our attention is that some foreign businessmen with ulterior motives have sought "wedding ties" of this kind on their own initiative, have gained capital by cheating, and have then fled with the money. The second is "exaggerating the amount of investment to build oneself up." Over a very long period, there has been a phenomena of exaggerated investment in the foreigners' visible assets -- passing old equipment off as new equipment, inferior equipment as superior equipment, and low-price equipment as high-price equipment. A foreign businessman negotiated five identical joint venture projects with several provinces and municipalities in China and imported five sets of equipment at $2.4 million each. During the later inspection by commodity inspection departments, all these five sets of equipment were pieced together abroad, and their total price was only slightly over $900,000. The third is "declaring losses instead of profits to evade taxes." In recent years, some foreign-invested enterprises have resorted to various tricks to evade taxes, the most common being is to "declare losses instead of profits." In 1991, a total of 4,838 foreign-invested enterprises declared losses totalling 3.66 billion yuan in Guangdong Province, accounting for 53 percent of enterprises involved in remittance settlement. As a result, quite a few joint venture enterprises have emerged which "always suffer losses" but will "never close down," and which have been constantly expanding their scale of production. These enterprises are in reality reaping more and more profits with each passing year. Besides, there are numerous other tricks which have appeared one after another, such as using foreign capital as a pretext for smuggling, making profits by exaggerating the amount of capital introduced and covering up the amount of capital taken out, fleeing to avoid paying debts, and so on. In conclusion, the article pointed out that the participation of some foreign businessmen in illegal activities is not something new. Such activities have existed for the past 13 years. They have become especially conspicuous, because the number of foreign- invested enterprises has increased greatly. Because foreign- invested enterprises are special by nature, effective techniques for managing domestic enterprises may not work in the management of foreign-invested enterprises. Therefore, many urgent problems require a prompt solution by the departments concerned, and better regulations and rules should be formulated so that the foreign capital fever can truly give impetus to rapid economic development in China.
