Remarkable increases have been seen in both the amount and the number of projects involving state investment in the northwestern provinces of Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi and the Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions. So far, half of the fund for economic development of these regions has come from state investment, which focuses on the exploration and exploitation of coal and oil resources, establishment of large state-owned enterprises and infrastructure construction. The five interior provinces and autonomous regions in northwest China occupy one-third of the country's total landspace. Among the 160 kinds of minerals found in China, 120 have been sited there. Two out of the three newly-discovered large-scale natural gas fields are located in northwest China with the one in the basin on the borders of Gansu, Shaanxi and Ningxia the country's largest gas field ever found. The plentiful natural gas of Shaanxi, the oil reserves of Xinjiang, coal resources in Ningxia and the rich water power resources of the Yellow River that winds through the region are all of vital significance to the country's economic development. Despite the area's rich natural resources, northwest China's economic development has long lagged behind that of other parts of the country for geographical and historical reasons. Promotion of the local economy and exploitation of natural resources has become an urgent need for the country. In China's eighth five-year-plan, priority has been given to the development of the transportation and electrical power industries and the tapping of resources in northwest China. Increased state investment has been rewarded with extensive growth seen in electricity supplies, transporting capacity and output of petroleum in the northwest region, which is expected to become the country's number one energy supplier in the near future.
