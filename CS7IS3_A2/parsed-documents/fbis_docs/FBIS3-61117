The privatization organs of local councils are seeking in this manner to neutralize the pressure brought to bear on them by the FDMU [Fund of State Property of Ukraine]--a structure of the Cabinet of Ministers, i.e. of executive power. In an exclusive to Business P-P, Taras Pakholyuk commented on the situation personally. In the words of Taras Pakholyuk, the main task of the conference in Kiev was to develop joint proposals concerning more intensive conduct of minor privatization for the supreme echelons of power--the president, Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, Supreme Council of Ukraine, and the FDMU. At the seminar quite a number of obstacles were revealed which interfere with the regular course of minor privatization as a result of ill-constructed regulatory documents which were confirmed at the level of the FDMU and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. FKM chairmen set up a working group which drew up a package of proposals concerning privatization for confirmation by the supreme echelon. Taras Pakholyuk proposed to create a coordinating organ to "push" these proposals in Kiev because a paper "without the footwork" will clearly not work effectively enough. Everyone was prompted to do so by the experience of the previous seminar at which, all the efforts of the chairmen of local funds notwithstanding, neither Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the commission of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, nor the FDMU leadership responded to the joint decisions of FKM chairmen in any way. For this reason, some of the proposals were included in the new package (nothing changed in half a year). The idea to establish the Association of the Privatization Organs of Ukraine was supported, and a resolution in this regard was passed. Statutory documents will be presented on 8-9 December in Odessa, at an international conference on privatization in Ukraine, where the resolution of all organizational issues will be completed, and, in particular, regulations on the association will be confirmed and the association will be registered. Taras Pakholyuk expects that a support group will be created in the Supreme Council with help from the association as early as this term. This, in a way, will be a lobby which will operate on the principle of the Union of Ukrainian Lessees. Responding to a question from the correspondent of Business P-P on whether this organ will turn into a self-contained structure, Taras Pakholyuk answered that it will not, because financing will be provided directly by the FKM's. That is to say, they will directly control the actions of the association and pay only if the work of the association is beneficial for the FKM's. At the same time, Taras Pakholyuk rejected accusations against the local FKM's to the effect that the desire of the funds to maintain independence from the center was the main goal of the creation of the association. He is convinced that the independence of the FKM's, and the local organs of self-government in general, is guaranteed by Ukrainian legislation. "That is to say, we are sufficiently independent to begin with; for this reason, we are not afraid that someone will be able to subordinate us. It is just that at the seminar itself, after getting acquainted with the chairmen of the FKM's, one could conclude that their interest in conducting privatization exceeds that of the FDMU considerably; at least if we analyze approaches to privatization by the FDMU and the local organs, a substantial difference leaps out at us. The FDMU defends mainly the buyout of enterprises by labor collectives and the establishment of privately held joint-stock companies, that is, privatization strictly for labor collectives. At the same time, the FKM's of Ukraine hold both auctions and commercial competitions; accordingly, more funds are taken in, and the effectiveness of privatization is high. Through competition, property ends up with an effective potential owner who is interested in the greatest possible returns from production." According to Taras Pakholyuk, the FDMU is directly interested in maintaining or even enhancing control over privatization in Ukraine. It is precisely its efforts to create a vertical hierarchical system of the organs of privatization, subordinated to the FDMU, that accelerated the process of creating the organization. Everybody understood that this was yet another attempt at linking the channels of management through Kiev. However, varied approaches are necessary at the local level, where it is necessary to act flexibly. Thus, Taras Pakholyuk maintains that auctions run into practically no resistance in, for example, rayon seats such as Stryy, Drogobych, and Chervonograd. It is primarily local companies that privatize property, and the threat of an invasion of foreign capital, which some ultrapatriots are so afraid of, is nowhere in evidence. Evaluating the progress of privatization in Lvov, Taras Pakholyuk indicated that a list of 67 facilities to be privatized had been confirmed at the last session of the city council, and seven winners of an economic competition in October had been designated (the labor collectives of the latter are entitled to buy out their enterprises; however, Business P-P has already written repeatedly about the system of privatization in Lvov along the lines of commercial competitions). The chairman of the Lvov FKM said that this was being hindered somewhat; therefore, it was resolved to extend the deadline for the filing of privatization petitions by the labor collectives of the facilities. As far as the current winners in the commercial competitions are concerned, at present their property is being inventoried and the price at which it will be proposed to enterprises to buy it out is being determined. Then it will remain for them to confirm their desire to be bought out within 15 days. If the decision is favorable, an economic unit based on the labor collective--a joint-stock company or an association of buyers--will become the owner of the property. They will be granted the right to lease for a five-year term. Taras Pakholyuk maintained that in principle privatization deadlines set by the government for Lvov are realistic. However, there are problems, too. "Privatization definitely will not be completed before the end of the next year. There are many enterprises that need to be privatized. Even if we privatize 70 percent of the enterprises in Lvov, about 1,700 facilities will remain, and it is difficult to privatize them within one year. The process will most likely be completed before mid-1995. However, there is another snag. Certainly, less than one-half of the enterprises will be sold through competitive privatization techniques (auctions, economic competitions). Since to date we have witnessed the desire to block them, no changes for the better are expected. The results will be apparent at the end of this year or the beginning of next year, when we finish accepting petitions for 67 facilities, of which there should be no fewer than three per enterprise. Auctions will then begin."
