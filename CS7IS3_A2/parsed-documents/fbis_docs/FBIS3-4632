"Such control would disregard the rights of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic to establish its sovereignty over its own capital," Minister/State Secretary Murdiono quoted President Suharto as saying here over the weekend. When briefing UN Security Council Chairman Roble Olhay on the NAM chairman's attitude on Friday (25/2), the NAM chairman expressed deep concern over massacres, military aggressions and the ethnic cleansing program launched by Bosnian Serbs against the non-Serbian Bosnian people. He told the UN Security Council chairman that the continuation of the Serbs' military aggressions against the Bosnian people is a reflection of the world community's failure to implement every UN Security Council resolutions in the region. The chairman also underlined that the UN Security Council should have been acting as the protector of the Bosnian territory and sovereignty. "The failure has even been worsening by the arms embargo resolution imposed on the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It meant that the Bosnians had been denied their very basic rights, that is, to self-defense," said Suharto. The NAM chairman said that the international community should stay alert, even if the Serbs had withdrawn its artillery from Sarajevo following NATO's threat to launch air strikes. "We should stay alert till the Serbs fully withdraw from the besieged area," said the NAM chairman. Suharto also urged the UN Security Council to hold a meeting on the latest development in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to take some concrete and effective steps to implement all relevant resolution on the region. In a letter to the UN Security Council chairman, President Suharto also touched on the need to convene an international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina. The conference should have a streamlined structure to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to the issue. President Suharto and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic last month in Jakarta discussed the idea of convening such an international conference. Minister Murdiono said that after meeting with the UN Security Council chairman, President Suharto has asked the head of NAM Chairman Executive Board Nana Sutresna to order the chairman of NAM Coordinating Bureau at the UN to discuss the Bosnian issue with the NAM caucus at the UN Security Council. Murdiono said that NAM would always be ready to take part in such an international conference or in a new round of talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina.
