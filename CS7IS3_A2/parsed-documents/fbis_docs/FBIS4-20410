Since its change of session in early 1993, it has drawn up 14 local laws and regulations, and approved 16 local laws and regulations drawn up by the three cities of Jinan, Qingdao, and Zibo. The establishment and perfection of socialist market economy operating forces has to rely on a corresponding market economy legal system for guidance, standardization, guarantees, and restraints. The Shandong People's Congress Standing Committee has steadily freed up its thinking and revamped its legislative concepts, making its prime mission legislative work, particularly economic legislation. Shandong People's Congress Standing Committee Chairman Li Zhen [2621 2182] [former Shandong Vice Governor] has repeatedly emphasized the need to adapt to the needs of rapid economic growth, by using the spirit of reform to do a good job of local legislation. The Shandong People's Congress Standing Committee, in order to build as quickly as possible the basic framework of a market economy legal system throughout Shandong, so that there will be laws to follow in the key areas of reform, opening, and economic development throughout Shandong, has held two local legislative symposiums, which specially studied the new situations and issues posed to local legislation by a market economy, and explored innovative legislative thinking under the new conditions. Based on extensive investigation and study, and numerous changes in their drafts, they set the Standing Committee's 1993 legislative plans and Shandong's five-year legislative program, acting in line with market economy development needs, by setting forth legislative items to provide for future legislative objectives and missions. They first proceeded from Shandong's realities, by promptly drawing up local laws and regulations, such as the "Shandong Statistics Regulations," the "Management Regulations for the Qingdao Duty-Free Zone in Shandong," and the "Management Regulations for Shandong's Establishment of Project Bidding," to accomplish matters, such as standardizing market subjects, preserving market order, and tightening macroeconomic regulation and control, in order to promote sound market economy development. Directed at the "development zone and real estate fevers," they drew up and approved legislation, such as the "Shandong Regulations on the Sale and Transfer of Urban State-Owned Land Use Rights," and the "Management Regulations on Urban Real Estate Transactions in Qingdao City." To adapt to the needs of the rapid growth of reform, opening, and foreign investment throughout Shandong, they drew up and approved economic laws and regulations involving foreigners, such as the "Shandong Management Regulations on Economic and Technological Development Zones," the "Shandong Management Regulations on Enterprise Registration in Economic and Technological Development Zones," and the "Labor Management Regulations for Qingdao FIEs." To improve legislative quality and make local laws and regulations more serviceable, the Shandong People's Congress Standing Committee conducted bold explorations in areas, such as reforming local legislative systems and procedures, and broadening legislative channels, which breached the local legislative fetters of "empirical maturation and policy finalization," to achieve legislative leadership and foresight.
