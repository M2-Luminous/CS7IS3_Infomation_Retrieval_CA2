We protect our market more strongly than do Hungarians and Czechs. Contrary to the comments of PSL [Polish Peasant Party] Sejm deputies, Polish borders are not at all wide open. In the West, the average duty rate at present is 4 percent, while in Poland it is more than 10 percent. Even so, the developed countries decided that their duty rates are too high for trade to become a genuine locomotive of the world economy. During the seven-year-long Uruguay Round, which was completed in December 1993, it was decided that, in the next few years, the average duty rate would be reduced to less than 3 percent and all trade restraints in the form of countervailing fees, border taxes, etc. would be abolished. According to experts, this will cause world trade to increase by $200-300 billion. According to the OECD and the World Bank, the principal beneficiaries of the new trade agreement, which will begin to be binding as early as at the beginning of 1995, are, however, to be the developing countries, which in the next few years will earn an additional $130 billion. Soon now, sharp rivalry over dividing up that substantial sum will begin. Yet, at the same time, Polish industry and farming, instead of getting ready to expand, are seeking security by advocating higher duty barriers. Following a temporary slash in Polish duties to a level not much higher than in the West (5.5 percent), they were jacked up since mid-1991 to levels several times as high as in the West--as high as 18.8 percent. The tariff increases applied chiefly to the least transformed [i.e., least adapted to market reforms] industries, such as textile, footwear, and food. Thus, duties of as much as 20 percent became levied on consumer goods, 20-35 percent on farm products and textiles, and 45 percent on luxury goods. According to Tomasz Jodko, director of the Department for Multilateral Agreements at the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, this whole subject is beset by inconsistency. Sometimes the failures of certain branches of the economy are blamed on high interest rates and sometimes on supposedly low tariff duties. It is symptomatic that increases in tariff duties are considered when miners strike. Yet, after World War II, the liberalization of trade became the principal locomotive of world economic growth. The seven previous GATT rounds have resulted in an eightfold reduction of duty rates, and, in the years 1950-75, this resulted in a fivefold growth in the volume of world trade, along with growth of the generated world product. In 1982, when world trade grew by only about 3 percent, generated world product diminished by 2 percent. In Belgium and the Netherlands, trade accounts for more than 70 percent of the gross national product [GNP]. In contrast, in Poland, foreign trade accounts for barely 20 percent of the GNP. And this proportion is going to be even lower now that the government wants, contrary to worldwide trends, to surround Poland with a tariff wall. Since 1991, protection of domestic products has been increasing not only through duty raises, which account for 70 percent of its extent. Toward the end of 1992, a 6-percent border tax, levied on the value of merchandise plus duty, was introduced. Moreover, the basis for levying duties was augmented by including the cost of transportation and insurance. In this connection, unlike in the West, the successive Polish Governments arrogated to themselves rather than to the parliament the power of fixing duty rates. As if on purpose, they provoked pressures from various interest groups. In the years 1990-91 alone, the government revised more than 90 implementing acts. It was only after signing the Association Agreement between Poland and the European Union and owing to the understanding with GATT that the government lost the power to manipulate duty rates for about 75 percent of goods. [From now on] tariff revisions will require GATT consultation, but it is hard to say whether that will cool the fevered temperament of the Polish farm lobby. Yet estimates of the Institute for Business Cycles and Foreign Trade Prices (IKCHZ) indicate that the liberalization of tariffs owing to the Association Agreement between Poland and the European Union will contribute to increasing Poland's foreign trade revenues. In the next few years, exports of Polish manufactured goods alone should increase by about $70 million. To be sure, Professor Elzbieta Kawecka-Wyrzykowska of the IKCHZ admits that it is not much, but, still, tariff liberalization affords a tremendous opportunity for the Polish economy. She commented, "Polish exports by now are impeded not so much by customs barriers, which are low, with the exception of farm products, as by their intrinsic weaknesses." As if that were not enough, we are not utilizing export quotas--i.e., the opportunities for selling goods on European markets at preferential duty rates. This applies chiefly to farm products. For example, Polish exporters sold only 4-10 percent of the permissible quantities [under the quotas] of pork and potato starch, and even smaller amounts of butter, cheese, eggs, and chickens. As for sales of, for example, live geese and their eggs, they are impeded by a strange regulation--namely, the Ministry of Agriculture has prohibited the exports of live geese because it dreads duplication of Polish breeding stock abroad. Had other countries followed the same mentality, the invention of television or computers would not to this day be a widespread boon. Concerning the growth in exports owing to tariff liberalization, Andrzej Byrt, deputy minister for foreign economic relations, is much more optimistic. He estimates that the ending of the Uruguay Round will result in a $1-billion annual increase in our exports. At the same time, Poland's GNP will grow. But that hardly sounds plausible because, in Poland, duty rates are viewed as a means of not only getting rid of [foreign] competition but also of enriching the state coffers. Thus, while in recent years budgetary receipts from customs duties have been rising, Poland's participation in world trade has been declining. Too many overprotected sectors of the economy have remained impervious to market reforms. Thus, while as recently as in 1991 customs duties accounted for 3.7 percent of budgetary receipts, a year later they soared to 27 percent. In 1992, the budget earned 27 trillion zlotys [Z] (Z27 trillion) in receipts from customs duties alone or, when receipts from the border tax are included, Z46.5 trillion. In 1993, these receipts doubled. The duties levied have caused major increases not only in the prices of imported finished goods but also in the manufacturing cost of many domestic goods produced with imported raw materials. In the cosmetics industry, many plants have to import as much as 70 percent of ingredients. Moreover, duties also are levied on goods and raw materials not produced in Poland. For example, there is a 10-percent duty on video cameras and on many ingredients used in the manufacture of cosmetics--for example, on basic detergents for shampoo production (15-percent duty) or on cosmetic packagings (also 15-percent). All the more so considering that, in Poland, unlike in the West, the differences in the size of duties levied on semifinished products and raw materials and those levied on finished products are not appropriately wide. In some cases, such duties are even the same--for example, for wine imported in bulk and for bottled wine. This is causing problems for Warsaw Imported Wine Cellars and six other similar establishments. As a result, imports of wine in cistern tanks have almost completely ceased, and bottling plants had to lay off hundreds of employees. By the same token, the consumer is condemned to pay higher prices for wine imported in bottles. Prof. Kawecka-Wyrzykowska said, "Our biggest losses will come as our economy becomes a bigger mess and further loses its competitiveness." She added that, to be sure, farmers are accusing the government of failing to protect the food market, but, were not it for the imports, we would certainly be still waiting a long time before being able to drink milk or yogurt in colorful packagings. Jolanta Zombirt, adviser to the Government Commissioner for European Integration, said, "Sometimes initial losses have to be risked in order to join the company of the economically strongest countries. We would thus gain the cachet of a safe country, in which European customs regulations are binding. To the potential foreign investor, this would mean a guarantee that Poland is not some banana republic and will not, unlike it has been doing until recently, keep changing its customs regulations overnight." Although duty rates have been fixed in international agreements, the government is exploring the possibilities for bypassing them. Apparently it has stumbled on such possibilities as regards farm products. To be sure, it has presented a proposal for reducing duty rates by one-third in accordance with the GATT agreement, but, at the same time, it is raising them to make up for having to abolish other fees (e.g., countervailing fees) under the agreement, so that the prices of imported merchandise are certain to rise. For example, the duty on butter will be 140 percent after the countervailing fees and the border tax are abolished, whereas, at present, it is 40 percent. The duty on wheat is to be doubled. The government intends to raise duty rates in order to reduce them later from a higher level and still look like it is following the decisions of the Uruguay Round.
