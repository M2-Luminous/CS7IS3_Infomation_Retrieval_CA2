[passage omitted] Wang Qun and Wu Liji gave important speeches respectively. Qian Fengyong, Bai Enpei, Yi Junhua, Song Zhimin, and Wu Lunsai, and responsible comrades of various leagues, cities, regional departments concerned, and the regional rural and pastoral work leading group and units attended the conference. Bai Enpei presided over the conference. In his speech, Wang Qun pointed out: While fully understanding the excellent situation, we should clearly recognize that we should set demands on ourselves in line with the high standards of modernizing agriculture and animal husbandry and the market economy. At present, our region's agricultural and animal husbandry production is still at a low development stage. The party Central Committee has stressed repeatedly that the issue on agriculture, animal husbandry, rural areas, and peasants is always a fundamental issue affecting the overall situation of our party and the state. Judging from our Inner Mongolia Region's situation, without the invigoration of agricultural and animal husbandry and the development of the rural and pastoral areas, there can be no economic invigoration and social development in Inner Mongolia, no social stability in the rural and pastoral areas, and no long period of order and security in the border areas. Therefore, we should conscientiously study, profoundly understand, and comprehensively implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference, further understand the urgency of strengthening agriculture, animal husbandry, as well as rural and pastoral work from the overall situation of reform, development, and stability, firmly establish the ideology of regarding agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation, unswervingly place agriculture and animal husbandry above all economic tasks at any time and under any circumstance, and uphold it for a long time with unremitting efforts. Wang Qun said: The rural and pastoral works are numerous, and development is the essential criterion. Judging from the overall situation of the region, the current agricultural and animal husbandry development trend is good and the situation is gratifying. The broad masses of peasants and herdsmen have already seen the opportunity of having a good market for agricultural and livestock products and good prices and the local advantages and potential for developing agriculture and animal husbandry. Therefore, their enthusiasm in planting grain and raising livestock is unprecedentedly high and their desire to accelerate development is very strong. In the face of this situation, party leading cadres at all levels have the responsibility of protecting, guiding, and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; the responsibility of judging the hour and sizing up the situation, organizing leading peasants and herdsmen to advance on the crest of a victory, developing our region's agriculture and animal husbandry in a quicker and better manner, and entering a new stage on the present basis. The general objective of this new stage is to enable peasants to attain a better-off level of moderate prosperity on schedule by the end of this century which was once proposed by the regional party committee and the provincial government, to enable herdsmen to take the lead in becoming better-off, to basically realize the goal of developing modernized agriculture and animal husbandry with high yield, high quality, and high efficiency, to carry out all forms of integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture, to combine planting industry with breeding and processing industries, and to turn the region into an important base and market for brandname, quality, and special products, such as grain, oil-bearing crops, sugar, meat, milk, eggs, leather and fur products, fruits and medical herbs, in China's northern region. In line with this general objective, our region's agricultural and animal husbandry sectors must strengthen scientific and technological progress, raise the quality of personnel, strengthen the infrastructure facilities for agriculture and animal husbandry, mechanize agricultural and animal husbandry production, increase input, deepen reform, and carry out large-scale production and intensive operations. This year it is necessary to continuously increase the production of grain and animal husbandry on the basis of last year's production and strive to make the grain output reach 23 billion jin; the number of livestock reach 57 million during the animal husbandry fiscal year; the total revenue growth rate of township enterprises reach more than 50 percent; and the net income of peasants and herdsmen increase by 100 yuan after deducting the factor of price hikes. According to this demand, the higher and the lower levels across the region should adopt practical measures, make specific targets, and strive to attain the aforementioned objective. After analyzing our region's possibility, necessity, and favorable conditions for accelerating the development of our region's agriculture and animal husbandry and entering a new stage, Wang Qun stressed: Our proposal of accelerating the development of agriculture and animal husbandry and entering a new stage on the present basis is in conformity with the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, the overall situation of reform, development, and stability, and the common interests and wish of the people of various nationalities across the region. The regional party committee has called on the broad masses of party-member members across the region, particularly the party's leading cadres at all levels, to further emancipate the mind, enhance understanding, realistically unite their ideology with the policy decision of the regional party committee, and guarantee the implementation of this policy decision with practical and effective deeds. Wang Qun pointed out: At present and for some time to come, the principle of deepening reform in the rural and pastoral areas is and will still be the four sentences proposed by the eighth plenary session of the 13th party Central committee, that is to stabilize and improve the responsibility system with the family-based output-related contract system as the mainstay, perfect the dual management system of centralized and decentralized management, actively develop various forms of socialized service system, and gradually expand the collective economic strength. The major content of reform is to take market cultivation as the mainstay, perfect the socialized comprehensive service system, strengthen macro regulation and control, and accelerate the establishment of economic operational mechanism and management system that suit the socialist market economic structure. First, we should further improve the rural and pastoral management system; second, organize and improve the township comprehensive service organizations; third, actively develop "dragon-typed economy"; fourth, strengthen macro regulation and control as well as protection in the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors; and fifth, deepen reform in rural and pastoral areas and in banners, counties, and organs, transfer personnel to all localities, and combine these two tasks together. Wang Qun stressed: The objective of accelerating agricultural and animal husbandry development and entering a new height has set a higher demand on the party committees and governments at all levels, particularly the party's leading cadres at all levels. We must pay more attention to agriculture and animal husbandry and to the issues on peasants and herdsmen than at any time in the past, adopt practical and effective measures, and further strengthen and improve the party's leadership over rural and pastoral work. Party committees at all levels should realistically place rural and pastoral work above all economic tasks and further strengthen leadership. In the future, the work focus and main energy of the party committees of various leagues, cities, banners, and counties should be placed on agriculture, animal husbandry, and rural and pastoral work. It is necessary to continuously attend to building grass-roots organizations and ranks of cadres in the rural and pastoral areas. All banners and counties should be determined to select good quality cadres from all sectors and send them to work in townships, towns, and sumu and install good leading bodies in townships. We should realistically strengthen spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system in the rural and pastoral areas, and take a "two-handed approach in work and be tough with both." Through effective work, we may eliminate the destabilizing factors and create a good social environment for reform and development in the rural and pastoral areas. [passage omitted]
