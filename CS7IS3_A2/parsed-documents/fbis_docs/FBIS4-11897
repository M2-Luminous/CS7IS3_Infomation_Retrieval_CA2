That was evident from the broad consultative conferences which were held throughout the country, which produced truly Sudanese views on solutions to numerous complicated internal issues. On this same basis, the NSR is pursuing the same procedure and using the same method for dialogue to remove misunderstandings which might occur between Sudan and any other state. This is what Sudan has always called and striven for, that is: To place relations between ourselves and the United States in their correct framework on the basis of mutual respect and noninterference in the country's internal affairs. Colleague Najm al-Din Muhammad Ahmad wrote the following commentary on the visit to this country last Thursday [31 March] by Madeleine Albright, the U.S. delegate to the United Nations, which he will now read: [Najm al-Din] The two-hour visit to the country by Ambassador Madeleine Albright, the U.S. delegate to the United Nations, during which she met Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, president of the Republic, was regarded in diplomatic and official circles as a true beginning to serious dialogue between our country and the United States. The United States has displayed flagrant hostility towards Sudan since the beginning of the National Salvation Revolution in 1989, without Sudan committing a sin or without issuing anything which in the least harmed these relations. For this reason, we know, just as the whole world does, that the United States itself, and not others, is the one and only country responsible for the state of estrangement and indeed hostility that has been a characteristic tarnishing relations between the two countries. Evidence, facts and the practices of that great power have demonstrated this, for that country is the one that started all this through an economic boycott, beginning in 1989, within the framework of a policy of pressure -- which it always pursues towards states and peoples that strive to liberate their will and build themselves through self-reliance. The superpower was not content with that. It led a feverish campaign in international forum when the weapon of economic pressure did not succeed. America has been drawing on this weapon against Sudan to make it bow or retreat, even an inch, from all the programs and plans which have crystallized through the numerous dialogue conferences in which the people of Sudan joined forces. The result was a comprehensive national strategic plan which laid down a cure for all the diseases and maladies of the state. Sudan began to implement this plan with every confidence and ability, in order to achieve the superstate of Sudan, which it sought with the help of God. We say: When the weapon of economic pressure did not (?finish off) a free, noble people like the people of Sudan, the United States resorted to campaigns in which it looked for excuses to condemn Sudan and justify its direct interference in Sudan's internal affairs, exploiting that so-called international organization, the United Nations, in which it is represented by the visitor who came to our country as a dear and honored guest. She was granted the honor of meeting the president of the Republic, who cleared up matters and removed every obscurity or ambiguity in her mind about issues and ambiguities. We hope she will be able to convey all the facts she heard, the documents she acquainted herself with and the information she was given on all her queries so as to thaw the thick ice in relations between Sudan and her country -- or, that at least, we can count on this as being the beginning of the road leading to that. When the weapon of economic pressure failed, the United States, which since the collapse of the communist bloc has always brandished a stick at whoever disobeys or tries to disobey it, led a campaign in which it desperately attempted to distort Sudan's image in world opinion. This endeavor reached its climax when the great power threw the name of Sudan falsely onto the American list for terrorism, without citing any convincing proof to justify the allegation, labeling as terrorists people who profess a religion that discards violence and calls on people to embrace it amicably. The United States has always been accustomed to attaching the label of terrorism to any honorable, proud, and free state, forgeting or pretending to forget that it, that is to say, the United States, in reality -- according to evidence -- sponsors terrorism and protects those who practice terrorism. It also assists those who terrify peaceful people and it spreads terror and a lack of tranquility among peoples. No two people disagree on U.S. support for organized international terrorism. Moreover, its support for terrorism in Sudan is represented by the direct moral support which it gives, just as it gave generously to the rebel movement through the Washington Symposium, and its sponsorship of the rebellion's assertion, which favors the separation of southern Sudan from the rest of the country. U.S. support for terrorism in Sudan does not limit itself to moral support --it exceeds it to give material support and indirectly supply the rebel movement with the necessary equipment through its allies and pawns. In all this hostility and incitement, the United States proceeds from the bases of its flagrant hostility to Islam. While it does so, it takes into account the fact that Islam is the logical alternative to remolding the world on the basis of justice and equality, and absence of injustice after having suffered injustice and oppression under U.S. attempts at hegemony and domination. This is naturally not the conviction of the Sudanese people alone but the conviction of all Muslim peoples in all parts of the world. We say this, but, at the same time, we welcome the dialogue between Sudan and the United States, which we regard as having seriously begun with all openness and frankness. However, we only hope that the United States will continue its dialogue with us, while bearing in mind the principles of the Sudanese people, which we cannot abandon or deviate from. These principles are represented by Sudan's cultural orientations. The United States ought to know that Sudan's cultural option was not manufactured by the Sudanese Government, inasmuch as it is the option of the widespread national will. This matter is not confined to the Sudanese people but it goes beyond them, becoming one of the concerns of the Islamic nation as a whole. Consequently, the United States is faced with an historic test and should show some readiness, however limited, to respect other peoples' options. It is now entering a dialogue with Sudan to rehabilitate its relations and eliminate misunderstandings, caused by the United States in the first instance -- that is, if it so wishes. God grant us success.
