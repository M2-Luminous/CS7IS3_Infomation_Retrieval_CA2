Import bans, effective under the import diversification system, will also be lifted on some consumer products such as plastic household utensils. Imports of some farm products, which have recently shown steep price spirals, will be made as soon as possible to place curbs on soaring prices. These are the highlights of a package of anti-inflation steps announced by the Economic Planning Board [EPB] yesterday. Deputy Premier-Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok chaired a meeting of economic ministers to discuss these and other anti-inflation measures. The measures are in response to mounting public criticism about soaring inflation. The National Statistical Office [NSO] on Tuesday announced that consumer prices surged a whopping 1.3 percent in January, boosted by the rise in public-service charges and sharp increases in prices of some farm products. Economists warn of inflationary pressure building up more strongly, citing some factors which would hurt the nation's price stability. To create long-term stability in private-service charges, the anti-inflation steps call for easing entry restrictions in the private-service sector across the board. Specifically, the license system now used for new beauty parlors, barber shops, public bath houses and lodging places will be changed to a registration or report system to encourage competition. Criteria governing the opening of various private institutions will also be eased to facilitate the opening of these institutions. "The easing of restrictions will help spark freer competition, thus contributing to reign in rises in private-service charges," an EPB official said. To stabilize prices of manufactured goods, the package envisages phasing out import restrictions on some consumer goods, particularly those imported from Japan, such as household utensils made of glass and plastics. The EPB also urged manufacturers not to raise prices of their goods by absorbing price-raising factors through technological development while threatening to slap sanctions against those who try to raise prices through collusion. The government also plans to release state-held rice without limit to curb rising rice prices. In January alone, rice prices soared a whopping 3.1 percent, according to the NSO. Onions, garlic, salt and powdered milk will be imported massively. Imports of onions and garlic are planned at 3,000 tons, respectively, this month and for the whole of this year, about 78,000 tons of salt will be imported. The EPB said the government will exert utmost effort to stabilize price increases of 30 basic necessities which affect public livelihood significantly at below 4 percent in 1994. They are rice, beef, pork, eggs, garlic, onions, sugar, ramyon [instant noodles], wheat flour, salt, footwear, TVs, refrigerators, toys, yontan [coal brickets], propane and so on. The government will also focus on minimizing rises in public-service charges by urging public utilities to refrain from high increases through management renovation. The EPB sees curbing this year's inflation rate, as measured by consumer prices, at below 6 percent. Last year, the consumer price index soared 5.8 percent.
