As Chief Inspector of the Main Personnel Department of the ministry Aleksandra Zemskova told a RIA correspondent, the question of the trip of Russian policemen to Angola has not yet been decided. According to her, some time earlier the leadership of the Interior Ministry had refused to send its men to Mozambique because of the hot climate in that country and considering that in Angola the climate is no better it can be assumed that the UN request will hardly be granted. Zemskova stressed that the Russian police contingent acting as part of the peacekeeping force on the territory of the former Yugoslavia has well acquitted itself and has earned a high assessment of specialists. "This explains the increased demand for our workers," noted the spokesman of the Russian Interior Ministry. She reported that now a group of five Russian policemen is preparing for dispatch to Haiti where they will go as soon as the appropriate UN mandates are received.
