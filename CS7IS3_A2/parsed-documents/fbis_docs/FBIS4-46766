At the stages immediately preceding the destruction of the great power, you began to actively and openly voice your position. In August 1991 you undertook a last desperate attempt to avert this disintegration--an unsuccessful attempt, for which you paid with a year and a half of incarceration, suffering, humiliation, and political ostracism. You must sense the existence of a certain design aimed at the destruction of the Soviet Union. There are conspiracy models, a plot theory circulating in our patriotic circles. In part, it appeals to me, although I understand very well that it is difficult, for instance, to draw up a blueprint of a superplot sometime at the beginning of our century and then consistently, methodically implement it. Of course, there was a general trend of efforts aimed at the destruction of the Soviet Union, and within it there existed numerous doctrines, micro-projects, and merely operations of our opponents. Some were successful; others collapsed after encountering our ability to defend ourselves. Speaking in the language of mythology rather than intelligence or political science: There existed a certain design for destroying the USSR. It included such tasks as, for instance, squeezing the Soviet Union out of global zones of confrontation: Africa, Asia. It contained a score of programs aimed at weakening our geopolitical belts in Central and East Europe. It definitely included the weakening of our military potential, removing parity status through unilateral disarmament, and absolute military collapse. It also had built into it the destruction of state structures, in particular the military. Very little is known about the Soviet Union's withdrawal from East Europe, how the communist pro-Soviet regimes collapsed in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, and about the unification of Germany. Its unification was accompanied by propaganda slogans based on so-called "universal human values." In my opinion, however, unification in Germany more than anything else potentially holds a tremendous danger for the Europe of the 21st century, including Russia. Did Gorbachev and the State Security Committee take into account the potential consequences of this unification; and generally, how did the Soviet Union leave East Europe? [Kryuchkov] Looking at the conspiracy model you described, in reality everything was simpler and at the same time more complex. More complex in the sense that we did not sort out right away the deep-seated internal and external factors that led our country to tragedy. And simpler because plans to destroy our Union have indeed been developed and implemented, because the West saw a danger to itself in the existence of such a powerful state. Strictly speaking, the West did not conceal these plans. Moreover, there are our own, domestic figures who only recently were bragging that they had something to do with it, and that they contributed to what has happened. Seeing the latest events in the country, they became less vocal, though, because now the moment of reckoning is coming. I think the time will still come when these people will be held to answer. I remember my conversation with former CIA Director Gates, which took place in Moscow in 1990. He said then: "Mr. Kryuchkov, would you like me to give you a very interesting report, from which you will learn what will be happening in your country in the year 2000, at the point of transition to another century?" I said: "Of course." He promised to send me the materials, and I promised in return to put on paper my perception of global problems. He never sent the materials, but, as I learned later, among other things the report said that in a year or two the Soviet Union would no longer exist. When the head of state security gets this kind of information firsthand, it tells you a lot. Our intelligence officers also reported that it was commonly expected in the West that the plan to break up the Soviet state would succeed in the near future. And our own analytical evaluations as well led us to sad conclusions. As KGB chairman (and before that, chief of foreign intelligence for almost 15 years), I openly told Gorbachev in 1989, 1990, and 1991 of the impending danger. The trouble was that this man never told the truth. He hedged, dodged, and agreed: "Yes, yes." But no measures were taken, and everything was sliding into an abyss. Moreover, some of his actions did not fit with the notion of actions expected of a statesman, whose responsibility it was to take care of society and to try to forestall tragedy. The country was going through a succession of failures, but instead of holding the defense, and occasionally going on the offensive, all we did was retreat, retreat... The events that took place in the heart of Europe at the end of 1989 are something we will long remember. Even in the West the reaction to them was not at all uniform. In December 1989, President of France Mitterrand came to the GDR on an official three-day visit. And this at a time when the GDR already was falling apart; groups of youth from West Germany were attacking the building of the Ministry of State Security, and rallies had been held in some cities for the unification of West and East Germany. Of course, Mitterrand was well informed of the current events, but he wanted to demonstrate his goodwill stance toward the German Democratic Republic. The point is that neither France nor England were ready to see the GDR absorbed by West Germany. They thought it would be a slow process, within the framework of general European integration, in a form that would not affect its future in any way. Because both France and England know what a powerful unified Germany means... I cannot say that the processes were totally unexpected for us. The unexpected part was only that they rolled in so swiftly and that the leadership of the Soviet Union completely resigned themselves to it. I do not want to say that I was not related to it at all. I raised these questions. If you dig into documents you will find very alarming KGB memoranda addressed to Gorbachev, in which we warned of what could happen. As to Gorbachev, they valued him tremendously in Germany; he was later declared a "No. 1 German" in West Germany. By the way, Helmut Kohl said these notable words at the time: Germans should not miss the chance of unification, and that chance is a result of the fact that Gorbachev is at the helm of the Soviet Union. You know, this was not just surrendering positions--it was a real capitulation that happens only in the most serious defeat. We fled not only from the GDR but also from other countries, without a thought about our short-term interests. We welcomed German unification--in reality, the absorption of the GDR--without attaching any conditions to it. We abandoned our property; we abandoned our friends, who had been with us for 40 years, on whom we drew for support and who helped us; because it is hard to tell who gave more over the last few years: we to the GDR or the GDR to us. Then came the arrests of intelligence officers and statesmen. Erich Milke, minister of security and Hero of the Soviet Union, is in jail now--a man who put his entire life on the altar of internationalism, the altar of Soviet-German friendship. Some other friends from the Ministry of State Security are in jail on charges of horrendous crimes; and in general, many GDR statesmen are in prison for allegedly committing crimes against Germany. While all they did was carry out their duties as citizens of the completely independent state of the GDR--recognized in the world and, among others, at the United Nations... I think this is not the end of it all; there will be more. Because Germany already has revised the outcome of a world war once, and it cost us alone 27 million human lives... The story of the GDR is an ignominious page in our history, a shameful page, possibly with far-reaching consequences. If we continue to remain so unwise, this may do tremendous damage to our vital interests. You know how we lost many friends in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and many other places... I am not saying that Germany will definitely go in a direction fatefully detrimental for us. This depends on many factors. But if we continue to remain in our current state, whether we want it or not this will whet the appetite of other countries. And we should not expect altruism in this respect. [Prokhanov] It so happened that I went to Germany the day an aircraft carrying the ill Honecker was leaving for the Soviet Union from the same airport. He was coming to our country for treatment, but in reality he was flying there to a future of captivity, disgrace, humiliation, and arrest, perhaps knowing deep in his heart that this is exactly what awaited him. Gorbachev betrayed his trust--as he did with other allies, effectively surrendering them to enemies and tormentors. This is what I am thinking about, though. In 1945, when the Russian Army entered Berlin and Europe was still smoldering in the ashes of war, Stalin, together with the other leaders of victorious countries, carved up Europe, established borders, and accomplished a change of a social system in the countries of East Europe. What immense, if perhaps tragic for the population, measures were implemented across the entire enormous expanse from the Baltics to the Black Sea! A geopolitical design was implemented which, as rumor goes, had existed even before the war in the mind of Tarle, who read Stalin his treatises, his essays on a pan-Slavic union in Europe by the end of the 20th century... What I am saying is that after the war a superorganizational design was implemented, the result of which was the emergence of a pro-Soviet Europe. So why have all these efforts--military, economic, geopolitical--been nullified overnight? After all, there was already an entire generation of Czechs, Poles, and Germans with values and a psychology that the West Germans, for instance, still cannot grind out... One would think that such failure can be sustained only as a result of a strike, a crushing military defeat--of the kind that happened, for instance, to the Germans in 1945. We were fleeing from there as if we were under the fire of nuclear cannons and a strategic bombers' strike! As it turned out, however, it all happened after one or two trips by Gorbachev--one to Reykjavik, another to Malta. Somebody said a few words to somebody; somebody promised something to somebody; somebody shook somebody's hand in the quiet of an office; guarantees were given; perhaps an immense amount of money was paid, some immense promises made to Gorbachev... Why did one word of Gorbachev's all of a sudden prove stronger than the entire huge mega-machinery of the Soviet presence in Europe? What was it that they whispered to him, promised him? For me, as a writer, this is a mystery and a subject for a plot. What do you think? [Kryuchkov] There is one factor I would like to start with in answering. As you know, in 1990-1991 the system of governing our country, the decisionmaking mechanism, was changed. When we had Article 6 of the old Constitution, which formalized the leading role of the party, the most important issues, including those of foreign policy, were decided exclusively in the CPSU Central Committee Politburo. When we rejected the leading role of the party, we needed to replace the Politburo with another organ rather than leaving complete control over everything to one person--the president, no matter how much of a genius he might be. And Gorbachev was not such a person anyway. This gave Gorbachev, Shevardnadze, Yakovlev, and other persons the opportunity to make decisions without the support of legal norms and collective will. At the end of the war, when we were drained of our lifeblood, had lost tens of millions of people, East Europe, changed from a territory hostile to us to a friendly one. And when the processes of forming states with a new sociopolitical system began, there was no opposition. In the years following the war we quickly restored the ruined economy. This was a brilliant victory, perhaps as great in significance as the victory in the Great Patriotic War. In 1948-1949 we already reached the prewar level, and in 1950-1951 we began to bring on line plants, entire industrial complexes, electric power stations. The nation returned to life. We again became a great power the world had to reckon with. This said that the socialist system had not exhausted its possibilities but had just begun to approach them. We took the road that promised peace in Europe, and people understood this very well. I think that by all these deeds and accomplishments we built at the time a very serious margin of security for many decades and made good use of this margin. Our state had a huge safety margin. Our gold bullion alone amounted to 2,500 tonnes in 1953. Ask how much gold we have now. You will get an answer that is simply demeaning for us. We should look for answers to far-reaching questions in two directions. First, in our system, in our governing mechanism, the national leadership--that is, objective things. Second, we should give subjective factors their due. First and foremost the procedures for electing our presidents, evaluation of the possibility or impossibility of placing authority in their hands. This is a very important issue, and many countries have long insured themselves against all sorts of flukes. We, unfortunately, left a multitude of loopholes for these accidental things, and will pay for this more than once. [Prokhanov] Being a writer and a free artist, by a certain logic I found myself plunged into a journalistic battle when an all-out campaign began against the Soviet Army. I was amazed at how an army that has established control over half the world, is capable of sending aircraft carrier groups into every ocean and sending global control orbital stations into space, found itself defenseless against those who were destroying it in front of our very eyes! I remember: All of a sudden a theory was advanced that the Soviet Army is a source of thermonuclear threat, and the entire population was horrified by the possibility of the start of World War III, while the military was seen as the devil incarnate. I remember how it came out that the army was being called an army of parasites; when all our economic troubles, the insufficient percentage of protein in our nutrition, were being blamed on it: That it had allegedly exhausted our economy and eaten up our development potential. The military was accused of cruelty, of propagating ruthless, antihumane, almost brutal customs... I jumped into this battle, tried to explain that the military is the concentrate of statehood, the guarantor of world stability, and if we have no world wars it is only because the Soviet Army is strong. I tried to show that a Soviet officer, with his ethics based on sacrifice and service to the people, is the standard of public service to the country... A lot insults were heaped at me at the time. One of the latest phases associated with the collapse of the Soviet Army were the so-called "set-ups." The army was sent into zones of internal interethnic conflicts, in particular, Baku, Tbilisi, Vilnius, while at the same time a certain dual policy was conducted. One originated at the center, in particular, from Aleksandr Yakovlev, and encouraged in every way nationalist movements in the republics; people's fronts were springing up; our party leadership secretly met with their leaders and coddled them in every way. These people's fronts were a force that strived to seize power from the republic parties, from the republic leadership, and very serious conflicts were arising on these grounds. Another one was when the same center sent troops into the zone of conflict to suppress this unrest. First a wound was inflamed; then the steel probe of the army was sent, the wound was stirred up even more, and the result was a nationalist explosion. Use of force is very traumatic for the population; it incites them. An entire nation would rise up against the central military leadership. Then the military was called back and, having first established order, it withdrew in humiliation. The reputation of the military both in the republics and the Union was dropping to zero; commissions were set up, like Sobchak's, or the one with the participation of the writer Vasilyev. The military was traumatized, it was demoralized, and the winners were regionalism and separatism. Could you, as a person associated with intelligence, security, get a feel of all these mechanisms at the time? What was your perception of all these conflicts: Tbilisi, Baku, Vilnius? Who was the "architect" of this tragedy? [Kryuchkov] I remember very well how you fought for our military. I greatly appreciated your efforts then, and remember them now with gratitude. In 1990 Academician Arbatov began to say that our military budget considerably exceeded that of the United States. This was an outright lie. The U.S. budget at the time exceeded $300 billion, while ours was 70 billion rubles [R], but even then the dollar and the ruble were not comparable in weight. The attacks on the military pursued a single purpose: to knock out one of the most important pillars of the state. Of course, not everything was ideal in our military--there were a lot of shortcomings... At the same time, the military-industrial complex already in 1990 produced up to 100 percent of the output of certain categories of civilian products, in particular, television sets and washing machines; that is, even then it was not a burden to the state. In 1990 the Soviet Union accounted for more than one-third of global arms sales. Currently the United States' share is 38 percent, while quite recently it was only 18 percent. See who we have surrendered to?! Attacks on our military were being conducted in all directions, and I think that those who set as their goal to destroy it have achieved this to a considerable extent. In the level of combat readiness our current armed forces are hardly capable of deflecting any aggression. This is very serious. This "setting up" of the military began under Khrushchev. Remember the Novocherkassk events? Later, whenever a difficult situation arose, military units were moved to forward positions. In 1988-1989 events were brewing in the Caucasus, and again military units were activated there. Then came Karabakh, Lithuania, Baku, and so on. In Tbilisi, for instance, the army was cleverly set up in the interests of certain circles. Georgian forces were fighting for power. In order to avoid doing this themselves, they drew the armed forces into the conflict. I am fully convinced that this was not done without the knowledge of the highest leadership of the party and the state. In January 1991 the situation in Lithuania heated up so much, taking such an unpredictable turn, that it came to direct clashes on a massive scale. The forces that came to power took a position against the constitution of the USSR of the time and of the republic itself, and took a course on secession from the Union in a way not envisaged by the law. And the forces that wanted to prevent the violation of the constitution, that supported the Union, were subjected to direct persecution and repression. They had a moral right to defend themselves. Then the military units stationed in Lithuania decided to ensure minimal order, to forestall potential bloodshed. They were carrying out only protective functions. I remember very well the materials of the investigation. It followed from them that the casualties were killed and wounded not by the military but by other persons who were in the crowd, who were provoking the unrest, which was used by the reactionary forces in the republic as a pretext to start more active actions and as a result achieve their goals. The subsequent development of events in Lithuania fully confirmed this. I think that A. Yakovlev's trips to these republics at the time also played their role. Every time they were followed by an explosion of actions against the center, against the constitutional order. It is apparent that his hand showed in this, too. I once wrote in one of my articles about the actions of certain individuals who were beginning to destroy our Fatherland, and I will not take back a single word. I think that in terms of destructive force, in terms of exerting a corrupting influence on many aspects of our life, the main credit should go to A. Yakovlev. I cannot tell what drove him in the beginning: strictly personal traits, vanity, or something else, but in any case many of his actions were not in any sense in the interests of our state. [Prokhanov] I think that the history of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the current post-Soviet history are replete with mystery. History in general is a hierarchy of mysteries, most of which never come to the surface. Among the mysteries of the last decade is mentioned, for instance, the disappearance of the so-called party--essentially, state--gold. It is believed that there is still information on the highest leadership of the Soviet Union kept in secret safes that tells of their recruitment and their connections with secret, closed Western organizations. One such version, circulating to a very limited extent in intellectual circles and very cautiously mentioned at seminars and symposiums, concerns a certain German project nurtured in the Soviet leadership, involving an infusion of a large quantity of capital into West Germany and concealing this capital from the public. This capital allegedly was accumulated by German business and controlled by people from the Soviet Union for the contingency of post-Soviet history, when it is to be returned here, to our space, to nurture a new authority, a new generation of statesmen on the basis of a Russian-German alliance. Allegedly, already then a certain convergence of economies, of future financial systems, and future policy had begun. And one can see a trend toward rapprochement with Germany in today's convulsive political process. Among patriots, for instance, some are anti-German, while the others are pro-German. For instance, Zhirinovskiy openly proclaims a Russian-German alliance. Behind all these statements--speeches, hints, innuendoes--one can detect the formula of that early Soviet-German project. Do you know anything about this, have you heard about it? [Kryuchkov] I think your question is based to a certain extent on reality, but this is also a fruit of mythology. The actions of U.S. politicians are driven by one set of interests; our politicians are guided by other interests--if they are pro-Soviet, of course; the French have their own, the Chinese and Japanese--their own... These interests engender both certain alliances of forces, and their lobbying. Under Stalin, any lobbying was out of question. Sometime in the 1960's, however, under Khrushchev, we gradually began to practice a rather broad system of lobbying. It is time to tentatively identify our lobbying groups, without bringing up actual names at this point. I think that we have a pro-German lobby, a pro-American, pro-Chinese, pro-Japanese, and pro-European one; then there are branches of the above that do not play a significant role. [Prokhanov] The only lobby we do not have is a pro-Russian one. [Kryuchkov] Speaking of what you have in mind, I think that such a pro-Russian lobby is undergoing a revival today; it is getting stronger and broader. I believe that in a very near future it will proclaim itself loudly. Our lobbying does not operate by the same rules as in the West. The pro-Japanese lobby in the United States, for instance, spends enormous sums of money, makes major investments in economic sectors that are interesting and profitable for Japan. Our lobbies operate gratis. I am deeply convinced that the Germans, Americans, and others do not invest billions in lobbying in order to realize their ideas. On the contrary, they are pumping money out of our country. Because the aid that goes to Russia and some CIS countries--if one can call these crumbs aid--is generated through the theft taking place in our country. Tens of billions flow abroad, and at best only a few million come back. I have heard of this Soviet-German myth, and I am convinced that all this is not true. The Germans may, of course, spend some money to support the German communities in our state, to develop some or other sectors in our industry, to set up some training. But there is not and will not be powerful support for our pro-German lobby or billions in investment. Where have our reserves and wealth disappeared? A very simple thing is happening in this respect: At some stage we engaged in self-consumption. We permitted industrial production to decline, permitted inflation. Since the 1990's corruption has been spreading rapidly. In the past we had a foreign trade monopoly; today this would be our salvation. So why is our oil today sold by private individuals? Should not the state be doing this? What is happening is real squandering, real theft... As to the party money, I will tell you: Had there been, let us say, massive embezzlement of party money, a massive outflow of the party gold to a foreign country, I can assure you that the KGB certainly would have heard something about it. [Prokhanov] In your communications you constantly contemplate the problems of security, formulating its concept in classic form, creating a hierarchy of different levels of security, including cultural and intellectual. Its foundation, however, is still geopolitical security, the balance of world powers. Russia cannot be considered today a certain subject in a geopolitically finished form--this is meaningless. Today's Russia cannot formulate its security without measuring itself against, identifying itself with, neighboring Ukraine. It cannot formulate its security without the sense of its presence in Kazakhstan all the way to the Chinese border, without a perception of its historical and geopolitical unity with Belarus, which pushes the border of Russia's defense to the Polish border. What is your opinion of Russia's strategic interests? [Kryuchkov] To my great regret, I have come to the conviction that today's Russia is essentially not vital as a state. We have never been in such a grave situation with respect to security. We are currently vulnerable literally from all sides. Take our borders. Finland, the Baltics, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, China, Japan, the United States... It so happens that our borders have become disputable--at ,least we hear such voices from the other side of our borders. Before 1985 nobody raised such issues. The Soviet Union was a mighty superpower. Now all of a sudden everybody has simultaneously started voicing claims on our territories; even the Baltic countries have raised this issue. It has reached the point of direct provocations at borders. When there was a great Soviet Union, we could security defend one-sixth of the world's territory. First, our population comprised almost 300 million; second, we had strong industry and science. Our positions in East Europe, Asia, Africa, and some Latin American countries permitted us to be certain of our security. Nobody touched us. I think we could be "busy" with peaceful labor for another 50 years. Generally speaking, nothing and nobody threatened us. Now the situation has changed. Look to the east. Japan lays claim to Kuril Minor range. This is a serious claim, and the Japanese stand firm on it. They do not say that they will resolve this issue by force. But under certain circumstances the situation may become very unfavorable for us, and we will be helpless to do anything. We have reasonably good relations with China now. But China has never said that it does not have any territorial claims against us. Moreover, not the entire border is marked. Therefore, while giving due credit to the sensible policy of the current leadership of China, can we be sure that its next generation will hold the same course? Take the West. I think that the Germans would be well served if they do not forget the lessons of history and remember Bismarck, who understood the significance of Russia for Germany and nothing cast a shadow on our relations. But there also were two world wars. History has a peculiar trait--it repeats itself. If certain forces in Germany return to a militarist policy, is there someone to keep them from taking ill-considered steps? Moreover, there may be some who are interested in channeling Germany in a certain direction. I cannot understand the United States and the British, who are aware of this danger but so far remain silent. Our south also is very dangerous. We had strong positions in Afghanistan, but the situation has changed. There are countries with which we absolutely have to be friends. I mean India--our natural geopolitical ally, which has a stake in good relations with us. There is a large group of countries in Asia which we can regard with great optimism. These are so-called minor countries that already play an important role--South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines... We had strong positions in Africa, and some used to say: What are we doing; why are we there? But let us think about it once again. Our expenditures there were minimal, while we did derive a certain profit. In addition, this was where the struggle was conducted for political positions at our remote outposts. Now we are approachable--almost to the heart of Russia... We also had good relations developing with a number of Latin American countries. We had active military cooperation with Peru, and due to this factor alone we were receiving up to $1 billion of net profit. And generally, Latin America is a very promising continent from the standpoint of our geopolitical situation. Unless there is sharp progress in the very near future in relations with CIS countries, unless we take the road of close integration, the situation will become very difficult for all of us. Still, I am an optimist and I believe that this process will begin, and Russia, together with parts of the former Soviet Union, will create a society, a state entity, that will ensure our collective security. There is currently a certain imbalance in the world: Some countries are coming to the forefront, some are receding, but sooner or later everything will stabilize. We would be ill-advised to believe that all of this will happen on its own. Nothing of the sort! Without human will, without the will of the leadership of certain countries, this is not going to happen. [Prokhanov] And what about such a problem for Russia--and many other countries as well--as the Jewish problem? The Jewish factor played an enormous role in foreign and domestic policy in the former Soviet Union and in today's Russia. At certain times it went under the surface, took on a coded form, and then at some point it would suddenly become a priority, and entire political groups mulled over it. Sometimes the Jewish problem held the threat of a global catastrophe--as it did during the Arab-Israeli wars in the Near East. Today the Jewish problem is delineated by an internal drama, the Russian-Jewish conflict at ideological, cultural, and ethnic level, as well as the drama of the Russian choice in the Near East. Traditional groups of Arab countries still see us as a potential ally who betrayed them at a crucial moment. Israel, on the other hand, is the strategic ally of the United States, with which today's Russia has established long-term relations of partnership. This mysterious triangle, or if you wish, polygon, today grips human passions and destinies. Enormous energies are being burned in this regard, and completely unproductively. How do you see the Russian-Jewish issue, the political factor of Russia and Israel in the context of 20th century history? [Kryuchkov] This question does have peculiar aspects. The explanation to them is in the history of the Jewish people, their difficult road in the struggle for survival. For thousands of years Jews were a relatively small nation in a far from friendly environment. They not only survived, but increased their numbers and in the end achieved the formation of an independent state. In a historical sense, Russia has long been a motherland for a considerable number of Jews. According to the 1897 census, half the world population of Jews lived within the borders of tsarist Russia. Over the last couple of decades not everything was smooth in relations between the Soviet Union and Israel. Problems arose with respect to Jewish emigration, and this gave rise to arguments, confrontation, and misunderstanding. Currently this problem has been removed. And I do not see any other problems that could somehow seriously damage Russo-Israeli relations. At the same time I believe that a society cannot consider itself healthy if it produces, for instance, anti-Georgian, anti-Ukrainian, anti-Belarusian, or anti-Jewish attitudes. But this is a two-edged process. Over the past few years we have had no direct anti-Jewish manifestations. I remember that when I was KGB chairman we received warnings of potential anti-Jewish pogroms. We checked them out and never found anything to them. Apparently what we are dealing with is not some anti-Jewish manifestations but simply disagreement with some or other aspects of Israeli policy toward, for instance, Arab countries. In my opinion, it has not been optimal. Lately, history has demonstrated that there are healthy forces in Israel; there are smart people who understand that it is necessary to move into a broad front of development of Arab-Israeli relations. And this viewpoint now prevails. I do not think that Jews in the Soviet Union are in a position of an oppressed ethnic group. Nothing of the kind. They hold decent positions in all spheres of administration, industry, agriculture, medicine, science, etc. Moreover, I think that there are certain extremes in this, too, but this is happening for the reason of certain special traits of their character and partly because of the complacency of Russians. I think that some persons of Jewish nationality are making a serious mistake. They frequently go too far in labeling some or other political figure an anti-Semite. This is not always so. For instance, speaking against certain aspects of Tel Aviv's policy does not mean one is an anti-Semite. Speaking against certain actions of persons of Jewish nationality here does not mean one is an anti-Semite, either. In the same way one can speak against Kazakhs, Ukrainians, Belarusians, but this does not mean that this person is anti-Kazakh, anti-Ukrainian, or anti-Belarusian. I think that the process of creating a better atmosphere for the development of relations between Russia and Israel must proceed from both sides. Israel and Russia have serious reasons to speak of the compatibility of certain interests in the geopolitical structure of the world. And in this respect we absolutely cannot orient ourselves toward individual persons of Jewish nationality. I, for one, will never judge the position of all Jews by the actions and deeds of, for instance, Minkin, Plutnik, and some others. This is far from full compatibility, of course, but it would not be in the interests of either country to disregard it. [Prokhanov] I propose that we come down from geopolitical heights back to our sinful earth. On one hand, it seems to me that the current regime, having gone through phases of crises, in a way has suddenly come to its senses and begun to take steps towards stabilization in Russia. Attempts are being made to stabilize the sociopsychological atmosphere by all these charters of reconciliation, through state regulation of the economy. There are attempts to stabilize the situation at the border. There is talk about military development, increasing military orders. We, people of the opposition, should appraise all this positively. Hurt and insulted, remembering all the wounds and traumas dealt us by the regime, we still should not reject outright all these actions aimed at stabilization. On the other hand, against this background, which to a large extent is only being proclaimed, we see again some steps towards destroying the remnants of Russian statehood. This involves the system of security, everything that used to be called the ministry of security and now has become the Federal Counterintelligence Service. People come to me from these agencies, people who have left, been fired, have fled, been thrown out--they are horrified at what is being done to this last bulwark of Russia's security. What is your opinion of what is happening in your former domain, the Committee for State Security, and what this organism is being turned into? What does this mean for the state and the country? [Kryuchkov] Yeltsin's latest steps, aimed at reaching an accord, were manifested impulsively earlier as well, in the form of occasionally dropped phrases, because you cannot keep threatening and act only by enforcement methods. I think the explanation is simple: The regime has found itself in a very difficult situation; many see it as hopeless, and therefore they undertook such steps in the interests of survival. But I also think that those to whom this accord is being offered would be wrong not to use this opportunity to ease the hardship of life for our people. It is another matter what the proposal will be. We have to look at it. Problems related to state security are closer to me. I could anticipate and have anticipated many things, but what has happened in our Fatherland has exceeded my worst expectations. In August 1991 the first reorganization of the KGB took place; at the end of 1991--the second; then the third... I have lost count. We need to organize not just reliable security but also make it economical. Everything that is being done currently is not economical. Because these organizations have not become smaller numerically--they have simply been dispersed into different corners. There is no system now in dealing with security problems, and this is impermissible. There are apparently considerable means allocated to it, considering the disastrous state of the country, but the entire system of security--and this is the tragedy--is subordinated not to the interests of the state but those of a certain individual. How long can this go on? A year, two, three... Sooner or later it will all collapse anyway. Intelligence has been separated; counterintelligence, communications, protective units, technical services, border troops have been taken out of the total structure of security; that is, everything is fragmented. Until August 1991 everything was a single mechanism; we were at a level necessary to deal with problems of security associated with the country as a whole. Now this does not exist. We know that thousands of skilled personnel have left the organs; new ones have come, poorly trained--they have different selection criteria there now: apparently loyalty toward the regime rather than professional skills. In the past the most important thing for us was attitude towards the Motherland, this was a sacred notion. In the past, we had duty--another sacred notion. Now everything has shifted and lost shape. The system of security--broken up, dismembered, drained of its lifeblood, stripped of cadres--is unable to deal with the tasks it is facing. Those who will inherit this component of our statehood, or rather its bits and pieces, will find themselves in a very difficult situation. How do we solve security problems? We have to work on this fast, because intelligence operations against our country continue, the drug business is growing, international organized crime is active, smuggling is running wild, our secrets are swimming away... There are some secrets that are worth billions of dollars, and they are being taken from us almost for free. While the organs, drained and destroyed, are expected to fight all this. [Prokhanov] The country is living through, as we say, a systemic crisis. This is the crisis of the socium in all its manifestations. Among the directions in which it is developing there is a power dimension. We are living through a crisis of authority. In normal constitutional societies this is resolved by changing the cabinet, leadership, course. The losing team gives way to another one through constitutional forms. In our country this is apparently precluded. All crises since 1991 have been resolved by methods of force. I have a feeling that this power crisis, as it grows rather than diminishes, must produce a cascade of similar power catastrophes. It is not accidental that the whole society was traumatized by rumors of a state coup. Society did not treat it as another canard because the idea of coups is hanging in the air. We are waiting for them and practically inviting them. Does your experience, your intuition, tell you that these coups are becoming a norm in our troubled times? [Kryuchkov] I think we are dealing here with a very troublesome phenomenon which perhaps no other country has had to face. Efforts are being made to make our public, our people, get used to everything that is unusual in normal life, even unnatural, impermissible. For instance, a change in a social system occurs either as a result of a revolution or with the consent of the entire nation. In our country one sociopolitical system has been changed or is about to be changed without asking anyone. Moreover, we had a referendum on 17 March; we had a Union--they simply broke it up. Also, without asking anyone. Force is being used in dangerous dimensions. Last year will go down in history by its October tragedy, during which hundreds of totally innocent people died. We had one coup, then a second, a third... Now there is talk of the probability of another coup. One gets the impression that there is a group of people trying to find a way out of the crisis by the same method of force. I do not think that Yeltsin necessarily is the source; there are other people. They want us to get used to the idea that an enforcement structures' strike against the forces that allegedly are plotting a coup is a logical thing to do. This is the most dangerous method of resolving the problems we now face. And at the same time they exhort us to reach a peaceful accord... I would like very much for Russia to get rid of such cataclysms, and look for a constructive way out of the crisis situation. But I am afraid that interested forces may provoke an attack against those who do indeed stand for order.
