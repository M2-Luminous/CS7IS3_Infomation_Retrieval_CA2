On Friday media reports said that "the terroristic group Les [not further identified] based on the outskirts of the Ossetian village of Tarskoye where the state of emergency is in effect killed eight Georgians near the Ingush village of Algun who were building a road between Ingushetia and Georgia, bypassing North Ossetia. They said that the bodies of the builders were allegedly transported to the Sunzhensk district of Ingushetia. Information obtained by ITAR-TASS from the press service of the North Ossetian Interior Ministry said that the group Les does not exist in the republic. The Ingush side made a statement about the brutal killing of the Georgian workers without preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident, the press service said. The press service said that the aim of this disinformation is to "aggravate the situation on the eve of the debates on the extension of the state of emergency in parts of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, discredit North Ossetian bodies of power, build up tension and disrupt the negotiation process initiated by North Ossetia." The state of emergency in some districts of North Ossetia has been extended until May 31. According to reports, the situation in these districts remains tense mostly because of the continuing fighting and attacks on civilians, military units and police patrols and hostage taking. Sporadic shooting broke out seven times in the Prigorod District of North Ossetia last night. No casualties were reported. The situation is under control of Russian peace-keeping troops and local law enforcement bodies.
