FR940224-0-00019 FR940224-0-00002 Following the enactment of FDICIA, which expanded the lending limit provision of section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act to cover directors and their related interests, questions were raised more frequently regarding the scope and proper application of the tangible economic benefit rule. If interpreted literally, the tangible economic benefit rule would apply whenever a bank extended credit to any person, including a member of the general public with no other relationship to the bank, and the proceeds of the extension of credit were transferred to or used for the benefit of an insider or an insider's related interest. For example, as one commenter noted, loans on non-preferential terms to members of the general public to purchase homes from a builder who is a director of the bank would be treated as loans to the builder/director. The tangible economic benefit rule is similar to a provision contained in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, and was adopted at a time when the Board was required by section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act to use the definition of ``extension of credit'' found in section 23A. See Public Law 95&hyph;630 Section 104, 92 Stat. 3644 (1978). The definition of extension of credit in section 22(h), however, is no longer tied to section 23A, and the Board is authorized to adopt appropriate definitions of terms in the statute. See 12 U.S.C. 375b(9)(D) and 375b(10). The Board therefore proposed to revise the tangible economic benefit rule to clarify that it was not intended to reach such transactions, by providing explicitly that the rule does not apply to an arm's-length 4 extension of credit by a bank to a third party where the proceeds of the credit are used to finance the bona fide acquisition of property, goods, or services from an insider or an insider's related interest. 4 In order to satisfy this requirement, the extension of credit to the general public must be on terms that would satisfy the standard set forth in ยง215.4 of Regulation O if the extension of credit was being made directly to an insider or an insider's related interest. Commenters supported the proposal, and no adverse comments were received. Three commenters objected to the requirement that any arm's-length loan satisfy the non-preferential provisions for insider loans found in ยง215.4(a), labelling that requirement overly restrictive. The Board has retained the requirement, however, that loans be on non-preferential terms, in order to prevent banks from participating in commercial promotions that benefit the bank's insiders to the detriment of the bank. 5 5 One other commenter sought clarification on the relationship between the tangible economic benefit rule and another rule in Regulation O that states that loans made by a bank to a partnership in which one or more executive officers of the bank hold a majority interest are to be attributed in full to each of the executive officers. 12 CFR 215.5(b). The introductory portion of ยง215.5 has been revised to clarify the interplay between ยง215.5 and the general provisions of Regulation O. Continuing to be covered by the tangible economic benefit rule are extensions of credit to an insider's nominee and transactions in which the proceeds of the credit are loaned to an insider. The Board also notes that provisions of the definition of ``extension of credit'' outside the tangible economic benefit rule will continue to reach transactions in which an insider actually becomes obligated to a bank, ``whether the obligation arises directly or indirectly, or because of an endorsement on an obligation or otherwise, or by any means whatsoever.'' 12 CFR 215.3(a)(8). B. Discount of Obligations without Recourse Regulation O includes within the definition of ``extension of credit'' any ``discount of promissory notes, bills of exchange, conditional sales contracts, or similar paper, whether with or without recourse .'' 12 CFR 215.3(a)(5) (emphasis added). At the time this provision was adopted, the Board was required by section 22(h) to include such items in the regulatory definition of extension of credit. 6 However, the current statutory definition does not require the inclusion of such items where the transaction is made without recourse to the transferor. 7 The Board proposed to delete this provision so as to exclude non-recourse transactions from Regulation O coverage. Transactions entered into with recourse to the transferor would continue to be covered under other provisions of the definition. See 12 CFR 215.3(a)(4) and (8). 6 The current definition of ``extension of credit'' in Regulation O was adopted in 1979, when the Board substantially amended the regulation in order to implement the Financial Institutions Regulatory Act of 1978 (FIRA), Public Law 95&hyph;630 Section 104, 92 Stat. 3644 (1978). 44 FR 12963, March 9, 1979. FIRA added section 22(h) to the Act, which in turn incorporated the definition of ``extension of credit'' contained in section 23A. At that time, section 23A's definition included the above-referenced provision concerning the discount of paper acquired with or without recourse. See Public Law 89&hyph;485 Section 12, 80 Stat. 241 (1966). 7 The statutory cross-reference to section 23A was deleted from section 22(h) in 1982. See Public Law 97&hyph;230 Section 410, 96 Stat. 1520 (1982). FDICIA added a new definition of ``extension of credit'' to section 22(h), which applies whenever a member bank makes or renews a loan, grants a line of credit, or enters into any similar transaction as a result of which a person becomes obligated to pay money or its equivalent to the bank. See 12 U.S.C. 375b(9)(D). This definition does not cover all transactions, such as the purchase of assets, covered by section 23A.
