He said it is necessary to concentrate hard on the position and role of political and legal work from the high plane of maintaining the concept of class struggle and strengthening dictatorship, from the high plane of safeguarding modernization, and from the high plane of maintaining the unity of the motherland and opposing ethnic separation. The most important concern for CPC committees and all levels in leading and supporting political and legal work is leading and supporting political and legal departments in maintaining the basic line of "a single center and two basic points," and leading and supporting political and legal departments in eradicating impediments and interference in strict enforcement of the law. It is necessary to uphold a combination of expert work and the mass line, closely relying on the masses of all nationalities to concentrate on stability. CPC committees and governments at all levels must give energetic support to working conditions. All jurisdictions must also show sufficient concern and support for the real difficulties of political and legal departments, making a needed tilt in favor of political and legal departments in the allocation of operating expenses and providing material support to increase inputs into political and legal departments. In a speech at the beginning of the conference, autonomous region CPC committee standing committee member and political and legal committee secretary Li Fengzi [2621 6646 3320] said that the emphasis in the 1994 "severe blows" battle should be on "breaking big cases, striking at gangs, and pursuing escaped convicts." Criminals who have committeed serious crimes that hurt the people's welfare, damage the social and economic order, and endanger public safety such as murder, robbery, rape, grand larceny, and the production and sale of drugs must be resolutely punished severely and quickly according to law. Each jurisdiction must set its own emphasis as conspicuous local problems warrant, focusing on crimes that can be attacked in a concentrated way such as robbery, car-jackings and police officers putting up roadblocks to collect fines and fees, and hit and run offenses, as well as criminal activities about which there is strong public reaction. A targeted, planned, and step-by-step struggle that has specific goals and specific actions must be organized promptly. An unrelenting battle must be waged to eliminate pornography and eradicate the "six evils." A resolute attitude and strong measures must be taken against disgusting social acts that the public strongly opposes like prostitution, drug taking, and gambling to bring them under real control, cracking down on them severely and stamping them out according to law, punishing them strictly in accordance with regulations, and positively not allowing them to run rampant.
