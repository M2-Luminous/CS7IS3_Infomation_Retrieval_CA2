The report said that the official, Pak Tong-chun, head of the North Korean mission in Paris, claimed that Washington accepted the principle of pulling 37,000 American troops out of South Korea under the frame of a "secret" bilateral agreement which was agreed in December 1993 in New York and concluded last February. "The United States asked us not to leak this, but they breached all the promises later," Pak was quoted as saying. The daily said Pak failed to produce any evidence and a spokesman for the U.S. State Department declined a comment on Pak's allegation. Meanwhile, in an interview with the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, Pak denied North Korea's nuclear development but said his country is prepared to wage a war if it is necessary to safeguard "our essential national interests." He said that any North Korean attack on the United States, China or Japan with nuclear weapons would be a suicidal act. "We cannot even think of attacking South Korea, our same people," Pak told the TRIBUNE. Asserting that the United States had invented all problems like the theory of North Korean attack simply to justify their presence in South Korea, Pak said that North Korea has reached the limit of patience and has no intent of making concessions any further.
