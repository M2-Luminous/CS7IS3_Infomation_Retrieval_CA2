In view of the fact employees of the private sector received their biweekly salaries and 13th-month bonuses today, stores should have remained open until after 2100. This was not the case, however. By 1900, almost every store was closed, and the few that remained open were empty. The uncertainty of the situation harmed local business. [Begin recording] [Ricardo Duran] There was even talk of street violence, strikes and so forth, and this prompted some businesses to release their employees a little earlier and to close. After seeing what happened this evening, however, I believe the country will return to normal tomorrow. [Rivera] Did this situation in any way affect the country's economic activity? [Duran] I would imagine so. I hope no great harm was done, and thank God it will not be permanent. [end recording] According to Monsignor Brown, the president's announcement did not cause any surprise. [Begin recording] [Brown] I believe too great an expectation was created for what, in fact, was said. [Rivera] Do you believe this will have an effect on politics? [Brown] I do not know. It is difficult to say. [Rivera] What is your opinion of what Endara said? Was there any substance? [Brown] In reality, he did not say much. [end recording] It is most likely the country will return to normalcy, and the electoral campaign will continue as it has until now.
