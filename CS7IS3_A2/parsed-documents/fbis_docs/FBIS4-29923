Under such a thrilling [pokchan] atmosphere, we are observing a meaningful day marking Comrade Kim Chong-il's, the dear leader of our party and people, 30th anniversary of working at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. Our party members and people, who look back with deep emotion on the past 30 years of history in which they have marched following the great guidance, are filled with great pride and dignity of upholding the peerless man. They are filled with firm resolve to endlessly glorify our party's leadership achievements. Three decades ago, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to lead the party work, responding to the desire of all the people and the requirement of the developing revolution. It was a great event of historic significance in the development of the party and the revolution. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The question of inheriting the leadership has been successfully solved in our country because Comrade Kim Chong-il wisely guided the overall work of the party, the state, and the Army from a long time ago. The working class cause of revolution and party building has been pioneered by the leader [suryong] and is inherited and consummated by the leader [yongdoja] who is endlessly faithful to the leader's [suryong] cause. Upholding the leader [chidoja] who has distinguished resources and traits of leadership at the head of the party and revolution is a fundamental problem deciding the destiny and future of the revolution. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great leader [yongdoja] who has a rare ideological and theoretical wisdom, excelled in the art of leadership, and the invincible art of military operations. He is a true leader [chidoja] of the people who has both literary and military accomplishments. With Comrade Kim Chong-il leading the party work, a broad road has opened to glorify the party forever as a revolutionary party of chuche and accomplish the revolutionary cause of chuche pioneered in the thick forests of Mt. Paektu. We cannot think about the indomitable might of today's WPK, the grand appearance of our ever-victorious socialist fatherland, and the bright future for our revolution and nation, apart from this historical event in which a great guiding hand of our party work has reached. The past 30 years in which our people have advanced, following the illustrious leader, are glorious decades in which the most brilliant era has opened in the development of the party and the revolution and decades of victory and feats. Our revolution's atmosphere at home and abroad was difficult and arduous in the past and immense tasks of struggle have been laid before our party. However, thanks to the leadership of the dear comrade leader who has shouldered all the burdens of the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause and the cause of party building and led our party and people to one road of invincibility, our revolution has vigorously marched on the one road of chuche pioneered by the great leader [suryong] in the thick forest of Mt. Paektu. During these days, an era of great creation and reform that can be labelled as a heyday of the WPK has come to this land and the question of inheriting the revolutionary cause has been brilliantly solved in conformity with the demand of the times and our people's ardent aspirations. By leading the party from the 1960's to the 1990's in which most upheaval events of the century took place, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has performed immortal feats for the era and the revolution that will shine long in history. The history of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's revolutionary activities is a glorious and brilliant history of struggle of a distinguished thinker and theoretician who has immensely exalted the chuche idea as the guiding idea of the era with his rare intelligence. [Text] Resolutely adhering to and enriching the leadership ideology created by the leader [suryong] are the most important work in completing the independent cause of the popular masses. From his early days, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, with rare energy and inquiring spirit, has waged creative ideological and theoretical activities. By doing so, he has developed and enriched the leader's [suryong] revolutionary ideas in conformity with the people's aspiration and the demand of times at a time when the question of inheriting the revolutionary cause has been raised. This course has been the path in which the trend of all sorts of reactionary and opportunistic ideologies have been sharply criticized and the essence of the working class' revolutionary idea has been adhered to. This course has also been the days of creative contemplation in which unpredictable new theoretical and practical questions arising in the revolution and construction have been explained with the iron-willed theories. On this historic course, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary ideas have been formalized as a monolithic system of the chuche ideological and theoretical method, and all the components have been completely enriched and developed as new principles and contents. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has published many works during the past 30 years, including the works published on 19 February and 2 August, 1974, "On the Chuche Idea," "Historic Lessons From Socialist Construction and Our Party's General Line," and "On the Fundamental Questions of Our Revolutionary Party Building." These works are an undying banner that enables our party and people to carry forward the revolutionary cause of chuche to accomplishment, and a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon that leads the socialist cause of our era along an ever-victorious road. Truly, an era led by the dear comrade leader is a proud era in which the chuche idea, sowed on the soil of our people and brought up as a dense forest by the great leader [suryong], has been glorified as a great leading idea presenting the present time and the future of communism.

Today, the invincible might, combat capacity, and high dignity cherished by the WPK are connected with the name of the dear comrade leader who has led the cause of party building for several years at the fore, under the slogan of modelling the entire party after the chuche idea. The course of the revolutionary activities of Comrade Kim Chong-il is proud annals of an experienced, veteran statesman and a great strategist, who has firmly defended the socialist cause of our own style and powerfully displayed the dignity and honor of socialism.

This is because of the great leadership of the dear comrade leader, who possesses an iron-like will and extraordinary leadership, and the most solid political, economic, and military might achieved by the dear comrade leader. Under the slogan, "Modeling the whole society under the chuche idea," the dear comrade leader called for vigorously carrying out the three revolutions in all fields of the revolution and construction, thus he unfolded a great flowering period of socialism of our own style centered on the popular masses on this land. Socialism of our own style, which is being led and elucidated by the dear comrade leader, is socialism which is formed by a strong main force of the revolution in which all the people are firmly united around the party and the leader; socialism endlessly developing above the firm basis of self-dependence, self-support, and self-reliant defense; and socialism in which the people's independent and creative lives are in full bloom. In the long course of the revolution, the dear comrade leader has provided a strong and mighty national defense power that can firmly carry out our socialist cause in any environment.

Today's majestic advance is an honorable and rewarding struggle to vigorously demonstrate to the world the indomitable mettle and might of our people who are blessed with the dear leader's leadership. All party members and the working people should achieve a decisive advance in the struggle to implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy by displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and, thus, should enhance the superiority of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style. We should accelerate the revolution and construction with a strained and mobilized posture and should effect a new upsurge in all sectors of economic construction and national defense construction. All officers and men of the Korean People's Army should cherish deeper in their hearts the sacred mission of firmly defending with rifle the party's cause, that is, the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il's cause; should thoroughly implement the supreme commander's order; and, thus, should firmly deepen the might of our Army. We should also lead the laudable custom of army-people unity, which has reached a high plane in the course of upholding the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander, to be brought to fuller bloom in the whole society. Today, the enemies of the revolution are viciously running wild. However, the future of our revolution is bright, and our victory is certain.
