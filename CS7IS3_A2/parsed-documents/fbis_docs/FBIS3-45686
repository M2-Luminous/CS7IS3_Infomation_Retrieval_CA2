Lu Peijian, auditor-general of the State Auditing Administration, said here today at a national auditing conference that one of the main tasks of this year's work is to check for the existence of illegal transmissions of capital funds in financial departments. He explained that from this year on, about one-third of the major state projects currently under construction will have to be audited every year. Those already completed will certainly be included. The auditing administrations will mainly check whether investment in these projects has been directly and rationally applied to its designated uses. So far as overseas-funded construction projects are concerned, Lu said, standard audit reports will be submitted to overseas investors, so as to be in line with international practice. China has yielded good results in auditing during the last ten years since it set up formal auditing administrations. In the period, over 22.8 billion yuan which should have been raised for state financial departments but had been pocketed illegally has been uncovered by auditing administrations. As a result, they have helped cut down state expenses by more than 40 billion yuan.
