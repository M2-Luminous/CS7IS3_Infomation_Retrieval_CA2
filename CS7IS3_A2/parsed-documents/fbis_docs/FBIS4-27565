The organization, which polled 152 top executives of large corporations in mid-May, said four out of five businessmen expect business conditions to improve in the second half of the current business year or later. According to the results, 75.0 percent of those surveyed said the economy's future course is unpredictable, though they have seen some signs of bottoming out. Another 24.3 percent said the economy has not yet bottomed out, while only 0.7 percent said the economy has already hit bottom and prospects are bright. As for the timing of recovery, 40.6 percent said they expect it in the October-December period this year, while 39.9 percent predicted the January-March period or later next year. On corporate capital investment, many of the surveyed said recovery will take a considerably long time because many companies are slowly completing stock adjustment. Some respondents also predicted that major corporations will shift their investment from domestic to overseas markets to take advantage of the higher yen. They predicted investment will for a while center on rationalizing equipment and renewing existing facilities as part of their restructuring programs. Corporate investment that will boost the economy will come much later, they added.
