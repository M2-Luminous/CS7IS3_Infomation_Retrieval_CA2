FR940325-1-00045 FR940325-1-00008 A second problem of the current fee formula is that while forage value in the private market has increased substantially over time, the Federal grazing fee formula has produced relatively small increases and, in some years, decreases. In 1980, for example, the private grazing land lease rate for the 11 western States, weighted by survey weights as determined by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, was $7.53, while the Federal fee was $2.36; thus, the difference between the private and Federal rates in 1980 was $5.17. In 1993, the private grazing land lease rate for the 11 western States was $10.03, while the Federal fee was $1.86. Thus, the difference between the two figures had jumped to $8.17. The proposed formula would address the failure of the existing formula adequately to reflect private grazing land market conditions by including a base value that considers the cost differences of operating on public lands as compared to private leases, as well as appraisal data, and by annually adjusting the fee in proportion to changes in private grazing land lease rates. After an initial phase-in period, the fee would be adjusted annually to reflect the change in the private land lease rate in the 17 western States (i.e., forage value index). Although no explicit index based on production costs or value of products produced is used, both factors influence the prices paid for forage and so are, to some extent, implicit in the forage value index. The proposed formula is essentially a return to the simpler formula that was in effect before 1978 using an updated base value. While the proposed rule would move toward greater equity among fees, it would still result in a fee below the fees charged for grazing on State lands in most western States, and would fall well below private grazing land lease rates. The amount by which the fee would increase is similar to recent increases that have taken place at the State level; those increases have not led to noticeable shifts in the livestock industry or economic effects on communities in those States. This, when considered with the reasonableness of the proposed fee increase and the fact that more than 73 percent of BLM permittees and lessees would experience a fee increase of less than $1,000 per year, offers evidence that the proposed change in the fee would generally not have a significant impact on the stability of the dependent western livestock industry and would not have a serious detrimental effect on most permittees and lessees. Some permittees and lessees that are highly dependent on Federal forage, do not have off-ranch income, and have heavy debt loads may be required to make some financial adjustments. These adjustments, in some circumstances, may include sale of the ranch; however, it is expected that such sales will occur in limited circumstances. Such sales, it should be noted, are occurring and will continue to take place under current conditions, as well. The economic impact on western communities is expected to be localized and, in most areas, not significant because that portion of the local economy that depends upon the use of Federal forage is relatively minor. The initial proposal generated a great amount of public comment both for and against increasing the fee. Most of the comments related to the anticipated impacts to individual operators and to rural western economies. Many respondents suggested regional economic differences, the cost of investment in public lands, and overall rangeland resource conditions should be considered in determining grazing fees. Some felt the proposed fee would be economically devastating, and some felt that a fee increase was warranted, but the proposal represented too little or too great an increase. As a result of the public input gained following the advance notice of proposed rulemaking and through the scoping process for the environmental analysis of Rangeland Reform '94, the Department has determined that the fee formula initially proposed represents a reasonable and equitable method for calculating the fee. However, an adjustment in the forage value index is proposed in this draft. A provision for an incentive-based fee has also been added. A base value of $3.96 per AUM to be used in calculating the grazing fee is proposed in this rule. This value represents a midrange between the results obtained through the use of two methods for estimating a fair base value. Explanation of the methodology used in arriving at the $3.96 base value is presented in the discussion of section 4130.7&hyph;1. The proposed fee would be phased in over the years 1995 through 1997. Thereafter, annual increases or decreases in the grazing fee resulting from changes in the forage value index would be limited to 25 percent of the amount charged the previous year to provide for a measure of stability that would facilitate business planning. This proposed rule would establish 1996 as the base year for the forage value index used in the formula. The forage value index would not be used to adjust the fee annually in response to market conditions until the year 1997. This proposed rule would establish the 1995 grazing fee at $2.75, and the 1996 grazing fee at $3.50. Thereafter the fee would be calculated, except as provided below, using the base value of $3.96 multiplied by the revised forage value index. By definition, the forage value index in the year 1997 would equal one; yielding a 1997 grazing fee of $3.96. In subsequent years the calculated fee would depend on the changes in the market rate for private grazing land leases as reflected by the forage value index. By comparison, the 1994 grazing fee established under the existing regulations is $1.98 per AUM. This change in the derivation of the forage value index is proposed to reduce the uncertainty in the fee in the immediate future that resulted from using a forage value index based on less current private land lease rate data. Under the proposal presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the fee would have been adjusted annually by a forage value index based on the average price paid for private grazing in the years 1990 through 1992. Assuming that forage value index would have remained constant until the end of the phase in period provided in the advance notice, the formula would have yielded a grazing fee of $4.28 per AUM as compared to a 1997 fee of $3.96 per AUM using the revised forage value index.
