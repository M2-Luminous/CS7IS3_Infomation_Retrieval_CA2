FR941206-2-00109 FR941206-2-00074 II. Discussion The Commission believes the portion of the proposed rule change relating to the transfer of customer accounts is consistent with Section 15A of the Act and, therefore, is approving that portion of the proposal. Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 15A(b)(6) 8 of the Act which requires that the rules of the NASD be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 8 15 U.S.C. 78o-3. By amending its rules to shorten the time frames for customer account transfers in order that its rules correspond with the rules of the NYSE and the NSCC, the NASD's proposed rule change should foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, and settling securities. By shortening the time it takes to transfer securities from one broker-dealer to another, the proposal also should assist investors by giving them greater flexibility in the selection of a broker-dealer through which to hold securities and by giving them enhanced control over their assets. Shortening the time it takes to transfer securities to a broker-dealer also should facilitate transactions in securities. NASD has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the portion of the proposed rule change relating to customer account transfers prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing. On September 2, 1994, the Commission approved the NYSE's proposed rule change to implement corresponding changes to the NYSE's procedures for transferring customer accounts. 9 The NYSE amendments relating to the automated transfer of mutual fund positions and residual credit processing become effective 180 days from approval i.e., on March 3, 1995) while all other provisions become effective 90 days from approval i.e, on December 2, 1994). Because many broker-dealers are subject to both the NYSE's rules and the NASD's rules and because of systems changes NSCC has made to its customer account transfer system, it is important that the rules of the NYSE and the NASD's rules and because of systems changes NSCC has made to its customer account transfer system, it is important that the rules of the NYSE and the NASD do not conflict. In order to permit the NASD's rules to become effective simultaneously with the NYSE's rules, the Commission is granting accelerated approval to the portion of the proposed rule change relating to customer account transfers. Thus, sections 65(m)(2) and 65(m)(3), relating to automated transfer of mutual fund positions and residual credit processing, will became effective on March 3, 1995, and all other amendments to Section 65 will become effective on December 2, 1994. 9 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34633 (September 2, 1994), 59 FR 46872. III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the portion of the proposed rule change relating to customer account transfers is consistent with Section 15A of the Act. It is therefore ordered. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the portion of the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;56) containing the amendments to Section 65 be and hereby is approved. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation pursuant to delegated authority. 10 10 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
