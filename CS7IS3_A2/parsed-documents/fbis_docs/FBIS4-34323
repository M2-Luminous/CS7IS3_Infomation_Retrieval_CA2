FBIS4-34323 "drlat118_a_94014" FBIS-LAT-94-118 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Lage: Embassy Entries `Provocation by Enemies' Lage: Embassy Entries `Provocation by Enemies' PA1906141594 Paris AFP in Spanish 1030 GMT 19 Jun 94 PA1906141594 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Madrid, 19 Jun (AFP) -- The entry by approximately 150 Cubans into three embassies in Havana is a "provocation by enemies" of Cuba who could "have some sort of organization in the country." This was said to EL PAIS, a Spanish daily, by Carlos Lage, executive secretary of the Council of Ministers and a close aide of Fidel Castro. Lage, a 42-year-old pediatrician, recalls that Cuba grants exit permits to whoever wants to travel and notes that "no one involved in this type of incident can leave the country." The only solution is for the refugees in the embassies "to leave with our guarantees that there will be no reprisals against them," he added. Lage, who is also one of the persons responsible for Cuban economic reforms, defended the "socialist model" and the "fundamental" role of a planned economy, but did not reject "openings to the private initiative" or "private work" in certain sectors. He noted Cuba's encouragement of tourism and foreign investments (an example of which is the sale of 49 percent of the shares of the telephone company to a Mexican enterprise) and its transformation of state farms into cooperatives. Regarding an eventual political change, Lage was blunt: "Cuba's problems are of an economic nature, and the solutions we need are of an economic nature." "It is possible" to improve the political system, "but not through elections aimed at producing a multiparty system," he said. Regarding speculation that some day he could succeed Fidel Castro, he said: "I do not believe I am the right person." "Besides," he explained, "here there is someone who is second in command in the country's leadership; that is Raul Castro. Castro's replacement is thus already known."
