FR941216-1-00021 FR941216-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF STATE Bureau of Consular Affairs 22 CFR Part 92 [Public Notice 2138] Notarial and Related Services AGENCY: Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Consular Affairs plans to amend its notarial regulations to authorize certain U.S. citizen employees of the Department of State who are not diplomatic or consular officers, but who have been designated by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Overseas Citizen Services, to perform notarial services overseas. All consular officers, other foreign service officers and designated U.S. citizen employees authorized to perform such notarials shall be identified, for notarial purposes, as ``notarizing officers.'' The extension of this authority to designated U.S. citizen State Department employees will enable foreign service posts to provide enhanced notarial service to the public. Consular officers assisted by designated U.S. citizen employees will be able to concentrate on managing consular resources, although they will still be available, as needed, to provide notarial services to U.S. citizens. Notarization by a designated U.S. citizens State Department employee will generally have the same effect as notarization by a consular officer. This proposed rule does not, however, permit designated U.S. citizen State Department employees to perform authentications, perform a notarial service for a patent application or take a deposition pursuant to a commission, as prescribed under 18 U.S.C. 3492, nor does it in itself ensure that notarials performed by the designated employees will be acceptable to every state. With these qualifications, the State Department believes that notarials performed by designated U.S. citizen employees will be acceptable for all purposes (particularly for federal law purposes). DATES: Comments due: January 17,1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carmen A. DiPlacido, or Michael Meszaros, Office of Citizens Consular Services, Department of State, 202&hyph;647&hyph;3666 or 202&hyph;647&hyph;4994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule implements section 127(b) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994&hyph;1995, P. Law 103&hyph;236, April 30, 1994. Section 127(b) authorizes the Secretary of State to designate State Department employees who are U.S. citizens to perform in foreign countries notarial services authorized to be performed by consular officers. Under section 24 of the Act of August 18, 1856, 11 Stat. 61, now generally cited as 22 U.S.C. 4221, consular officers are authorized to administer to or take from any person an oath, affirmation, affidavit, or deposition, and to perform any other notarial act which any notary public is required or authorized by law to do within the United States. Section 7 of the Act of April 5, 1906, 34 Stat. 101, now generally referred to as 22 U.S.C. 4215, made the performance of notarial services by consular officers mandatory, and mandated that a fee be charged for notarial services. The Department's new authority under Section 127(b) will allow it to supplement the staff available to perform notarial services at posts abroad with designated U.S. citizen State Department employees who are not consular officers, thereby providing prompt, efficient service to the public and freeing consular officers to also focus more of their efforts on other demands on our overseas posts. Consular and other diplomatic officers will still perform notarial functions as needed. Section 127(b) authorizes the Secretary of State to promulgate regulations providing for the designation of U.S. citizen employees of the Department of State to perform notarial functions as provided therein. The Secretary's authority was delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs on September 20, 1994. These proposed regulations will further delegate to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Overseas Citizens Services the authority to designate the United States citizen State Department employees who may perform these notarial functions.
