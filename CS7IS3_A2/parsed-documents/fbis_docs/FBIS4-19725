NATO "should help" the UN to give stronger protection to the UN-designated safe areas, Mr. Major said at question time. He insisted that, while keeping the objective of a negotiated settlement in view, attacks on UN troops or the safe areas "will meet with a strong response." The prime minister was replying to Tory John Ward (Poole), who pressed him to "condemn unreservedly" continuing Serb attacks on Gorazde and called for "more effective action by NATO and the UN" to protect the safe areas. Mr. Major replied that Mr. Ward spoke for most people in the UK. He added: "These attacks have rightly been condemned by European, Russian and American leaders alike. NATO should help the UN to give stronger protection to the safe areas and I hope that the additional troops committed to the UN Protection Force and the necessary funds will be made available as soon as possible." Mr. Major continued: "The UK is pressing for a rapid and united NATO response to the secretary general's request for further assistance that must, of course, be based on a thorough military appraisal." The Government would also be studying proposals made by President Clinton last night, said the prime minister. "But we must keep the objectives of a negotiated settlement clearly in view while showing that attacks on UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] or safe areas will meet with a strong response."
