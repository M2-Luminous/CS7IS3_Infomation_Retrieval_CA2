Present at the news conference were reporters of the Russian papers PATRIOT and (WETCHERAN,) and the Russian radio broadcasting network. The ambassador spoke at the conference. The ambassador pointed out that thanks to our side's sincere effort, the North-South working-level contact for the exchange of top-level special envoys, which was suspended in October last year, was resumed and that our side proposed last year the exchange of North-South top-level special envoys and made every possible effort to realize the exchange at an early date. He said: During the current contact, our side put forward four-point proposals that the large-scale nuclear war exercises be suspended; the so-called the international cooperative system, which is intended to harm fellow countrymen on a pretext of so-called the nuclear issue, be discarded; the introduction of Patriot missiles into South Korean be suspended; and the remarks by the person in authority in South Korea that he cannot shake hands with a dialogue partner should be canceled. This proceeded from a sincere position to create an atmosphere of trust between the North and the South and to smoothly resolve the issue of exchanging the special envoys. Nevertheless, the South side, from the outset, evaded expression of its attitude toward the principled demands put forward by our side. The South side repeated its previous claims that our just demands are issues and preconditions not related to talks in an attempt to justify its erroneous position on dialogue, thus laying a barrier to the working-level contact. This illustrates that the South side has no intention to exchange top-level special envoys with us. The South Korean authorities even made presumptuous remarks that although the working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys began, they cannot take an optimistic view on North-South relations, the United States will not hold a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks before special envoys are exchanged, and so forth. By doing this, they revealed their vicious intention to put the brake on DPRK-U.S. talks, to block a solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, and to harm fellow countrymen together with outside forces while continually pursuing North-South confrontation. The four-point simultaneous action steps for a package solution of the nuclear problem, which was agreed upon during DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, have not assumed any precondition. However, the South Korean authorities made unjust assertions that the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise and holding of a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks assume the exchange of North-South special envoys and inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] as preconditions. The purpose of their unjust demand is to rupture [patan] the DPRK-U.S. talks by taking part in discussion of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. As has been known to the entire world, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is the question that should be resolved between us and the United States. The South Korean authorities have neither authority nor qualification to participate in this. They have nothing to do with the issue. The third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, when they are held, will be an important occasion for a solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, and the pending issues between the North and the South will be resolved easily. Therefore, the most important issue is to sincerely fulfill the agreement made in DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, and to realize DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date. If the South Korean authorities are interested in resolving the pending issues between the North and the South in a manner of dialogue and negotiation by realizing the exchange of special envoys, they should discard the attitude of confrontation denying dialogue, instead of laying barrier to dialogue by raising unjust conditions, and should come to contact for the exchange of North- South special envoys with sincere attitude without any precondition. Success in dialogue totally depends on the position and attitude of the South side. Following this, the ambassador answered reporters' questions.
