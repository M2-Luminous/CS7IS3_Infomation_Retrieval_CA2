Soldiers and gendarmes were patrolling the city center and virtually no gunshots are heard any more. According to a source close to the Army, the clashes with automatic weapons, grenades, and, apparently, rocket launchers may have left "several dead." The same source asserts that the attackers whose number was not specified were on the run and that some of them had headed toward the Ghanaian border which is contiguous with the [Togolese] capital.
