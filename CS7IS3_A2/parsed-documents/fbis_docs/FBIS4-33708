Ricupero is very aware of President Itamar Franco's concern about this issue. Franco has questioned high interest rates and wants to stave off a possible conflict with Planalto Palace over the establishment of interest rates in real terms (above the inflation rate). The launching of the real is only some 20 days away and the finance minister and his team are still trying to explain to President Franco that the success of the Real Plan will be in jeopardy unless the government implements a tight monetary policy (restraint on money supply). A member of the economic team conceded that "the question of interest rates has long been on the mind of the president and the finance minister." According to government advisers, the president has on several occasions voiced concern about this issue to Minister Ricupero. A member of the economic team noted: "It did not reach the point where the president requested the team's resignation." Experts believe Franco's concern is normal and insist that "Ricupero does not champion high interest rates either." They recall, however, that this is a delicate question, since it led to the resignation of former Central Bank President Paulo Cesar Ximenes, a staunch advocate of high interest rates. The members of the economic team believe, from a technical standpoint, it is not advisable to implement low interest rates during the first months of the Real Plan. They are seeking alternatives also to counter a possible signal that the government is betting on an economic downturn in the country until the end of the year. Ricupero has been pressured from all sides to desist from implementing a sharp increase in interest rates as of 1 July. During his weekly meeting with businessmen, they asked the government not to establish high interest rates because it would only contribute to a renewed recession. Ricupero's response has been the same for weeks: "The plan will not foster a recession." Ricupero has discussed with Franco and entrepreneurs a concern raised by economists. According to the minister, high interest rates are necessary to prevent speculation on the financial market rather than to check consumption. "Those in favor of high interest rates are afraid of a movement of financial assets," he stated. His aides believe $6 billion, which has been invested in the financial market, may easily be funneled into other investments such as gold, the dollar, and real estate, thus jeopardizing the success of the economic plan.
