According to him, following the approval in Brussels of the Partnership for Peace NATO program, the rapprochement of Lithuania with this organization would depend on the opening possibilities: political stability, the economic potential of Lithuania, the ability to organize and improve military structures according to European standards, and the ability to cooperate both with NATO and other Baltic states. Justas Paleckis thinks that a strong incentive to start implementing the Partnership for Peace NATO program will be the visit to Brussels by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, due to take place on 27 January. According to the president's adviser, the main objective of the visit to Brussels will be to convince NATO leadership that Lithuania's commitment to rapprochement with NATO is not directed against Russia or other neighboring states.
