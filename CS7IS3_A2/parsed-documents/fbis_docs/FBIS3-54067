[passage omitted] Commenting on the peace process in the Middle East, the Jeddah- based AL-MADINAH said despite the Israeli maneuvers, a comprehensive settlement will be realized in the Middle East in view of the fact that it is being supported by the international public opinion. "Moreover, the comprehensive settlement is supported by America and the Arab countries and at the same time it has become an essential matter after the end of the era of the Cold War," the paper added. The Jeddah-based 'UKAZ deplored the intransigent policy of Israel and said the Israeli policy would block the march of peace. The daily criticized the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to hold referendum in Israel on the idea of restoring Golan Heights to Syria and said the proposal runs counter to the Resolutions 242 and 338 issued by the Security Council. The idea of referendum constitutes a violation of the international law because it would be illogical to inquire from people of a country about the future of another country, the daily added. The Dammam-based AL-YA'UM deplored a statement of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in which he said Israel would not withdraw from Golan Heights before a visit of Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to Israel and said such a statement was part of a series of the maneuvers practiced by Tel Aviv. The paper called for a firm stand against the Israeli maneuvers and procrastination which aim at blocking the peace process. "It is high time for the U.S. to shorten the period of talks and take the appropriate measures for the implementation of the international resolutions," the paper said.
