After an opening ceremony, ruling and opposition lawmakers passed a revision of the National Assembly Law through a plenary session. On Tuesday, the Assembly is scheduled to select the new parliamentary speaker, the two vice speakers and chairmen of standing committees. Rep. Hwang Nak-chu nominated by the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) is the sole candidate for the successor to outgoing Speaker Yi Man-sop. Rep. Yi failed to be renominated by the DLP because he has allegedly been feuding with party leaders. The feud is said to have been triggered when Yi refused to cooperate in the DLP's plan to railroad the controversial budget bill for fiscal 1994 through the Assembly in December last year. Hwang, a five-term lawmaker, is a close associate of President Kim Yong-sam and draws support from the mainstream in the DLP, most of whom are Kim loyalists. The nomination of Hwang is expected to gain swift approval from the Assembly members given that the DLP controls the 299-member unicameral legislature. DLP lawmaker Yi Chun-ku and opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Hong Yong-ki will most likely become vice Assembly speakers. The Assembly will also deal with the appointment of new justices of the Supreme Court during a plenary session July 9. But there is a possibility that opposition lawmakers may take issue over the past careers of some appointees who have been accused because their "politicized" rules under previous military-backed government. The first summit meeting being pushed by the two Koreas is expected to be capped in the interpellation session during July 4 to 8. The government's policy on the North Korean nuclear standoff is also expected to become an issue of contention between lawmakers of the ruling and opposition parties. In addition, the Assembly will handle the government-proposed supplementary budget scaled at 384 billion won (about $476 million). The bill is designed to help ease the economic plight of farmers and fishermen in the wake of the partial opening of domestic agro-fisheries markets to foreign supplies. But political observers predict that the Assembly session is unlikely to draw much attention because of the focus of public interest on the World Cup and the first inter-Korean summit. Furthermore, major parties' preparations for two upcoming by-elections for the Assembly slated for around the end of next month are expected to reduce their concentration on parliamentary activities.
