FR940224-2-00160 FR940224-2-00095 Background/Objectives of This Program The end of colonialism and the consequent dramatic rise in the number of sovereign states in the developing world have produced an equally dramatic rise in the scope and diversity of available news media, both print and broadcast. However, much of the reporting disseminated through these media is flawed by the absence of journalistic skills, appropriate educational background, and appreciation for professional standards among those employed as journalists. In addition, media throughout the Near East, North Africa, and South Asia are often utilized to mold public opinion, rather than to provide objective information, and to rally support for the policies of parties holding or seeking power, rather than to present an independent, credible account or a responsible analysis of social and political phenomena. The primary objective of this program is to further the development of journalism education as an independent academic discipline in North Africa, the Near East, and South Asia, and thereby to strengthen substantive, responsible, and objective media reporting, reflecting international recognized standards of journalistic professionalism. Project proposals should focus on the cultivation of a cadre of journalism educators_both professors and deans of schools of journalism_from the Near East and North Africa, or from South Asia, who are persuaded of the need for curricular reform and development in order to train well educated, responsible journalists and who are able and willing to translate their convictions into efforts to bring about such reform and development. Participants Journalism educators from the Middle East and North Africa who will participate in the U.S. phase of this program will be provided the service of bilingual escort-interpreters in Arabic, with one interpreter for each five/six participants and one language-fluent escort for the group (to be facilitated by USIA through the U.S. Department of State). For American consultants participating in the second component of the Near East/North African exchange, fluency in Arabic or French, depending on the countries visited and the language preference of the anticipated audiences, would be desirable. In the absence of language fluency, arrangements should be made by the grantee organization, in consultation with USIS posts, for interpretation. Participating educators in the South Asian exchange must possess strong English language skills. American consultants traveling to South Asia during the second component of the program may require the service of interpreters, depending upon the language facility of the South Asian educators with whom they will work in the region. Again, the grantee organization should coordinate arrangements for in-country interpreters with the appropriate USIS posts. Participants will be nominated through coordination among USIA, U.S. Information Service personal in the region, and overseas partner institutions. USIA and the participating USIS posts retain the right to nominate all participants and to accept or reject participants recommended by grantee institutions. The U.S. consultants who will travel abroad will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA. USIS officers in participating countries will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related material. Programmatic Considerations Thematically, each program should: _Analyze the current status of professional journalism and journalism education in the participants' countries of origin and determine, in conjunction with USIS posts in these countries and with the journalism educators selected as participants, the needs to be addressed by the exchange;
