While making a speech at the National Assembly on 13 May, Lien Chan said: "Taiwan is gradually developing practical relations with the ROK, but this does not mean that it will discard the possibility of development of diplomatic relations with North Korea." He added: "There is no reason for Taiwan to avoid the establishment of official channels for dialogue with North Korea." Currently, Taiwan has established diplomatic relations with 29 countries. If it improves relations with North Korea, it would be a breakthrough in settling the North Korean economic crisis. It seems that it will also bring about a setback in restoring economic relations between ROK and Taiwan. Taiwan severed diplomatic relations with the ROK in August 1992 when the ROK established diplomatic relations with China. In November 1993, the ROK and Taiwan established missions in each other's countries. Nevertheless, Taiwan is continuing to maintain tense practices with the ROK, such as continuing import restrictions on ROK products, including automobiles. Right after severing diplomatic relations with the ROK, Taiwan sought to improve relations with North Korea as part of a retaliation against the ROK, but has retained its `North Korean card' because it had decided at that time that it does not have great practical benefits.
