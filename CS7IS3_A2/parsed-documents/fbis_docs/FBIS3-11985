FBIS3-11985 "drlat060_l_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-060 Document Type:Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 Bolivia _o_ BOLIVIA ECONOMIC BRIEFS 94P20570A 94P20570A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report]ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT ENCOURAGED IN COCA-GROWING AREA--On 3 February Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS reports that, during a seminar entitled "Investment Opportunities in the Chapare," the Cochabamba Regional Development Project (CORDEP), the Regional Alternative Development Program (PDAR), and local businessmen agreed that the area, which boasts good transportation and power infrastructure and fledgling hotel, dairy, and alternative crop industries, has potential for agro-industrial development. According to the PDAR, the region's bananas, pineapples, peppers, palmito, and passion fruit already have a secure national market, international demand, and 48 percent "profitability." Nevertheless, businessmen stressed that "serious" investment is needed to develop these industries in order to move away from a coca economy. LOS TIEMPOS of 2 March reports that, this year, the PDAR will invest its $17 million budget in various projects in the Chapare as part of the coca reduction strategy. Of this figure, $8 million will go toward improving 200 km of roads; agricultural production will receive $6 million; and social projects, $3 million. This is a departure from previous years when most of the PDAR's budget was destined for the populations of the high valleys to stem their migration into the Chapare coca-producing region. According to Santa Cruz daily EL MUNDO of 9 February, Mario Soliz, national secretary for social defense, assured peasants that, for each hectare of surplus coca they "reduced," they would receive $2,000 from the Directorate of Agricultural Reconversion (DIRECO) and an additional "compensatory bonus" of $500. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION FOR 1993--La Paz daily PRESENCIA of 27 February reports that, according to the 1993 national Agricultural Survey by the National Statistical Institute, the volume of agricultural production (6,353,632 metric tons) rose 2.3 percent from 1992. Overall cereal (corn, wheat, barley, and sorghum) production rose by 16 percent, the most significant increase being that of sorghum, which increased 157.4 percent from 45,600 metric tons in 1992 to 117,400 metric tons in 1993. Among commercial crops, soybeans enjoyed an "unprecedented increase" of 47.6 percent while cotton production decreased by 20.4 percent. Santa Cruz Department was the country's main agricultural producer, followed by La Paz and Cochabamba. According to Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS of 19 February, Edgar Talavera, the national secretary for agriculture and livestock, said that the soybean five-year plan is in effect in Santa Cruz, which aims at cultivating 1 million hectares for export and surpassing in importance the "mining and hydrocarbon industries." Santa Cruz daily EL MUNDO of 9 February reports that a Colombian investor has just launched Bolivia's largest soybean processing plant in Puerto Suarez, Santa Cruz Department. The plant will have the capacity to process 350,000 tons of soybeans annually, enough to produce 65,000 tons of oil and 270,000 tons of soybean flour. The National Secretariat for Agriculture and Livestock estimates that $287 million will be invested in the sector for 1994-1997. Eighty percent will be financed by pledges made at the Consultative Group meeting for Bolivia held in December 1993, and 20 percent of the funds will come from the national budget for public investments. This plan, according to PRESENCIA 4 February, is part of a larger 1994-2003 "Sectorial Strategy" to make agriculture and livestock raising the driving force of economic development. LOS TIEMPOS also reports that, according to the secretariat, agricultural prospects for 1994 are "very encouraging in general"; the country will be able to meet its food needs. ORURO DEVELOPMENT PLANS--On 10 February, the Japanese ambassador to Bolivia donated equipment and machinery worth $7.2 million for road maintenance and improvement in Oruro Department. Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS of 11 February reports that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said that with this important donation, one of the country's principal "export corridors," the Oruro-Pisiga route, will be completed. Furthermore, the Capitalization Plan is widely expected to convert this depressed mining region into the country's new railway center and a "pillar" of mineral smelting. According to the 12 February issue of La Paz daily PRESENCIA DEL PAlS, the president added that Oruro, as a transport center for exports and a hub of regional integration, "may become the country's most important region." In 1994 Oruro Department will also receive $63 million from the government to be invested mainly in social projects. NEW THERMOELECTRIC PLANT--The Mataral thermoelectric plant was inaugurated on 26 February. Situated 200 km from Santa Cruz de Ia Sierra, it is estimated that this plant will provide 24-hour electrical service to 25,000 inhabitants across three provinces of Santa Cruz Department. The plant was financed with $5.5 million disbursed mainly by the Santa Cruz Regional Development Corporation (CORDECRUZ) and USAID. [Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 27 Feb]
