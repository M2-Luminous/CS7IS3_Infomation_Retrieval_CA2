The Election Will Cost the Taxpayers Three Billion Rubles"] [Text] The last stage of the election campaign has begun in the Republic of Komi. Several days ago the Central Electoral Commission registered four candidates for the post of head of government who have received the number of votes necessary for registration. Aleksandr Gladkov, general director of the Inta-Ugol Concern; Yuriy Spiridonov, chairman of the Republic of Komi Supreme Soviet; Vyacheslav Khudyayev, chairman of the Republic of Komi Council of Ministers; and Valeriy Markov, chairman of the State Committee for Revival of the Komi People, who came out in favor of the rights of the Komi people codified in the law, became the contenders. All the candidates have yet to release the final versions of their election platforms. Recently Chairman of the Council of Ministers Vyacheslav Khudyayev has been voicing in interviews and public presentations the opinion that now is not the time for the election; the situation in the economy is too difficult. The 3 billion needed to elect the head of the republic and the deputies of local soviets will have to be taken away from teachers, physicians, and other employees of the sector financed from the budget. These statements are being received in various ways. Khudyayev's supporters view them as showing concern for the people, and his opponents--as indicating a desire to frustrate the elections. Incidentally, according to a public opinion poll, Khudyayev's rating is the lowest, with the current head of parliament, Yuriy Spiridonov, ranking first. Vigorous actions taken by Spiridonov to defend the interests of the republic while serving as head of parliament are contributing to his success. Thus, at a press conference concerning the results of a regular meeting of the Federation Council, Yuriy Spiridonov, chairman of the Republic of Komi parliament, stated that the law on guarantees and compensation for northern territories was not taken into account in development of the 1994 federal budget of the Russian Federation; the budgets of krays and republics are expected to assume a proportion of federal spending. In this case the entire burden of expenditures will devolve on enterprises. In the opinion of Yuriy Spiridonov, only radical changes in tax policy can improve the existing situation and make the output of northern enterprises competitive. Referring to the results of joint hearings on the north in the Federation Council with the State Duma, Spiridonov stated that an agreement among deputies from the northern regions exists under which the deputies intend to block passage of the budget if the draft of the document does not envision complying with the law on the north. The decision of a session of the Republic of Komi parliament on reducing tax transfers to the federal budget from 13 to 8 percent will take effect on 15 April.
