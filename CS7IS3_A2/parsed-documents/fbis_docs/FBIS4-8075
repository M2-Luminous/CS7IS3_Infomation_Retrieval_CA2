We are examining the problem very seriously, and I hope the necessary steps will be taken. This is all I can tell you, Redman said following the meeting. Asked by reporters whether the ferocity of the fighting has subsided following the threat of air strikes unless an end is put to the offensive, Redman says: This was in the morning [as heard].
