What Will It Bring to Ukraine?"] [Excerpt] [Myasnikova] What has been achieved since bilateral relations were established two years ago? [Plyushko] China was one of the first countries to recognize Ukrainian independence, so we are now celebrating this modest anniversary. Although two years is a but a brief moment from the historical viewpoint, this has been a time of strenuous work in terms of bilateral relations. A great many things have been accomplished. During nine months of 1993, since the time I presented my credentials, 10 official Ukrainian delegations have visited China. Of course, bilateral relations are not defined by the number of delegations, but this still indicates their intensity. Every visit dealt with specific issues. About 20 documents have been signed during those two years, which have established a legal treaty basis for our bilateral relations in various fields. [Myasnikova] Anatoliy Dmytrovych, how would you describe relations between Ukraine, which is moving toward nonnuclear status, and China, a nuclear state? [Plyushko] I have held numerous meetings and conversations with representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other leading Chinese officials, during which we discussed China's attitude toward the Ukrainian Supreme Council's ratification of the START I treaty and the Lisbon Protocol. I will briefly outline China's stance on these issues. As early as 1964, when China started to acquire nuclear weapons, it pledged that it would use them neither first nor against any nonnuclear state or region. When we requested that the Chinese side grant us security guarantees if Ukraine assumed nonnuclear status, the PRC Government reaffirmed its position. At the same time, the Chinese side expressed understanding for Ukraine's standpoint on nuclear disarmament, for which we are very grateful. We would welcome China's participation, along with other nuclear states, in a multilateral treaty granting national security guarantees for Ukraine. [Myasnikova] Nevertheless, China continues to test nuclear weapons... [Plyushko] China points out that other nuclear states have conducted more nuclear tests, which are essential for improving nuclear weapons and maintaining them at a proper level. Fundamentally, China wants such weapons to be completely prohibited, which will eliminate the problem of nuclear tests. This has been stated by Chinese officials. [Myasnikova] What is Ukraine's attitude toward Taiwan? [Plyushko] For China, this is a very delicate issue when it comes to relations with any country. The position of the PRC is clear, adamant, and consistent: There is only one China, and Taiwan is an integral part of it. While building relations with other countries, China consistently tries to get its partners to recognize this standpoint. Ukraine also recognizes it. We pledged not to establish any form of official relations with Taiwan. [Myasnikova] What about unofficial relations? [Plyushko] Such relations are possible in the sphere of economic cooperation. It is no secret that Taiwan has a robust economic and financial potential, as well as huge foreign currency reserves. Many countries are therefore interested in developing trade with it. The Chinese Government understands this and allows certain forms of cooperation, however only on a nongovernmental level -- at the level of companies and businesses. [Myasnikova] Ukraine's independence has led to profound economic problems. Even though our government needs other countries' help, it has been refusing Chinese aid for more than a year. Why is the Joint Intergovernment Commission for Trade and Economic Cooperation not operating? [Plyushko] It is always hard to establish a new state even under the most ideal conditions, both foreign and domestic. Our situation is even further complicated by inconsistency in implementing the economic reform program. A certain role was played by the breaking off of old economic ties, which undermined our economy. There are also objective reasons -- the lack of know-how in trading with other countries and offering the world what we have. Today, at the current stage, we cannot manage without foreign help. We need equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries. We have many products we could offer to the world, and even developed countries are interested in those products, not to mention developing ones. In this regard, the prospects for our economic cooperation with China are very, very great. Positive changes have already taken place over the last year. Whereas trade between Ukraine and China totaled $220 million in 1992, this figure doubled in 1993. Although I do not have the final figure for trade between our countries in 1993, according to specialists, it should have reached $500 million. This is encouraging, but taking into account the capabilities of our countries, this is not a great deal. During President Kravchuk's visit to China in October and November 1992, a number of documents were signed, including some on trade and economic relations, in particular an agreement establishing the Joint Intergovernment Commission for Trade and Economic Cooperation. This commission should become a coordinating and controlling body that will elevate our trade and economic relations to a new level. The commission was difficult to establish, given that this was a time of constant changes in the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry of External Economic Relations. Finally, the members of the Ukrainian section of the commission, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, were approved. Then a problem appeared on the Chinese side, which had a different attitude toward the establishment of the commission, considering it to be a working body that should be headed by people not below the level of minister of external economic relations. Negotiations on this issue are currently continuing, and there is hope that the first meeting of the commission will be held in January or February. [Myasnikova] What will change when it begins to operate? [Plyushko] The commission is to concentrate on trade and economic activities. Thus far, we do not have a mechanism for resolving such issues at the state level. Cooperation with China may become very beneficial for Ukraine. This basically concerns the PRC's experience in conducting economic reforms, which were introduced in 1978 and shook the whole world. China's GDP grows on average at a stable rate of 8-9 percent per year. In 1992 it increased 12.8 percent, and in 1993 -- 13 percent, according to preliminary assessments. China's latest economic successes cannot but draw the attention of the international community, and we can see today that Western countries are modifying their trade and economic policies, relations, and priorities. For its part, Ukraine possesses a sound industrial potential. We have certain world-standard technologies that China and other countries need. Few countries have experience in such fields as overall oil and gas pipeline planning, superhard materials, monocrystals, or welding equipment. However, we do not know much about the Chinese market, and we have conducted virtually no research whatsoever on Chinese needs or import requirements. One of the tasks of our embassy is to fill this gap. Moreover, we should help businessmen find beneficial partners. For the time being, it is hard to do this. Our numbers are limited (seven diplomats including the ambassador), and the important area of trade and economic relations is handled by only two officials who are physically unable to cope with the volume of work. By comparison, I can say that the trade mission attached to the Russian Embassy in Beijing employs about 100 professionals who help Russian enterprises establish cooperation with China. [Myasnikova] Will Ukraine establish a trade mission? [Plyushko] So far, it has been decided to open Ukrainian trade missions only in certain countries, first of all, in Europe. However, such a decision should also be adopted regarding China. We already have a trade surplus in relations with this country: In 1992, exports amounted to 60.5 percent, and imports to 39.5 percent. [Myasnikova] What is the situation with the 50-million-yuan interest-free commodity credit that has not been used by Ukraine for a year? [Plyushko] Indeed, it has been a year since President Kravchuk signed the agreement for China to grant credit to Ukraine. Of course, it is bewildering why we do not take what they are offering. However, there are certain problems. China offers us goods in which we are not particularly interested. The point is to choose goods that Ukraine really needs. The conditions are tough. This does not mean that they give us 50 million yuans and we can buy everything we want from other countries. The conditions are that the commodities must be bought in China. Realizing this obstacle, the Chinese side proposed slightly changing the form of the credit. During the September 1993 visit to Kiev by Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the Chinese side proposed allocating this sum for the construction or reconstruction of one or several Ukrainian enterprises, evaluating the equipment requirements, and purchasing it in China with the loan. This option is currently being evaluated. [passage omitted]
