Let us go over to a telephone report by Skender Durmishi: [Durmishi] At today's news conference, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, chairman of the republic of Kosova, asked the UN Security Council to examine the question of repression in Kosova and to demand, through a resolution, an international protectorate there. Such a system of international protection, Rugova said, would be a reward for the peaceful resistance of the Albanians and would at the same time interrupt the intolerable police repression in localities and villages of Kosova. Rugova also informed reporters that this week, repression and other police actions, assuming the dimensions of a campaign, have occurred in 23 communes and in hundreds of Kosovar villages. As usual, this repression has been accompanied by fierce brutality through arrests, destruction, violent press-ganging, etc. At the same time, the persecution of political activists and local government officials has continued. Military movements have been observed in the region of Gjakove, Prizren, Peje, and in Han i Elezit. Presenting details and other data on the repression, the president of Kosova said that in addition to the already known motives, the aim of this repression is to instigate a backlash against the violence and provocations among the Albanian population, to which the Albanians have not succumbed. Despite the repression, Dr. Rugova pointed out that this week Kosova is at the center of the international community's attention. He greeted all the statements and other reactions, demanding prevention of a conflict in Kosova. Supporting the NATO attack on Serbian weapons in Bosnia, Dr. Rugova asked for the destruction of the arms, being the main cause of wars and tragedies in the region. He again reminded reporters that the arms were obtained through the sweat of all the peoples of Yugoslavia. Based on an approach with mystical elements, as he called it, Rugova stressed that we do not exclude the possibility that one day the arms will be turned onto the Serbs themselves. In the context of these political observations, Mr. Rugova expressed the hope that Russia will manifest the proper flexibility on the crisis in former Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, he asked Greece for a more mature stance in conformity with the rules of good-neighborliness. At the end of the conference, Rugova suggested as a preferred form for a global and efficient solution the total pacification of all the regions in former Yugoslavia because of the serious threats for further expansion of the crisis and war in these areas. Condemning the demands of Serbian officials to close the Soros Foundation and several world news agencies, Mr. Rugova considered them as attempts to turn these areas into ghettos with elements of an absurd confrontation with the world. He thanked the commitment of the Soros Foundation and offered further cooperation with this foundation as far as the possibilities and the institutions of our system permitted. President Rugova also repeated the demand that, as member of the former Yugoslav Federation, Kosova should be granted the right to secession, with all the rights and obligations deriving from it. He also spoke of more intensive contacts with the UN High Commission for Refugees to prevent Serbian attempts to colonize Kosova.
