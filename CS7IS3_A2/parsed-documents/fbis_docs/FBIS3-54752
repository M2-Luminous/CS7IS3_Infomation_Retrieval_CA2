The LDP which won over 20 percent of the vote in this month's elections, more than any other party, will hold 60 seats in the new Russian parliament. The LDP proposes that the trial over members of the 1991 coup attempt be ceased and criminal charges lifted against anyone taking part in this October's events including the siege and defence of the White House and other facilities. It also wants leaders of the parliamentary revolt, now at Moscow's Lefortovo prison, to be placed under house arrest with some of them barred from any political activity for a period of three years. The measure must be seen as a step on the way to public unity, the LDP statement says.
