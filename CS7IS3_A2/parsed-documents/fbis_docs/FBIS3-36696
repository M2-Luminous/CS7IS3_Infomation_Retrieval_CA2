Historic Document May Be Signed 15 February"] [Text] Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev, who heads the Tatar delegation to talks with Russia, has told your SEGODNYA correspondent that the work on the draft Treaty on the Mutual Delegation of Powers and Terms of Reference between the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation has been virtually completed. Last weekend the document was presented to Presidents Yeltsin and Shaymiyev. Likhachev would not specify what formula for relations between the republic and the federal center was found after nearly three years of negotiations, saying only that it differed from Article 61 of the Tatarstan Constitution, which stipulates that "the Republic of Tatarstan is a sovereign state, a subject of international law, associated with the Russian Federation-Russia on the basis of a treaty..." It has transpired, however, that the Russian side agreed to accept sovereignty and the republic's status as a subject of international law, a fact from which local observers conclude that only the term "associated" has been changed in the aforementioned constitutional formula. The Tatarstan vice president said also that human rights and freedoms come first in the treaty and that the largest section deals with the joint powers of the Russian and Tatar authorities. In Likhachev's view, this is an argument in the dispute about how the treaty should be assessed: As a document formalizing Russia's breakup or as a legal framework for Russia's establishing itself as a federation. Likhachev said also that "the talks between Tatarstan and Russia have ushered in a completely new type of diplomacy" and that the "draft treaty under consideration is unprecedented both in Russian history and on a world scale." During the Tatar delegation's stay in Moscow another four agreements were drawn up that are set to be signed simultaneously with the treaty: on combatting crime, on finances, on budget relations, and on foreign economic activity. Hence 11 out of the planned 12 agreements (seven were signed earlier, and one -- on military organization -- has not yet been prepared) will go into force in the near future. This week, a Tatar delegation is scheduled to arrive in Moscow again to initial the treaty, a ceremony which was put off 4 February owing to Boris Yeltsin's illness. The ceremony of signing the document is still tentatively scheduled for 15 February. It is yet unclear at what stage the treaty should pass through the Federation Council: The upper chamber has made clear that is wants to take part in the historic event.
