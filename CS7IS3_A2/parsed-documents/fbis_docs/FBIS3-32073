The EZLN communique states that a direct dialogue is "imminent." The message is "an important step toward meeting and advancing the process for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State," Camacho Solis said in a communique released to the media in San Cristobal, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City. [passage omitted] Camacho Solis, in his second communique issued on 1 February, termed as an additional advancement the fact that the group is willing to broaden media coverage of the possible direct dialogue. The armed group also agreed today to Camacho Solis' proposal for national and foreign journalists to cover the eventual negotiations, but the group excluded the private Mexican television networks Televisa and Television Azteca. Camacho Solis responded: "My stance is not to exclude anyone and to make accreditation and access to the talks subject only to the appropriate security measures." The commissioner deemed "appropriate the EZLN's suggestion for the registration of the media and the procedures for coverage to be carried out through the group's mediator, Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia." Camacho Solis, in his first communique today read this morning in San Cristobal de Las Casas, proposed to the armed group the creation of two "buffer zones" without an armed presence to ease the situation and help the civilian population. Camacho Solis also announced that the Mexican Army has withdrawn from the towns in the conflict area.
