International opinion interested in peace calls for the denuclearization of Northeast Asia, regarding it as an important issue for peace and security in Asia and the world at present. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To abolish nuclear weapons and prevent nuclear war, nonnuclear, peace zones should be established in various parts of the world and should be continuously expanded. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia is an urgent demand for the situation prevailing in this region which includes the Korean peninsula. Northeast Asia is an area where the danger of nuclear war is greater than any other in the world. Today with the end of nuclear confrontation between superpowers, nuclear disarmament is an international trend. In contrast, however, in Northeast Asia, factors increasing the danger of nuclear war remain and constantly threaten the peace and security of this region and Asia as a whole. Above all else, numerous nuclear bases and nuclear means are concentrated in the Northeast Asian region. Nuclear weapons and nuclear bases that exist in the Northeast Asian region are the remnants of the Cold War era. Under the pretext of deterring someone's attack and of preparing for nuclear retaliation, the United States built numerous nuclear bases in Northeast Asia, such as in South Korea and Japan in the Cold War era, and deployed enormous quantities of nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles in forward positions. Under the U.S. nuclear umbrella protection strategy, South Korea has turned into the largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the Far East, and Japan has become an unsinkable U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier. Today, with the Cold War over and with nuclear disarmament a prevalent trend, there is no reason why nuclear weapons and nuclear bases should remain any longer in Northeast Asia. Although the United States declared a few years ago that there were no nuclear weapons in South Korea, no convincing practical steps have been taken for this [kugosul naptuk sikilmanhan silchejok chochiduri chwihaejiji anko issumnida]. Numerous nuclear war means are deployed on U.S. military bases in Japan, such as those in Misawa and Okinawa. These bases are basic factors increasing military confrontation and the danger of nuclear war in this region. The danger of nuclear war in Northeast Asia is increasing all the more because nuclear war commotions continue in this region. It is a well-known fact that the United States has frequently conducted nuclear war exercises, mobilizing its nuclear weapons in the Asia-Pacific region and its mainland as well as into the Northeast Asian region. The Team Spirit test nuclear war is a typical example of it. The United States is going against its own promise in attempting to enforce large-scale nuclear war exercises, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise, referring to the possibility of someone's nuclear development and war provocation. As long as nuclear armed forces exist in Northeast Asia and as long as nuclear fire games continue there, the danger of nuclear war cannot be removed, nor can the people of Asia free themselves from the constant nuclear threat. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia becomes an even more serious and urgent problem particularly because a new hotbed of nuclear war is rapidly growing in this region. This new nuclear war force growing in Northeast Asia today is Japan. The possibility of Japan's nuclear armament has now surfaced as an international concern, with increasing worries about it. This is far from surprising. In fact, Japan's nuclear armament has reached a dangerous point. It is a well-known fact that the Japanese reactionaries are dashing toward becoming a military and nuclear power, raving that Japan lost the war in the past because it was not strong enough. Japan will soon be operating [monju], its first fast breeder reactor in its nuclear power plant with the largest-scale reprocessing capacity in the world. Needless to say, this emerges from Japan's dangerous attempts to produce nuclear weapons in a fullfledged manner at any time by securing large quantities of plutonium on its own. Japan apparently plans to maintain a large stock of plutonium from which it can produce some 6,200 nuclear bombs by the year 2010. Japan has all the factors and the technology, including an electronic explosion device, that enables it to immediately produce nuclear weapons at this time. Moreover, Japan has already manufactured nuclear warheads, which will operate only if the required amount of plutonium is loaded. Japan recently fired a satellite delivery rocket. Thus, in actuality it came to possess a long-range missile system. This means that Japan's nuclear armament has become a reality before the people's eyes. It is not an imaginary thing. Experts in nuclear issues believe that it is simply a matter of time for Japan to develop nuclear weapons. With the opening of the door for dispatching troops overseas, Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers take even a more grave and dangerous hue. Japan's acceleration of its nuclear armament lays obstacles on the course of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. In addition to the United States, Japan is attempting to become our other nuclear offender [haek kahaeja]. We absolutely cannot become the nuclear victim of Japan. Under the circumstances that Japan is accelerating its nuclear armament program, we, its neighbor, are forced to cope with this situation with vigilance [pudukbuk kaksongul kajigo ie taechohajianulsu optta]. Because Japan's nuclear armament has reached a dangerous stage, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula became meaningless. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be realized to check Japan's nuclear armaments. It is necessary that the world, not to mention Asia, should direct due attention to Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers, and should wage an international movement to check them. It is also necessary that the international community raises its voices for realizing the denuclearization of Northeast Asia, including the Korean peninsula. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia is an important demand for building a nuclear-free world. To realize the denuclearization of the entire world, the district which has become a most dangerous nuclear spot should first be made a nuclear-free zone. If the denuclearization of Northeast Asia is realized, the most dangerous hotbed of a nuclear war will be removed and a nuclear war can be prevented in Asia, thus effecting a remarkable advance in building a nuclear-free world. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be linked to the overall abolishment of nuclear weapons throughout the world. Only when this is achieved, can an overall and complete abolishment of nuclear arms be realized throughout the world and can a new era be opened in guaranteeing durable peace and security in the world.
