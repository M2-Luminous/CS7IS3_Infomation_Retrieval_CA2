Overall, the problems of implementation of the treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan constituted the bulk of the discussions at the latest, the 19th, session of the Republic of Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet, where the 1994 budget was discussed. Today in an interview to an INTERFAX correspondent, Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin gives his appraisal of the session's results and his vision of the ways of leading the republic economy out of the crisis. This interview continues a series of IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA materials on the subject that is extremely important for Tatarstan's future. [Fazullina] In your opinion, has the Tatarstan Government been able to make use of the situation in the republic--which over the past two years had been more favorable than in Russia as a whole--to implement economic reforms? [Mukhametshin] It has been able to provide social protection for the population, which is important. Nevertheless, since it was not burdened with large payments into the Russian budget last year and had more favorable terms with respect to oil exports, it could and it should have used this situation to begin transformations at the same time in the economy, to create a favorable environment for the development of small- and medium-size business. Unfortunately, the government has been concerned not so much with new sources of budget revenue as with the optimum distribution of existing income, which in the current conditions quite logically kept shrinking. At the latest session, the budget was subjected to just criticism. The analysis of parts of its revenues and expenditures shows that the government has a conservative approach to the economy. [Fazullina] In this case, will Tatarstan be able--without its own economic program and still traditionally increasing the tax pressure on insolvent enterprises and citizens who are certainly not getting richer--to collect the expected budget revenue, especially considering that the Republic of Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet decreased the revenue part at the 19th session? [Mukhametshin] The parliament approved the budget on condition that the government will develop within a month a program of anticrisis measures. Considering that at this point only R400 million rubles had been received into the budget, can we really expect that R3 trillion will be collected by the end of the year? Hardly. Therefore, today the main task for the government is to identify priority sectors and enterprises, which will be given tax preferences; develop an effective credit policy and a program of reduction of mutual nonpayments--today they have reached R2 trillion--coordinated with the federation government. [Fazullina] If these tasks have not been resolved in two years, where is the guarantee that the Cabinet of Ministers will find a way out of the crisis situation in one month? [Mukhametshin] We believe that a month is enough. A program of anticrisis measures will be designed to utilize both the republic's internal reserves--which undoubtedly exist--and the external ones. Many enterprises today have programs ready, and some of them already are being implemented. They only need support, and by the end of the year they will be able to stabilize their financial situation. It is necessary to put into effect the law "On Bankruptcy," and get the antitrust committee to work. Being in the same economic space as Russia, we are also looking at the second part of this program--conducting a coordinated policy with the federal authorities, opening centralized credit lines for the agro-industrial complex, financing federal programs, and so on. The treaty we signed with the Russian Government allows the National Bank of Tatarstan to keep flexible interest rates, and we will use this ability as well. We have to keep in mind, however, that Russia has the same problem as we do. We intend to participate most actively in joint actions, in the development of federal programs. It is possible that the government will bring in outside economists to work on the economic development of Tatarstan; we are already in the process of negotiations. It is too early, however, to mention any names. [Fazullina] There were no hints at the session at having your own regional policy. Moreover, the prime minister said that Tatarstan will follow the line of Russian policy... [Mukhametshin] A completely independent economic policy is hardly possible today. We cannot say, however, that Tatarstan will simply go with the flow of the Russian reforms. Specific features will definitely be taken into account, and relevant adjustments made. [Fazullina] In your opinion, is Tatarstan in a state of government crisis? Do you not believe that the Cabinet of Ministers should resign, making room for reformers? [Mukhametshin] It is too early to speak of the government's resignation. Everything will depend on the program they propose take the republic out of economic crisis. [Fazullina] Have the arguments or debates on the subject of the budget at the latest session been natural, or is it a manifestation of disagreements between the parliament and the government? [Mukhametshin] The budget is always lobbied by certain groups--industry, agriculture, the budget-financed sphere. Adopting it is working out a compromise. In the course of budget discussions, I did not detect a desire on the part of deputies to raise the issue of replacing some members of the government or the entire cabinet. Although in some remarks its ability to implement radical transformation was indeed questioned. [Fazullina] Do you not believe that over the past two years Tatarstan's leadership has been more concerned with resolving political issues--both external and internal--than the problems of working out economic strategy? Both targeted social protection and support for the agro-industrial complex represent to a great extent programs of survival, softening the shock. Do they have a future or will it be necessary to fold them? [Mukhametshin] Yes, a lot of money has gone into preserving stability in the republic. We believed that this was necessary; otherwise the population would have rejected reforms. Now a new stage has began, and we have to protect the rights we have been granted and prove the vitality of sovereignty. After the signing of a treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan, the responsibility for reforms rests solely with local the leadership.
