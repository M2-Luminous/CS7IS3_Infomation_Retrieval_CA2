The Center for Technical and Technological Research and Innovation (CRITT) is introducing to the market, with the help of the Vierzon-based "Z3T" company, a new concept--the "Fabception" principle--based on computerization of the entire fabrication process for parts made of reputedly unstable materials such as ceramics and ceramic composites. According to Z3T officials, Fabception can reduce from 40 days down to 5 the time elapsing between design and fabrication of parts, including all phases of product development, to wit: - product definition and design, with the help of CAD systems such as Euclid and Catia; - analysis of part feasibility via prototyping with the help of automated mechanisms, as well as simulations for the analysis of contraction, deformation, and density; - simulation of the production process and on-screen analysis of tooling (i.e. mold) practicability; - preparation of the mold or model by means of CNC machining with three-dimensional control; - experimental fabrication to validate simulation results; - serial production and optimization of the manufacturing process. Beyond the fact that Fabception covers all stages of the process, it integrates all the software (robots and equipment) into a single, continuous process. This implies a single, integrated communications system; a single, consolidated database; technological know-how; and a new methodological approach. In addition to saving time and resources, it permits simplification of various processes.
