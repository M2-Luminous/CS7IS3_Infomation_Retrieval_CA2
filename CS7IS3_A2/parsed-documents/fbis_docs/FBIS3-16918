Speaking to journalists prior to his departure from Sochi airport, the head of the cabinet described the fabrications about a deterioration in the Russian president's health as "insulting." The prime minister strongly denied recent rumors that Boris Yeltsin's health has sharply deteriorated. "Yesterday Boris Nikolayevich and I did almost four hours' work together. The work was continued this morning," Viktor Chernomyrdin said. "We resolved a whole series of questions -- both economic and political -- and discussed the situation in the south of the country." "Somebody has an interest in destabilizing the situation," he stressed.
