FR941216-2-00168 FR941216-2-00094 CNG states that it will obtain the funds it loans to CNGF through internal cash generation, issuance of long-term debt securities as authorized by Commission orders dated April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) and April 14, 1994 (HCAR No. 26026), borrowings under a credit agreement, as authorized by Commission orders dated March 28, 1991 (HCAR No. 25283) and September 9, 1992 (HCAR No. 25626), or through other authorizations approved or to be approved by the Commission. Applicants also seek authorization for CNGF, from time to time through December 31, 1998, to purchase, at par from CNG, shares of CNGF's $10,000 par value common stock previously sold to CNG to obtain funds, as described above, to hold such required shares as treasury shares and to resell such shares to CNG at par. Applicants state that customers receiving loans (``Financing Customers'') will come primarily from the commercial and/or industrial sectors and will result mainly from contacts between CNG Systems LDCs and their end-use customers. 3 CNGF proposes to conduct its Gas Equipment financing activities both within and outside of the four states of Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio where the CNG System LDC's are located (collectively, ``LDC States''). However, applicants state that during the twelve-month period beginning on the first day of January in the year following the date CNGF commences Gas Equipment financing activities pursuant to a Commission order issued in the matter, and for each subsequent calendar year thereafter, the total dollar value of Gas Equipment financing loans made to Financing Customers in the LDC States will exceed the total dollar value of Gas Equipment financing loans made to Financing Customers in all other states. 3 CNGF will not act as a representative of any gas equipment manufacturer or supplier but may recommend specific manufacturers or types of gas equipment to end-users. For example, a CNG System LDC marketing representative may recommend to a glass manufacturing company that a new type of gas equipment be installed in a furnace to increase production efficiency. CNGF will provide Gas Equipment financing to Financing Customers by (1) making short-term loans to cover the period of installation of the Gas Equipment until permanent financing can be obtained by the customer or (2) making long-term loans for a period of time not to exceed the lesser of 10 years or the expected useful life of the equipment. The aggregate amount of Gas Equipment financing loans by CNGF outstanding at any one time will not exceed $25,000,000, with an individual customer financing limit of $5,000,000 at any one time. Loans to Financing Customers may be secured or unsecured and will be made at a spread above the cost of funds from CNG in order to cover CNGF's costs and earn a return on its capital. CNGF does not have any full-time employees, and Applicants expect CNGF to obtain accounting, credit, financial, management, marketing, operating, technical and clerical support, at cost, from CNG Service Company (``Service Company'') pursuant to a written service agreement. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
