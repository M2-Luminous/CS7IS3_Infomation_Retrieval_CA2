They are both authorized leaders of the Tajik opposition delegation at the inter-Tajik talks taking place in Moscow under the auspices of the UN secretary general's special envoy Ramiro Piriz-Ballon. The first -- Moscow -- round of the inter-Tajik talks has ended, having opened on 5 April. Republic Minister Shukurdzhon Zukhurov officially headed the Tajikistan government delegation, the unofficial Tajikistan foreign minister Rashid Alimov, who has been in Moscow for the duration [sentence as published]. The opposition delegation was temporarily headed by Otakhon Latifi, chairman of the Coordinating Center of Tajikistan Democratic Forces in the CIS Countries. During two weeks of talks behind closed doors the sides managed to agree on an agenda for the subsequent rounds of dialogue. A total of 27 questions are to be discussed, divided into three "baskets." The first concerns a political settlement in Tajikistan and includes the cessation of hostilities on the Tajik-Afghan border and inside the Republic, the attitude toward the military formations of various government forces and opposition forces, and various measures contributing to mutual trust. The second agenda "basket" is intended to solve problems connected with the return of refugees and people who were forced to move: guarantees of a safe return home, property matters... Finally, the third "basket" contains fundamental questions of the future constitutional structure and consolidation of the statehood of the Republic of Tajikistan, a new election law, the holding of elections, a transitional period in the Republic... In an IZVESTIYA interview at the end of December with former Tajikistan chief justice Turadzhonzoda, he formulated the basic approaches to a peaceful settlement as a result of which the Tajik-Tajik talks finally began in Moscow. The Tajik opposition aknowledged at the time that Russia had geopolitical interests in the region and agreed that Russian peacemaking forces should stay in Tajikistan on condition that their commanders were replaced. In Moscow now, answering my questions, Turadzhonzoda particularly stressed that they had come to the Russian capital to express their respect for and gratitude to Russia for the part it is playing in a peaceful settlement in their country. The opposition leaders are hoping to meet with Russian leadership representatives in Moscow. Turadzhonzoda and Khemmatzoda intend to participate in the next rounds of the inter-Tajik talks, which will take place in the Iranian or Pakistani capital, on condition that "top people" in the official Tajik leadership are also participating.
