FR940727-1-00014 FR940727-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;74&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and &hyph;700A Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and &hyph;700A series airplanes. This proposal would require installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the flight deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel `RY,' below the right pilot's seat. This proposal is prompted by a report of smoke in the flight deck due to a lighting transformer 6 volt output circuit short circuiting to ground. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent smoke or fire in the flight deck due to inadequate circuit protection for 6 volt circuits of the flight deck lighting transformer. DATES: Comments must be received by September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;74&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., 3 Bishops Square, St. Albans Road West, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL109NE, United Kingdom. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;74&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;74&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and -700A series airplanes. The CAA advises that an incident occurred on a Model HS 125&hyph;700B series airplane when a 6 volt output circuit from the flight deck lighting transformer on Panel 'RY' overheated and short-circuited to ground. This resulted in a release of acrid smoke in the flight deck. Investigation revealed that the 6 volt output circuit was not protected by a fuse or circuit breaker. This condition, if not corrected, could result in smoke and fire in the flight deck during flight. Since Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 125&hyph;700A series airplanes are similar in type design to Model BH/HS 125&hyph;700B series airplanes, the FAA has determined that the addressed unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 125&hyph;700A series airplanes. Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin SB.24&hyph;310&hyph;3544A&B, dated February 14, 1994, which describes procedures for installing circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of two flight deck lighting transformers. The purpose of the circuit breakers is to provide circuit protection for the 6-volt output wires and to prevent overheating and short circuiting. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the flight deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel 'RY.' The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 202 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $212,100, or $1,050 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
