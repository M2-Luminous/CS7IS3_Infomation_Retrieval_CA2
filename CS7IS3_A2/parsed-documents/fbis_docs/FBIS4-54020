FBIS4-54020 "dreas101__a94028" FBIS-EAS-94-101-A Daily Report 13 May 1994 ANNEX Japan MOPT Telecommunications Council Issues Report MOPT Telecommunications Council Issues Report 942A0243A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 May 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0243A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The Telecommunications Council, a Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] advisory organ, published a draft report on 12 May which will serve as the guide for establishment of an advanced information society and envisions "optical fiber cable to homes" by 2010 with an optical fiber network which encompasses households on a nationwide basis. The concept can be considered as Japan's version of Vice President Gore's "information superhighway concept," but there are many problems to be resolved when one considers the details of how and who will raise the necessary capital. The issues will certainly inspire renewed future debate together with arguments in favor of breaking up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) which is considered too powerful. The draft report published by the Telecommunications Council on 12 May reflects the strong desire of the MOPT to build a next-generation communications network and reflects ambitious goals which call for both the government and private sector to take more extensive actions than ever envisioned in the past. However, as the report indicates, installation of the optical fiber cable network alone will require a vast investment of 33-53 trillion yen by 2010. The critical business organization to handle the installation work itself remains to be established. The reality is that many hurdles must be overcome in implementing the project. The initial passage of the introductory paragraph of the draft report states, "Japan now stands at a crucial crossroads." These words reflect a sense of crisis wherein strong concern is being expressed about the reversal of Japanese-U.S. competitiveness in the high-tech arena and the potential that Japan will be outdistanced by the rest of the world in the communications sector. The report is configured so that it reflects strong awareness of action being taken in the United States, such as the installation of optical fiber networks encompassing schools and hospitals by 2000. Chapter 4 of the report comments, "We observe more than just a few cases where so-called new media didn't succeed in the past." Officials of the MOPT Communications Policy Bureau state, "Wording like this is unprecedented and merely provides a strong indication of the lessons we learned from experience with past projects." Put another way, those words merely reflect an honest acknowledgment of past failures of "teletopia ideas" and a determination to create a visionary but practical concept for the future. Actually, the Telecommunications Council has held over 30 subcommittee meetings during the past 14 months. MOPT councils normally operate for two to three months and meet only three or four times, but the duration and frequency of Telecommunications Council subcommittee sessions were of an unprecedented magnitude. On 11 May, the day before the draft report was submitted to the Telecommunications Council for review on the 12th, more than 20 representatives of the financial world gathered secretly at an MOPT facility in Tokyo. The group included adviser Yoshihisa Tabuchi of Nomura Securities and director and advisor Osamu Sakurai of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.. The gathering marked the launching of the "Communications Business Policy Council" (chaired by Chairman Sho Nasu, Tokyo Electric Power Company), whose members come primarily from the private sector and which is attended by the directors of the Communications Policy, Teleommunications, and Broadcast Bureaus of the MOPT as observers. It is a fact that the business world has strong expectations for the growth of the information sector and that the draft report takes the position that the private sector will play a principal role in the construction of the information infrastructure, amidst an absence of signs of a full-scale economic recovery. However, on the other hand, the MOPT embraces the strong hope that the momentum inspired by emerging movements of the above nature will serve to favorably influence funding decisions. Speaking of MOPT budgets, major budget categories such as postal, postal savings, and simplified insurance are covered by special accounts. The initial fiscal year 1994 budget for MOPT public works projects provided only 5.3 billion yen. The reason is that the MOPT had a burning desire to acquire general accounts budget funding for the information-communications sector. However, even some sources at MOPT express fear that the "required funding estimates" found in the draft report "are not based on sound data." Basically, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] is negative on the use of fiscal funds for construction of communications infrastructure because such funding would be inconsistent with the privatization of NTT and some sources express the opinion that, if conditions remain unchanged, an MOF which faces difficulties with tax revenues is unlikely to increase budgets for sectors that lack any meaningful performance record. Now that the draft report has been published, attention will be focused on how competition will be encouraged among businesses in the installation of optical fiber cable networks. Pending resumption of debate on the break up of NTT some time next year, the draft report strongly launches the idea of "fair competition." The idea seems to reflect the goal of restraining NTT, which launches business operations on an overwhelming scale. The draft report shows strong signs of competing with the U.S. "information superhighway idea." A look at the schedule in which Japan is to complete installation of optical fiber networks by 2010 shows that Japan will be progressing on a shoulder-to-shoulder basis with the United States. To begin with, the question is why has Japan fallen behind the United States. The MOPT and the communications industry state that the reason rests with the fact that Japan sits far behind the United States in terms of personal computer installations, cable television [CATV] subscribers, and cellular telephone hookups. They attribute the creation of an information boom based on the Gore concept to the maturity of the U.S. computer software industry. As a practical matter, it was the CATV companies in the United States which took the initiative in providing two-way communication services in response to the Gore concept. Further, Internet, which is a grassroots network, is drawing much attention now as a principal role player among next-generation communications networks. Private-sector business logic would seem to dictate that if "actual demand" does not exist in Japanese markets, it would be advisable to delay investments in optical fiber cable networks, but the draft report for whatever reason places emphasis on completing such investments simultaneously with the United States. Although the draft report speaks of the user being the primary driving force, it persists in the concept of placing supply before demand. On the other hand, the draft report stresses private-sector competition, but in Japan the situation is such that NTT could well become the sole winning player with a predominant role, compared to the United States where CATV firms have grown to levels equalling communications firms and actively engage in competition and business affiliations. Although the report speaks of competition under such circumstances, it lacks in providing a real sense of competition. In the final analysis, the MOPT will probably endeavor to maintain a competitive market by assisting in the development of a force to counter NTT in the form of CATV and newly formed electric power company-affiliated telephone companies. MOPT in December 1993 launched a plan to promote CATV participation in the communications sector. At one time, the MOPT extended lower priority to new electric power company-affiliated telephone companies because they came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, but they have no choice now but to nurture organizations of that nature. Fiscal year 1995 will see a rekindling of the debate on a split-up of NTT. The draft report which calls for fair competition among various businesses could potentially induce a renewed call for breaking up NTT.
