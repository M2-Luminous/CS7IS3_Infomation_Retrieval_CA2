"We do not want to force prices down, any more than destroy western markets," he said. Chernomyrdin emphasised that Russia is prepared to press for entry into the world economic community on a parity basis. He was against discrimination of Russian commodity producers, who should enjoy equal opportunities with other western exporters. The Russian prime minister noted that reforms in the country require immense funds, which, in his view, can be obtained by selling Russian products in other countries. Chernomyrdin further indicated that Russia's leadership invites western businessmen with their merchandise to the Russian market. The prime minister believes that in a number of cases the Russian market may prove more promising than the European one.
