According to Kang Huijun, director of the Pudong Economic and Trade Bureau, by the end of last year, Pudong had attracted foreign investment of $3.27 billion, 28 per cent more than all domestic investment. By the end of last month, Pudong had registered 1,831 foreign-funded projects, more than half of all those in the new area. "If there weren't a lot of foreign funds flowing into the new area, it would be impossible for Pudong to ensure rapid economic growth," said Kang. Kang also said that since the foreign-funded enterprises are established according to international practices, they will speed up the formation of a modern enterprise management system in Pudong. According to Kang, Pudong has become the top place in China for foreign enterprises to invest. Kang said Pudong approved 924 foreign-funded enterprises last year, and they involved foreign investment of $1.73 billion. This year, Pudong will mainly attract investments from transnational corporations, according to Kang. By the end of last year, 32 transnationals had invested in Pudong. This year, the new area will strengthen the relationship with the top 102 transnationals in the United States and the top 100 in Europe. Kang expects nearly 20 multinational corporations to invest in Pudong. Kang also said more and more foreign enterprises in Pudong will deal in service industries. By the end of last year, nearly 42 percent of Pudong's foreign-funded corporations were engaged in service trades. This year Pudong will focus on developing foreign-funded banks, insurance companies and finance companies.
