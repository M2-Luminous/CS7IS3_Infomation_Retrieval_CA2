Cartagena de Indias and Santiago de Cuba are sister cities through a decision by their respective mayoralties. I believe they probably have some sort of ties. Cartagena de Indias is a Caribbean city. I believe the Cartagena de Indias Chamber of Commerce might approach Caribbean countries. The Association of Caribbean States will be established soon, and I believe Colombia will be part of that organization. [Martinez] Since the resumption of relations between Cuba and Colombia, Cartagena de Indias has benefited greatly from this new phase of relations with Cuba, and due to certain characteristics and agreements on many aspects -- economic, geographical, and cultural -- we have maintained close contacts with the Cuban delegation in Colombia. We have already established a number of contacts -- in addition to the establishment of a fraternal relationship between Cartagena de Indias and Santiago de Cuba that you mentioned -- after holding meetings with the Cuban Embassy and charge d'affaires to study the possibilities, and we are virtually organizing a number of activities, beginning with a business mission from Cartagena de Indias and the entire Atlantic Coast to Cuba, which we will organize. We are planning to organize this group in July, and we want to involve businessmen not only from Cartagena de Indias but also from Barranquilla and other areas along the coast because, according to information we have received from the ambassador and the charge d'affaires, there are enormous possibilities to establish two-way exchanges, not only from Colombia to Cuba, but there are also many business activities in Cuba that are competitive. With the opening and the tourist boom in Cuba, the island, its businessmen, and its tourist sector require a number of goods and services that are not being offered. There is an enormous potential there. Colombian businessmen could find a market; in fact, some have already approached us to establish a direct relationship with Cuban businessmen through the Association of Businessmen and the Cuban Chamber of Commerce. We have not yet had official contact with the Cuban Chamber of Commerce. We have started efforts given the possibility of organizing this mission. We hope to invite not only the Cuban Chamber of Commerce but also the chambers of commerce of the entire Caribbean area to a meeting in Cartagena de Indias, possibly next year, of Caribbean chambers of commerce and businessmen affiliated with them.
