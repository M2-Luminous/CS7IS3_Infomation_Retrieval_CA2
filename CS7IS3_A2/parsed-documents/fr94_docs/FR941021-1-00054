FR941021-1-00054 FR941021-1-00009 (1) would generate benefits exceeding costs, and, thus, is not a major rule as defined by the Executive Order; (2) is significant as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; and (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not have an impact on international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below. Regulatory Evaluation Summary The majority of the proposed amendments would have insignificant attributable costs with respect to the benefits received. This evaluation does not address the minor proposed amendments such as changes in syntax, technical corrections, reorganization, updating medical terminology, or adjustments to cross-references for conformance purposes. Furthermore, the evaluation attributes no significant costs or benefits to several other proposed amendments that would add a specific disease or medical condition to the list of medical standards. Such additions do not necessarily constitute a change in the standards. Current regulations include two open-ended (general) medical standards that cover: (1) any other personality disorder, neurosis, or mental condition *␣*␣*, or (2) any other organic, functional, or structural disease, defect, or limitation *␣*␣* that the Federal Air Surgeon finds would make, or may reasonably be expected to make, the applicant unable to perform the duties associated with the certificate. Thus, the applicable medical standards are not limited to those actually listed in the regulation. As medical knowledge and experience progress, the Federal Air Surgeon may find a previously unlisted disease or condition to be grounds for withholding or restricting a medical certificate, so long as that finding is based on qualified medical judgment. Under the proposed standards, a small number of airmen who currently hold certificates as a result of an order of the NTSB would become disqualified from further medical certification because of the addition of specifically disqualifying medical conditions. These airmen were denied medical certification by the FAA under the current general medical standards. For example, the FAA has denied certification to airmen who have had cardiac valve replacement and the NTSB has ordered certification in some of these cases. Under the proposed standards, a medical history of cardiac valve replacement would be specifically disqualifying and those airmen would no longer be entitled to certification. It is expected, however, that certification of the affected individuals would continue under the Federal Air Surgeon's special issuance authority once the FAA evaluates the case and is satisfied that the airman's condition has not worsened since the NTSB ordered certification. As such, the expected economic impact of the specifically disqualifying medical conditions would be minor. Costs and Benefits That Are Not Quantified Prior to summarizing the evaluation of the substantive proposals, it is important to note one category of costs and one category of benefits that have not been quantified in this analysis. The evaluation does not explicitly quantify the economic consequences to those individuals who would lose their pilot certificate privileges as a result of the proposed additional medical tests or standards. Where such consequences are expected, the evaluation estimates the numbers of persons who would be denied but does not attribute a cost to those actions. It is recognized that the denial of pilot privileges would mean the loss of a highly valued avocation for some individuals. For others, it would actually result in the loss of primary livelihood. An accurate assessment of the economic valuation of the denials that are projected under this proposed rule is beyond the scope of the evaluation. At the same time, the evaluation also does not quantify the overwhelming personal health benefits, external to flight safety, that would be afforded to those individuals whose medical conditions would be detected and whose treatment would be enabled by the proposed tests and standards. On average, third-class medical certificate holders spend only 0.7 percent of their time flying. The evaluation only quantifies the direct benefits of the proposed rule to reduced aviation accidents. Under existing regulations, the Federal Air Surgeon is charged to deny a certificate in those cases where a disease or other physical or mental condition would make, or may be reasonably be expected to make, the applicant unable to perform the duties associated with the certificate. Such findings are not capricious, but instead, are based on the case history of the individual and on appropriate, qualified medical judgment. Summary of Quantified Costs and Benefits Vision Proposals, All Classes The proposed rule would institute additional vision tests and standards for all three classes. For first- and second-class applicants age 50 and older, it would add a new standard (20/40 Snellen) and a new test for intermediate vision (32 inches). Applicants for third-class medical certificates would be subject to a new standard (20/40 Snellen) and a new test for near vision (16 inches). The projected 10-year (1994&hyph;2003) costs of the intermediate vision proposal for first-class applicants are $1.1 million in primary testing costs, $1.7 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for those persons not meeting the standard, $5,641 in direct processing costs for the expected 14 additional persons who would be denied under the provision, totalling $2.8 million, with a 1993 present value of $2.0 million.
