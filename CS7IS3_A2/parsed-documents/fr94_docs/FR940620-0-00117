FR940620-0-00117 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. Several commenters questioned the need for such a requirement since holding or housing cells or rooms are rarely equipped with telephones or alarms. They were concerned that alarms within cells may be vandalized or tampered with by inmates or detainees. Moreover, since emergency evacuation is done under controlled or supervised circumstances, alarms directly serving inmates or detainees are usually unnecessary. Response. Many detention or correctional facilities may not have cells equipped with the type of devices, such as alarms and permanently installed phones, that would trigger the requirements of ADAAG 12.6. The NPRM noted: Generally, most correctional facilities do not provide these kinds of elements in cells, but some facility types, such as minimum security prisons, may in fact be equipped with such devices. If permanently installed phones are provided in one category of housing, the minimum number or percentage, if specified, would be based on the total number of cells or rooms provided within that category of housing, not on the total number of cells or rooms of the facility. 57 FR 60632 As noted previously, this section covers a wide variety of facilities, including those facilities with lower levels of security that may have cells or rooms containing telephones or alarms. Comment. The NPRM asked for information on the number or percentage of persons with hearing impairments in detention and correctional facilities. A number of State correctional authorities provided survey data with results that ranged from .01 percent to 5 percent. Most figures, including several estimates, fell below 1 percent and the average among them was .65 percent. At the local level, one corrections official indicated that .5 percent of jail inmates have hearing impairments, and among county facilities, one State agency provided a figure of .10 percent. From its survey, the Bureau of Prisons found that .5 percent of inmates within its system were identified as having a hearing impairment. Two organizations provided information on studies that suggest that this percentage is considerably higher. According to the National Center on Law and Deafness, ``[i]ndependent studies have identified from 8.9 to 47 percent of inmates as having some degree of hearing impairment.'' The American Speech-Language Hearing Association stated that studies place the range from between 15 to 50 percent depending on the age group, and that the prevalence of hearing, speech, and language impairments is two to five times higher among the inmate population than among the general population. Response. Information received from the comments does not account for the wide discrepancy between survey results submitted by detention or correctional authorities and studies referenced by certain organizations. One reason may be a variable working definition of hearing impairment used in different studies and surveys. Based on this information and considerations that were taken into account with respect to fully accessible cells or rooms covered in ADAAG 12.4.1, ADAAG 12.4.3 requires that a minimum of three percent of holding or general housing cells or rooms be accessible to persons with hearing impairments. This percentage, as noted in the appendix, is not based on the total number of cells or rooms provided at a facility but on the total number of cells or rooms equipped with permanently installed telephones or audible emergency warning systems. If cells or rooms of this type are not provided at a facility, the requirements of ADAAG 12.6 do not apply. Additionally, this requirement only applies to housing or holding cells equipped with permanently installed telephones or alarms. These elements are typically located in common use areas, such as dayrooms, instead of individual cells. In this case, permanently installed telephones and alarms are required to be accessible according to ADAAG requirements for common use areas. See ADAAG 12.1 and the appendix note at A12.4.3. 12.4.4‚ê£Medical Care Facilities This section applies the requirements of ADAAG 6 (Medical Care Facilities) to medical care facilities in detention and correctional facilities. Facilities covered by ADAAG 6 are defined as those ``in which people receive physical or medical treatment or care and where persons may need assistance in responding to an emergency and where the period of stay may exceed twenty-four hours.'' ADAAG 12.4.4 is intended to address the same range of medical facilities covered by ADAAG 6. Other medical facilities that do not meet this definition, such as physicians' offices, must be accessible to the extent required for common use areas. ADAAG 6 contains scoping and technical requirements for patient bedrooms and toilet rooms. Medical care facilities in detention and correctional facilities covered by ADAAG 12.4.4 are subject to the scoping requirements of ADAAG 6.1. For example, ADAAG 6.1(1) requires that 10 percent of patient bedrooms be accessible in certain facilities, including those used for detoxification. The patient bedrooms of a prison detoxification unit would be subject to this 10 percent scoping requirement. Comment. The NPRM asked whether further clarification was needed in applying the requirements of ADAAG 6 to detention or correctional medical care facilities or whether there were certain kinds of medical care facilities that are not clearly addressed by the requirements of ADAAG 6. A majority of comments felt that further clarification was unnecessary and that the requirement, as stated by the National Institute of Corrections, ``adequately addresses the kinds of medical facilities found in detention and correctional facilities.'' Those comments recommending further clarification identified specific types of medical facilities, such as first aid rooms, that are not clearly addressed by ADAAG 6. Response. Those areas recommended for specific consideration, including first aid rooms, do not typically provide overnight care or patient bedrooms and thus would not meet the definition of ``medical care facilities'' in ADAAG 6. Medical care units not covered by ADAAG 6 would be considered common use areas and would be required to be accessible under ADAAG 12.1. Comment. A few commenters felt clarification was necessary with respect to small detention facilities which may not contain medical care facilities.
