FR940825-2-00011 FR940825-2-00008 The antidumping duty rate calculated for Sandvik in the first administrative review pertains to Sandvik's sales of the subject merchandise (1) made directly to the United States and (2) destined for consumption in the United States. In its response, Sandvik stated that the Canadian company ``was authorized to sell the merchandise in the U.S.'' and that the merchandise was intended for ultimate importation into the United States (Sandvik's April 5, 1989 response at 10). Accordingly, we have continued to treat Sandvik's sales to the Canadian company as sales to the United States because they were made with the knowledge that the merchandise was destined for consumption in the United States. Therefore, we believe that such sales properly belong in the calculation of Sandvik's antidumping duty rate. Comment 3: Sandvik contends that it was inappropriate for the Department to apply, as best information available (BIA), the antidumping duty rate from the less than fair value (LTFV) investigation for those instances in which constructed value was not available for comparison to U.S. sales. Instead, according to Sandvik, in several recent administrative reviews the Department has found that, where a gap existed in the record for certain U.S. sales, and the Department had to use ``other information,'' not ``BIA,'' it could use a neutral and reasonable surrogate to bridge the gap. Sandvik argues that the Department derives its authority to use reasonable, ``other information'' from its own inherent authority to administer the U.S. antidumping law in a fair and equitable manner. Sandvik further points out that in this case the Department has already calculated margins on the overwhelming majority of Sandvik's U.S. sales transactions. Therefore, Sandvik maintains that, rather than apply the rate from the LTFV investigation as BIA, the Department should apply the weighted-average margin derived from the pool of sales with calculated margins as the more appropriate rate for unmatched sales in this review. Department's Position Section 776(c) of the Act requires the Department to apply BIA ``whenever a party or any other person refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner or in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation.'' When a company substantially cooperates with our requests for information, but fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner or in the form required, we use as BIA the higher of (1) The highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the class or kind of merchandise from the same country of origin ( Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of An Antidumping Duty Order (referring to Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) And Parts Thereof from France; et al.) (58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993); and Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) And Parts Thereof from France; et al.; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 28360, 28379. June 24, 1992)). In cases where a firm failed to supply certain FMV information ( e.g., corresponding home market sales within the contemporaneous window or constructed value data for a few U.S. sales), we apply the BIA rate as outlined above, and limit its application to the particular transactions involved. In this case, Sandvik substantially cooperated with the Department in furnishing the requested information. Therefore, for those few sales in which we found it necessary to use partial BIA, we applied the rate of 20.47 percent from the LTFV investigation, which is the highest rate ever applicable to Sandvik for the same class or kind of merchandise from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review. Comment 4: Sandvik contends that the Department's use of mean average shipment, entry, and payment dates to represent missing shipment, entry, and payment dates imposes an unjustified penalty on the company. According to Sandvik, there were a number of sales for which this particular information could not be furnished because, at the time the response was prepared, payment, shipment and entry had not yet occurred. Sandvik claims that the use of mean shipment and entry dates greatly and arbitrarily increases the size of any adjustments based on such dates. In particular, Sandvik notes that the time the merchandise is in inventory and the days for which credit is extended are both greatly overstated through the application of these mean dates. Accordingly, Sandvik urges the Department to adopt the company's earlier proposal of using the substituted date of June 1, 1989, the date on which the first review tape was prepared, as the shipment date. According to Sandvik, this proposal is reasonable even though it still overstates these adjustments. Department's Position We note that since the June 1, 1989, date of preparation of the computer tape, Sandvik received subsequent opportunities to submit these missing data when replacement tapes were requested by the Department. Sandvik, however, provided no additional data for these missing values. Accordingly, we have continued to apply mean values as BIA for these missing data.
