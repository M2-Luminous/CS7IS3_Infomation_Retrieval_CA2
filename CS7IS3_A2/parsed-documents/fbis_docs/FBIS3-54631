Besides, India should take definite steps in occupied Kashmir to create a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan summoned Indian High Commissioner S.K. Lambha to the Foreign Office and handed to him the Pakistani proposals, which are aimed at focussing attention on the vital issues concerning the Kashmir dispute and giving the talks a meaningful and purposeful direction. Pakistan has asked India to give a response to these proposals and said that only after receiving its reply can arrangements be made for the next round of bilateral talks on the peaceful resolution of the dispute. If India stops its atrocities in occupied Kashmir and gives its consent to providing an opportunity to the people for an impartial plebiscite on the future of Kashmir, talks could be resumed by the end of the year. According to the BBC, Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan did not describe these proposals as a condition for the talks. But, if India totally rejects them, it will be proved that India does not want to remove the differences. On finding out the views of the Kashmiri people, India had said there might be some consensus on certain issues. According to BBC, the political intricacies between the two countries are quite delicate. But, even this small step [of holding plebiscite in Kashmir] will also be in the right direction. The peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue depends upon the referendum of the Kashmiri people. If India comes forward to fix modalities for this referendum and, along with it, halt the atrocities in occupied Kashmir as a mark of goodwill, it might create an atmosphere for the resumption of meaningful talks.
