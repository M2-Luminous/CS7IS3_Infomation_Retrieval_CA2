The Constitution of the Slovak Republic guarantees every citizen's right to freely disseminate information and there is no law banning the acceptance of honorariums from abroad. This does not even run counter to ethics. What we consider immoral is, quite the contrary, the evocation of stereotypes of totalitarian thinking by which dollars were synonymous with dirty money. The publication of such a list, but even the very mention of it by the prime minister, is an evident attempt to use xenophobic sentiments in society against independent media, an attempt that is, in the final analysis, directed against democracy. We protest, furthermore, against the prosecuting bodies' efforts to introduce into practice Article 103 of the Penal Code [regarding defamation of the head of state]. This precedent of a political problem being carried to the level of criminal law is a dangerous signal of future abuse of Articles 102 and 103 of the Penal Code against truly independent critics of power. The Slovak PEN Center deeply regrets that two of its members signed the Proclamation of 50 Slovak Intellectuals to the Intellectuals of Europe [reference to a statement adopted in Bratislava on 6 January 1994, in which 50 Slovak intellectuals blame Hungarian policies and ethnic Hungarians' "irredentism" for tension in Slovak-Hungarian relations].
