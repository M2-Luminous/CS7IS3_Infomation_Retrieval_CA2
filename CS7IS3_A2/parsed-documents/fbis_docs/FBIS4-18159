"There will be no Norwegian EU membership if the Conservative Party does not do its part of the job." The day of the Conservative Party's national conference is approaching and the party's incoming leader made it clear that the EU question will be center-stage when Conservatives gather in Bergen on 8-10 April. He also made it crystal clear that the Conservative Party shares the Labor Party's view on the timing of the referendum: "It should be held after Sweden and Finland have reached their decisions. In a situation in which many people think that it is a key consideration that we should have an answer to the question of what our neighbors are doing, it is obvious that we cannot deprive them of this information." Jan Petersen was the Young Conservative leader in the campaign year of 1972 [year of Norway's pervious referendum on EU/EC membership]. He is now looking forward to leading the Conservative Party into a new referendum: "We lost last time. This time we are going to nail this thing," Petersen said. Like Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland, he hopes that the debate will pass off a little more calmly this time: "We should argue rather than agitate." Petersen will have an easier job than Jagland when it comes to maintaining control over his own party members. Even though there are EU doubters in the Conservative Party too, they do not constitute a dominant group among the 17 percent of voters who currently profess Conservative sympathies. Petersen himself said: "Given the good results from the negotiations I am counting on unambiguous support for them at the Conservative Party national conference. Conservative themselves are impatient to get started." The country's incoming Conservative Party leader is generous in his praise of the government: "It has done a good job. We Conservatives have always stressed that Norway should speak to the rest of the world with one voice. Both the government's negotiators and the EU's people have done a good job. The EU's negotiators have shown themselves to be sensitive to our special requirements. This makes me optimistic," Petersen. He believes that the credibility of the "no" side will now be put to the test:"This applies both in respect to the results of the negotiations, and the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement. According to the `no' side, there was no limit to the catastrophes the four freedoms [of movement for goods, services, labor, and capital] would bring down on us. We have now been part of the EEA for three months and so far no catastrophe has occurred. ``What the `no' side has tried to do is to portray the EU countries as something totally alien and unknown. In this respect the EEA agreement was a useful lesson for us. We went through 12,000 pages of EU laws and it turned out that the EU countries' social systems are very like our own.'' In the Storting the lawyer from Oppegard has chiefly concerned himself with foreign policy. He is deputy chairman of the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee and he is leader of the delegation of Norwegian parliamentarians to NATO. However, as the incoming Conservative leader he knows that he now has to be an well-rounded. He has to be a match for Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Are you able to understand why in the last election many Conservatives voted for the Labor Party because there was no other government alternative? "I can only note the fact that a few did so. But it is the voters who must give us the political weight which can give us government responsibility again." So in the run-up to the 1997 Storting election the Conservative Party together with other nonsocialist parties will come forward as an alternative to the Labor Party? "Our aim is to seek political power. But the Center Party's shift to the left is the problem. Naturally the Conservative Party wants to be a real alternative to the Labor Party."
