I know you said you wanted to do it, but you took action on an independent basis and went ahead and said, OK let's go. Let's give it a go. [Patten] That is, broadly speaking, right. The Chinese knew perfectly well that we had to start taking some decisions in early December. I don't think they were under any illusions about that; we have responsibilities. We have responsibilities to legislate to the electoral arrangement and to administer the elections. And we have to discharge these responsibilities, though I would much prefer to do so after agreement with the Chinese side. [Lim] But by your taking unilateral action, doesn't that give the Chinese an excuse to do the same? Doesn't it invite them to do the same, really? [Patten] I don't think so because the Chinese recognize, after all, it is explicit in the joint declaration that we are sovereign until 1997 and that means we have certain responsibilities and of course what the joint declaration is supposed to do is to ensure that China cooperates with us while we discharge those responsibilities until 1997. Cooperation has not been perhaps as extensive as we would have liked. Cooperation is of course a two-way street. [Lim] Throughout the negotiations, though, it has been very public. You have been quite accessible to the press and I would say the Chinese have become more accessible. But if you look back at it now and given the fact that there was a report recently that you had tried to establish a secret channel of communications before you came out here, would you not prefer the negotiations to be less public? [Patten] Well, I would have preferred to have gotten an agreement whether through a secret or in public, but I don't think that you could have had negotiations going on for the best part of a year or even longer in secret. I think it would have been impossible. [Lim] Why do you say that? [Patten] I think that you will know that what we sought in the first place was a rather better channel of communications with the Chinese side and we sought that very sincerely. Unfortunately, they did not seem to have the interest at the time, which was shortly after I had come to Hong Kong. I think that is perhaps an indication of what the Chinese sometimes call sincerity. [Lim] Alright. Let's talk about the Chinese reaction for a bit. They have said that no matter what you do, governor, we are going to eliminate Legco, Legislative Council. We are going to eliminate the legislature anyway. Does that worry you at all? [Patten] Well, I don't find a Chinese threat to do something which would be very much against Hong Kong interests in 1997 a persuasive argument for us to do things which are against Hong Kong interests in 1994. [Lim] So you think they are bluffing? [Patten] I didn't say that. I very much hope that they will not throw out the window institutional arrangements which work and which are acceptable to people in Hong Kong and which in no way represent a threat to the rest of China after 1997. I don't actually think that as their first act of sovereignty that China will simply overturn the arrangements that they find here in Hong Kong. But that said, I repeat the point I was making earlier. If China says we will do something which does not make any sense at all in three or four years time, it does not mean that we would be sensible to do something which is not in Hong Kong's interests today. [Lim] But if you are not quite sure that they are bluffing and I think you have indicated this, aren't you sort of jeopardizing people who have to stay here after 1997? [Patten] I think we will be jeopardizing them far more if we connived at putting in place arrangements before 1997 which weren't fair, if we gave a veneer of respectability to arrangements which would in the end prove corrosive to the rule of law and to Hong Kong's free institutions. I think if we were to do that, we would be very unwise and I think we would be condemned in Hong Kong and outside Hong Kong. [Lim] Outside Hong Kong, Beijing has already also set up the Preliminary Working Committee, the PWC. Do you feel threatened by this at all? [Patten] Well, I don't think so. They describe themselves increasingly in strange and interesting ways under a certain amount of criticism. They have now said we are not an organ of power, but just a talking shop. There was a poll over the weekend. One should not take every poll seriously, but I think it sort of reflected people's views which suggested that 70 percent of people in Hong Kong did not trust them, or certainly did not trust them very much. And they do have credibility problems, but I very much hope that they will begin to represent some of Hong Kong's interests to China. The more channels of communications there are, the better. But no threats to the governments authority or credibility. The threat to our authority would have come if we had been prepared to do a rotten deal with the Chinese officials. That would have been a real threat to our authority. [Lim] If the PWC is not a threat, is not seen as a threat, why did you recently then say, look, local legislators don't accept the invitations to be in the PWC? Why did you not think it is a good idea when you do not see it as a threat? [Patten] What we have received is a request to send civil servants to Beijing to brief the PWC and we don't think it is a very good idea. [Lim] Why not? [Patten] For a number of reasons, let me tell you. First of all, their existing arrangement under the joint declaration for improving relations between Britain, China, and Hong Kong for dealing with transitional matters and, for example, the Joint Liaison Group through which we would like to be doing a great deal more business than we are actually managing to achieve at present because China tends to drag her feet in the Joint Liaison Group. [Lim] You mentioned Legco just now. You have gazetted the reforms, watered down they may be. But, let's say for some reason or another, the legislators say, well, I am not sure so sure I would like to pass this and it does not pass. Would you feel at that point disappointment as well as some relief, perhaps? [Patten] I'd feel acute disappointment. [Lim, interrupting] No relief? [Patten] No relief whatsoever because we are responsible for good government in Hong Kong. We are responsible for the electoral arrangements and we have to have electoral arrangements in place. Whatever arrangements, whatever proposals we put to the Legislative Council, we will argue for as vigorously as possible. I certainly don't intend to put proposals to the Legislative Council which I would like the Legislative Council to water down or change in some way. That is not political leadership. [Lim] I asked if you would feel any relief because if the reforms do not pass, in a sense, the whole issue sort of blows over and you would have been seen to have tried, to have fought tooth and nail to get through this, but Legco says sorry, we don't think it is a good idea. [Patten] In what is becoming an increasingly balding and grey-headed political career, I have always believed myself that I am trying to be too clever by half, though a very very bad way of trying to conduct public business. I think that clarity is important. I think you set out what you want to try to do and then you try to do it. And I don't know any better way of giving a political lead and I don't know of any better way of trying to mobilize consent so we will do what we believe is in Hong Kong's interests. It is a true point that I have made many times. It is true that I can't go further than Hong Kong is prepared to go, but nor in my judgment can I go less far than Hong Kong is prepared to go. [Lim] I find it a bit ironic, though, because in a speech in October, you said that the community's legislature, you are responsible for setting the limits to this government's ability to strengthen democracy, but you are asking the legislature to take responsibility for negotiations that have been held outside of their vision, outside of their involvement, but when push comes to shove, it is still their responsibility. [Patten] What we are doing is recognizing the constitutional role of the Legislative Council, which is to pass, to agree, to amend legislation and electoral matters. That is the position under the present constitutional arrangements in Hong Kong and, I whisper the words in case Chinese officials are listening, that will be the position and under the constitutional arrangements after 1997. What we are doing is attempting to shape Hong Kong's political institutions in consultation with the Legislative Council; it is a process of political dialogue which I think one should find not only acceptable, but immensely practical in an open society like this. [Lim] And lastly, in the past 10 months, has this job gotten any easier for you? [Patten] No, I don't think anybody would regard this as one of the easier jobs in the world. [Lim] Less difficult, lets just say. [Patten] It remains challenging and fascinating and I hope learning that in order to do it, I need to be rather fitter and keep my wits about me and I hope that I'm also learning to do it without being provoked by the noises off that we sometimes hear from the mainland. [Lim] Thank you for your time, governor. [Patten] Thank you very much.
