"The Moslem side would prefer to leave that (demilitarization) until after the exclusion zone is negotiated and up and running," EC negotiator Lord Owen, a co-chairman of the talks, told reporters. Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic of the mainly Moslem Bosnian government told AFP Friday: "We refuse to discuss Sarajevo without the rest of Bosnia. We want to discuss the overall settlement now." An aide was carrying maps of Bosnia for the discussion. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic entered the second day of talks here in a decidedly more upbeat mood than on Thursday, when he refused to participate if Serbs did not join an investigation into last week's mortar massacre in Sarajevo that killed 68. A compromise was reached Thursday for the setting up of a committee with Serb and Bosnian government liaisons involved, to investigate the massacre, which led to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation issuing an ultimatum Wednesday for Serb artillery to withdraw from around Sarajevo. The liaison formula was clearly the key to the compromise, worked out by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Bosnian Croats, the third of the former Yugoslav state's warring factions, were represented at the talks by Mile Akhmadzic.
