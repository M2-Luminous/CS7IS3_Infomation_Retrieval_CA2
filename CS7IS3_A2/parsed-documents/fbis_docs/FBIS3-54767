The Moscow Ostankino channel presents what it calls "the first pictures" of the new emblem. Ukhov says that the Russian Defense Ministry recently organized a competition for a new emblem for the Russian Army. Almost 300 proposals were submitted for consideration. The results of the competition have recently been announced. The new emblem will consist of a crowned double-headed eagle holding a laurel wreath and sword. On an inset shield mounted on the eagle's chest a horseman can be seen killing a dragon. The eagle clutches the Russian national flag and the St. Andrew's flag in its claws. A brief interview with V.N.Medvedev, head of the insignia department of the Ministry of Defense General Staff Headquarters, is then shown. He says: "There are plans for placing this unified emblem of the Russian Armed Forces on military uniforms, banners of military units, military and navy flags, identification marks on military equipment, documents and identity cards."
