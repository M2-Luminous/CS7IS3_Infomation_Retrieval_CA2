The final part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled: "Later Years," and focuses on Mao's role in the Cultural Revolution and Deng Xiaoping's rehabilitation. After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong said: The youth of today and tomorrow will appraise the revolution according to their own criterion of values...." the documentary begins with video of an interview with Nobel laureate Lee Tsung-dao recalling his 1974 meeting with Mao, during which Mao regretted he had not continued the pursuit of natural sciences. In fact, the narrator says, due to Mao's failing health, from the early seventies on he did not even study his favorite subject -- social sciences. Then, as video shows historical footage of Mao attending the 10th CPC National Congress in 1973, his former head nurse Wu Xujun recalls the ailing Mao being unable to stand up from his chair on the rostrum to receive a standing ovation from congress delegates. The narrator says: According to the accounts of Mao's doctors, he was stricken with one ailment after another in his later years, which put "the old man with ceaseless aspirations" in the face of "new contradictions." As the video shows historical footage of Mao's funeral, as well as shots of the Mao memorial hall in Tiananmen Square, the narrator explains: Mao always viewed the issue of life and death in a lighthearted and humorous way. In a conversation with Edgar Snow in 1965, he said he had no way of knowing what the youth of today and tomorrow would aspire to, but he added that future generations would appraise the revolution according to their own criterion of values. This view conforms with the objective law on social development. However, in his later years, Mao failed to match his theory with practice. A year after the conversation with Snow, he began the Cultural Revolution. While the video shows historical footage of Red Guards shouting slogans and cheering Mao in Tiananmen Square, the narrator says: "Mao Zedong should bear chief responsibility for the decade-long calamity brought about by the Cultural Revolution in China. Of course, Mao's purpose in initiating the mighty mass movement was not to destroy the socialist state he himself founded. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: As far as Chairman Mao's intentions are concerned, he initiated the Cultural Revolution out of consideration for avoiding the restoration of capitalism. However, he misapprehended the realities in China and consequently led the country into large-scale turmoil, which was far beyond his expectations and control." The narrator continues: In 1967, Mao contemplated ending the Cultural Revolution within three years, but it did not proceed as he envisaged. "Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and others successively set up two counterrevolutionary cliques and schemed to seize supreme power. They exploited Mao's errors and committed a host of activities behind his back to the detriment of the country and people's interests, causing immeasurable harm and damage to the party and state." While the video shows historical footage of the masses adulating Mao as "the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman," the narrator points out: "Mao did not entirely reject the people's worship. Nevertheless, he began to be wary of this man." Video at this point shows a close-up shot of Lin Biao reading the little red book of Mao's quotations. Many photographs taken during the Cultural Revolution show a stone-faced Mao while Lin Biao shouted "Long live Chairman Mao." The narrator continues: During a CCTV news documentary made on 1 June 1971 Mao was never seen with Lin Biao. The occasion was Mao's 45th and last appearance atop the Tiananmen rostrum. As Mao's head nurse Wu Xujun gives an account of Lin Biao's failed attempt to blow up the train carrying Mao back to Beijing from an inspection tour in the summer of 1971, video shows color photographs of several charred corpses and plane wreckage in Mongolia, with an on-screen caption reading: "The Lin Biao treasonous clique plunging to death on a flight to a foreign country on 13 September 1971." The narrator adds: In the wake of the incident, Mao decided to reexamine the mass movement and pondered several issues. While the video then goes onto show historical footage of Marshal Chen Yi's funeral in January 1972, his son Chen Haosu recalls how Mao showed up unexpectedly at the funeral in defiance of the Gang of Four's orders, and he says that Mao's decision to attend was based, to some extent, on the political situation at that time. Chen adds that though subjectively Mao was unwilling to call off the Cultural Revolution, objectively, in view of the leadership vacuum caused by the disappearance of Lin Biao, he had to consider the rehabilitation of veteran comrades who had been purged. The narrator then adds: "It was at the funeral that out of the blue, Mao mentioned Deng Xiaoping, who was then toiling in a shabby workshop in the suburbs of Nanchang, Jiangxi." Then, as the video shows historical footage of Deng's reappearance on the political scene on various occasions, the narrator comments: "On the evening of 12 April 1973 the late Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a banquet for Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia at the Great Hall of the People. At the banquet, people saw a familiar face who had not been seen in public for a long time. Deng Xiaoping sat quietly as the curious eyes of several hundreds people focused on him. Before the banquet was over, reporters rushed to the post office to dispatch the news: Deng Xiaoping has been rehabilitated. At the 10th CPC National Congress in August 1973, Deng Xiaoping was included in the Central Committee. In December the same year at a Political Bureau meeting, Mao proposed Deng be made a Political Bureau member and chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). In a speech at a Political Bureau meeting, Mao said earnestly: `It was wrong that I took Lin Biao's biased views on several occasions; I should conduct self- criticism in front of comrades.' In October 1974 Mao again proposed Deng take up the post of first vice premier of the State Council. In January 1975, Deng was appointed vice chairman of the CPC Central Committee's Military Commission and concurrently chief of the general staff of the PLA; he was also elected vice chairman of the CPC Central Committee in charge of its day-to-day work. Mao placed high expectations on Deng, and praised him as a rare talent with a strong political orientation." While the video shows more historical footage of Mao and Deng, the narrator continues: "Mao praised Deng time and again. As early as 1957, when Mao was visiting the Soviet Union, he told Khrushchev: `Did you see that short guy over there? He is extremely smart and has great potential for growth.' Mao added: `This man observes principle and at the same time has flexibility; he is a rare talent.' At a Political Bureau meeting in December 1973, again Mao said: `Deng handles affairs in a decisive manner. He is firm but gentle, like a needle hidden inside cotton. Outwardly he is amiable, but inwardly his mind is as strong as steel.'" The narrator continues: "While appraising Deng positively, Mao always paid keen attention to the domestic economy. On the eve of the Fourth National People's Congress session in 1974, Mao repeatedly emphasized: `The Cultural Revolution has been going on for eight years; it is better to have stability now.' He also pointed out the need to push the national economy forward. In line with Mao's guidelines, Deng, exerting great efforts to open up a new situation in economic construction, launched a comprehensive drive to overhaul work in industry, agriculture, communications, science and technology, military affairs, literature and art, education, and public health." As the video shows more historical footage of Mao and Deng on various occasions, the narrator continues: "Mao rendered support for Deng's work, and repeatedly criticized the interference of the Gang of Four. At a Central Political Bureau meeting on 17 July 1974, Mao used the term four-member faction for the first time, and declared: `Jiang Qing does not represent me, but herself.' During a talk with Deng in Changsha in October 1974, Mao gave explicit support for Deng's fight against the unreasonable troublemaking of Jiang Qing and her clique, and at a Central Political Bureau meeting said: `It is good that you have set up a steel company; I back you up.' Soon afterward, Mao more incisively pointed out: `Jiang Qing has ambitions; she wishes to make Wang Hongwen the chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee and herself party chairman.' By and large, however, Mao wanted to uphold the theory and practice of the Cultural Revolution and, therefore, could not understand and solve the problem of the Gang of Four once and for all. Neither could he tolerate the drive to overhaul work on all fronts launched by Deng in 1975, which inevitably developed into a systematic repudiation of the Cultural Revolution's left-leaning mistakes. In November 1975, Mao made an erroneous decision to criticize Deng and counterattack the right-leaning tendency to reverse the verdict." As the video cuts to show historical footage of Mao holding Hua Guofeng's hands, the narrator continues: "On 15 June 1976, when Mao was gravely ill, he told Hua Guofeng and others about his life. He said: `I did two things in my life: One was the decades-long fight against Chiang Kai-shek, which resulted in his exile to the islands; and the other was the Cultural Revolution, which was supported by a few but opposed by many people.' In 1976 -- the year of the dragon -- at a crucial moment in China's future destiny, on his sickbed Mao did not hand over power to the Gang of Four. China owes what it is today to Mao's important decision at the time." Then, highlighting Mao's efforts to preserve his image abroad as a jovial man with a sense of humor, video shows historical footage of Mao's meetings with Kissinger and Nixon, and Kaunda of Zambia, as well as interviews with them reminiscing about their encounters with Mao. Video then shows an interview with famed ophthalmologist Tang Youzhi recounting an operation he performed on Mao in 1975 to remove a cataract, and with an attendant describing Mao's final hours on his sickbed. After the video shows footage of Mao laying in state and grief- stricken people congregating in Beijing on the day he died, the documentary concludes at 1300 GMT with an on-screen postscript reading: "Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the `Cultural Revolution,' but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese Revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary.... -- Excerpted from the `Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC.'"
