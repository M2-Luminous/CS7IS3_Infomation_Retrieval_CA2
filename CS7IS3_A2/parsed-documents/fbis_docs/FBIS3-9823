The fresh round of talks will include the Bosnian Serbs, whose absence makes the peace "impossible". This round of diplomatic action, as is announced in Washington, aims not only to bring the Serbs to the negotiating table, but also to find something they and the Moslem-Croat Federation could reach an agreement on. Two things are crucial to this: First, to reach an agreement on relations between the Moslem-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb republic, and, secondly, to resolve territorial demarcation issues between the federation and the Bosnian Serb republic. Although the Serbs refused to join the Moslem-Croat Federation, they do not rule out the possibility of establishing a trilateral union in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a feasible solution, especially if confederal relations with countries outside Bosnia-Herzegovina are not insisted upon. The territorial demarcation issue is the most difficult, but it could also be solved. The problem had nearly been resolved in Geneva and Brussels, when the differences have been reduced to only a few percentages. Now that the Moslem-Croat Federation package has been tied, U.S. presidential envoy Charles Redman announces a return to Geneva, speaking to that effect about the former demarcation lines. It was, in fact, a deal offering 33.3 per cent of the territory to the Moslems, 17.5 per cent to the Croats and about 50 per cent to the Serbs. The deal broke down at the last minute after Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic rejected it under the pretext of being dissatisfied with the quality of the territories. The "Geneva idea" is now back in circulation and, all things considered, the U.S. and Russian presidential envoys, Charles Redman and Vitaliy Churkin, will take it as a starting point of a fresh round of the talks. In the meantime, talks between Croatia and the republic of Serb Krajina officials resume, Yugoslav and Croatian bureaus have opened in Belgrade and Zagreb and a question of "a phased economic restoration in the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia" has been raised at a meeting of the working group in charge of economic issues within the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia. No matter how utopian any of these issues might sound, a peace option is mostly being considered and supported. The major foothold is that the Americans and the Russians are so deeply involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina that they would not let it slip away so easily. They would otherwise lose face, which would be a greater disgrace than the one the European Union had experienced there.
