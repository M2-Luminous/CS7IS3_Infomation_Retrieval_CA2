A Press Statement from the African National Congress. The ANC [African National Congress] election manifesto is titled: "For Jobs, Peace and Freedom". There is good reason why `jobs' comes first. Without jobs to get the country's more than 3 million unemployed into work, there is little chance of peace or freedom for any of us -- the main aim of all ANC policies. Our election programme promises the creation of at least two-and-a-half million jobs within five years! Real jobs -- not charity handouts. Real useful work -- not useless "job creation" schemes for digging holes and filling them in again. Two-and-a-half million real jobs, which will provide a real base for reconstruction and a new South Africa, and for the development of its industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors. Two-and-a-half million people taken from the ranks of the desperate and the hopeless, and given the chance of dignity and human development which only real, secure, full-time useful work can provide. This is the promise and the substance of the ANC Reconstruction and Development Plan. It is not a glib generalisation to fill the temporary demands of our election campaign. It is a long-term plan which sets the social parameters for an ANC government for years to come. New jobs cannot be created by reckless spending on ephemeral schemes. In our programme, the two-and-a-half million jobs will be created steadily, through the unfolding over a five-year time scale of an unprecedentedly massive programme of essential public works. These are the detailed focus points of that programme: The building of up to 300,000 low cost homes a year, totalling at least one million in the first 5 years. A national network of primary health care centres with maternity care services and safe supervised childbirth facilities for virtually all women. Clean on-site water supplies to all households in urban and rural areas, with first priority given to schools and clinics. Electricity supply to 25 million households within five years, with first priority for schools and clinics. Tele-communications to all schools and clinics within two years, and rapid expansion of the service nation-wide thereafter. Immunisation against disease for 90 percent Of children within three years. A range of free and nation-wide health-care services for the aged, the disabled and the unemployed. The training of three thousand community development workers in 5 years, and half the nationally required district health workers within 3. Expansion of the schooling system, to give at least ten years schooling to all children, in classes of not more than 40. Those are the numerically determined elements of the programme. There are further unquantified elements, such as the building of road and rail networks, setting up vocational and management training schemes, providing nation-wide sanitation and refuse disposal services, and so on. These projects will create hundreds of thousands -- perhaps millions of new jobs, directly. The indirect spinoffs will create many more, from such auxilliary activities as manufacture and supply of materials, to transportation, training and retraining, planning, marketing and so on. This massive plan of development and construction cannot be carried through by central and provincial governments alone. To even attempt to do so would require the creation of an equally massive bureaucracy and administrative apparatus. This is a burden our country cannot afford. We will therefore encourage the private sector, through with special incentives, to take a large part of the financial and material burden on themselves. We will encourage all portions of the private sector to shift its focus from the area of speculation and luxury production to the new opportunities to enterprise contained in the ANC Reconstruction and Development Programme. We will encourage citizens everywhere to take full part in the detailed planning of the programme through democratic peoples' forums, and so tailor the programme to meet detailed local needs. We will encourage citizens to volunteer to assist the paid teams which will be providing the main man and woman-power needed for the physical realisation of all the local development projects. We will set the same criteria for the planning and for the execution of the whole programme, viz: preference to be given to small private enterprises as contractors and suppliers before the large monopolies favoured by the past NP [National Party] regime. Preference to be given to labour intensive rather than capital intensive methods of construction and service provision, to maximise the number of new jobs. Priority in the distribution of jobs and contracts to be given to the most dispossessed and deprived sectors of the population, rather than the rich favoured by the NP regime. Priority in the allocation of labour, material and finance to be given to those regions worst neglected by the NP regime. Priority in opportunity to be given to women rather than men, and to blacks before whites, to redress the inequalities left over from the NP, regime. We will pay for this scheme without any general need to raise tax rates, partly through savings from by cutting back the NP's swollen bureaucratic apparatus; partly by cutting out the waste, the multiplication of administrative structures, and the corruption which flourished in the NP era; but mainly with new revenue created from turning thousands of unemployed into employed taxpayers, and from taxes payable by private-sector enterpreneurs on their new profits from the public works programme. This is the ANC programme for jobs. It is realistic, and it is realisable.
