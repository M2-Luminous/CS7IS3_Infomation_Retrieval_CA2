He does not tire of advocating a good relationship between all peoples of the Lusophone countries, and he backs the community being prepared. Among other advantages, it will carry a significant weight at the UN, which could help many people in the future. These were Soares' words in an exclusive interview with Renascenca. Ines Saldanha also spoke to President Soares about the political contacts he has been having and of Itamar Franco's visit to Portugal. [Begin recording] [Soares] First of all, at the invitation of Vice President Itamar Franco, we are preparing a major meeting to be held in Lisbon and a major meeting of Lusophone countries at a head-of-state level. [passage omitted] [Saldanha] You place great importance on the July meeting of Lusophone countries, and I know that that is related to the importance you give to a greater weight of those countries in the UN. Do you think that could help Portugal in matters such as Indonesia? [Soares] Of course. They all have come out, and even Brazil recently came out very clearly in favor of East Timor and in favor of its self-determination. This carries some weight. But I am thinking beyond the present. I am thinking of the future. [Saldanha] Are you thinking of the community of Lusophone countries the Brazilian ambassador talks of? [Soares] Exactly. I am thinking of a community, a Luso-Afro-Brazilian community that could have an important specific weight in the 21st century. [Saldanha] And do you think that is viable considering the conditions in Mozambique and Angola? [Soares] Precisely, what I want is a joint plan by Portugal and Brazil to help our African brothers, who are in a bad situation but will be great nations in the future. [Saldanha] Have you invited President Itamar to visit Portugal before the end of your mandate? [Soares] Naturally, it has been confirmed that he will visit in June. Before the summit of heads of state, he will come on a bilateral state visit to Portugal, and I will have the honor of receiving him in Lisbon. [end recording]
