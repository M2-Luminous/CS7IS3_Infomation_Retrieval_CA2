He said the deployment of some 1,000 extra officers in the military police and police to monitor foreigners was "too ambitious." "By putting in more than 1,000 extra people, the impression of panic is created," the minister said. He said the package of measures announced last week by State Secretary for Justice Kosto on the Evangelical Broadcasting Corporation's "Time Signal" news show was "unacceptable." [passage omitted] According to Pronk, the current flow of asylum-seekers was a direct consequence of the Netherlands's decision to sign the Schengen Treaty. "We decided fat too lightly to bring down the internal borders," he said. "We did that to strengthen the economy, but it also had consequences for mobility. We put up with that because the economic gains were bigger. So it is a bit hypocritical to say that the borders have to be closed again now," Pronk said. He also warned that the "mood" for good policies on asylum-seekers was in the process of becoming harder. "Step by step the mood is becoming egocentric," he said.
