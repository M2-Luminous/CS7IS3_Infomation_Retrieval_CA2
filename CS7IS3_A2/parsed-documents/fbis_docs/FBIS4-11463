About 30 kg of explosives, antitank rockets, 24 grenades, and arms of various calibers and ammunition were also seized. Police and court sources have indicated that the detainee, officially identified as Alejandro Jorge Socksdorf, 35, is a member of a "Painted Faces" group whose members had allegedly been training "to rescue" former Colonel Mohamed Ali Seineldin, sentenced to life imprisonment for heading a military uprising on 3 December 1990. The operation in which Socksdorf was detained was ordered by San Isidro Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich. Buenos Aires Islands Security Corps police participated in the raids on an island near the Antequeda Creek, 400 meters from the Parana de Las Palmas river confluence. Inspector Juan Carlos Rebollo, the Buenos Aires Islands Security Corps chief, said the detainee "is an extremely dangerous person." Rebollo emphasized that the area where the raids were carried out is reportedly "a training camp for ultra-right extremists" because "a large number of spent cartridges" were found in the area. Rebollo explained: "In addition to the arms seized, we also found targets and other items that lead us to believe that people were trained there. A heliport was found at the far end of the island." Based on this, Rebollo emphasized that the 15-hectare island might be "a training center," specially for former "Painted Faces" military officers. He indicated that extreme-right literature was also seized, reinforcing the possibility that the detainee is part of an extreme right group. [passage omitted] The police seized 24 MK2 grenades, an unspecified quantity of 9-mm pistols, at least 10 "Energan" antitank rockets which are launched by FAL rifles, a large quantity of 7.62 and 12.70 caliber ammunition, and a "homemade firing stand" [preceding word in English] for mobile targets. Inspector Rebollo added that 10 rifle-launched rockets, one FMK 2 grenade, three electric detonators, and 100 grams of dynamite were also seized. Buenos Aires Security Secretary Alberto Piotti noted that 46 pounds of TNT -- in 1-pound pieces -- rapid and safety fuses, detonators, a 12.70 caliber shotgun [as received], an unspecified quantity of dynamite, and a Browning pistol with erased license numbers were also seized. [passage omitted] In a brief communique signed by Colonel Eduardo Alfonso, the Army Press Office chief, the Army General Staff indicated that Socksdorf was a "civilian employee" in the Army until 1993 when he was "fired" for undisclosed reasons. Army sources reported that Socksdorf, who was a PCI [Civilian Intelligence Personnel] grade employee, participated in the operations to recover the 3d Infantry Regiment of La Tablada that was surrounded on 23 January 1989 by a group of For the Fatherland Movement (MTP) militants. Inspector Rebollo noted that when the raid began, Socksdorf introduced himself as "an IN-11 grade Army member and many other things which the judge (Marquevich) will have to determine if they are true." Police sources contacted by NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS stated that the detainee "has significant military training" and so the possibility that "he is a trainer of other members of the cell" has not been ruled out.
