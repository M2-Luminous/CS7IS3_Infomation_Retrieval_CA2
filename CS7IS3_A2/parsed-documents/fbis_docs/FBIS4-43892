Speaking at a press conference on the Corfu summit, Delors said that "being of a rank lower than that of prime minister... it is not up to me to propose a meeting, it is up to him. If he does so, I would be most happy to hold bi-lateral talks on the sidelines of the summit." Delors also dwelt on his recent negative reaction to a statement by Gianfranco Fini, leader of Italy's rightist National Alliance, who alleged that the American landings in Europe in 1944 marked the end of Europe's own cultural identity. Denying that his remarks amounted to interference in Italy's domestic affairs, Delors said "if Fini makes statements which I believe to be not good or worrying, I respond, and this is a dialogue between him and me. I have never judged, and I never intend to judge people's intentions, and I do not interfere in Italy's domestic affairs." Asked who should head the World Trade Organisation, the body which will replace GATT, the EU [European Union] executive chief said "there is an Italian candidate, and he certainly has all the right qualities for being an excellent director." The reference was to Renato Ruggiero, a one-time diplomat and former foreign trade minister.
