[Chamorro] Speaking as a simple citizen, I think the Sandinist Congress met as any political party would meet. Each party must deal with its own problems. [Reporter] But who is your candidate, Daniel Ortega or Henry Ruiz? [Chamorro] Young man, I do not have a candidate in any party. This development is fine as long as we consolidate the new democracy with the help of conservatives, liberals, social Christians, Sandinists, and [words indistinct]; as long as it is done for Nicaragua's sake. [Reporter] Do you think the contradictions within the Sandinist National Liberation Front are real or just a smoke screen? [Chamorro] I really could not say. God willing, they will benefit everyone. Everyone has a right to speak freely, to say what he likes. This is a party -- I repeat -- just like the liberals, conservatives, and social Christians. They should reach an agreement for the country's benefit. I think unity equals strength. I do not think anyone should (?perpetuate himself), however. [Announcer] Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo also commented on the Sandinist Congress: [Obando y Bravo] They will always be united and will try to attain power in the next term. Nothing else will happen. For the time being, there can be only criticism from and tension created by the media. [Announcer] Dona Violeta was questioned about the possible presidential candidacy of Engineer Antonio Lacayo: [Chamorro] [Words indistinct] informed, but he has not said so. He has not told me. Anyone who wishes to run should do so. [Reporter] But would you support him? [Chamorro] I cannot answer that yet.
