Pol Gen Chawalit said Khun Sa's struggle was not a democratic cause. He said narcotics traffickers who were recently arrested in Chiang Mai Province and had ammunition seized were Khun Sa's subordinates and should not be called "fighters for democracy". The ammunition was intended for exchange with drugs, he said, adding he had no idea where they came from. Academics have proposed that measures be put in place to control the ethics of politicians, but Pol Gen Chawalit thought the moral standards of MPs could improve gradually. He said it was beyond his responsibilities to comment on what should be done to prevent politicians from becoming involved in the narcotics trade. He also said the committee responsible for drafting the anti-money laundering bill had already met once and would meet again this Monday. It was agreed at the first meeting that the legislation should deal initially with "dirty money" acquired through the narcotics trade, he said.
