Total cases, lost workday cases and nonfatal without lost workday cases are expressed as incidence rates are per 100 full-time employees (200,000 person hours). 2. Average lost workdays are the average number of lost workdays per lost workday case. Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin Nos. 1830 (1972), 1932 (1974), 1981 (1975), 2047 (1977), 2097 (1979), 2130 (1980), 2196 (1982), 2236 (1983), 2259 (1984), 2278 (1985), 2399 (1990), 2424 (1991) Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry. While the injury incidence rate remains high in the logging industry, the BLS data show a steady decrease in the incidence rate for the industry since the pulpwood logging standard was adopted in 1971. 2 The decrease in incidence rates occurs in both lost-workday and non-lost-workday cases. In contrast, the data also show a steady increase in the average number of lost workdays per case, that indicates that the severity of injuries has increased over time. 2 The decrease in injuries since 1971 is also due in part to adoption of comprehensive logging standards by six states. For example, the state of California, which has a comprehensive standard, reported 457 logging fatalities in the 1950s, prior to adoption of the standard. In 1981, after the logging standard had been promulgated, California's logging fatalities hit a record low (6 fatalities) (Ex. 2&hyph;11). The 1991 logging industry incidence rates still remain far above the total incidence rates and lost-workday incidence rates for other industries, as Table 2 indicates. For example, the most recent logging industry incidence rate (15.6) is almost double the incidence rate for the private sector combined (7.9). It is also 40 percent higher than the manufacturing sector incidence rate (11.2). The logging injury incidence rates also are well above the incidence rates for the construction industry (12.8) and mining (7.1), industries generally considered as high hazard.
