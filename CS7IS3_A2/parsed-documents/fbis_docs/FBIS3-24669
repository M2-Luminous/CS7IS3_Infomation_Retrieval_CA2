Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-17FEB94-PALESTINIANS New Paper Seeks To Boost Support for PLO The appearance in Jerusalem of a new Palestinian newspaper apparently intended to present the PLO leadership's viewpoint to educated Palestinians reflects the leadership's concern to maintain support in the occupied territories as the peace process proceeds. According to a report by Israel Television on 13 February, the English-language weekly The Jerusalem Times is edited by Hanna Sinyurah, formerly editor of the daily Al-Fajr- -until it closed last July--which generally supported Yasir 'Arafat and the mainstream PLO leadership. The report cited staff members of the paper as saying that the paper seeks "to boost grass roots support for the political process" and that it receives "ideological support," though not financial assistance, from the PLO.
