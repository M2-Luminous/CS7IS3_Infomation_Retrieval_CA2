The Opposition has done a good job of articulating the fears stemming from the Dunkel draft; but it took the approach that since it is its business to oppose the Government, it needed to do no more than to suggest that the country should opt out of Dunkel, that is, pull out of GATT. That this course of action is not open to India or any other nation in today's unipolar world is obvious enough. The alternative to crowbars, of the American or any other variety, is a strong multilateral forum. Like other developing nations, India has a stake in a truly independent GATT. True, the Uruguay round is taking the world away from even-handed trade; but the issue then surely is to stem this trend by developing a negotiating stance. The Opposition could have contributed to this by suggesting specific amendments to the Uruguay round proposals before these were consolidated in the Dunkel draft. Indeed, even with regard to the draft, the Government could have been pressured to ask for changes that would result in visible benefits to the country's exports. As things stand, the multilateral trade agreement that is to be finalised on December 15 and made operational from April next year, will improve annual world trade by $217 billion; this country's share in this at $207 million will be a fraction of one per cent. India is being fobbed off under the Uruguay round. This reflects the country's failure to adopt a national stance, stemming from a total loss of initiative following its submission to the IMF and World Bank-referred programme of economic liberalisation. In the Lok Sabha debate, the Union Commerce Minister made brave noises: if the textile export quotas against India are kept in operation for 15 years (as proposed by the US), India will ask for a similar term for relaxing intellectual property rights; since the Dunkel proposals will mean a sharp rise in prices of drugs and pharmaceuticals, the Government will exercise its licensing powers, and so forth. The fact is that retaliatory or protective powers are not available to India under the Dunkel draft nor can issues be reopened at the ministerial-level meeting of April 1994. Worse, in the resurrected GATT, the US and the advanced capitalist countries will tend to gang up against the developing countries; if the multilateral forum does not suit them, there is nothing to stop them from acting unilaterally against India. The Government has mishandled the Uruguay round negotiations, failed to protect India's interests in international trade and yielded to the one-sided Dunkel draft.
