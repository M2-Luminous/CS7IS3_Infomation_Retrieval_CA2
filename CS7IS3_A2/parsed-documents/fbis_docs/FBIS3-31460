[Begin recording of Omar Bahman in unidentified language with superimposed correspondent's report in Persian] Referring to recent NATO decisions for air operations in Bosnia, he said: This decision should have been made a long time ago. The situation in Bosnia has now reached such a stage that such temporary steps--even though positive--cannot solve the Bosnian people's problem. Criticizing UN actions in Sarajevo and referring to the general disarmament in the city, Omar Bahman said: If this decision is carried out justly, it can be useful. But past experience shows that this step by the United Nations also serves the objectives of the Serbs and that in the long run only the Muslims will be disarmed since the Serbs can re-arm themselves with the support that they have. The Bosnian ambassador in Tehran also described the West's political pressure to accept the peace plan as futile, and said: The Bosnian people are no longer fooled by the West's false slogans. Continuing, Omar Bahman strongly criticized France and Russia and accused them of conveying the secret decisions adopted by NATO and the Security Council to the Serbs. [end recording]
