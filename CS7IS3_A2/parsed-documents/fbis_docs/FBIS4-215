At the same time the majority of whites are scared for their future under an ANC government. This survey was carried out among 500 white South Africans countrywide. According to the Electoral Act this opinion poll is one of the last of its kind that can be released. After tomorrow the act bans the publication of opinion polls indicating support for parties, their leaders, or their policies. Ronel van Zyl analyzes this opinion poll. [Begin recording] [Van Zyl] The developments in Bophuthatswana last month that led to the deposing of former President Lucas Mangope contributed to the discrediting of right-wing groups. The deployment of Afrikaner National Front and AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] armed forces in Bophuthatswana was rejected by 82 percent of whites. [AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche] A magnificent victory for the AWB. [Van Zyl] This remark by AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche was condemned by 83 percent of whites. Concerning participation in the election, 80 percent of whites believe that all right-wing organizations should participate. This includes 68 percent of right-wing supporters. Eight-four percent of all whites say that General Constand Viljoen of the Freedom Front has made the right decision by participating in the election. The idea of a homeland is opposed by 60 percent of all whites and 54 percent of Afrikaans-speaking whites. The idea enjoys the support of 30 percent of whites, while only 13 percent are prepared to live in such a homeland. Sixty-three percent of whites feel they will be worse off under an ANC government, but 90 percent say they will accept an ANC government if they are allowed to continue their lives unhindered. The opinion poll indicates that the state president and National Party leader, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, is the most popular leader among whites. [video indicates 72-percent support] He is followed by DP [Democratic Party] leader Dr. Zach de Beer [42 percent], whose support has risen sharply over the past few months, followed by Gen. Viljoen, CP [Conservative Party] leader [37 percent], Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg [17 percent], and then Mr. Terreblanche [12 percent]. According to the poll, 64 percent of Afrikaans speakers say that the AWB is an embarrassment to other Afrikaans speakers. There is a 5 percent margin of error. [end recording]
