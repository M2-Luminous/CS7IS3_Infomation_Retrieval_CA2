It is reported that some listed companies recently gave different treatments to state-shareholders, corporate-shareholders, and individual-shareholders with respect to new share allocation. Some companies ask state-shareholders to give up their right to new share allocation and let individual-shareholders enjoy the right exclusively. Other companies give state-shareholders cash dividends while allocating dividend shares to other shareholders. Such different treatments to shareholders hurt the legitimate rights and interests of state-shareholders. Besides, they do not conform to standards and international practices. For this reason, the State-Owned Property Administrative Bureau, after consulting the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, issued the urgent circular calling on state-shareholders to effectively exercise their shareholder's rights and protect the interests of state shares at shareholders' meeting with respect to new share allocation. State-shareholders are urged not to blindly approve of new share allocations unless the company indeed needs more capital, unless issuing shares is the best way to raise the capital, unless the shares are issued at shareholders' request so as to maintain proper shareholding ratio, and unless state-shareholders have the ability to buy additional shares. Only under these conditions should state-shareholders agree to the allocation of new shares by listed companies. The state-shareholders should use their veto power to stop new share allocations if the purpose of the capital fund-raising is unclear, if share allocation is not the best option, or if the state-shareholders do not want to make additional investments. If they are unable to stop the new share allocation, they should manage to buy the allocated shares, or sell their share allocation rights. Under no circumstances should they give up their share allocation rights. If the listed company is subject to the control of state- shareholders, the sale of the share allocation rights should not affect the controlling status of the state-shareholders. The urgent circular emphasized: Presently the best way to sell the state-shareholders' share allocation rights is through negotiation, unless the securities supervision organ has other stipulations. The urgent circular unequivocally demanded: At the shareholders' meeting, the state-shareholders should oppose the practice of giving state-shareholders cash dividends while giving other shareholders dividend shares, and stress the principle of same treatment to all shareholders. If the shareholders' meeting of a listed company decides to turn the common reserve funds belonging to all shareholders into new shares, it should allocate the new shares to all shareholders in proportion to the number of shares they are holding. Failure to allocate new shares to state-shareholders will violate their right to the common reserve funds and reduce the proportion of state shares. For this reason, state-shareholders should clearly and definitely oppose such a practice at the shareholders' meeting, and should not agree to the unilateral reduction of the proportion of state shares under any pretext. The urgent circular emphasized: Local state-owned property administrative departments and the State Council's functional departments, if without proper authorization, are not permitted to approve the request of state-shareholders for giving up the new share allocation right, accepting unequal share and dividend distribution plan, or unilaterally reducing the proportion of state shares. The person in charge of a relevant department of the State-Owned Property Administrative Bureau pointed out during an interview with this reporter that the urgent circular was issued to protect the rights and interests of state-shareholders and to promote a healthy development of the stock market and those enterprises selected for experiment on the shareholding system. He said: The permission given to transfer of state-shareholders' new share allocation rights through negotiation does not mean the right may be sold in open market. Its sole purpose is to correct the old practice which does not conform to standards and international practices.
