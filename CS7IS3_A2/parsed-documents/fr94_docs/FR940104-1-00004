(b) On or before the 15th day of the month, the market administrator shall announce the Class II price for the following month computed pursuant to §1030.50(b) Handler Obligations and Producer Prices In §1030.60, revise paragraphs (a) and (f) to read as follows: §1030.60 Handler's obligation and producer prices. For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler described in §1030.9 (a), (b), and (c) as follows: (a) The handler's obligation for producer milk shall be computed as follows: (1) Multiply the total hundredweight of producer milk in Class I as determined by §1030.44 by an amount equal to the Class I differential price pursuant to §1030.50(h) for the month (this amount may be negative); (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of producer milk in Class II as determined by §1030.44 by an amount equal to the Class II differential price pursuant to §1130.50(i) for the month (this amount may be negative); (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight of skim milk in Class I as determined pursuant to §1030.44 by the skim milk price pursuant to §1030.50(d); (4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to §1030.44(a) by the average protein content of producer skim milk received by the handler (reported pursuant to §1030.30(e)), and multiplying the resulting pounds of protein by the protein price specified in §1030.50(f); (5) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to §1030.44(a) by the average other solids content of producer skim milk received by the handler and multiplying the resulting pounds of other solids by the other solids price specified in §1030.50(g); * * * * * (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received less the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to §1030.43(d) and §1030.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to §1030.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of §1030.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; In §1030.61, redesignate paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) as (c), (d), (e) and (f); revise the introductory language and paragraph (a), add a new paragraph (b), and revise redesignated paragraph (e) to read as follows: §1030.61 Producer price differential. For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1 (this price may be negative). If the unreserved cash balance in the producer settlement fund to be included in the computation is less than 2 cents per hundredweight of producer milk on all reports, the payments required pursuant to §1030.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the uniform price. The report of such handler shall not be included in the computation of the uniform price. The report of such handler shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until he has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned conditions, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner: (a) Combine the values computed pursuant to §1030.60 (a)(1), (a)(2), and (b) through (k) for all handlers; (b) Add the values computed pursuant to §1030.60 (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the value obtained by multiplying the protein price by the handlers' total pounds of protein and by multiplying the other solids price by the handlers' total pounds of other solids. * * * * * (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of (1) the total hundredweight of producer milk and (2) the total hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat for which a value was computed pursuant to §1030.60(f); and * * * * * Revise §1030.62 to read as follows: §1030.62 Statistical uniform price. The statistical uniform price is the sum of the basic formula price and the producer price differential pursuant to §1030.61. Add a new §1030.63 to read as follows: §1030.63 Announcement of producer prices. (a) On or before the 5th day after the end of each month, the market administrator shall announce the butterfat differential pursuant to §1130.74 for such month.
