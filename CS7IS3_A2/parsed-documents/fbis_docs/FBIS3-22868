The newspaper NIZHEGORODSKIYE NOVOSTI reports that the unusual contraband had been despatched from Arzamas-16 to sovereign Kiev for use in X-ray machines. But the investigation will show whether this was actually the case. The containers of dangerous radioactive polonium-210 had crossed virtually all of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast from south to north. And they were coupled to a...passenger train. The cost to the passengers of this little journey is as yet unknown.
