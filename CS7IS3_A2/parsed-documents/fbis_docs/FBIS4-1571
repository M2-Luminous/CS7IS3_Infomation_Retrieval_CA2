This contradicts statements made by Jardines directors last week when they announced the hong's intentions to de-list several Jardine companies from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at the end of this year. Bermudan financial ministry officials said Simon and Henry Keswick had said there was an extreme likelihood that there would be a hostile bid for the group. David Saul, Bermuda's Minister of Finance and a senior parliamentary member of the ruling United Bermuda Party said he met the Keswick brothers on several occasions to discuss details of passing their takeover code into law. "The Keswicks were concerned, they expressed those concerns and they described those concerns," he said. "They were concerned principally about a hostile takeover. They decided that they needed protection, and that seemed to us a genuine bona fide concern." The code Jardines sponsored in Bermuda stipulates that anyone acquiring 30 percent of a company's stock must make a general offer, whereas the Hong Kong trigger point is 35 percent. The company, which has been doing business in Hong Kong and China for the past 150 years, had sought, but been denied a special arrangement in Hong Kong, that it said could have allowed the group's shares to remain as a secondary listing in Hong Kong. Mr Saul said Jardines had been expressing fears about being taken over since it first officially announced its new domicile in 1984, coinciding with the agreement by Britain to hand Hong Kong back to China in 1997. "When Jardines moved their headquarters to Bermuda, it was apparent that takeover concerns led them to do it." He said it was these concerns too, that proved to be one of the deciding factors persuading the Bermudan Government to allow Jardines to proceed with a private bill to enshrine a specific takeover code. Mr Saul said: "We suggested that they go the private bill route. We said that we had no provisions in law to prevent hostile takeovers." Malcolm Williams, the general manager of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, whose department investigated the code and who will be responsible for administering it, also said that these were their motives. "They were uncertain about 1997, and it seemed sensible in some ways in stationing and positioning themselves, so that if something adverse happens, then they have something to protect shareholders," Mr Williams said. He said that from this assessment he could only surmise that the Keswicks felt that the Hong Kong regulations were insufficient to protect them adequately. The announcements for the de-listing Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic were backed by statements that the move was not related to fears about China. Jardines officials were not available for comment.
