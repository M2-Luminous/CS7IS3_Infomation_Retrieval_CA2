In order to achieve this objective the Russian Government assigns a significant role to the country's regions, which are capable of establishing partnership ties with Finland of their own accord. During 1993, overall trade between the two countries grew by 40 percent compared with the preceding year. President Ahtisaari, who is paying an official visit to Russia, expressed satisfaction with his talks in Moscow. Among other things, specific plans for economic cooperation between the two countries were discussed. Responding to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the Finnish president said that Finland's forthcoming membership of the European Community will not impair but, on the contrary, will expand opportunities for bilateral Russian-Finnish cooperation. He cited the example of funding for joint projects. The further development of traditional trade and economic relations between Russia and Finland is essential to both countries, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted at a short briefing after the talks. We see no obstacles or special difficulties in the way of this. With whom have we always found mutual understanding, if not with Finland, the Russian premier asked?
