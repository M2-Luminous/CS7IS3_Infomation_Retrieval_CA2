Mayak programs were switched off in the oblast on 6 February, while today, even the "Utro" television news program was not broadcast. However, commercial channels are continuing to operate, broadcasting semilegal Western clips and local advertisements. The local television program will not be switched off as its management has reached agreement with the communications workers to earn millions [as heard] and pay them off. Even so, local television and the two commercial channels are working only a few hours a day. Meanwhile, local inhabitants watch Polish, Swedish and other Western programs, which can be received well here. When I asked Kostantin Votpusko, head of the oblast's radio and television transmission center what he thought of this situation, he said that state television had long been a burden to the transmission workers. It is much simpler to sell the air time to the multitude of private commercial companies, which agree to pay large amounts of money. This would be in the interests of the transmission workers, he said. I think that this is what lies behind the boycott and its logic. But who is giving thought to the interests of Russian viewers and listeners?
