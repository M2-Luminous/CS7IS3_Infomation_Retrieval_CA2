The statement reads: "Some false reports of a rather primitive type on the participation of units of the Army of Yugoslavia in the war in the former Yugoslavia have again appeared in some media. These articles are trying to present the Army of Yugoslavia in the same light as the units of the regular Croatian Army, whose participation in combat activities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is indisputable. The General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia has on several occasions, in connection with this, informed Yugoslav and world public that no members of its Army are outside the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This fact has been acknowledged several times in statements by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] military officials and political functionaries of the countries whose forces are serving within UNPROFOR. Reiterating accusations against the Army of Yugoslavia despite the facts in an atmosphere of a serious aggravation of the conflict raises the question of the motives and objectives of such risky schemes. To assign blame for the war to an army that is not taking part in it, and to absolve of responsibility the forces that cause and aggravate it, cannot be seen in any other sense than propaganda support for the escalation of the war. The General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia again reiterates its commitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict, while following with greatest attention the developments that could affect the security of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the survival of the Serb people wherever they live. There are no members of the Yugoslav Army anywhere outside the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and therefore not in Bosnia-Herzegovina either," the statement says.
