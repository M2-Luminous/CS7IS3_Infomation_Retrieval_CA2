FR941206-0-00123 FR941206-0-00017 Summary of issues raised by the public comments in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. There were no comments submitted in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) filed comments in the original rulemaking order. The Commission addressed the concerns raised by the Office of Advocacy in the Rate Order. The SBA also filed reply comments in response to the Fifth Notice. Significant alternatives considered and rejected. Petitioners representing cable interests and franchising authorities submitted several alternatives aimed at minimizing administrative burdens. In the course of this proceeding, the Commission has attempted to accommodate the concerns expressed by these parties. For example, the revised going forward mechanisms are designed to enhance incentives to add new channels to regulated tiers without creating new regulatory burdens and to provide additional options tailored to the concerns of small systems. In addition, the New Products Tier is designed to ensure that regulated cable service rates are reasonable while reducing administrative burdens. Paperwork Reduction Act The requirements adopted herein have been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and are found to impose a new or modified information collection requirement on the public. Implementation of any new or modified requirement will be subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget as prescribed by the Act. Ordering Clauses Accordingly, it is ordered, That, pursuant to Sections 4(i), 4(j), 303(r), 612, 622(c) and 623 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 154(j), 303(r), 532, 542(c) and 543, the rules, requirements and policies discussed in this Sixth Order on Reconsideration and Fifth Report and Order, are adopted and Part 76 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR Part 76, is amended as set forth in below. It is further ordered, That the Secretary shall send a copy of this Report and Order, including the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (1981). It is further ordered, That the requirements and regulations established in this decision shall become effective January 1, 1995, 5 with the exception of new reporting requirements which will become effective on that date or as soon thereafter as they may be approved by the Office of Management and Budget. 5 Good cause exists to make these requirements effective on less than 30 days notice in the Federal Register . See 5 U.S.C. section 553(d)(3). Good cause exists to make the requirements effective January 1, 1995 because this Order provides additional opportunities and incentives to cable operators and many of the Commission's rate regulations apply on a calendar quarter system.
