Gorbatkina, All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining; UDC 549.67+[66.097:665.6] [Abstract] Synthetic zeolites are porous crystalline aluminosilicates of alkaline or alkaline earth metals with a strictly regular pore size and unique adsorption and catalytic properties. The All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining [VNIINP] has been researching the conditions of synthesizing different types of zeolites and zeolite production processes since the 1960s. The VNIINP has recently developed promising processes for producing type Y zeolites. A no-waste process has been developed to synthesize NaY zeolite that entails producing the silica needed to synthesize the zeolite by electrodialysis of a sodium silicate solution and then using the alkaline solutions formed during electrodialysis and crystallization to dissolve the silicate materials for return to the production process. Other studies performed at the VNIINP resulted in the establishment of six general laws governing crystallization of pentacyls of the TsVK series that were in turn used to develop a method of synthesizing zeolites with 100 percent phase purity. In 1989-1990, the VNIINP developed a no-waste process for producing pentacyls with a very low (�0.1 weight percent) sodium oxide content, i.e., TsVN zeolites, according to which the mother liquors are returned to the process in the stage of preparing the starting reaction mixture. Working jointly with Byelarus Technological Institute, the VNIINP synthesized molecular sieves with different structures: AlPO[.sub]4[/]-5, AlPO[.sub]4[/]-20, AlPO[.sub]4[/]-44, SAPO-5, SAPO-44, etc. Catalysts based on them are now being tested. The wide-pore sieves AlPO[.sub]4[/]-5 and SAPO-5 have shown the most promise and highest stability: They do not break down when heated up to 1,040�C or when treated with steam at 600�C. Both sieves also have rather high sorption volumes. Modified TsVM and TsVK-XI zeolites have been used as a basis for developing the catalyst SGK-1m for dewaxing the base of I-20A and I-12A industrial oils and the heavy oil distillates used as a base for ASV-5 high-viscosity motor oil. The catalyst SGK-1R has been developed for single-stage hydrorefining of highly aromatized catalytic cracking gas oils. New processes have also been developed for two-stage hydrocracking of vacuum distillate at a pressure of 15 MPa to produce jet fuel and for light hydrocracking at a pressure of 5-7 MPa to produce diesel fuel. The new process has been used to create the zeolite-containing catalysts NMG-70 and GKO-1. A series of zeolite-containing catalysts has also been developed for light hydrocracking of vacuum distillate with a transformation depth of more than 70 percent. The zeolite RZEU is used as a splitting component. Catalysts of the series GKR consisting of 40 percent RZEU possess good splitting activity but are not selective enough with respect to the diesel fuel fraction. Catalysts of the series LGK are more active and selective than their rival counterpart ZMAG 95 AS produced by Haldor Topso. Tables 10; references 31 (Russian).
