Of endless competition in the speed of printing documents fabricated by one political group in order to destroy another; of careful calculation of the arc of fire at the headquarters of hostile political groupings and pocket-size parties; the national pastime of watching the state of the liver of the also nationally elected president and of bringing in astrologers to tell us the dates and details of future coups. In the endless flak of arguments about how to conduct another revolution, we have somehow forgotten that there are far more real problems. We have forgotten that in the Far East "friends and business partners" from North and South Korea will soon leave nothing--not even stumps--in centuries-old taiga; that 150 companies from America and West Europe are flooding the country with toxic waste in exchange for Russian metal; and that, finally, because of our own negligence and indifference the threat of a new Chernobyl has become far more real than the threat of a coup. I am sick and tired of it, because dozens of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA materials--and we wrote about it all: the "black market" in nuclear materials, the Western radioactive waste coming into our country, the catastrophic situation in the domestic nuclear power generation--did not elicit any response from our own government circles, which are busier attempting to reposition themselves in the shadow of the ruling chair. I am sick and tired of it because the almost two-year-long struggle of Vladimir Kuznetsov, former Gosatomnadzor [Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] inspector, fired for his attempt to shut down 10 unsafe nuclear reactors, has not produced any results. Among the people he appealed to are the first persons in the Russian "ecological" establishment: presidential adviser A. Yablokov; Social-Ecological Union Chairman S. Zabelin... None of them supported Kuznetsov, while the truly horrible information he collected is still gathering dust in the safes of highest-level offices. You need facts? There are many of them in the article V. Kuznetsov brought to the newspaper. Judge for yourself whether coup rumors are more important than something that affects our life. Russia May Turn Into a Chernobyl Last year I had an honor my "colleagues" in the line at the employment agency could only dream about. Can you imagine an unemployed American being is invited as a consultant to the U.S. Senate, let alone the White House? Nevertheless, anything can happen in Russia, and an officially registered unemployed Russian may work for an equally official presidential adviser. There are numerous advantages to this method: If the finished report attracts the "highest attention," there is no need to introduce the author, who has not gained any status in the nomenklatura; in the event of failure, however, one may resort to a tried and tested remark: "Well, you know, we have to use the services of questionable characters, but after all, we do not get any support from ministries and agencies...." This in itself would not be too bad--one can swallow personal insult if the information you collected literally crumb by crumb did indeed bring about at least some result. But time goes on, and nothing changes. Presidential advisers shove the material you prepared to the back of the desk drawer; ecological organizations of the Social-Ecological Union and Physicians of the World for Prevention of Nuclear War type shrug their shoulders helplessly; and ministerial bureaucrats simply dismiss the facts and figures they are shown. It is easy to understand the reason for such attitudes. All the reports and memoranda are devoted to the activities of only one, albeit very impressive agency--the Russian Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], which has always held the status of "sacred cow" in domestic industry. Nevertheless, let us try to sort out what is hidden behind the polished sign of the omnipotent ministry. Radioactive waste disposal is perhaps one of the items at the top of the list of Russian ecological problems. Existing capacities simply are insufficient, and the size and safety of storage facilities are limited, while construction of new ones involves immense expenditures of technical and monetary resources. At the same time, existing plans for dismantling nuclear arms and nuclear power generation systems far from always comply with the ability to safely store the resulting radioactive waste. At the end of 1992 the total area of contaminated land amounted to 52,263 hectares. Of them, 16 were recultivated over the year. According to official data of the Ministry of the Ecology alone, Russian Minatom enterprises have accumulated radioactive waste with a total emission power of 1.7 billion curies, which are kept in 227 storage facilities, and of these, 81 have already been sealed. If only the problem were limited to the number of storage facilities, though! At some enterprises the waste is kept in the open; most solid radioactive waste disposal sites do not meet elementary safety standards. And the system of handling solid radioactive waste in our country not only does not meet IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] standards but is contrary to the practice of developed countries. The problems of enterprises whose names have been mentioned in the world press for many years--Mayak Production Association (Chelyabinsk-65) and Siberian Chemical Combine (Tomsk-7)--still have not been resolved. In 1992 the maximum allowable discharge of strontium-90 at Mayak was exceeded by a factor of 1.8. The waste was dumped into the Techa river. At the same time, at the Siberian Chemical Combine norms of discharge of phosphorus-32 were exceeded by a factor of 1.14. The average annual concentration of this radionuclide in the Tom river was 2.9 times higher than the allowable level. In 1993 serious accidents involving radiation occurred at both enterprises. Serious and very representative commissions visited the sites; tonnes of papers were written, but no particular conclusions were drawn from the events. Suffice it to mention that the already approved program of replacing equipment presenting nuclear danger at these enterprises is still not being implemented. This, however, is just a concrete case involving only two nuclear facilities. Of much greater interest is something else: In February of this year the Russian Gosatomnadzor, known in the past for the extreme caution of its statements, suddenly subjected the state of the Russian nuclear complex to sharp criticism. Inspection of practically all domestic nuclear installations showed that "the state of nuclear and radiation safety in the Russian Federation as a whole cannot be called satisfactory. Numerous problems associated with the use of nuclear energy are being resolved extremely slowly and are not regulated by law..." After such a serious statement, however, which for the first time indicated a split between Minatom and Gosatomnadzor, information came out which at first glance completely refuted the Federal Oversight's conclusions. The Rosenergoatom concern's vice president, B. Antonov, representing the main user organization, said that on the contrary, the safety of Russian AES's [nuclear power stations] has increased: There were 45 fewer incidents at stations in 1993 than in 1992. For a specialist this is a strange argument, to say the least. The decline in the number of incidents is not at all an indicator of AES safety. Last year a considerable number of AES's were operating at reduced capacity. This happened because of the considerably greater length of the repair season at power generators of all stations: electric power consumers simply did not pay their bills on time, and the AES's did not have the money to buy materials and component parts in the needed quantities. In addition, controller-imposed restrictions on capacities (up to 23.9 percent, plus the restrictions introduced by the Federal Oversight--26.1 percent of the rated level) together produce a figure equal to a 50 percent loss in power generation output. The figures above confirm not only the thesis of Rosenergoatom's imperfect--to put it mildly--calculations and the resulting conclusion regarding the increased safety of the AES's, but also bring up a no less important question: Can it be that electric power produced by AES's at the old level of output is not needed by the Russian economy, which constantly complains about energy shortages? And what has caused these restrictions if, in the opinion of Minatom bureaucrats, everything is going so well in their industry? Somehow, the No. 2 and No. 3 generators at the Balakovo station and the No. 5 Generator at the Novovoronezh station, which had been under long-term repair, as well as Balakovo's No. 4 generator, which was recently brought on line, have disappeared from the list of AES's to be inspected. According to the results of last year, it was these stations' power generators, as well as those at the Kola AES, that were found to be the worst in terms of reliability and stability of operation. In June 1993 a "medium-gravity incident" was registered at the No. 2 generator at the Balakovo AES--jamming of 11 regulation devices in the control and protection system; at the Novovoronezh AES No. 5 generator in February last year there was an incident classified as "insignificant:" the water-chemical condition was off balance. At the Kola AES the incident was far more serious: As a result of a hurricane, high-voltage lines in the Kolenergo system were damaged, which resulted in the shutdown of all four of the stations' power generators. As to work on increasing AES safety, this is not even on the agenda at this point. Actions in replacing technical channels at RBMK [high-power pressurized tube reactor] power generators and steam generators at power generators with VVER [water-moderated power reactor] reactors do not increase safety as compared to the design level--they only remove design faults discovered in the process of exploitation. Technical substantiation of safety factors at most power generators is still at the stage of development; there is no systematic substantiation of planned measures with respect to power generators' technical retrofitting and modernization. As to exploitation of all nuclear reactors and systems without exception, it is still being conducted in accordance with safety norms developed at the time they were built--that is, 15-20 years ago--and today does not even come close to modern standards. As to Minatom's contention that an IAEA commission that visited most AES's appraised their safety condition as satisfactory, this is no guarantee. The conclusions of various IAEA commissions are of a purely advisory nature and are not mandatory for compliance. Nothing has changed since then, and our power generation industry is still ruled by the kilowatt-hour, not by safety. Speaking of research nuclear installations, the situation with respect to them is even more difficult than that with nuclear reactors. The reason is not only the extreme obsolescence and physical wear and tear of the equipment and technological systems, but also the absence of practically any norms and safety systems. There is no normative-technical documentation; there is no statewide program of utilization of research systems, which would allow a definition of the necessary volume of work on these systems; there is no system for localizing accidents, and no simulator facility for personnel training. The situation with respect to spent nuclear fuel at scientific research centers that use nuclear reactors is critical. In the NII [scientific research institute] of Atomic Reactors in Ulyanovsk Oblast, in the Physics and Energy Institute in Kaluga Oblast, and in the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, facilities for storage of spent nuclear fuel are filled to 80-90 percent of capacity, while the technology for reprocessing it simply does not exist. The practice of liquid radioactive waste disposal in the NII of Atomic Reactors simply does not have any analogues. Medium- and low-activity waste in Ulyanovsk Oblast is simply pumped underground into so-called "absorbing collector beds." As a result, more than 2 million cubic meters of waste with a total activity of 100,000 curies have already accumulated in underground storage. By law, however, waste disposal can be done only after it is "converted into solid explosion-, fire- and nuclear-proof form." In other words, waste must be converted into a form that ensures its reliable isolation in a geological medium. Fifty years of operations of the Russian scientific center Kurchatov Institute produced an extremely difficult problem associated with rehabilitation of land set aside for temporary storage, and taking off line obsolete research systems. At the territory of the institute, which is located in the heart of the city of 9 million inhabitants, temporary storage--which, by the way, has remained "temporary" since the time it was built in the 1940's--occupies an area of two hectares. It is estimated that it contains more than 200 tonnes of highly radioactive waste. Normative documents, which have been at the development stage since 1989--nuclear safety rules for research reactors and many others--will not come out any time soon. The explanation is simple: The Kurchatov Institute is the leading scientific organization with respect to almost all Russian research reactors, and it is apparently not in its interests to introduce stricter safety regulations. This will require considerable financial investment and bringing the system to the required level or shutting it down. The shortcoming and problems I have enumerated involve the activities of only one agency--the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, as well as of the structures it has set up. But even in the new political environment the methods Minatom utilizes for solving its problems remain the same old ones. As in the past, the atomic industry is trying to "twist the government's arm." Otherwise how can one explain the clamor recently raised by this agency in the press? (A good dozen newspapers published the outcry that nuclear stations are running out of fuel during the peak period of fall-winter demand, and soon nearly half of Russia will be without heat and light unless a number of decisive steps are immediately taken.) But the answer to this question is not that complicated: Having bungled things up once again, Minister V. Mikhaylov is trying to cover it up by grabbing a juicier chunk of state subsidies. It is no secret to anyone that both enterprises producing nuclear fuel and nuclear power stations are under the roof of one and the same agency, and therefore what we have is obviously an elementary miscalculation. Neither does Minatom's panicky tone fit with the recently signed agreement to sell nuclear fuel to the United States. If we cannot provide for ourselves, how can we talk about selling it to other countries? Nothing will change unless in the nearest future a package of legislative acts is adopted on the use of nuclear power generation, and a state safety program is drafted and backed up by priority financing. Without this first step, nothing will change. And who knows, perhaps in just another 10 years Russia will turn into a huge Chernobyl zone.
