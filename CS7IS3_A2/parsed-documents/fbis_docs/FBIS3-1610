The country's inflation rate climbed to 13 percent nationwide last year. When the central government unveiled its fiscal reforms and unified the exchange rate at the start of 1994, it declared war against inflation by repeated pledges of tighter control on credit and money supply as well as on investment in fixed assets. The question is, however, will China's battle against inflation be successful? The inflationary pressure is obvious with last year's 1,300 billion yuan spent on fixed assets, excessive money supply over the past few years and the bigger-than-ever stride in price reforms in 1993. Meanwhile, higher production costs will force some enterprises to raise the prices of their products in order to maintain a balanced book. A vicious cycle is thus set. The biggest pressure comes from local enthusiasms to start more construction projects, and with last year's projects to be continued and new ones started, the central bank faces mounting pressure to issue more money. But this year the central government indicates a strong determination to fight against inflation. It must do so because it wants the economic boom to continue. It also needs a good economic and social environment to push ahead reforms in other fields, including state enterprises, investment system as well as finance. Therefore, the central authorities target this year's growth at around 9 percent, hoping to achieve a "soft landing" of some kind. Meanwhile, the central bank has repeatedly vowed to keep a tighter rein on credit and money supply in the new year. According to central bank sources, the total money supply for 1994 will not exceed last year's level; the increase in bank lending will be kept on a par with that of last year, which means a reduced rate of credit increase. Recently, a senior official of the central bank disclosed that the central bank had no intention of making changes in interest rates in the foreseeable future. After two rises in 1993, the interest rate for one-year deposits stands at a relatively high level of 10.8 percent. A month earlier, the State Council issued a circular, demanding a strict grip on fixed asset investment. It stressed that the government would, in principle, not allow new construction projects to start this year. Coupled with the State Council's move, the central bank has worked out a set of rules for banks across the country to follow, which feature tougher conditions for extending loans for fixed assets investment. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also the central bank governor, told the banks not to provide loans to unauthorized projects, while the credit quotas must not exceed the planned figure. To reach an understanding between the central government and different areas, "keeping the general balance in demand and supply while maintaining a relatively high growth" is expected to become one of the main points of discussion during the National People's Congress due to open on March 10. This year, the government will limit bond issuing by localities and enterprises. The securities authorities have also banned enterprises from issuing shares to their employees. Therefore, all fund-raising activities will become more difficult in 1994. As part of reform efforts, starting this year, the state treasury deficits can only be made up by issuing state bonds, instead of overdrafts from the central bank; the establishment of policy-oriented banks will leave little ground for the specialized banks to ask for more money supply under the excuse of extending loans to state designated projects. Both these measures will help reduce the central bank's money supply. Observers here say that in building up a market economy, the top leadership is assuming a stronger macro-regulatory role in fine-tuning the economy. The successes of last year's macro-economic control and the prompt intervention of the central government in stabilizing grain prices in December proved that the authorities have the will and the means to keep the economic development on a right track. Most economists in Beijing expect that the momentum of price increases will be gradually reduced when the state anti-inflation measures are implemented. Hyper-inflation can be avoided if agriculture enjoys another bumper harvest this year and there is no sharp fluctuation in the renminbi exchange rate, economists agree. "The central government's anti-inflation efforts will have paid off if the year-round inflation rate can be contained within 12 percent in 1994," analysts said.
