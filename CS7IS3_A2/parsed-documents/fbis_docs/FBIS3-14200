The conferees discussed topics related to developing and strengthening industrial cooperation between the two countries, and drafting the necessary decisions and recommendations that will then be referred to the Joint Industrial Committee. [passage omitted] In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, Nasri Khuri said: Today's meeting of the technical subcommittees is one of a series of meetings and contacts that these committees are holding to form the framework of cooperation and coordination between the two fraternal countries under the provisions of the Treaty of Fraternity and Coordination and on the basis of the agreements signed and ratified in accordance with the constitutional procedures in both countries. Several committees were formed under the provisions of the Economic and Social Cooperation Agreement. These committees are: The "Joint Industrial Committee," which in turn has formed five technical subcommittees, which are holding their meeting today; the "Joint Agricultural Committee," which held its meeting earlier and agreed to establish a subcommittee for marketing agricultural products, and which will hold its second meeting on Saturday; the "Joint Electricity Committee," which is scheduled to meet today, Sunday 13 February; the "Joint Water Committee," which is discussing several matters relating to joint waters and which has already held two meetings; the "Joint Health Committee" and the "Joint Transport Committee," which also held their meetings. The Joint Economic Committee, which has prepared a general idea of how to implement the Economic and Social Cooperation Agreement, will hold its meeting in the middle of next month. There is also a "Joint Tourism Committee," a "Communications Committee," a "Committee for Facilitating Border Procedures," and a "Committee for facilitating Bases for Certificate of Origin." We are now in the process of forming a "Joint Committee for Labor and Social Affairs" and a permanent committee for planning. All these committees are operating under the supervision of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council and they submit their results to the Economic and Social Cooperation Agreement committee, which consists of all the competent and concerned ministers from both sides in the two fraternal countries, in order to make the necessary decisions on them prior to submitting then to the Followup and Coordination Commission. We must point out here that within the framework of the Treaty of Cooperation and Coordination between the fraternal countries there is a "Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs," and a "Joint Committee for Defense and Security." This is in addition to the "Economic and Social Committee." These specialized committees, which are stipulated in the treaty, will begin holding their meetings in a periodic and organized manner in the near future in order to put the provisions of the cooperation and coordination agreement into practice and actual implementation.
