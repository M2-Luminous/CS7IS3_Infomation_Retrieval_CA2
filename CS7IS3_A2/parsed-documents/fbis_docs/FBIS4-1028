FBIS4-1028 "drafr075_c_94037" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA MK Commander Criticizes Delay in Forming New Army MK Commander Criticizes Delay in Forming New Army MB1704182794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1612 GMT 17 Apr 94 MB1704182794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Bloemfontein April 17 SAPA -- Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; MK] Commander Joe Modise on Sunday [17 April] accused the SA [South African] Defence Force [SADF] of "dragging its feet" over the integration of various armed formations into an army for the future. He said he suspected the SADF had its own agenda and wanted to delay the integration process in the hope it could stay in command and determine who joined a new national defence force. "This we will not allow. We are very worried about it...but we are going to ensure that integration takes its course once a new government comes in." The SADF had in the past had facilities for an intake of up to 20,000 new recruits, but had now reluctantly identified three of its bases where MK members could assemble. "We have had to drag this information out of them," he said, adding that allegations of stalling the integration process were being raised with the defence force leadership. Mr Modise, who has commanded MK since 1965 and is now a candidate on the ANC's national list, said he was resigning from the military. "I think it is time for me to rest and give a chance for younger people." He hinted that he may get involved in the proposed vocational training schools which the ANC hopes will absorb the thousands of unemployed and militant youths who lack education. He said he thought the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] was capable of the task assigned to them, but wished they could have had more training. The NPKF was, however, better than the police's Internal Stability Division, he said.
