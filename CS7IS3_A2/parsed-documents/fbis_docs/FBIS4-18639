"I am not willing to bow to the terror of any group in the streets of Germany," Kohl said in an interview at his vacation resort in Bad Hofgastein, Austria, which was prereleased on Thursday [7 April]. He added that if, in this case, it is the Kurds "who came to us with Turkish passports," they must be aware of the consequences. However, deportations may be carried out only to those countries where it is clearly obvious that "the necessary points have been ensured from the viewpoint of human rights." Asked about the reservations by FRG Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic Party of Germany) against the deportation of Kurds to Turkey, Kohl reportedly reacted with clear annoyance. "She does not represent in any way the opinion of the Federal Government in this matter, not to mention my own." Furthermore, it is not clear at all whether the minister's statements correspond to the opinion of the Free Democratic Party of Germany.
