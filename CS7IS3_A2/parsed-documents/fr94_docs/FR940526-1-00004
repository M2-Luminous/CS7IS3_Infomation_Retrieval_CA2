FR940526-1-00004 FR940526-1-00002 The FAA estimates that 5,000 aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1.5 work hours to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $298 per transponder. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposal on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,902,500. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Terra Corporation: Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;03&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model TRT 250 transponders, part number (P/N) 0900&hyph;0250&hyph;00, with serial numbers (S/N) 4194 and below, Modification Level (Mod Leval) 4 and below; 3-inch ATI-mounted TRT 250 push-button transponders, P/N 0900&hyph;0250&hyph;20, with S/N 5324 and below, Mod Levels 4 and below; and, TRT 250 D digital display transponders, P/N 0900&hyph;0250&hyph;30, with S/N 1155 and below, Mod Level 1 and below (transponder). Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the transponder to respond properly to Mode S interrogations from Mode S ground stations and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II airborne equipment, which could result in loss of airspace separation, accomplish the following: (a) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, remove the TRT 250 series transponder in accordance with the procedures stated in the Accomplishment Section of Terra Corporation Mandatory Service Bulletin No. SB&hyph;104 (SB&hyph;104), dated March 14, 1994, and determine the part number (P/N), serial number (S/N), and modification level (Mod Level). (b) If the determination made in paragraph (a) reveals one of the affected part numbers, serial numbers, and modification levels indicated in this AD, replace the affected transponder with: (1) A Terra Corporation transponder that has modified in accordance with the provisions of SB&hyph;104, dated March 14, 1994; (2) An unaffected Terra Corporation transponder; or, (3) Another manufacturer's transponder that responds properly to Mode S interrogations from both an ATCRBS/Mode S ground station and TCAS II airborne equipment. (c) If installing a replacement Terra Corporation transponder that has been modified in accordance with the provisions of SB&hyph;104, dated March 14, 1994, perform a ramp test in accordance with the Testing section of SB&hyph;104, dated March 14, 1994. Conduct the tests and checks required by ยง91.413 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.413) prior to approving the aircraft for return to service. (d) Installation of an affected Terra Corporation transponder modified and tested in accordance with SB&hyph;104, dated March 14, 1994, or another transponder that responds properly to Mode S interrogations from both an ATCRBS/Mode S ground station and TCAS II airborne equipment constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Airplane Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Airplane Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Airplance Certification Office. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on May 18, 1994. Eric Bries, Acting Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
