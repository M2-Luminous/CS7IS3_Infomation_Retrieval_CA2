Turkey has been the host country to the force with "certain misgivings." Many hawks in the military hierarchy have claimed the force has contributed to the strengthening of the clandestine Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in northern Iraq. They say the PKK has effectively used the safe haven in northern Iraq to train the terrorists who have wreaked havoc in southeastern Turkey. We hear that some people in the government are inclined to use the extension of the mandate of "Provide Comfort" as a bargaining chip against the American move to link U.S. aid to Turkey with human rights and the Cyprus question. At first the claims surfaced when the final communique after Saturday's [28 May] National Security Council failed to mention that the council has recommended to the government the extension of the mandate of the force for another six months. The mandate of the force ends at the close of this month and the Turkish Parliament has to vote on it before June 29 if the force is to stay on in Turkey. The next meeting of the council will not take place before the Parliament is required to act on the extension. So the possibility emerged that, because the final communique did not mention the matter, the "extension" of Provide Comfort could be in jeopardy.... The government gave out confused signals which did not help. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin ruled out any "blackmail" concerning "Provide Comfort," while Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin said Washington should draw the appropriate conclusions from the fact that the National Security Council did not mention the extension of "Provide Comfort"... The TURKISH DAILY NEWS later learnt that the council did discuss "Provide Comfort" and probably gave the go-ahead to the extension without publicly announcing it, just to give Washington the jitters. So all this business of "defying" Washington and telling it to take its "Provide Comfort" force out of Turkey is just empty talk. Turkey is in no position to use "Provide Comfort" as a trump card, especially when the allies could move the force to southern Cyprus and deny us a very important leverage on northern Iraq and the Iraqi Kurds.
