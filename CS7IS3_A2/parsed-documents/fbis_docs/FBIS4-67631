Ignorance of the condition, which affects 350,000 Britons, is widespread among GP's, who ignore sufferers or refer them to hospital. Nearly 100,000 people suffer seizures at least once a month but half could be eliminated with the right treatment, Dr Tim Betts, consultant neuropsychiatrist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, said. Launching a survey of public attitudes to epilepsy, Dr Betts said sufferers were still stigmatised as unstable. One in four of the 1,000 respondents said they would not feel comfortable about letting their child play with a child who had epilepsy. Seizures can affect a sufferer's job prospects, relationships and quality of life. In 80 per cent of sufferers the condition is fully controlled with drugs or surgery but they are still barred from jobs in the police or armed services and may have difficulty following other careers such as primary school teaching. One in 200 of those who continue to have seizures die each year in accidents, by suicide or directly as a result of their condition. Suicide is five times more common among epilepsy sufferers. "Whole areas of the country have no epilepsy service at all," Dr Stephen Brown, chairman of the Epilepsy Task Force, said.
