First to address the Assembly was Dervis Eroglu, leader of the main opposition National Unity Party [NUP], who described the government program as a flippant and inconsistent list of promises without an overall philosophy. This is not a program that can serve the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] or the Turkish Cypriot people, he charged, or that can defend or advance the national cause in line with national interests. He added: This program is not unified. It is full of inconsistencies; it does not have political vision; it does not foresee to uphold or to promote the TRNC. It is bound to fail. It prefers propaganda to the implementation of policies. The NUP leader alleged that the program will create problems in the country, will bring confusion, and will help to destroy the state mechanism. We will vote against this program, he said, which does not protect the national interests of the TRNC or of Turkey. Eroglu went on to say that it is not yet clear what kind of a foreign policy the government will pursue. He alleged that the coalition wants to pursue a daily foreign policy that it will make up as it goes along. He noted out that the points made in the government program are completely contrary to the inalienable and basic principle on which the TRNC is founded. He charged that the program does not foresee keeping the TRNC alive. He said the program gives the green light to a unitary state. Referring to the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements, he said, the government program ignores the developments that have taken place up to now and thus denies the rights gained so far. The government is trying to make the press dependent on the state, he said, and we view with suspicion the promise that Bayrak Radio and Television will be granted autonomy. The NUP leader pointed out that the promises made to civil servants during the election campaign are not to be seen in the government program. He charged that the government's economic program will only bring new problems. Instead of developing a free market economy, he said, the government is tying the economy to the state again. We are pessimistic about the future of the economy, he said. Eroglu stated that while the coalition cooperation protocol had said the state revenues and expenditures would be indexed to foreign exchange rates, the government program takes a step back from this principle. He added that the election promise of reducing the duration of military service is also omitted in the government program. Addressing the Assembly on behalf of the Communal Liberation Party [CLP], party leader Mustafa Akinci described the government program as abstract, unclear, and indecisive. He charged that the specific promises made during the election campaign were diluted in the government protocol and become completely unrecognizable in the government program. [passage omitted] Akinci said: Even though the Cyprus problem is the most important problem, it seems that enough time was not allotted to that issue during the efforts to establish the government. Akinci pointed out that the confidence-building measures are not mentioned in the program. On the other hand, he stressed, the Greek Cypriot administration started extensive work on this issue. The CLP leader said the program has nothing on the issue of a federation or a confederation, and is inconsistent on the territorial issues. The government must determine its Cyprus policy before the vote of confidence, he added. Akinci said the government program does not mention the issue of how to promote the TRNC in the world, or what the government's views are on the issue of European unity. [passage omitted] The CLP leader concluded by saying that it is impossible for his party to vote in favor of this indecisive program.
