Rabin noted that the United States believed that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was showing signs of moderation and moving closer toward Israel's interpretation of peace. Yet Syria had not changed its position one iota on the price Israel would have to pay in exchange for a peace agreement. The Syrians were demanding a full withdrawal and as far as Damascus was concerned this was non-negotiable. As for the negotiations with the PLO, Mr. Rabin explained that the PLO had made several attempts to back out of certain issues, mainly in the field of security, that had already been agreed upon in the Declaration of Principles. However, in Rabin's assessment, the Palestinians had realized that Israel was adamant in its position regarding internal and external security. Therefore, Rabin said, one could say that a certain degree of progress had been made recently. Moving on to the issue of the border crossings, Rabin said that Israel insisted on having the right to examine every person crossing the border in what he called a sterile room, manned exclusively by Israelis. There would be a Palestinian presence at the border terminal, but Israel would be responsible for the passageway between the bridge and the border terminals. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Prime Minister Rabin was speaking at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
