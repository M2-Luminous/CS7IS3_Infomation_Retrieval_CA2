In a statement to AL-HAYAH Durdah saluted "the Egyptian brothers for their awareness of the conspiracy." He pointed out that the economic effects of the Lockerbie crisis has paralyzed Libya's ability to meet spending requirements in all spheres, especially with regard to new development projects and securing foreign currency to finance imports. He pointed out that exporting states are setting the condition that Libya pay the financial credits for imports in full. He said that even the budgets of the biggest and richest states cannot do that. On Libya's cooperation with Egypt and Tunis, he said that "European states took accounts of their interests when they adopted the resolutions against Libya. But some Arab brothers -- either because they did not directly read the text of the Security Council resolution or because of the influence of Western media services -- did not understand the resolution the way the Western states concerned with the crisis did." He declined to name these states. On the reduction in the volume of Egyptian-Libyan trade after Mansur al-Kikhya's disappearance, he said: "There is no link between trade and al-Kikhya's disappearance. Libya has lost billions of dollars as a result of the freezing of its assets abroad. And Libya has taken a number of measures" -- he declined to reveal them -- "to secure the largest amount possible of these investments, especially liquid investment or those that are easy to liquefy." On the measures Libya is going to take to reduce workers, Durdah said: "Necessity knows no laws." Libya is preparing steps in this connection, but it will not touch Egyptian and Tunisian workers in particular.
