However, let us look at the issue in a different way: Does the Ministry possess the rights and powers enabling it to have a real influence upon the processes taking place in the branch. In this regard, Georgiy Kvesitadze, minister of the agriculture and processing industry, and member of the republic's Academy of Sciences, answered questions put to him by a SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA correspondent. [Amiredzhibi] Many people are interested to know: Is a structural reorganization of the management of the branch underway? [Kvesitadze] Yes. However, it is proceeding slowly. Administrative mechanisms are not functioning in the current situation as, to all intents and purposes, there is no market economy in the country. Nevertheless, work is proceeding on the creation and improvement of the structure of management of the branch in new economic conditions; first and foremost, within the framework of the European Union [EU] project. This concerns the elaboration of an organizational structure for managing the branch and mechanisms for serving agricultural enterprises, so-called agro-service. Priorities have already been determined for developing subbranches of the country's agro-industrial complex. Incidentally, a strategy for the production of agricultural products in the Republic is being elaborated together with a group of EU experts and the Ministry and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences. [Amiredzhibi] Can one speak about any proper cadres policy in the branch today? [Kvesitadze] Of course. Work is proceeding according to a specially elaborated program. The heads of agro-industrial departments and the managers of more than 50 enterprises and organizations, and so forth have been replaced in more than 20 rayons. In order to train, retrain, and improve the qualifications of cadres in the agro-industrial complex, there exists within the Ministry the Higher School for the Management of the Agro-Industrial Complex and the Institute for Improving the Qualifications of Cadres in the Food Industry, 16 specialized technical schools, 14 inter-rayon training centers, and seven permanent training courses with a fairly strong material and technical training base. New forms of training are being introduced. The first stage involves the training of qualified workers; the second -- the training of mid-level specialists who will receive a bachelor's degree. A third stage is also being planned, which will involve the training of higher-level specialists who will be awarded a master's degree. With this aim, the majority of specialized technical schools within our system have been reorganized into agricultural colleges offering various specializations. Instruction in many new specializations has started. Life convinces us that the branch badly needs new types of cadres, particularly in such spheres as the organization and management of the economy, modernization and automation, the market economy, the mastering of new conditions for science, and so forth. In this respect, a system for improving the qualifications of production managers and other specialists is being established. [Amiredzhibi] What is the situation regarding privatization and joint-stock companies in the branch? [Kvesitadze] At the moment, these processes are progressing slowly. Given the sharp reduction in land set aside for agricultural enterprises, there are very many premises, vehicles, agricultural equipment, and other assets that are not being used and standing idle. These are the ones that need to be privatized first so that agricultural production can get underway, but this should now be in the hands of peasant holdings, farms, and other private entrepreneurs. One has to say that the process has become quite complicated regarding the privatization of buildings and installations not being used on state farms, for example, livestock departments and other facilities. The whole point is that they can be privatized only by a decree issued by the Cabinet of Ministers. There are thousands of such facilities. I believe that it is wholly sufficient to obtain permission from our ministry whereas rayon bodies dealing with the management of state property can attend to the proper course of the privatization process. Let me say a few words about the privatization of agricultural machinery. We believe that there should be some delay before tackling this issue. We propose the following solution: It is expedient to form, on the basis of agricultural equipment that has been made available following the reorganization of state and collective farms, subdivisions of the agro-service that will also serve the small farms and other holdings that are being created. Of course, this does not exclude another solution: Individual farms will be given the opportunity to acquire machinery as private property. It is possible for a state farm to be privatized and taken over by its collective as a whole. This is already happening, for example, in Dushetskiy rayon. There is a different approach to the privatization of enterprises in the food and processing industry. Here, it is expedient to form joint-stock companies. For example, the "Tbilmargarinprom" production association, the commercial and industrial firm "Kristall," and enterprises in Tbilisi -- the "Kartli" tobacco factory and a dairy -- have already been turned into joint-stock companies. A list of enterprises has been drawn up, 51 percent of whose shares will belong to the state once they become joint-stock companies. Preparatory work has already been completed at many enterprises due to be transformed into joint-stock companies. However, there are enterprises whose production is of strategic importance for the Republic, namely alcoholic drinks, tea, and tobacco. The issue here is clear cut: It is necessary for the state to have a temporary monopoly on this production; this means that the privatization of these type of enterprises, as yet, does not correspond to the general interests of the state. One more thing has to be said. Privatization in this branch is, in many respects, of a spontaneous nature. Facilities are being redeemed on the basis of leasing agreements that were concluded previously, that is to say, assets are not being revalued taking into account inflation and enterprises are being bought for a song. Such facts have come to light through the work of the Commission for the Privatization of State Property that has been created in the ministry. State property should be redeemed without fail according to its value at the moment of the transaction. [Amiredzhibi] Are there any violations and abuses on the part of local authorities in the privatization process? [Kvesitadze] There are very many, particularly when it is a matter of the privatization of land. Thus, as a result of incompetent and unscrupulous work by local land-privatization commissions, there are facts of land being taken that has not been included in the land reform program. As a result, several seed farms have ceased to exist. In a number of livestock-breeding complexes, not even the minimum amount of land has remained for the production of feed. We are somehow trying to correct the mistakes made. In this regard, on the initiative of the Ministry, the Republic's government adopted a decree in 1992 in accordance with which it is prohibited to include in the land reform program that land on which scientific and educational institutions, experimental centers, nurseries, pedigree stock farms, and also livestock-breeding complexes and hothouses are located. [Amiredzhibi] It is well known that the agrarian sector is receiving greater attention from the criminal world, if only on account of the fact that goods are nevertheless being produced there. Are any attempts being made by the Ministry -- of course, with the help of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other corresponding ministries and departments -- to weaken the pressure being applied by criminal groups and with what effect? [Kvesitadze] Mismanagement, misappropriation, the unlawful use of state property, unproductive expenditures, and so forth -- all these phenomena have always been an integral part, so to say, of the socialist method of economic management and have done enormous damage to the state and society. In the current conditions of economic decline, the intensification of crime, legal nihilism, the incompetent actions of local authorities, and the extremely slow pace of the formation of new economic relations, all these phenomena have acquired a truly universal character. Numerous economic and financial violations and criminal actions have been exposed during the second half of 1993 by our departmental control alone. A halt has been put to many of these. The illegal expenditure and facts of embezzlement and misappropriation that have been exposed amount in total to over 730 million rubles. In the course of checks carried out, more than 120 million rubles have been recovered. Thirteen cases have been lodged with bodies in the Procurator's Office. An analysis of these statistics confirms once more the disorder in the economic mechanism in rural areas and the irresponsibility of many workers. If, in previous years, violators used methods of direct embezzlement and illegal expenditure in their encroachments upon state property, these have been supplemented recently by violations of existing leasing rules. Taking advantage of the lack of a firm legislative base, in particular, regarding questions of privatization, many have misappropriated state property for next to nothing. Gross violations of leasing rules in cases of redemption and incorrect settlements have deprived the state budget of approximately 600 million rubles. Countering this anarchy is difficult, but not impossible. We are strengthening departmental control and establishing close contacts with the Chamber of Control and the republic's law enforcement bodies for we realize that, only by uniting our efforts, will it be possible to bring about some kind of changes to the situation that has taken shape.
