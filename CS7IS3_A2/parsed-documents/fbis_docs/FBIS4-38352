He added, however, that Ukraine was the sole country in the world that was gradually becoming nuclear-free. Moroz said that Ukraine could not make this step all at once, no matter what kind of pressure was brought to bear on it. In his view, the West had to meet Ukraine half-way. The Western countries had to understand that investing in Ukrainian disarmament was not charity but payment for the security they enjoy as a result of Ukraine's moves. Moroz admitted that he had once regarded the Black Sea Fleet as an element of collective defense forces. But now it was time to become aware of the fact that Ukraine and Russia had different interests in the Black Sea, meaning two friendly navies had to be set up. He said that he would work for closer relations with Russia but thought that Ukraine's rejoining the ruble zone would do no good either to Ukraine or Russia.
