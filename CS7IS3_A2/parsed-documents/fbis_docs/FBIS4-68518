However, events this past week that became known just yesterday, since they were not advertised by the company, indicate that Westinghouse has revised its attitude toward Russia. The company took its first steps in the Russian market with truly American sweep, concluding two major agreements at once. The firm signed a memorandum on the principles of cooperation with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and an agreement on its participation in an international consortium established to carry out a project for the modernization by 2005 of the unified air traffic control system in Russia. The project's approximate cost is $5 billion. Many foreign aircraft companies have not yet made up their minds to begin active business in Russia, since they consider flights on Russian airlines to be less than safe. According to official statistics, the level of safety on Russian airlines is three times lower than in the United States and two times lower than in West European countries. The level of training of air traffic controllers and the equipment with which they work do not meet world standards. In addition, international airlines are overloaded beyond permissible norms. Because of all these problems, not only do passengers suffer every possible inconvenience and discomfort, but the state budget loses foreign exchange that it might earn from foreign airlines whose planes flew over Russia's territory. Last April the Russian government passed a decree "On the Modernization of the Unified Air Traffic Control System in Russia" (and that was when the first negotiations with Westinghouse began). The decree provides for the establishment of an international consortium with the participation of leading Western companies that have experience in organizing air traffic control. At that time the Russian-Italian Buran Joint Venture established by the State Scientific Research Institute for Air Navigation, the Proton Research and Production Association, the All-Russian Research Institute of Radio Automation Equipment and the Italian Aleniy company was working in a similar area, but on a smaller scale. Buran's experience was taken advantage of, and an international consortium is presently being established (its name has not yet been determined) that will include, in addition to Aleniy, Westinghouse, The French Tomson-CSF company and the recently established Russian Scientific and Technical Center for Air Traffic Control--as the general contractor on the Russian side. Negotiations are continuing with a number of other large foreign companies. As the center's director Sergey Novikov indicated, "the road to the consortium has not been closed to new investors." According to Mr. Novak, the ultimate value of the project will be determined in April, after the pertinent federal program has been adopted. The Russian side's share in the consortium will be 51 percent. Until the federal program is adopted, the amount of foreign investments in the large-scale project is not being made public. However, there is no doubt that it will come to hundreds of millions of dollars. When it makes its contribution, the Westinghouse corporation will immediately become one of the Western electronic companies--such as ABB or Siemens--that have invested sizeable funds in Russia. According to REUTERS, Westinghouse President Gary clark is also counting on the company's playing a substantial role in modernizing vitally important sectors of the Russian economy. Mr. Clark expressed the desire not only to help Russians realize their dreams for "normal flights," but also to take part in modernizing Russian nuclear-power enterprises. As a KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at the Ministry of Atomic Energy, for a long time this agency was unable to find a common language with Westinghouse: "It seems that the company had little interest in Russia." However, in this area, too, things have started moving--at any rate, a memorandum on principles of cooperation has already been signed.
