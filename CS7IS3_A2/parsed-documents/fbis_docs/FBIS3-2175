In 1992, China and Japan marked the 20th anniversary of the normalization of relations between the two countries. General Secretary Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan and His Majesty the Japanese Emperor and Her Majesty the Japanese Empress' visit to China in the same year indicated that Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's current visit to Japan is another major event in Sino-Japanese relations since 1992. His visit attracted world wide media attention, was completely successful, and will have a far-reaching effect on future Sino-Japanese good neighborly and friendly relations, especially on the development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. Sino-Japanese Cooperation Is the Trend of the Times Wherever they went, Vice Premier Zhu and his party were warmly welcomed by personalities of the Japanese Government and people from all circles. His visit created a series of climaxes and many touching scenes. During his visit, Vice Premier Zhu met with the Japanese Emperor and held important talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Foreign Minister Hata, and other major members of the Japanese Cabinet. Their talks were conducted in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere and the two sides had identical views on many important issues. Vice Premier Zhu also had very wide contacts with people from various circles of Japan, especially people from Japan's economic circles. According to incomplete statistics, during his more than 30 meetings in various forms with people from Japan's economic circles, more than 260 well-known Japanese entrepreneurs and bankers directly conversed with Vice Premier Zhu, and over 1,400 people from Japan's economic circles attended his speech sessions. The heads of all major economic organizations in Tokyo and the Kansai and Kyushyu areas, including the major leaders of Japan's six largest enterprise groups -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Sanwa, and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Banking -- exchanged views and had discussions with Vice Premier Zhu on the exchanges, cooperation, and other issues between China and Japan. They expressed great enthusiasm in further developing the economic, trade, scientific, and technological cooperation between the two countries. From Vice Premier Zhu's current visit to Japan we can see that the world, especially Japan, is trying to reunderstand China -- a "Chinese fever" of being willing to broaden the scope of cooperation with China has surfaced in Japan. The surfacing of this fever is not an accident but a product of the combination of the evolution of international relations after the Cold War, the change in Japan's domestic situation, and China's dynamic economic development. Following the end of the Cold War, international relations, especially relations between big countries, are undergoing an in-depth readjustment, and giving priority to the economy has become an important factor for guiding state to state relations. Since the world entered the 1990's, the economies of the West have been widely in recession and economic friction between the United States, Japan, and Europe has intensified. The United States and Europe have jointly applied pressure on Japan, demanding that Japan open up its market, increase its domestic demand and imports, and reduce its trade surplus. Over the decades after WWII, based on the principle of "founding the nation on trade," Japan has established an export-oriented economic structure. Its foreign trade surplus exceeded $140 billion last year. The situation facing Japan this year is: the increased external pressure; the domestic economic decline, which has lasted 35 months; Japanese products have been less competitive in the international market due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen and therefore, readjusting its industrial structure has become a pressing task. An increasing number of people of insight from Japan's economic circles have realized that developing Sino-Japanese economic, trade, scientific, and technological cooperation, and undergoing industrial restructuring are one of the important ways to free Japan from its economic predicament. Explain Away the Doubts and Misgivings to Enhance Confidence While Japan's economic circles hold favorable views on China's economy, some people have common doubts and misgivings -- such as: what if China's inflation gets out of control, resulting in social turbulences; what if reform encroaches on foreign investors' interests in China; what if the system of separating local tax revenues from those of the central government intensiflies the contradictions between the central authorities and local authorities; and can China's economy continue to develop rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner. In one word, will China's reform succeed? Vice Premier Zhu gave pointed and unequivocal answers to aforementioned questions on various occasions. Vice Premier Zhu said: Our reform was initiated based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; under the direct leadership of President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng; and after in-depth deliberation and repeated discussions pooling the wisdom of the whole party and nation and making use of the experiences of developed countries, including Japan. China's major measures for market economic reform have been instituted since 1 January this year. It is unprecedented to institute comprehensive and mutually supplemental financial, taxation, foreign exchange, investment, and enterprise reforms in a country with a population of nearly 1.2 billion; you can imagine the complexity and arduousness of this work. In Japan, it took 10 years to institute the consumption tax system alone; three Cabinets changed hands during this period. However, in China, major reform measures have been carried out smoothly in the past 50 days and more; there have not been any major problems -- the market has been stable, social stability has been maintained, and the public has been assured. The central government's financial revenues and the country's foreign exchange reserve have been on the increase. All these indicate the Chinese Party and Government's prestige, courage, resourcefulness, and ability. We are determined to carry through to the end the reform of building a socialist market economic system. China's reform will triumph! While speaking on the current hot issue that has drawn international attention -- China's inflation problem -- Vice Premier Zhu said: Hong Kong's inflation is still at 9 percent. Mainland China's inflation is not as serious as people have thought. From 1990 to 1992, China's inflation had been maintained at one digit, and it was 13 percent last year, which was a little too high. The main reason was that the price reform lifted the control over the prices of some capital goods that were originally under planned economic control and whose prices were too low. Excessive increase in the scale of capital construction also contributed to the increase of capital goods prices. We have taken measures to control the scale of the capital construction and have appropriately controlled the monetary supply. However, because more price reform measures will be instituted this year, this year's inflation will still be at about 10 percent. But we have the confidence to gradually lower it to one digit next year. Chinese workers' income increased 25 percent last year; taking the inflation into account, people's living standards still continued to improve and Chinese society is stable. Vice Premier Zhu continued: This year is crucial to China's economic reform. Major reform measures will be launched, investigations and studies will be conducted in the course of practice, and these measures will be adjusted and improved. Next year the country will further adapt to the new situation of reform, and the year after next, China's economy will begin to enter the normal market economic course. He predicted that China's economy will continue to develop rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner over a fairly long period ahead and its annual economic growth will be maintained at 8-9 percent. Vice Premier Zhu stressed on many occasions in Japan: Success in China's economic reform will create more favorable conditions for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and will contribute to both countries' economic rejuvenation and prosperity. In carrying out its economic reform, China has always paid attention to protecting the interests of foreign investors, including Japanese investors, in China. Vice Premier Zhu's candid, realistic, and convincing remarks and answers have to a large extent removed Japan's economic circles' doubts and misgivings about China and have enhanced their confidence in China's economic reform. After meeting with Vice Premier Zhu or after hearing his speeches, many people from Japan's economic circles said they believed China's economic reform definitely will succeed, adding that Japan's economic circles can feel relieved and should not hesitate to develop economic, trade, and technological cooperation with China. Fumio Sakurauchi, former speaker of Japan's Lower House and chairman of the Japan Trade Promotion Council, said the news Vice Premier Zhu brought was encouraging and was being spread around Japan. There Is Much To Be Achieved if We Seize the Opportunity In conversations with people from the Japanese business community, Vice Premier Zhu pointed out that the Chinese and Japanese economies are mutually complementary and both sides can make up each other's deficiencies. The evolving situation is providing a historic opportunity for mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. The fast growing Chinese economy needs Japan's capital and technology while Japan, which is undergoing the most profound post-war industrial restructuring, needs China's market, low-cost, high-quality labor forces, and abundant resources. Seizing the opportunity is a major challenge of profound significance facing both China and Japan. Many people are aware of the opportunity; many in the Japanese business community have one question or another on whether and how they can utilize this opportunity. Some people are worried that industrial readjustment and the shift of some manufacturing to China will result in the "hollowing out" of Japan, disrupting Japan's employment and stability. Vice Premier Zhu hit the nail right on the head when he pointed out: Japan is reaping a trade surplus of over $100 billion annually. This situation cannot be sustained for long. High labor costs have resulted in Japan's gradual loss of its competitiveness in traditional products. Japan will lag behind and find itself in trouble if it does not take timely action to readjust its industrial structure. Some mass media in the United States have criticized the "hollowing out" of Japan. As a matter of fact, many large U.S. corporations have already readjusted their production structure by shifting manufacturing to China and Southeast Asia. They provided training to the surplus work force and shifted them to industries that yield a higher added value. The end result of this is increased international competitiveness of U.S. products. This is also one of the reasons the U.S. economy is recovering faster than others. Many Japanese big corporations have adopted the same strategy with striking results. Some people are worried that technology transfers will help make China a competitor to Japan. Vice Premier Zhu: It's not true. Japan's principal way of transferring technology to China is joint production under the joint-venture format. Under such arrangements, China and Japan will become, instead of competitors, partners of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation working jointly in developing the international market. Many farsighted Japanese businessmen have already started doing so. Cooperation in the production of videotape recorders between China and Matsushita Electric Industrial Company serves as a model. Imports of Japan's technology accounted for 28 percent of China's total technology imports in 1993. Kazuhira Seki, president of the well-known Isuzu Motors, told Vice Premier Zhu that his company has seen an improvement in economic returns by transferring technology and undertaking joint production with China. Certainly, in the process of deepening Sino-Japanese cooperation, China and Japan will inevitably encounter some problems. Vice Premier Zhu believed that there are problems on the way to development. As China's reform moves forward with success, and so long as the two sides will -- on an equal and mutually beneficial footing -- display mutual understanding and accommodation and consult each other in a friendly way, problems can be solved without too much difficulty. During his visit, Vice Premier Zhu emphasized on more than one occasion: The respective characteristics of the Chinese and Japanese economies and the favorable temporal, geographical, human, political, economical, and other factors are closely binding our two countries together. Sino-Japanese cooperation is taking shape like an irresistible historical tide. There are very bright prospects for cooperation between the two countries. Trade between China and Japan in 1933 was worth $39 billion, a record high. Vice Premier Zhu said: This is not a small figure. However, when compared to the potential for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the figure is quite small. A figure ten times that would be about right. The day that this will be attained should not be far away and the two countries should make common efforts. These comments by Vice Premier Zhu were warmly received and struck a strong sympathetic chord in Japan's business community. As many friends in the Japanese business community told Vice Premier Zhu and his entourage, the business communities of China and Japan should join hands to seize the historic opportunity, utilize their potential, and pool their efforts in pioneering undertakings to jointly usher in a new era of Sino-Japanese relations centered on economic cooperation.
