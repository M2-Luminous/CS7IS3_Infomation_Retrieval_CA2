The EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] representative commented that so far there are "just pieces of paper" at the negotiating table. For that reason, he expressed his certainty that this phase will conclude without specific agreements. Those pieces of paper, he affirmed, do not yet give security or guarantees to Indians that they will live well or feed themselves. He said those points will have a bearing on the future of Mexico and noted the EZLN is not prepared to lay down its weapons, since it is certain that the pacification process in Chiapas is not simple. The signing of a peace accord, he added, will not be fast or easy to attain, and many days will pass in order to obtain satisfactory responses to the proposals by the EZLN General Command. During a private meeting with foreign correspondents, the subcommander felt all the demands on the list submitted to Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, can be resolved by the federal authorities with a total commitment and interest in improving the conditions in which Mexico's Indians live.
