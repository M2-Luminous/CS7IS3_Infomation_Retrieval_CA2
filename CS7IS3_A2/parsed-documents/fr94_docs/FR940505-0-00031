FR940505-0-00031 FR940505-0-00007 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 92&hyph;NM&hyph;157&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8893; AD 94&hyph;09&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland, Inc., Model DHC&hyph;7 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes, that requires a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance between various adapter plates and seal retaining angles on the fuselage side access panel, and modification of both the forward and rear seal retention angles. This amendment is prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in commuter-class airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. DATES: Effective June 6, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from de Havilland, Inc., Garratt Boulevard, Downsview, Ontario M3K 1Y5, Canada. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, room 202, Valley Stream, New York; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sol Maroof, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANE&hyph;172, FAA, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, room 202, Valley Stream, New York 11581; telephone (516) 791&hyph;6220; fax (516) 791&hyph;9024. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on January 4, 1994 (59 FR 266). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance between various adapter plates and seal retaining angles on the fuselage side access panel, and modification of both the forward and rear seal retention angles. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 44 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modifications and inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $19,360, or $440 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
