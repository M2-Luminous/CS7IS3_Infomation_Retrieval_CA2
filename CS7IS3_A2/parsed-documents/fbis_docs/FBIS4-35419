At his meeting with 'Abd al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Yemeni Presidential Council member, at his office in the Prime Ministry this morning, the prime minister also emphasized the noninterference of Jordan in the Yemeni internal affairs, and Jordan's support for a cease-fire and a halt to fighting. For his part, 'Abd-al-Ghani said in a statement to reporters that the meeting reviewed bilateral relations, the latest developments in the situation in the Republic of Yemen, and the visit he will make to the United States to attend the Security Council deliberations on the Yemeni crisis--a meeting called by certain countries. He added: We are always ready for dialogue and diplomatic efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis, and we are always ready to end fighting if the elements that created the situation return to constitutional legitimacy and retract the statement which sought--through armed rebellion--to separate parts of the Republic of Yemen formed on 22 May 1990, and blessed by all Yemeni people. He added: We believe that discussing the issue at international forums is interference in Yemeni affairs because what is taking place in the Yemeni arena is a purely internal Yemeni affair. He said: What is taking place is a rebellion carried out by some elements of the Socialist Party that forced the constitutional legitimacy to confront it in order to realize security and stability in the Republic of Yemen. Concerning the alternatives that may be proposed during the Security Council deliberations on this crisis, 'Abd-al-Ghani said the solution lies in resolving the issue in accordance with the constitutional legitimacy that resulted from the elections of March 1993, and--according to testimony of the whole world--were honest, and in which all eligible voters participated. He added: We ask all brothers and friends to deal with the Republic of Yemen in accordance with the principles of international law which respect the sovereignty of every country, and state that no country should interfere in the affairs of another. He emphasized that Yemeni unity is an accomplished fact supported by all Yemenis, and added that no one can return Yemen to the situation that prevailed before 22 May 1990. He also stressed that the danger posed by presenting the Yemeni issue [at the Security Council] is the interference in an internal Yemeni affair. It is a serious step to discuss a subject that concerns a sovereign state and member of all regional organizations and the United Nations and one which is committed to the UN Charter and regional and international charters. He added: We think that discussing any internal issue in any country is a dangerous precedent because doing so is not stipulated in the UN Charter, especially Article 2 of this charter. The meeting was attended by Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Yemeni ambassador in Amman. 'Abd-al-Ghani left Amman for New York today. He was seen off by the acting minister of state for foreign affairs and the Yemeni ambassador in Amman.
