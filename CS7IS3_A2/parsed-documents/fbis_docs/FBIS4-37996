Northern rocket and shell attacks stopped late Friday bringing an uneasy calm to the battered city after a day in which 14 civilians died and 42 were wounded, hospital officials said. But the brief lull in the north's siege ended when the northern suburb of Dar-Sa'd, close to the frontline, came under attack early Saturday. All 12 casualties came from the district, hospital officials said. One soldier was killed and seven others wounded in fighting at Bi'r Ahmad, about 15 kilometres (nine miles) northwest of Aden, where northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were reported to be advancing on Friday. They had taken the school in the middle of Bi'r Ahmad Friday after occupying the entrance to the village on Thursday. Southern reinforcements were sent Friday to Bi'r Ahmad to try to stop the northern advance which threatens to cut off Aden from its refinery at Little Aden, 15 kilometres (nine miles) away, and the power station at Hiswah, 10 kilometres (six miles) away. A southern military spokesman said in Aden late Friday that the north "was continuing its desperate attempt to advance on Aden," adding they had "suffered hundreds of dead and wounded and lost 12 assault tanks." UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali blamed the north on Friday for the bombing of Aden and called on Sanaa leaders to declare an immediate ceasefire. Southern leaders have said that 376 civilians have been killed in Aden and the surrounding area since June 11 and 861 wounded, in a toll obtained Friday by AFP. Fighting between Salih's men and those loyal to his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid broke out on May 5, ending a four year uneasy union between the former tribal, conservative North Yemen and the Marxist South.
