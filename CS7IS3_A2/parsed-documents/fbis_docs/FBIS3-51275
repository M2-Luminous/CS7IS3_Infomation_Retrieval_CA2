The new minister is the son of Jorge Cardenas, Colombian coffee czar, and he currently holds the post of manager of the Colombian State Energy Enterprise. This will be his second experience in the public sector, because previously he had dedicated himself exclusively to managing private sector companies. Cardenas must carry out an industrial reconversion process initiated by his predecessor. The process is aimed at boosting industry in the face of the economic opening implemented by Gaviria's government. The incumbent minister resigned to join the political campaign of Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana, who in early February will launch officially his presidential campaign.
