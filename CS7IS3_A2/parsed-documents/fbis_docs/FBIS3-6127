The dear comrade leader put forth modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea as a chuche-oriented Army founding program which the People's Army must adhere to.

Modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea is to arm all the soldiers under the great leader's revolutionary ideology to foster them to become a chuche-oriented revolutionary fighter and carry out the revolutionary armed force building and all military activities in accordance with the demand of the chuche idea. By presenting the outstanding strategic method of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea by the dear comrade leader, the road to highly uphold the leadership of the party and leader with loyalty and to guarantee to the end with force the chuche revolutionary cause have been clearly elucidated.

Therefore, a firm guiding principle was provided in carrying out the revolutionary armed force building and military activities in accordance with the demand of the chuche era. Also, it was possible for our revolutionary armed force to grow into an invincible rank that can defeat any kind of enemy and defend ever so strong the party, the leader, the fatherland, and revolution. Outstanding and tested leadership is one of the most important traits of a commander, and the commander's leadership can be said to determine the might of the revolutionary forces. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a military genius who has boundless military insights, limitless boldness, extensive military knowledge, and political insights. He is also a great commander who has an art of military operations with which he commands all Armed Forces of the country in a unified manner and makes them act like one. The dear comrade leader presented a clear struggle slogan that the revolutionary Armed Forces must adhere to as a motto and noble mission and has strengthened and developed the People's Army into a powerful chuche-oriented Army and invincible revolutionary Army. The dear comrade leader personally called in a People's Armed Forces Ministry official on 1 January 1976. With a serious look on his face, he told the official that we had many things to do in the new year and stressed that it is important to continuously and persistently carry out the work to build the party's unitary ideological system in the military. He also said: Your basic mission, comrades, is to make all soldiers, shock brigade members, and do-or-die unit members unconditionally carry out any order issued by the leader [suryong] -- by even risking their lives. Therefore, you, comrades, must better indoctrinate soldiers under the slogan "Let us fight for the great leader by even risking our lives!" This slogan presented by the dear comrade leader impressed People's Army officers and men. This immortal slogan is imprinted at any guardpost in the frontline, coast, and mountainous areas; command posts on warships, aircraft cockpits, and guardposts at major facilities and vigorously inspires People's Army soldiers into the single road of loyalty and heroic feats. The outstanding leadership with which one presents a slogan, builds the entire Army into a powerful rank, and leads the entire Army to fulfill a single purpose is a leadership trait that only the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il possesses. Nothing is more fortunate to an army than having a commander who has an outstanding art of military operations. Upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the supreme commander is a boundless honor and the highest privilege to our people and People's Army. Our dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is an outstanding commander who takes charge of the entire Armed Forces of the country in a unified manner, makes the entire Army act like one, has a good understanding of everything from operational tactics to equipment, and is well versed with all Army, Navy, and Air Force branches. The dear comrade leader personally visited the training field of a unit one day in October 1980. After watching soldiers in combat training with satisfaction, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said proudly that our People's Army's combat capability has been strengthened beyond comparison. He added: If our people see the invincible spirits of our People's Army, they will be very pleased, but, if the enemy sees them, it will be (?horrified). He also gave a great lesson, which is a leading guideline in strengthening the People's Army's combat capability. Even professional functionaries could not have imagined that the most important question of war victory lies in the seemingly ordinary logic set forth by the dear comrade leader. The great military genius, dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, was the only one who gave answers to the victory of war after closely analyzing and comprehending all aspects of nature and characteristics of modern war from a new angle. His extraordinary strategy is a comprehensive reflection of the sagacious general's military wisdom, peerless courage, and scientific insight. These qualifications and traits can only been seen in a veteran of many battles. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a military genius and matchless sagacious general who long time ago smashed into pieces [sansanhi chitpusida] the enemy's reckless war maneuvers with wisdom that foresees all troubles and adapts to any circumstance. An (?example) was seen a few years ago, when the enemies' Team Spirit joint military exercise reached its highest, he organized the mobilization of the Korea People's Army [KPA] units to one focused place and the enemies were chaotically confused. This made the most important part of the exercise useless. At another time, the enemies came at us saying they would make a preemptive strike. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il seized the initiative with one single tactic and frightened them away. In March 1993, when the enemies resumed the Team Spirit '93 joint military exercise, which the enemies had decided to suspend temporarily, and drew dark clouds of nuclear war to this land, he unsparingly smashed [chitpusida] the war aggression maneuver of the enemies, who ran wild without discretion, with an order in the name of the supreme commander. Each time the military functionaries see the frosted-pumpkin look of the rascals in those right-on-target cases, they could not resist admiring the outstanding military sense and brightly shining extraordinary strategy of the dear comrade leader, who changes adverse circumstance to favorable one all at once by gaining supremacy over the enemies with one single blow. Our revolutionary forces' supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, is a great military genius who always leads our revolutionary armed forces to the single road of victory with outstanding military ideology, military wisdom that foresees a thousand ri ahead, and extraordinary military training skill, and an indomitable sagacious general who grips the enemies in one catch and tosses them around with fantastic strategies and tactics, and unique war method. His respected name is indeed a brilliant symbol of spirit, dignity, hope, and victory of the ever-victorious invincible people and the People's Army. Endless is the glory of our people and the People's Army because we have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the supreme commander of our revolutionary armed forces. Wide open is the road of glorious and brilliant victory for our people and the People's Army because of his leadership.
