The future of the United States is closely related to the Asia-Pacific region, which is recording the fastest economic growth in the world, so we must develop our relations with this region." U.S. Secretary of State Christopher also said: "In the 21st century, no other region will be more important than the Asia- Pacific region to the United States." All this shows that the United States has substantially adjusted its diplomatic policy, which has become noticeably inclined toward the Asia-Pacific region. People made different assessments on the degree to which the United States would adjust its Asia-Pacific strategy. One opinion holds that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy had shifted to the Asia-Pacific region. The other opinion holds that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole remains in Europe, and it will only be shifted to the Asia-Pacific region in the future. It seems that both opinions are not completely correct. As the Cold War just ended recently, U.S. diplomatic strategy remains in a process of adjustment, and its strategic focus still bears the characteristics of being "transitional" and replaceable. One should not simply follow the conventional concept of "only one focus." After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, tremendous changes occurred in the world pattern, and U.S. diplomatic strategy is also facing comprehensive adjustments. In the process of adjustments, actual conditions and objective contradictions did not develop to a degree which required a comprehensive shift in focus. That is, the original focus could not be removed immediately, and the new focus could not be established in one single move. Instead, there would be a period of transition and replacement. In such a period, there would not be only "one focus"; instead, "two" different "foci" would appear at the same time. This has been shown by the speeches of U.S. Government leaders. Shortly after the Seattle meeting, Christopher said that during the cold war, the United States had naturally focused its strategy on Europe, because it had to contain the Soviet Union. "Today, we are watching every region of the globe at the same time. Due to our economic and security needs, we have interests in Asia." When attending the NATO summit meeting in Brussels, Clinton also said explicitly: "The core of U.S. security remains in Europe." However, he added: "It is beyond doubt that Europe is not the only key point about which the United States cares." They made it clear that the United States would "watch every region at the same time" and that Europe would remain the "core of U.S. security" but "not the only key point." All this means that there is more than one key point in U.S. diplomatic strategy. Europe remains the focus of U.S. diplomacy, because most of the world's developed countries are in Europe. In the present stage and for a fairly long time to come, Europe will continue to be the center of international struggle, and the United States must lay the focus of its diplomacy in Europe. Because many allies of the United States are European countries and the United States is trying to maintain its status as the leader of the West and the world, it will have to first maintain its leading position in Europe. Recently, extreme nationalist forces have risen in Russia, and this cannot but cause concern and apprehension to the United States. In addition, the United States is still trying to keep more than 100,000 troops in Europe after the end of the Cold War, and this shows that Europe remains the key point of U.S. security interests. However, because of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the direct threat to U.S. security has disappeared, and the United States has also adjusted and scaled down its European strategy. For example, in order to lighten the European defense burden, the United States has tried to let the European nations bear as much of the defense role as possible. Therefore, although Europe remains the focus of U.S. strategy, it is not quite the same as in the Cold War period. The United States not only has major security interests in Europe, but it also has major economic interests there. At present, the United States gains 60 percent of its profits earned overseas from Europe, over half of its overseas investments are in Europe, and 65 percent of foreign investment in the United States is from Europe. Although Europe is so important to U.S. economic interests, the United States has begun to shift the strategic "focus" of its "economic security" to the Asia-Pacific region, because U.S. investment in Asia has been increasing faster than in other regions, and its bilateral trade with Asia greatly exceeds that with Europe. According to statistics, between 1989 and 1992, U.S. direct investment in Asia (excluding Japan) increased by 56 percent, far higher than the 26-percent growth in overall U.S. investment overseas in this period. According to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the rate of return from U.S. investment in Asia between 1989 and 1991 exceeded 23 percent, which was almost twice as much as the average rate of investment returns in the 24 major industrial countries in the world in the same period. The annual volume of bilateral trade between the United States and Asia exceeds $360 billion, which is more than four times that of 15 years ago and nearly 40 percent higher than the volume of bilateral trade between the United States and Europe. Although it will still take time for U.S. economic interests in Asia to exceed those in Europe in all fields, the development tendency as a whole has already shown that the focus of U.S. economic interests is being shifted to the Asia-Pacific region. In short, it is still too early to say that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole has been completely shifted to the Asia-Pacific region, and it is also unrealistic to say that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole remains in Europe. In the post-Cold War transitional period and at the turn of the century, adjustments in U.S. diplomatic strategy will bear a transitional nature. At present and for a certain period to come, there cannot be just "one focus"; instead, there will be two different "key points." Concretely speaking, the focus of political and military "security interests" in U.S. diplomatic strategy remain in Europe for now, but the focus of its economic interests has been shifted to the Asia-Pacific region. Because the United States places economic policy at the center of its diplomatic strategy, the development tendency shows that the Asia-Pacific region will hold an increasingly important position in U.S. diplomatic strategy.
