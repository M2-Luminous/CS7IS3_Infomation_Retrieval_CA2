Asked by reporters to comment on Mr. Tanaka's remark this morning at the prime minister's official residence, Prime Minister Hosokawa said there is no such possibility. Commenting on Mr. Tanaka's remark at a news conference this morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said: As the clearest way for the prime minister to take political responsibility, he could dissolve the House of Representatives, call general elections and announce the resignation of his cabinet en masse. Mr. Tanaka probably anticipated the resignation of the Hosokawa cabinet en masse. I do not want to make any comment on his remark either way.
