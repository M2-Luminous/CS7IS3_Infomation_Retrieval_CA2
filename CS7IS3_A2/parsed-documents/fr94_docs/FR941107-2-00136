FR941107-2-00136 FR941107-2-00080 [Docket No. 50&hyph;219] GPU Nuclear Corp.; Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station; License No. DPR&hyph;16; Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 Notice is hereby given that by a ``PETITION FOR EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNDER PROVISIONS OF 10 CFR 2.206 WITH REGARD TO OYSTER CREEK NUCLEAR POWER STATION'', dated September 19, 1994, Oyster Creek Nuclear Watch and Nuclear Information and Resource Service, request that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission take action with regard to the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station of the GPU Nuclear Corporation. The Petition requests that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission: (1) immediately suspend the Oyster Creek operating license until the licensee inspects and repairs or replaces all safety-class reactor internal component parts subject to embrittlement and cracking; (2) immediately suspend the Oyster Creek operating license until the licensee provides an analysis regarding the synergistic effects of through wall cracking of multiple safety-class components; (3) immediately suspend the Oyster Creek operating license until the licensee has analyzed and mitigated any areas of noncompliance with regard to irradiated fuel pool cooling as a single unit Boiling Water Reactor (BWR); and (4) issue a Generic Letter requiring other licensees of single unit BWRs to provide information regarding fuel pool boiling in order to verify compliance with regulatory requirements, and to promptly take appropriate mitigative action if the units are not in compliance. As the bases for their requests concerning safety-class reactor internal components, Petitioners state that: the core shroud in General Electric BWRs is vulnerable to age-related deterioration; 12 domestic and overseas, BWRs have found extensive cracking on welds of the core shroud; only 10 of 36 U.S. BWRs have inspected their core shrouds and 9 were found to have cracks; 19 of 25 selected BWR internal components are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking and 6 of 19 are susceptible to irradiation assisted stress corrosion cracking; Oyster Creek is the oldest operating General Electric Mark I BWR and the third oldest operating reactor in the United Stats, and has been subjected to the longest period of operational conditions that cause embrittlement and cracking; the BWR Owners Group stated that cracking of the core shroud is a warning signal that additional safety-class reactor internals are increasingly susceptible to age-related deterioration; cracking of any single part or multiple components jeopardizes safe operation of the nuclear station; Oyster Creek did not inspect for core shroud cracking prior to the current refueling outage and other safety-class reactor internals have not been adequately inspected for cracking; and a safety analysis has not been performed on the potential synergistic effects of multiple component cracking. As the bases for their requests concerning fuel pool cooling design deficiencies, Petitioners state that: various design defects in BWR fuel pool cooling systems pose a significant increase in risk to the public safety and are violations or 10 CFR 50.49; 10 CFR Part 50, App. A, Criterion 63; 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion III; and Reg. Guides 1.13, 1.89 and 1.97; Oyster Creek is a single unit facility with no adjacent units to rely upon in the event that a design basis were to disable the fuel pool cooling system; and Oyster Creek has not docketed any material with regard to BWR design deficiencies identified in the 10 CFR Part 21 Report of Substantial Safety Hazard (November 27, 1992) of Messrs. Lochbaum and Prevatte, and thus Oyster Creek may be in violation of NRC regulatory requirements. The Petition is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The Petition has been referred to the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. As provided by Section 2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this Petition within a reasonable time. By letter dated October 27, 1994, the Director denied Petitioners' requests for an immediate suspension of the operating license. A copy of the Petition and the Director's letter are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public Document Room for the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington Street, Toms River, NJ 08753. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 27th day of October 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. William T. Russell, Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
