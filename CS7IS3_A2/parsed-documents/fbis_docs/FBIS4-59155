The minister was speaking at a news conference in Geneva, where he is attending a World Health Organization conference. Mubarak said the rising incidence of diseases and deaths among children in particular is supported by reports drawn up by international organizations. Iraq has satisfied the conditions laid down by UN Security Council resolutions, and is now, therefore, eligible for imports of food and medicines. Certain quarters, however, are blocking these deliveries, said the minister.
