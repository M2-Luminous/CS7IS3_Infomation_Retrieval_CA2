Honma, at his first court hearing, said he neither was offered the 20 million yen from Taisei last year, nor received any money. Prosecutors said Honma, 53, took the cash in late January in exchange for giving Japan's second biggest contractor the tender for a cancer center worth billions of yen. They said the money also was intended as a sweetener for future public works in Miyagi, about 340 kilometers northwest of Tokyo. Mitsuo Moriya, 65, a Honma aide charged with playing an intermediary role, admitted receiving the money but denied it was a bribe for Honma. Moriya was a senior member of the Liberal Democratic Party's Miyagi chapter. Three former Taisei executives who were also indicted said in the hearing that they gave the 20 million yen to Honma to help him win reelection. They also said that they implicitly expected him to act in favor of the company in awarding contracts for public works projects. The three executives are former Vice President Takashi Hashimoto, 57, Koji Amada, 53, former head of the firm's Tohoku branch and his predecessor Takaaki Wada, 57. Their attorney asked the court for leniency, saying his clients would not contest the charges. Honma was arrested in September along with Moriya, Wada and Amada. Hashimoto was arrested later. Honma stepped down in October, half way through his four-year second term. He has been held at Tokyo detention house. The former Miyagi governor also has been charged with pocketing 100 million yen in bribes from disgraced business tycoon Ryoei Saito, 77, former honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co. On this occasion, Moriya apparently acted as intermediary for Honma in channeling the bribe. Daishowa, which also has interests in a golf course and housing projects in Miyagi, was implicated in December 1991. Two governors and two mayors stand trial in a series of bribery scandals centering on eight of the country's leading construction companies. In mid-January, prosecutors arrested two executives of another contractor, Obayashi Corp., on suspicion of bribery. That brings the number of construction officials implicated in the scandal since June to more than 20.
