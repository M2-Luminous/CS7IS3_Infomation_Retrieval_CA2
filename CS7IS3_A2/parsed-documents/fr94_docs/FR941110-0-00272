FR941110-0-00272 FR941110-0-00017 Poa mannii of the grass family (Poaceae) is a perennial with short rhizomes (underground stems) and erect, tufted culms (bunched stems) 50 to 75 centimeters (cm) (20 to 30 inches (in)) tall. The leaf sheath completely surrounds the leaf, and the ligule (appendage at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath) completely encircles the stem, is about 0.5 millimeters (mm) (0.02 in) long, and has a tooth about 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.2 in) long and a fringed margin. The leaf blade is up to 15 cm (6 in) long and 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.2 in) wide, and has a rough upper surface and a hairless lower surface. The panicles (branched flower clusters) are usually less than 5 cm (2 in) long and have primary branches 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 in) long. The 4 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long, flattened spikelets (ultimate flower clusters) are pale greenish or yellowish brown and usually are comprised of 4 or 5 flowers. The glumes (small pair of bracts at the base of each spikelet) are about 3 mm (0.1 in) long. The lemma (outer bract at the base of a floret) is 3 to 4 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) long and has cobwebby hairs at its base. The palea (inner bract at the base of a floret) is 3 to 3.5 mm (about 0.1 in) long and has a sharp, longitudinal ridge. The reddish brown grain-like fruit is elliptical to spindle-shaped and about 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long. All three native species of Poa in the Hawaiian Islands are endemic to the island of Kauai. Poa mannii is distinguished from both Poa siphonoglossa and Poa sandvicensis by its fringed ligule and from Poa sandvicensis by its shorter panicle branches (O'Connor 1990). Poa mannii is found only on the northwestern and west-central portions of the island of Kauai. The four known populations extend over a distance of about 10.5 by 8.5 kilometers (km) (6.5 by 5.3 miles (mi)) and are found in Kalalau, Makaha, Koaie, and Waialae Valleys, all on State lands (David Lorence, National Tropical Botanical Garden, pers. comm., 1992). The species was formerly found in Olokele Gulch (O'Connor 1990). Approximately 125 individuals have been observed in the extant populations. This species typically grows on cliffs and rock faces at elevations between 460 and 1,150 meters (m) (1,510 and 3,770 feet (ft)) in lowland and montane mesic forests. Associated species include: Chamaesyce sp. ('akoko), Exocarpos luteolus (heau), Labordia helleri (kamakahala), and Nototrichium sp. in Kalalau Valley; Cyrtandra wawrae (ha'iwale) in Makaha Valley; Acacia koa (koa), Alectryon macrococcus (mahoe), and Antidesma platyphyllum (hame) in Koaie Valley; and Bidens cosmoides (po'ola nui), Carex meyenii, Dodonaea viscosa ('a'ali'i), and Schiedea amplexicaulis in Waialae Valley. Threats to Poa mannii include habitat damage, trampling, and browsing by feral goats ( Capra hircus ); competition with invasive alien plants, especially Erigeron karvinskianus (daisy fleabane), Lantana camara (lantana), and Rubus argutus (prickly Florida blackberry); landslides in the steep habitat; fire; and reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (D. Lorence and Ken Wood, Hawaii Plant Conservation Center, pers. comms., 1992).
