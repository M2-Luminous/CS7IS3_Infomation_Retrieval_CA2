"Russia needs uniting and consolidating all forces now as never before - the fact is reflected in the treaty on social accord and we had to cover such a long way towards its signing," Chernomyrdin said. "The government is to accept much of the responsibility for the fulfillment of the treaty and it will do its best. As a head of government, I am responsible for the fate of our homeland before the people and Russia. We shall overcome difficulties. We need (to turn Russia into) a country where a man will live happily. And the new Russia already takes shape," he added. According to Chernomyrdin, he believes in his government and does not map out to replace or fire anyone; its political course remains unchanged. The Russian prime minister visited a gas-processing plant and discussed ways to increase the volume of oil and gas extraction, use new and old bore-holes effectively, speed up the processing and secure the ties inside the fuel-and-energy complex.
