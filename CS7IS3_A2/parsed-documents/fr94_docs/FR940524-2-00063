FR940524-2-00063 FR940524-2-00040 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Drug Enforcement Administration William L. Algea, III, M.D.; Denial of Application On February 24, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to William L. Algea, III, M.D. (Respondent), of Milligan, Tennessee, proposing to deny his pending application for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) based on his dispensing and prescribing controlled substances for no legitimate medical purpose on ten occasions between 1986 and 1989 to undercover agents who were posing as patients; his voluntary surrender of his previous DEA certificate of Registration; the summary suspension of his medical license by the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of Tennessee; and his conviction of four counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) based on his guilty plea in the United States District Court, Western District of Tennessee. The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d) and 1301.54(e), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57. In 1986, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation obtained information that Respondent was issuing controlled substance prescriptions for no legitimate medical purpose. Based upon this information, agents posing as patients made office visits with Respondent in an attempt to procure illicit prescriptions. These visits corroborated the initial reports; Respondent issued prescriptions for Talwin and Valium, both Schedule IV controlled substances, on the first undercover visit and then issued two more prescriptions less then a month later for Pentobarbital, a Schedule III controlled substance, and Talwin. None of these prescriptions were issued for a legitimate medical reason. Other Tennessee law enforcement agencies also joined in the investigation. Between February of 1988 and April 1989, Respondent dispensed or wrote prescriptions for Demerol, a Schedule II controlled substance, Valium and Talwin for no legitimate medical purpose to these undercover agents on eight separate occasions. During some of these visits, Respondent inquired about obtaining cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance, from the agents. On the final visit, the undercover agent gave Respondent one ounce of cocaine in exchange for $600.00 and a Talwin prescription. Within a short time of the final undercover visit, Respondent was arrested and charged with four counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), based upon the latest undercover transactions. At this point Respondent voluntarily surrendered his DEA Certificate of Registration, AA2050285. Then, on April 14, 1989, the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of Tennessee summarily suspended Respondent's medical license. On May 20, 1990, Respondent pled guilty to and was convicted of four counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) in the United States District Court, Western District of Tennessee. On July 15, 1992, the Board of Medical Examiners granted Respondent a restricted medical license with the conditions that he be on probation for three years and that, inter alia , he not be allowed to handle Schedule II controlled substances. The Deputy Administrator may deny an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``(i)n determining the public interest, the following factors will be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.'' In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, the Deputy Administrator has the discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See David E. Trawick, D.D.S., 53 FR 5326 (1988). In this proceeding factors one through four apply. Factor one is applicable based upon the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiner's summary suspension of Respondent's license and subsequent issuance of a restricted license. Factors two and four apply because Respondent prescribed and dispensed controlled substances to undercover agents on many occasions between 1986 and 1989 and based on the fact that Respondent traded a controlled substance prescription for cocaine on the last undercover visit. Factor three is also applicable based upon Respondent's conviction in Federal District Court to four counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1). No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that the application executed by William L. Algea, III, M.D., on November 12, 1992, for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a practitioner, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective May 24, 1994. Dated: May 17, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12570 Filed 5&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
