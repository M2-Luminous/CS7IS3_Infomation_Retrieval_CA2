FBIS4-51756 "dreas085_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 North Korea Foreign Ministry Spokesman on IAEA Inspection Foreign Ministry Spokesman on IAEA Inspection SK0305141394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1300 GMT 3 May 94 SK0305141394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1300 GMT 3 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] In response to a question from a Korean Central News Agency reporter regarding the replacement of fuel rods at the five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today gave the following answer: In connection with the replacement of fuel rods at the five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, we and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat recently exchanged many telex messages. Under our special position [tuksuhan chiwi] in which we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], out of a consistent position to show the irreproachability [kyolbaeksong] of our nuclear activities, we decided to subject the upcoming replacement of fuel rods to the thorough surveillance of the agency. Therefore, we decided to allow agency inspectors to observe [iphoe] the replacement of fuel rods to verify that the nuclear material is not diverted for other, nonpeaceful purposes [tarun pipyonghwajok mokchoge yuyong]. The agency's observance activities, which we decided to allow, include the observance [kwanchuk] of the replacement of fuel rods, containment and surveillance [pongswaewa kamsi] of all replaced fuels, and all other contents of inspection sufficient enough to ensure the continuity of safeguards [tamboui yonsoksongul pojanghanunde chungbunhan sachal naeyongduri]. We also immediately issued visas for the five inspectors, which the agency requested. As shown, we made all possible efforts to prove the transparency [tumyongsong] of our nuclear activities even though we are under a special position. Nevertheless, the IAEA Secretariat is now making an unreasonable request [pudanghan yongu] to select, preserve, and measure [sontaek pogwanhago chukchong] some fuel rods during the fuel rod replacement. Saying that it would select and measure fuel rods means that it would conduct regular and irregular inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] after ignoring [musi] our special position in which we temporarily suspended the withdrawal from the NPT. This can in no way be allowed [tojohui hoyongdoelsu opta]. The only inspection activity that we can allow as a voluntary goodwill measure at present is an inspection purely to ensure the continuity of safeguards to prove that the nuclear material is not diverted for other purposes in compliance with our special position [hyondangyeeso uriga chawonjogin sonuiui chochiro hoyonghaejulsu innun sachal hwaltongun uriui tuksu chiwie matke haengmunchiri tarunmochoge yuyongdoejiannundanungosul hwaginhanun sunsu tamboui yonsoksong pojangul wihan sachal ppunida]. Allowing the agency to subject all replaced fuel rods to its containment and surveillance and to verify that they are not diverted for other purposes is the expression of our greatest goodwill [uriui choedaeui sonuiui pyosi]. The IAEA Secretariat, however, is insisting on unfair demands, while openly ignoring our special position. This is clear proof that the IAEA Secretariat is still treating us with prejudice, while using suspicions of us as an excuse and that the IAEA's partiality keeps expanding. The IAEA Secretariat, which has in the past fabricated inconsistencies by eliminating [word indistinct] samples, this time wants to measure selected parts of the fuel rods. This proves that it intends to continue to cling to the anti-Republic pressure commotion by eventually making new inconsistencies. What cannot be overlooked is that the IAEA Secretariat is still not sending an inspection team, even though we have this time allowed inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards and the so-called unfinished inspections, which was raised in the last inspection conducted in March. This clearly shows that the IAEA Secretariat has been pursuing insidious political objectives by raising our nuclear issue at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting and the UN Security Council. If we allow the measurement of selected parts of the fuel rods under such circumstances, the IAEA Secretariat is sure to fabricate a new pretext in the anti-Republic pressure commotion. We can no longer let the IAEA Secretariat use our nuclear issue in the political game. In case the IAEA Secretariat does not accept our reasonable proposal and insists on its unfair demands to the end, we cannot but replace the fuel rods in accordance with our operation plan. In technical and security aspects, the replacement of the fuel rods is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed any more. Whether the IAEA inspectors are there to observe or not, the spent fuel counter, thermal luminescence detectors, and surveillance equipment installed by the IAEA in the experimental nuclear power plant are still operational, therefore, our fuel rod replacement work will be under thorough IAEA surveillance. We will place all replaced fuel from the fuel rods under IAEA control and will allow examination when the nuclear issue is resolved in a package deal in future DPRK-U.S. talks. In the event the IAEA Secretariat drives the situation to extremes, despite our maximum generosity and good intentions, correspondingly, we will resolutely counter this [urinun ungdang kue tanhohi taechohae nagal kosida]. With the resolution of the nuclear issue now reaching a gateway stage [kwanmunjok taemok], the IAEA Secretariat should think more deeply.
