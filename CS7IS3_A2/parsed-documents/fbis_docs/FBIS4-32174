"My mistrust is aimed mainly against the post-communist Democratic Left Party (SDL), which from the outside looks like being open to ethnic minority demands. But it is just the opposite: It is the strong SDL group of deputies which has long been blocking the solution of minority questions. I would like to point out it is known that the SDL deputies are considering post-election cooperation with (ex-Premier Vladimir) Meciar," Duray says in MLADA FRONTA DNES. Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS, now an opposition entity, consistently tops opinion polls. "Of course, we are aware that despite its mistakes, the (present) government is a better alternative than Meciar," Duray says. "However,... the Egyutteles would like the government to arise from the new elections (slated for autumn) to lean more to the right, as Hungarians were always able to reach consensus with the Slovak right wing," he states. He dismisses the idea that he and Meciar need each other to legitimize their political stands. "I do not need Mr. Meciar for my political existence.... Mr.Meciar has caused many problems to Slovak residents, and as a politician I do not want any problems," Duray emphasizes. He says he does not consider himself a radical, but a politician not inclining to compromises at the cost of principles. To the question of the interviewer whether or not the Egyutteles contributed to the tension (between Slovaks and the strong Hungarian minority) in south Slovakia, when three of its nine deputies recently voted against the "place-name" bill (which was to enable bilingual place names in the above regions), Duray says the rejected bill's wording was far from what the ethnic Hungarian parties agreed with the government coalition. The bill could also have been passed if it were not for the absence of thirteen coalition deputies at the relevant parliamentary session, he adds. "We have very precise information that the Council of Europe (CE) was attentively monitoring developments in Slovakia and the country's attitude to the ethnic minority question," Duray says. He points out that the CE had not been correctly informed about the "place name" bill. According to him, CE representatives had believed that the Slovak Parliament would pass the law in a form known from Norway or southern Tyrol. "They did not know at all that we (ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia) had given up our claim for bilingual names of towns and villages, and accepted -- within a compromise -- the introduction of bilingual road signs. But this is a fundamental difference, and if they (the CE) had known this, the opinion could not arise that Slovak Hungarians demanded what could not be fulfilled. Therefore I cannot but state that Slovak representatives in the CE had distorted the reality at last," Duray says in MLADA FRONTA DNES. Referring to the question of a Hungarian-Slovak agreement to grant the unalterability of the common border, Duray says: "I do not think at all that the question is of any great political or international importance. The border, as all borders in Europe, has been guaranteed since the end of World War Two. There is only one exception, that of the former Yugoslavia, where we are witness to a bloody war, which in no case threatens between Slovakia and Hungary. After the split of the Czechoslovak Federation (on January 1, 1993) both Slovakia and the Czech Republic are in the position of successor states, which also means their borders are guaranteed," Duray points out. The Egyutteles Movement has 9 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament. Neither it nor the other ethnic Hungarian parliamentary party, the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH, 5 deputies) are members of the government coalition, but they are supporting the present government.
