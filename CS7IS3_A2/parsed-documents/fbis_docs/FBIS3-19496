After two hours of discussions, the ministers held a joint press conference to announce, among other things, that they had "reached agreement on the need to end the conflict" in Bosnia. The Russian head of diplomacy even dotted the "i's": "Our two countries want the three (warring) parties to reach a compromise." It could not be clearer that Washington and Moscow have decided to settle the matter together, without the help of the Twelve. The latter, who serve as labor on the ground, are being sent back to their diplomatic sandbox where they will continue to play until they have built a real common foreign policy. Make no mistake: The turn of events clearly shows the failure of the European Union on an issue which George Bush and Bill Clinton, at the beginning of his mandate, scarcely wanted to touch. The French-German disagreements on the issue of diplomatic recognition of Croatia and Slovenia at a time when Belgrade started to lose control of them, and the British rejection of a WEU [Western European Union] operation against the Yugoslav fleet and air force deprived the Twelve of the possibility of exerting the influence and pressure without which restoring peace is an illusion. Of course, one has scruples about criticizing them: They have made praiseworthy efforts to bring the warring sides to reason; but they jeopardized them because some countries tried to assert their interests in a extensive negotiations in which they had no place. For the Europeans, who have just been told to go sit in the corner, the turn of events will continue to be a disaster unless the lesson in humility prompts them, big and small, to make the concessions without which their union will continue to yield mediocre results on the world political stage.
