Nor is it prepared to receive its members in Budapest," Hungarian Ambassador to Ukraine Istvan Varga told Nikola Makarevich, first deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, in Kiev today. The ambassador said that the recognition of Ruthenians as a national minority is an internal affair of Ukraine. The cabinet of the so-called Subcarpathian Rus was formed in the spring of 1993 by Ruthenians seeking independence from Ukraine. Hungary's law on national and ethnic minorities mentions the Ruthenians and Ukrainians separately, thereby recognizing the existence of a Ruthenian minority in Hungary.
