FBIS3-47135 "dreas006_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Jan 1994 North Korea South Minister Trying To `Foil' DPRK-U.S.Talks SK0801042994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0413 GMT 8 Jan 94 SK0801042994 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Yi Yong-tok, the new minister of the South Korean puppet Unification Board, at a press conference on January 5 reportedly uttered very provocative words that he "will not respond unconditionally even if the North proposes a North-South dialogue." He meant that the South Korean puppet clique would refuse dialogue with the North by setting every conceivable condition. This clearly proved once again that they actually do not want any contact and dialogue between the North and the South but continue seeking confrontation and division, although they are loud-mouthed about dialogue and the exchange of special envoys. The mishmash of Yi Yong-tok is grave because it came at a time when a breakthrough has been made in the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. contacts and work is being done for a progress of the DPRK- U.S. talks. Yi's words are a base blast to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and isolate and stifle the North by setting an "international cooperation system" in-motion. Judging from this, "preconditions" for DPRK-U.S. talks cried for by the South Korean puppets are, in the final analysis, a brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks. Still more intolerable is that he, ridiculously enough, spun out the venomous trash that "the North's human rights problem will be dealt with" and "things touching the North on the raw will be mentioned in the future". It is preposterous for Yi Yong-tok to have cried over the North's "human rights problem", while keeping mum about the reality of South Korea riddled with human rights abuses.
