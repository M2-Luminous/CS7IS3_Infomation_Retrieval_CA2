FR940106-2-00124 FR940106-2-00071 Federal Aviation Administration Approval of Noise Compatibility Program; Stockton Metropolitan Airport, Stockton, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the Noise Compatibility Program submitted by the county of San Joaquin, Stockton, California, under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On May 10, 1991, the FAA determined that the Noise Exposure Maps submitted by under part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On November 22, 1993, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Noise Compatibility Program for Metropolitan Oakland International Airport. Twenty-eight (28) of the proposed measures were approved, and two (2) measures were disapproved. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of FAA's approval of the Stockton Metropolitan Airport Noise Compatibility Program is November 22, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John L. Pfeifer, Manager, Airports District Office, SFO&hyph;600, Federal Aviation Administration, San Francisco Airports District Office, 831 Mitten Road, Burlingame, California 94010&hyph;1303, Telephone: (415) 876&hyph;2805. Documents reflecting this FAA action may be reviewed at this same location. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the Noise Compatibility Program for Stockton Metropolitan Airport, effective November 22, 1993. Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator who has previously submitted a Noise Exposure Map, may submit to the FAA a Noise Compatibility Program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the Noise Exposure Maps. The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel. Each airport Noise Compatibility Program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150 program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to the following determinations: a. The Noise Compatibility Program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150; b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses; c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted by the Federal Government; and d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law. Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport Noise Compatibility Program are delineated in FAR part 150, ยง150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal, state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Burlingame, California. The county of San Joaquin submitted to the FAA on February 28, 1992, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced during the Noise Compatibility Planning study conducted from May 1988, through October 1990. The Stockton Metropolitan Airport Noise Exposure Maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on May 10, 1991. Notice of this determination was published in the Federal Register on May 28, 1991.
