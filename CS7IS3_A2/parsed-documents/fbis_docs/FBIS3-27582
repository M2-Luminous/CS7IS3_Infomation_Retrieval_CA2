[Zhang Yulai] Since the 14th CPC National Congress, the building of the socialist market economy structure has developed very quickly. However, some problems worthy of attention have cropped up, such as overheated investment in fixed assets, excessively fast development in the development zones, and excessive credit scale and monetary input. Why is it that whenever we talk about developing the economy, people think of speeding up capital construction, expanding scale, and increasing investment? [Meng Xianzhong] All these problems reflect a long-standing conspicuous problem in the economic construction of our country: People have attached importance to the speed of the economy while ignoring the quality of the state economy and have been accustomed to the quantitative type of economy which increases extension while failing to meet the requirement of taking economic results as the center. Economic development, of course, includes accelerating the speed of economic development and increasing the percentage growth of the GNP and this is of great significance. However, we cannot belittle the improvement of the quality of the state economy. In view of the present tendency to attach importance to quantity while belittling quality, I think that it is urgently necessary to make clear that to improve the quality of the state economy is a pressing task in building the market economy. [Zhang] What is the meaning of the concept "the quality of the state economy?" [Meng] All things are determined by quality and quantity. In the same way, the state economy is also determined by quality and quantity. The quantity of the state economy means the scale and speed of economic reality and economic development. The quality of the state economy is about whether or not the economic structure of a country is rational and whether or not its economic operations are highly efficient. To be specific, the quality of a country's economy is determined by various factors, such as the rationality of the industrial structure, the foundation and main propelling forces of economic development, various rates of input and output, labor productivity, and the amount of national income generated by the social GNP. As viewed from our macroindustrial structure, facts clearly show that the second and tertiary industries are not developed. Therefore, we must make great efforts to develop the second and tertiary industries. As viewed from the industrial and transportation fields, structural contradictions between industries have become more and more conspicuous. In particular, infrastructure like railway transportation and the support capacities of basic industries are still quite weak. At present, railway transportation can only meet 60 to 70 percent of the needs of freight transport and has become a "bottleneck" in our economic development. To speed up our economic development, we are first faced with the task of readjusting the industrial structure to make it more rational and modern. In assessing the quality of the economy from the angle of the industrial structure, it is also necessary to look at the internal structure of each industry. In recent years, for example, although the percentage of industrialization in some localities has been greatly increased, the industrialization in many localities is at a low level. This means that, although industrial production has become the dominant social production activities in these localities, the products turned out are mainly primary products which consume visible resources and the value added to them by means of high-technology and new-technology is quite low. They are in an unfavorable position in commodity exchanges. In 1992, it turned out that of the 500 enterprises with the best economic results, over 70 were cigarette plants; of the top 500 enterprises in handing over profits and taxes to the state, more than 90 were breweries. In 1993, ranking first and second in the 500 enterprises with the best economic results in our country were also tobacco processing and beverage enterprises. In the United States and Japan, almost all of the top 500 enterprises with the best economic results are industrial enterprises using high-technology or using a large percentage of high technology. Only a few tobacco enterprises, Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, Japan, Spain, and Renault [lei nuo 7191 6179] are among the world's 500 biggest financial groups. [names as published] Besides, all these tobacco enterprises have diversified business. Just think, when the tobacco processing and beverage industries have become the main industrial enterprises with good economic results in a country, how can we talk about economic competitive power or comprehensive national strength? Nevertheless, some localities are still expanding the production of cigarettes and wine. [Zhang] You said there are problems in the industrial structure of our country. What is the relationship between the foundation and propelling forces of economic development and the quality of the state economy? [Meng] The central resources and propelling forces of economic development vary in different historical periods. In the agricultural society, land was the central resource and agricultural labor was the main force propelling economic development; in the modern society, industrial capital was the central resource and production with machines on a large scale was the main propelling force; and since the second half of the 20th century, human capital has become the central resource for economic development and science, technology, and culture have become the main propelling forces in economic development. At present, 50 to 70 percent of the GNP in developed countries is created by the input of science, technology, and culture. That the input of science, technology, and culture has become the main propelling force implies among the input of resources, power, capital, labor, science, technology, and culture, that science, technology, and culture account for a greater percentage and the output of science, technology, and culture is high. Only this represents the level of modern production. China proves definitely inferior in this respect. The rate of industrial products contributed by science, technology, and culture is less than 30 percent and, in recent years, the percentage in a few provinces and municipalities has tended to decrease. [Zhang] Please tell us more about the question of the input-output ratio. [Meng] Viewed from various individual input-output ratios, the quality of the energy utilization coefficient, the profit and tax rate of capital, and the economic results of investment in fixed assets are low. The energy consumption of unit GNP of China is six times that of Japan and more than twice that of the United States. The profit and tax rate of capital in China is only equivalent to one-quarter to one-third of that of the developed countries. The economic results of investment in fixed assets in our country is even more worrying. Of the existing 2,200 billion yuan in fixed assets, those lying idle and those with a low utilization rate account for one-third, almost as much as 700 billion yuan. This means the economic result of one-third of them is very little. [Zhang] It seems that a low input-output ratio implies great waste. Please tell me more about the level of social labor productivity in our country. [Meng] Compared with the developed countries, the social labor productivity in our country is quite low. Let's take the auto industry for instance. The biggest auto production group in our country has 100,000 workers and staff members. Its total sales volume in 1991 was about 6.2 billion yuan. The accumulated number of automobiles produced since the plant was set up 40 years ago is less than 2 million. Japan's Toyota Auto Corporation has less than 100,000 workers and staff members. Its sales volume in 1991 was $65.454 billion. Germany's Mercedes-Benz has 376,000 workers and staff members. Its sales volume in 1991 was $54.259 billion. The number of automobiles turned out each year by either of the last two auto corporations exceeds 2 million. Just think, without a high labor productivity and without a good quality of the economy, how can we compete with other countries after reentering the GATT. What is especially worthy of our attention is that in recent years, although the output value of some provinces and municipalities has grown very fast, the labor productivity has fallen. This shows that the economic growth of these provinces and municipalities is the outcome of a high input of manpower, financial resources, material resources, and energy resources instead of raising the labor productivity. It should be pointed out that this kind of high output and high speed have covered up the fall in the labor productivity. [Zhang] It seems that without improving the quality of the state economy, it will be difficult to increase our economic strength and the comprehensive national strength, or to compete with other countries. In particular, the per capita possession of reserves of major minerals, clean water, farmland, forests, or pastoral land in our country is below the world's per capita level and the per capita possession of nonregenerated energy reserves is also below the world's per capita level. If we blindly seek a high output value and a high speed by means of a high input, we shall inevitably damage the conditions for sustained production and the capacity to expand reproduction. [Meng] It is precisely so. Let us look again at the question of the formation of the national income by the social gross output value. This question has a bearing on the final economic results. In the 1950's, 100 yuan of social gross output value resulted in over 50 yuan in national income. However, in the 1980's, the amount went down to just over 30 yuan instead of going up. This shows clearly that the quality of our economy urgently needs improvement. In short, developing the economy by improving the quality of the state economy or one-sidedly developing the economy by a high input and a high consumption rate are two different ways of thinking which will lead to two different results and prospects. We should never overlook this. During his inspection tour of the south at the beginning of 1992, Deng Xiaoping, while stressing the necessity of quickening economic construction, explicitly pointed out: It is necessary to pay attention to quality, economic results, and the export-oriented type enterprises and "to develop the economy faster, we must depend on science, technology, and education." In the report from the 14th CPC National Congress, it is also explicitly pointed out that the economic construction of our country should realize two kinds of transition. One is the transition from the planned economy structure to the market economy structure and the other is the transition from a quantity-type economy to an economic result-type economy. Many of us have paid attention only to speeding up the development of the economy while overlooking the necessity of depending on science, technology, and education to develop the economy. At present, the people have a greater awareness of the transition to the market economy but their awareness of the transition to an economic result-type economy is still very vague. [Zhang] How do you think the quality of the state economy can be improved? [Meng] Consumers should have awareness of the quality of commodities, enterprises should have awareness of the quality of the products, and the leadership at all levels should have awareness of the quality of the state economy. To the leadership at all levels, awareness of the quality of the state economy is the most important awareness of the economy. The improvement of the quality of the state economy is a system engineering project and there is much work to do in this respect. The most important thing is to depend on improving the quality of the national science, technology, and culture and on training capable personnel.
