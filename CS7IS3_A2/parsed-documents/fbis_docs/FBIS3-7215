The purpose of the symposium was: To affirm our attitudes and positions on Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought, with this regarded as our ideological foundation and compass for action. To clarify the theoretical and practical basis of this affirmation. To defend and develop Marxism-Leninism, oppose plots to eliminate Marxism-Leninism and socialism in conditions in which the world is undergoing many changes and in which the country is facing great difficulties and challenges. To exchange opinions on a number of the most common and important issues of Marxism-Leninism that are related to the topics, and to create a unified basis for preparing the instructional materials. Almost 100 people attended the symposium. Dao Duy Tung, a member of the Politburo and Standing Committee of the Secretariat and council president, and Nguyen Duc Binh, a member of the Politburo, director of the Ho Chi Minh Institute of National Politics, and vice president of the council, attended and presided at the symposium along with council standing committee members Nguyen Dinh Tu, the secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee and head of the Department of Science and Education of the Central Committee, Dang Xuan Ky, a member of the CPV Central Committee and head of the Marxist-Leninist and Ho Chi Minh Thought Research Institute, and Nguyen Duy Quy, a member of the CPV Central Committee and director of the National Social Sciences and Humanities Center. The council members, the chairmen, vice chairmen, secretaries, and members of the five instructional materials preparation committees and secretariat, and a number of full-time cadres who are monitoring the KX-10 program attended, too. Dao Duy Tung, who gave the opening speech, stated the goals and requirements of the symposium and, at the same time, pointed out the discussion format. He called on the scientists to go to the heart of the issues raised and discuss things with a democratic and scientific spirit and a lofty sense of responsibility. Professor Dang Xuan Ky, in his introductory remarks, raised a number of theoretical and practical issues of Marxism-Leninism and methodological issues in understanding, developing, and defending Marxism-Leninism today. The scientists attending the symposium discussed things very vigorously. Many of the ideas manifested new approaches with independent and creative ways of thinking. There were 41 speeches. Many people spoke two or three times and frankly debated specific issues. The symposium revolved around five main issues: 1. Correctly understanding Marxism-Leninism and issues concerning methodology: Those at the symposium analyzed the essential points in great depth in order to correctly understand the basic theoretical contents of Marxism-Leninism. Based on this, they unanimously affirmed the great role of Marxism-Leninism in our era. Even though socialism has now collapsed in many countries, Marxism-Leninism is still our banner and a compass for our actions. The collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is not synonymous with the collapse of Marxism-Leninism. Grasping the revolutionary and scientific nature of Marxism-Leninism and making creative use of this in our country's specific conditions is the basic guideline in our ideological and theoretical work. However, to understand Marxism-Leninism correctly, we must distinguish between what Marx, Engels, and Lenin said from the erroneous things that others have said in explaining their theory, which has transformed their theory. The arguments of Marx, Engels, and Lenin must be placed within the specific historical conditions of the time in which they advanced their arguments. This is the only way to correctly understand the issues posed by these men. Their arguments must be placed within the framework of a system; they cannot be separated. At the same time, they must be understood under the new light of the present age. 2. The essence and nature of the age: There have long been many different views on this issue. Some people say that the present age is still a period of transition from capitalism to socialism on a worldwide scope, with this starting with the Russian October Revolution. This is true even though socialism as an international system with the Soviet Union as its pillar no longer exists. Others agree that the present age is a period of transition from capitalism to socialism on a worldwide scope, but they say that this must be explained more concretely in accord with the changes in the present situation. Specifically, attention must be given to: a. the influence of the scientific and technical revolution; b. capitalism has the potential to grow thanks to many factors (even though the basic conflicts of capitalism are becoming sharper and sharper; c. the rise of more than 100 newly independent countries; d. the appearance of urgent universal problems that are related to the fate of mankind; e. and the collapse of the international socialist system. Many people think that the present age must be defined in accord with the real situation and in accord with the scientific and technical revolution, which is having a great influence on social progress. This revolution has created an all-around crisis for both socialism and capitalism. Mankind is facing urgent problems that everyone must help to solve if we are to survive. Through discussion and debate, those at the symposium said that even though realistic socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has collapsed, the present age is still a period of transition from capitalism to socialism on a worldwide scope. This is an objective reality and the direction of movement and development of history. However, the manner of expression must be balanced. 3. On the theory of "economic and social structure": Many people affirmed Marx' analysis concerning the evolution of man through economic and social structures, which holds that this started from historical materialism. This provides a firm basis for viewing the development of economic and social structures as a natural historical process. Some people said that this theory is correct, but that it needs to be supplemented, because when the theory was first formulated, Marx analyzed mainly Greek, Roman, and Western European societies. He was not able to study Asia or other places. The universal nature of this theory must be clarified. The analysis can also be supplemented by civilization. But if this approach based on civilization is made absolute and this leads to a rejection of the economic and social theory of Marx, that would be a mistake. Marx' theory on economic and social structures is correct. It is still the "foundation stone" of historical materialism. It reflects the laws of development of human society and is the methodological basis for examining specific historical viewpoints. 4. The historical significance of the theory of surplus value and the nature of modern capitalism: Many people affirmed that Marx' theory of surplus value is still the foundation of his economic theory. This is still the basis for analyzing the changes in modern capitalist society. Others said that the theory of surplus value is of epochal significance and that it is still the basis for analyzing and understanding modern capitalism. However, Marx' arguments on the absolute impoverishment of the proletariat were correct only during during the time of free-competition capitalism. Today, there is only relative impoverishment. The theory of surplus value was correct only during the age of "industrial" capitalism. Now, in the period of "post-industrial" capitalism, this theory is no longer correct. Today, capitalism produces wealth not by exploiting the surplus value of the workers but by using modern techniques and technology (robots). Capitalism is accumulating many socialist factors, which is making capitalism more "humane." Through discussing and debating the above ideas, those at the symposium affirmed that Marx' theory of surplus value still maintains its original value. Because in the final analysis, only with live laborers can surplus value be created. As for modern capitalism, the following must be clearly recognized: the effects of the scientific and technical revolution, the new development standards of the production forces, the new forms of production relationships in capitalism, and the fact that the working class in the capitalist countries has undergone a structural change (the middle class has expanded). 5. The historical mission of the working class: It was affirmed that socialism will replace capitalism and that it is the working class that has this historical mission. But when talking about the historical mission of the working class, it must be understood that the concept "working class" includes those who have a working class consciousness and position. Reality shows that the great majority of the leaders of the working class are intellectuals with a working class consciousness and position. Some people criticized the view that the working class no longer has a historical mission as the representative of the new production formulas. That role now belongs to the intellectuals. Those at the symposium analyzed the above ideas in great depth and unanimously agreed that even though capitalism has made changes and even though the structure of the working class has changed, the historical mission of the working class has not changed. Today, just as in the past, the working class is still being exploited by the capitalist class both intellectually and physically. The working class still represents modern production. Its historical mission is still to eliminate the yoke of capitalist exploitation and transform capitalist society into a more progressive and humane socialist society. Only with the working class will liberating the working class be viewed as tied to liberating all of society. Concluding the symposium, on behalf of the council and the presiding officials at the symposium, Professor Nguyen Duc Binh evaluated the results of the 3-day symposium and mentioned the tasks that must be done following the symposium. He stressed that we agree on many of the problems but that we must continue to study and debate things. As for those issues on which there is a lack of agreement, the committees must continue to study things and organize discussions and debates. The council will reach conclusions in order to have a scientific basis for preparing high-quality instructional materials and satisfying the requirements in studying and teaching Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought in our country today.
