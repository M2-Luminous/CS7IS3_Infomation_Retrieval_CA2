Nonsense, I Am Only a Little Khomeyni-ist" -- first two paragraphs are IL MESSAGGERO introduction] [Text] "I am very outspoken," Irene Pivetti said in April 1992, a few days after landing in parliament thanks to 3,272 votes. She has confirmed this in every way. As a strong Catholic, previously a member of FUCI [Italian Catholic University Federation] and ACLI [Christian Association of Italian Workers] in Milan, director of the monthly IDENTITA, and the president of the Northern League's Catholic Advisory Council [Consulta], Irene Pivetti has never been soft with anybody. She has attacked the Pope: "He must not meddle in politics." She has fired broadsides against Cardinal Martini of Milan: "He interferes unduly." Once she even yelled at the great head of the Northern League Bossi: "He is too much of a planner." Today, she is one step away from the speakership of Montecitorio [lower house]. And if she succeeds, at age 31 she will be the youngest speaker in the history of the republic or nonrepublic. Pivetti speaks four languages including Russian, has been married for six years, and admits that "a hard boiled egg is the only thing she knows how to cook": She does not want to be defined as being the Northern League Joan of Arc ("she is a saint, I am not") or a pasionaria ("I am not"), but a Khomeyini-ist, yes: "At times, in fact, I am a little rigid." And it is precisly this intolerance that the Radicals and Progressives are now denouncing. [Correspondent] Deputy Pivetti, you have been accused of anti-Semitism. [Pivetti] This is nonsense. I cannot be accused of anti-Semitism, I have the utmost respect for diversity. However, I have never made any secret of the fact that I am a Catholic. Rather, my religion permeates my personality, but I can assure that this will in no way interfere with the role of guarantor that I will have to fulfill if elected. I think that these insinuations are mere expedients and also irresponsible at such a critical moment. [Correspondent] In the past you have talked of "Jewish Masonry." Is this not so? [Pivetti] I may have spoken out about the Masonry and also about some Jewish lodges. But I do not think there is anything wrong in that. [Correspondent] But you also expressed a negative opinion concerning the regulations on skin-heads. [Pivetti] That is not so. It was back in November 1992 when the kickback scandal inquiry was in its decisive stages. What I said was that the campaign against racial intolerance was a means of drawing the attention of the Italians away from more serious problems. [Correspondent] What about your antiabortion stance that is causing the Radicals to put their foot down. [Pivetti] There is a law in Italy, Law 194. Now is the time to start implementing it. Including the section that provides for preventing abortion. [Correspondent] [National Alliance Coordinator] Fini has said that: "Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the century." What do you think? [Pivetti] We must acknowledge the fact that he built a part of Italy's history. Both good and bad. [Correspondent] What will your 25 April [Liberation Day] be like? [Pivetti] I hope it will be a celebration of reconciliation. The rights and wrongs of both sides must be acknowledged. [Correspondent] During the last legislative term one of your colleagues shook a noose in the air. What will happen when you are speaker? [Pivetti] There will be no nooses with me. [Correspondent] Once you suggested abolishing the title "honorable." Will you do this again? [Pivetti] Certainly. Instead of "honorable fellow representatives" it will be sufficient to say: "Fellow representatives." Period. [Correspondent] With you as speaker will the League's machismo come to an end? [Pivetti] Well, perhaps the time has come to do away with this myth.
