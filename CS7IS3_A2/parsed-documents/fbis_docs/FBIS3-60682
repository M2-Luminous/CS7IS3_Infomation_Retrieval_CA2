The chilling assessment comes from two high-ranking Beijing-based European diplomats who have sent alarming reports to their governments following the secret fact-finding mission. One of the envoys, an ambassador, writes in his report: ``North Korea has, in our opinion, the full capacity to enrich natural uranium and graphite of North Korean origin and has built several kilo-sized bombs. We established as well that testing sites exist.'' The diplomats had top-level discussions and were met by Kim Chong-il, the 51-year-old heir-apparent to ``great Leader'' Kim Il-song. They expressed to him their concern about the danger North Korea's nuclear weapons programme poses for world peace. The North Koreans prompted speculation that they were acquiring a nuclear capability last March when they withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused further inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Two meetings between North Korean and American officials last month failed to alter the situation. It was then that U.S. President Bill Clinton warned Pyongyang it would not ``be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb'' and urged them to ``crawl back off the ledge.'' In recent weeks, the Central Intelligence Agency said North Korea might have enough weapons-grade plutonium for ``one or two'' bombs...but that assessment seems well short of the mark, according to the European envoys. During their visit, they concluded that North Korea, which originally received help from Soviet nuclear scientists, had perfected the complicated ignition devices needed to explode an atomic bomb. They were also certain the Koreans had adapted short- range Scud-B Soviet missiles for use as launch vehicles. They are producing a Korean version of the improved Scud-C, which they have named Nodong-1. The Nodong-1 has been tested over 650 kilometres but can deliver conventional or atomic bombs over 1,000 kilometres--meaning most major South Korea and Japanese cities would be just 10 minutes away. North Korea has now around 120 Nodong-1 rockets, some of which have been secretly exported to Iran. There are secret testing and weapons development programmes between Iran and North Korea. American military sources believe that Iran has provided nuclear technology that North Korea has been unable to acquire elsewhere. The Koreans have also acquired mobile launching vehicles, according to sources. The Nodong-1 are transported on the chassis of IVECO heavy duty trucks made by Fiat in Italy. The Salzburg-based Austrian company Palfinger Ag, which makes special cranes designed for trucks, has imported crane equipment for this purpose. The cranes can lift the remodelled Scuds on the trucks and move them in seconds from horizontal transport into vertical launching positions. The mobile launching vehicles are difficult to track by spy satellites and therefore difficult to destroy by aircraft or cruise missiles--as the allies found when chasing Iraqi Scuds during the Gulf War. It is believed 30 trucks have been fitted out as mobile launching pads. A Beijing-based military attache said yesterday: ``There is ample evidence of the nuclear programme of North Korea coming from U.S. intelligence. The only question is whether North Korea has managed to change the original crude structure into a bomb and if it can be carried by a rocket. But even that doesn't matter. North Korea can drop the bomb by plane or deliver it by boat if it wants.'' North Korea has also tested the reliability and predictability of the ignition and explosion devices of their bombs. The secret crater-like test site is on the banks of the Kuryong River--very close to Korea's main nuclear research facility at Yongbyon. North Korea has imported from Europe extensive high-explosive testing material and neutron initiator materials, such as polonium 210 and tritium, sources said. The device tested was, according to these experts, the most important evidence that nuclear bombs have been produced. North Korea, like Iraq, has escaped the export monitoring of special testing and diagnostic equipment and the necessary high speed electronic components. It has yet to perform a full-scale nuclear test, but because of sophisticated detection equipment employed by the West, it would not be practical for reasons of secrecy. However, heat output measurements of North Korea's nuclear reactor have given some estimates of the amount of plutonium they have produced--believed to be enough for at least half a dozen bombs.
