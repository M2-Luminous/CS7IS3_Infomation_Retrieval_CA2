FR940527-0-00059 FR940527-0-00020 40 CFR Part 721 [OPPTS&hyph;50615; FRL&hyph;4746&hyph;6] RIN 2070&hyph;AB27 Significant New Uses of Certain Chemical Substances AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is promulgating significant new use rules (SNURs) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for certain chemical substances which were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) and subject to TSCA section 5(e) consent orders issued by EPA. Today's action requires persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process these substances for a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacturing or processing of the substance for a use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice will provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use, and if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it occurs. EPA is promulgating this SNUR using direct final procedures. DATES: The effective date of this rule is July 26, 1994. This rule shall be promulgated for purposes of judicial review at 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on June 10, 1994. If EPA receives notice before June 27, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments on EPA's action in establishing a SNUR for one or more of the chemical substances subject to this rule, EPA will withdraw the SNUR for the substance for which the notice of intent to comment is received and will issue a proposed SNUR providing a 30&hyph;day period for public comment. ADDRESSES: Each comment or notice of intent to submit adverse or critical comment must bear the docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50615 and the name(s) of the chemical substance(s) subject to the comment. All comments should be sent in triplicate to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ATTN: OPPT Document Receipt Office (7407), 401 M St., SW., Rm. E-G099,Washington, DC 20460. All comments which are claimed confidential must be clearly marked as such. Three additional sanitized copies of any comments containing confidential business information (CBI) must also be submitted. Nonconfidential versions of comments on this rule will be placed in the rulemaking record and will be available for public inspection. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This SNUR will require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing manufacturing or processing a substance for any activity designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The supporting rationale and background to this rule are more fully set out in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the Federal Register of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures for the rules and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data. I. Authority Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the substance for that use. The mechanism for reporting under this requirement is established under 40 CFR 721.10. II. Applicability of General Provisions General provisions for SNURs appear under subpart A of 40 CFR part 721. These provisions describe persons subject to the rule, recordkeeping requirements, exemptions to reporting requirements, and applicability of the rule to uses occurring before the effective date of the final rule. Provisions relating to user fees appear at 40 CFR part 700. Persons subject to this SNUR must comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs under section 5(a)(1)(A) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information submission requirements of section 5(b) and 5(d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (2), (3), and (5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities on which it has received the SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, EPA is required under section 5(g) to explain in the Federal Register its reasons for not taking action. Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. Persons who intend to import a chemical substance identified in a final SNUR are subject to the TSCA section 13 import certification requirements, which are codified at 19 CFR 12.118 through 12.127 and 127.28. Such persons must certify that they are in compliance with the SNUR requirements. The EPA policy in support of the import certification appears at 40 CFR part 707. III. Substances Subject to This Rule EPA is establishing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substances under 40 CFR part 721 subpart E. In this unit, EPA provides a brief description for each substance, including its PMN number, chemical name (generic name if the specific name is claimed as CBI), CAS number (if assigned), basis for the action taken by EPA in the section 5(e) consent order or as a non-section 5(e) SNUR for the substance (including the statutory citation and specific finding), toxicity concern, and the CFR citation assigned in the regulatory text section of this rule. The specific uses which are designated as significant new uses are cited in the regulatory text section of the rule by reference to 40 CFR part 721 subpart B where the significant new uses are described in detail. Certain new uses, including production limits and other uses designated in the rule are claimed as CBI. The procedure for obtaining confidential information is set out in Unit VII. of this preamble. Where the underlying section 5(e) order prohibits the PMN submitter from exceeding a specified production limit without performing specific tests to determine the health or environmental effects of a substance, the tests are described in this unit. As explained further in Unit VI. of this preamble, the SNUR for such substances contains the same production limit, and exceeding the production limit is defined as a significant new use. Persons who intend to exceed the production limit must notify the Agency by submitting a significant new use notice (SNUN) at least 90 days in advance. In addition, this unit describes tests that are recommended by EPA to provide sufficient information to evaluate the substance, but for which no production limit has been established in the section 5(e) order. Descriptions of recommended tests are provided for informational purposes. Data on potential exposures or releases of the substances, testing other than that specified in the section 5(e) order for the substances, or studies on analogous substances, which may demonstrate that the significant new uses being reported do not present an unreasonable risk, may be included with significant new use notification. Persons submitting a SNUN must comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs, as stated in 40 CFR 721.1(c), including submission of test data on health and environmental effects as described in 40 CFR 720.50. EPA is not publishing SNURs for 14 PMN substances: P&hyph;93&hyph;67, P&hyph;93&hyph;68, P&hyph;93&hyph;184, P&hyph;93&hyph;185, P&hyph;93&hyph;186, P&hyph;93&hyph;187, P&hyph;93&hyph;188, P&hyph;93&hyph;190, P&hyph;93&hyph;282, P&hyph;93&hyph;317, P&hyph;93&hyph;318, P&hyph;93&hyph;476, P&hyph;93&hyph;721, and P&hyph;93&hyph;959 which are subject to a final 5(e) consent order. The 5(e) consent orders for these substances are derived from an exposure finding based solely on substantial production volume and significant or substantial human exposure and/or release to the environment of substantial quantities. For these cases there were limited or no toxicity data available for the PMN substances. In such cases, EPA regulates the new chemical substances under section 5(e) by requiring certain toxicity tests. For instance, chemical substances with potentially substantial releases to surface waters would be subject to toxicity testing of aquatic organisms and chemicals with potentially substantial human exposures would be subject to health effects testing for mutagenicity, acute effects, and subchronic effects. However, for these substances the short-term toxicity testing required by the 5(e) order is usually completed within 1 to 2 years of notice of commencement. EPA's experience with exposure-based SNURs requiring short-term testing is that the SNUR is often revoked within 1 to 2 years when the test results are received. Rather than issue and revoke SNURs in such a short span of time, EPA will defer publication of exposure-based SNURs until either a Notice of Commencement (NOC) or data demonstrating risk are received unless the toxicity testing required is long-term. EPA is issuing this explanation and notification as required in 40 CFR 721.160(a)(2) as it has determined that SNURs are not needed at this time for these substances which are subject to a final 5(e) consent order under TSCA. The section 5(e) orders for P&hyph;92&hyph;776, P&hyph;92&hyph;777, and P&hyph;93&hyph;214 contain new chemical exposure limits (NCEL) provisions. In each case, the section 5(e) order allows the PMN submitter and the submitter's customers to protect workers by controlling and monitoring airborne concentrations of the substance present in the workplace as an alternative to certain respirator requirements. A clause had been added to these SNURs stating that as an alternative to the respiratory protection designated in the SNUR, manufacturers, importers, and processors may follow the same NCEL provisions found in the section 5(e) consent orders for these substances, including using only EPA-approved sampling and analytical methods if approval is stipulated by the 5(e) consent order. No general NCEL language has been added to the regulatory text of the corresponding SNURs as EPA expects that only manufacturers, importers, and processors with access to the original 5(e) consent order of the original PMN submitter will be able to readily use this clause. EPA recommends that any company proposing to substitute NCEL or other alternative control measures for SNUR provisions consult EPA either by submitting a SNUN or requesting a determination of equivalency under the procedures for ``EPA Approval of Alternative Control Measures'' in §721.30. PMN Number P&hyph;88&hyph;1304 Chemical name: (generic) Polypiperidinol-acrylate methacrylate. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: January 1, 1989. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health. Toxicity concern: Similar chemicals have been shown to cause immunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and chronic toxicity. The PMN substance has demonstrated acute toxicity and internal organ effects in toxicity studies. Recommended testing: A 90&hyph;day oral subchronic toxicity study in rats (40 CFR 798.2650) is recommended to address the potential health concerns. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed the production volume limit without performing the 90&hyph;day subchronic study. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.4794. PMN Numbers P&hyph;88&hyph;1937 and P&hyph;88&hyph;1938 Chemical name: (generic) Substituted 2-nitro- and 2-aminobenzesulfonamide. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: September 15, 1993. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that these substances may present an unreasonable risk of injury to the environment. Toxicity concern: Similar chemicals have been shown to cause aquatic and terrestrial toxicity in test species. Based on this data, EPA expects toxicity to aquatic organisms to occur at concentrations of 100 ppb (parts per billion) for P&hyph;88&hyph;1937 and 10 ppb for P&hyph;88&hyph;1938 in surface waters. EPA has determined that certain uses of the PMN substances could result in releases to surface waters where the concentration would be greater than 100 ppb for P&hyph;88&hyph;1937 and greater than 10 ppb for P&hyph;88&hyph;1938. Recommended testing: To help characterize the terrestrial effects, the following studies are recommended: Inherent biodegradation in soil (40 CFR 796.3400), earthworm toxicity test (§795.150, proposed June 26, 1991 (56 FR 29155)), early seedling growth test (40 CFR 797.2800), soil microbial community test (40 CFR 797.3700), and aerobic biodegradation test (aquatic) (40 CFR 796.3100). To help characterize the aquatic toxicity effects, the following studies are recommended: Acute algal (40 CFR 797.1050) (static/nominal conditions), acute daphnid (40 CFR 797.1300) (flow-through/measured conditions), and acute fish (40 CFR 797.1400) (flow-through/measured conditions). CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.1612. PMN Number P&hyph;91&hyph;659 Chemical name: (generic) 2-Chloro-4,6-bis(substituted)-1,3,5-triazine, dihydrochloride. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: July 20, 1993. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to environment. Toxicity concern: Similar chemicals have been shown to cause aquatic and terrestrial toxicity in test species. Based on this data, EPA expects toxicity to aquatic organisms to occur at a concentration of 10 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters. EPA has determined that certain uses of the PMN substance could result in releases to surface waters where the concentration of the PMN substance would be greater than 10 ppb. Recommended testing: To help characterize the terrestrial effects, the following studies are recommended: Early life seedling growth toxicity study (40 CFR 797.2800), inherent biodegradation in soil (40 CFR 796.3400), earthworm subchronic toxicity study (§795.150, proposed June 26, 1991 (56 FR 29155)), soil microbial community toxicity study (40 CFR 797.3700), and plant life cycle growth test (40 CFR 797.2830). To help characterize the aquatic toxicity effects, the following studies are recommended: Acute algal study (40 CFR 797.1050), acute daphnia study (40 CFR 797.1300), and acute fish study (40 CFR 797.1400). CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.9750. PMN Number P&hyph;91&hyph;689 Chemical name: (generic) Trisubstituted anthracene. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: October 6, 1993. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment. Toxicity concern: Laboratory animal test data on chemicals similar in structure to the PMN substance indicate that the PMN substance may cause carcinogenicity in humans. Similar substances have also been shown to cause toxicity in aquatic organisms. Specifically, based on quantitative structural activity relationships on similar neutral organic compounds, EPA predicts acute toxicity to aquatic organisms could occur at 2 ppb in surface waters. Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay (Ames test) (40 CFR 798.5625) and a 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a ]anthracene-12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate tumor promoter test may help characterize the carcinogenic effects of the PMN substance. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed specified production limits without performing these tests. However, the results of each preceding study will be used by EPA to determine if the next study may not be required. EPA believes that an oncogenicity test (two-species, dermal) (40 CFR 798.3300) would help characterize the human health effects and the following aquatic toxicity tests would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance: A 96&hyph;h bioassay in algae (40 CFR 797.1050), a 48&hyph;h LC50 test in Daphnia (40 CFR 797.1300), and a 96&hyph;h LC50 test in fish (40 CFR 797.1400). CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.715. PMN Numbers P&hyph;92&hyph;776 and P&hyph;92&hyph;777 Chemical name: (generic) Carboxylic acid glycidyl esters. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: June 25, 1993. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that these substances may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. Toxicity concern: Similar chemicals have been shown to cause carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and developmental and reproductive toxicities in test animals. Test data on P&hyph;92&hyph;777 indicate the potential for eye corrosion and lung damage. Similar chemicals have also been shown to cause toxic effects in aquatic organisms.

Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: August 7, 1993. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health. Toxicity concern: Test data on structurally similar chemical substances have been shown to cause developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity in test animals. Recommended testing: The Agency has determined that the results of the following toxicity testing and exposure monitoring would help characterize possible human health risks caused by the manufacture, import, processing, and use of the PMN substance: A 28&hyph;day inhalation study in rats (OECD guideline 407) modified to include a functional observation battery and neuropathology (NTIS: PB 91&hyph;1546170), and workplace airborne monitoring (NIOSH Analytical Methods nos. 0500 and 0600, total nuisance dust and respirable nuisance dust, respectively). CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.982. PMN Number P&hyph;93&hyph;333 Chemical name: (generic) Lecithins, phospholipase A2-hydrolyzed. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: July 9, 1993. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that these substances may present an unreasonable risk of injury to the environment. Toxicity concern: Test data on structurally similar chemical substances indicate that the PMN substances may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms. Based on this data, EPA expects toxicity to aquatic organisms to occur at a concentration of 10 ppb of the PMN substances in surface waters. EPA has determined that certain uses of the PMN substances could result in releases to surface waters where the concentration of the PMN substances would be greater than 10 ppb. Recommended testing: The Agency has determined that the results of the following acute aquatic toxicity testing would help characterize possible environmental effects of the substances: Algal (40 CFR 797.1050), daphnid (40 CFR 797.1300), fish (40 CFR 797.1400), and fish acute toxicity mitigated by humic acid (40 CFR 850.1085). All tests should be conducted with static conditions and nominal concentrations. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed the production volume limit without performing these tests. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.4585. PMN Number P&hyph;93&hyph;364 Chemical name: (generic) Polyepoxy polyol. CAS number: Not available. Basis for action: The PMN substance will be used as a coating. Based on analogy to epoxides, the PMN substance may cause cancer and reproductive effects. EPA has determined that workers exposed by inhalation may be at risk for these toxic effects. EPA determined that use of the substance as a granule as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because significant inhalation exposure will not occur. EPA has determined that use in a powder form may result in significant inhalation exposures. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at §721.170(b)(1)(i)(C) and (b)(3)(ii). Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a 90&hyph;day oral subchronic study with special attention to the testes (40 CFR 798.2650) will help characterize the health effects of the PMN substance. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.7710. PMN Number P&hyph;93&hyph;699 Chemical name: (generic) Substituted benzenedicarboxylic acid ester. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: September 21, 1993. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. Toxicity concern: Similar chemicals have been shown to cause cancer in test animals and ecotoxicity effects in aquatic organisms. Recommended testing: EPA has determined that the results of a 2&hyph;year rodent bioassay (40 CFR 798.33) would help characterize the potential carcinogenic effects of the PMN substance. In addition, to characterize the potential aquatic toxicity effects, EPA has determined that an acute algal study (40 CFR 797.1050), an acute daphnid study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an acute fish study (40 CFR 797.1400) would be helpful. Human health toxicity data on representative members of the acrylate/methacrylate class of chemical substances being developed by certain acrylate and methacrylate manufacturers may also be useful in evaluating the risk posed by the PMN substance. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.2930. PMN Number P&hyph;93&hyph;1047 Chemical name: Benzenesulfonic acid, 4-methyl-, reaction products with oxirane mono[(C 10-16 -alkyloxy)methyl] derivatives and 2,2,4(or 2,4,4)-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine. CAS number: 147170&hyph;38&hyph;5. Basis for action: The PMN substance will be used as a coatings component. Based on analogy of the substance to neutral organic substances, EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 1 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases to surface waters. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at §721.170(b)(4)(iii). Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.1645. PMN Number P&hyph;93&hyph;1119 Chemical name: (generic) Organotin lithium compound. CAS number: Not available. Toxicity concern: The substance will be used as a catalyst. Test data on organotin pesticides indicate that the substance may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms. Based on these data, EPA expects toxicity to aquatic organisms to occur at a concentration of 1 ppb of the substance in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that manufacture, processing, and use of the substance for uses other than as a catalyst could result in releases to surface waters. Based on this information, the substance meets the concern criteria at §721.170(b)(4)(iii). Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.9668. PMN Number P&hyph;93&hyph;1166 Chemical name: (generic) Alkylsulfonium salt. CAS number: Not available. Basis for action: The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy to dialkyl cationic quaternary nitrogen surfactants, EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 50 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters resulting in concentrations above 50 ppb. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases to surface water at concentrations above 50 ppb. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at §721.170(b)(4)(iii). Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.7655. PMN Number P&hyph;93&hyph;1183 Chemical name: (generic) Substituted quinoline. CAS number: Not available. Basis for action: The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy of the substance to neutral organic substances, EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 20 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters. Based on analogy of the substance to other quinolines, EPA is concerned that developmental and reproductive toxicity may occur to exposed workers. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters and significant worker exposure would not occur because the substance was used in an enclosed process. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases to surface waters which exceed the concern concentration and significant worker exposure. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at §721.170(b)(4)(iii) and (b)(3)(ii). Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance. EPA has determined that a two-generation reproduction study (40 CFR 798.4700), and a developmental toxicity study (40 CFR 708.4900) would help characterize the health effects of the PMN substance.

Basis for action: The PMN substances will be used as intermediates. Based on analogy of the substances to ester compounds, EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 80 ppb of P&hyph;93&hyph;1193, 1194, 1195, and 1196, and 60 ppb of P&hyph;93&hyph;1203 and 1204, in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substances as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substances would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that other uses of the substances may result in releases to surface waters. Based on this information, the PMN substances meet the concern criteria at §721.170(b)(4) (iii). Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substances.

Basis for action: The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy to acrylates, the PMN substance may cause cancer and may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms in surface waters at concentrations as low as 60 ppb. EPA has determined that persons exposed dermally to the PMN substance may be at risk for cancer. EPA determined that use of the substance as an intermediate did not present an unreasonable risk because there were no significant dermal exposures or environmental releases. EPA has determined that use of the substance other than as an intermediate may result in significant dermal or environmental exposures. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at §721.170(b)(3)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii). Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a 2&hyph;year two-species oral bioassay (40 CFR 798.3300) would help characterize the health effects of the PMN substance and a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.8654. PMN Number P&hyph;93&hyph;1381 Chemical name: (generic) Aliphatic ether. CAS number: Not available. Basis for action: The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy of the substance to neutral organic substances, EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 400 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases to surface waters which exceed the concern concentration. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at §721.170(b)(4)(iii). Recommended testing: EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.3364. IV. Objectives and Rationale of the Rule During review of the PMNs submitted for the chemical substances that are subject to this SNUR, EPA concluded that for 10 of the substances regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make reasoned evaluations of the health or environmental effects of the substances. The basis for such findings is outlined in Unit III. of this preamble. Based on these findings, section 5(e) consent orders requiring the use of appropriate controls were negotiated with the PMN submitters; the SNUR provisions for these substances designated herein are consistent with the provisions of the section 5(e) orders. In the other 22 cases for which the proposed uses are not regulated under a section 5(e) order, EPA determined that one or more of the criteria of concern established at 40 CFR 721.170 were met. EPA is issuing this SNUR for specific chemical substances which have undergone premanufacture review to ensure that: EPA will receive notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process a listed chemical substance for a significant new use before that activity begins; EPA will have an opportunity to review and evaluate data submitted in a SNUN before the notice submitter begins manufacturing, importing, or processing a listed chemical substance for a significant new use; when necessary to prevent unreasonable risks EPA will be able to regulate prospective manufacturers, importers, or processors of a listed chemical substance before a significant new use of that substance occurs; and all manufacturers, importers, and processors of the same chemical substance which is subject to a section 5(e) order are subject to similar requirements. Issuance of a SNUR for a chemical substance does not signify that the substance is listed on the TSCA Inventory. Manufacturers, importers, and processors are responsible for ensuring that a new chemical substance subject to a final SNUR is listed on the TSCA Inventory. V. Direct Final Procedure EPA is issuing these SNURs as direct final rules, as described in 40 CFR 721.160(c)(3) and 721.170(d)(4). In accordance with 40 CFR 721.160(c)(3)(ii), this rule will be effective July 26, 1994, unless EPA receives a written notice by June 27, 1994 that someone wishes to make adverse or critical comments on EPA's action. If EPA receives such a notice, EPA will publish a notice to withdraw the direct final SNUR(s) for the specific substance(s) to which the adverse or critical comments apply. EPA will then propose a SNUR for the specific substance(s) providing a 30&hyph;day comment period. This action establishes SNURs for a number of chemical substances. Any person who submits a notice of intent to submit adverse or critical comments must identify the substance and the new use to which it applies. EPA will not withdraw a SNUR for a substance not identified in a notice. VI. Test Data and Other Information EPA recognizes that section 5 of TSCA does not require developing any particular test data before submission of a SNUN. Persons are required only to submit test data in their possession or control and to describe any other data known to or reasonably ascertainable by them. In cases where a section 5(e) order requires or recommends certain testing, Unit III. of this preamble lists those recommended tests. However, EPA has established production limits in the section 5(e) orders for several of the substances regulated under this rule, in view of the lack of data on the potential health and environmental risks that may be posed by the significant new uses or increased exposure to the substances. These production limits cannot be exceeded unless the PMN submitter first submits the results of toxicity tests that would permit a reasoned evaluation of the potential risks posed by these substances. Under recent consent orders, each PMN submitter is required to submit each study at least 14 weeks (earlier orders required submissions at least 12 weeks) before reaching the specified production limit. Listings of the tests specified in the section 5(e) orders are included in Unit III. of this preamble. The SNURs contain the same production volume limits as the consent orders. Exceeding these production limits is defined as a significant new use. The recommended studies may not be the only means of addressing the potential risks of the substance. However, SNUNs submitted for significant new uses without any test data may increase the likelihood that EPA will take action under section 5(e), particularly if satisfactory test results have not been obtained from a prior submitter. EPA recommends that potential SNUN submitters contact EPA early enough so that they will be able to conduct the appropriate tests. SNUN submitters should be aware that EPA will be better able to evaluate SNUNs which provide detailed information on: (1) Human exposure and environmental release that may result from the significant new use of the chemical substances. (2) Potential benefits of the substances. (3) Information on risks posed by the substances compared to risks posed by potential substitutes. VII. Procedural Determinations EPA is establishing through this rule some significant new uses which have been claimed as CBI. EPA is required to keep this information confidential to protect the CBI of the original PMN submitter. EPA promulgated a procedure to deal with the situation where a specific significant new use is CBI. This procedure appears in 40 CFR 721.1725(b)(1) and is similar to that in §721.11 for situations where the chemical identity of the substance subject to a SNUR is CBI. This procedure is cross-referenced in each of these SNURs. A manufacturer or importer may request EPA to determine whether a proposed use would be a significant new use under this rule. Under the procedure incorporated from §721.1725(b)(1), a manufacturer or importer must show that it has a bona fide intent to manufacture or import the substance and must identify the specific use for which it intends to manufacture or import the substance. If EPA concludes that the person has shown a bona fide intent to manufacture or import the substance, EPA will tell the person whether the use identified in the bona fide submission would be a significant new use under the rule. Since most of the chemical identities of the substances subject to these SNURs are also CBI, manufacturers and processors can combine the bona fide submission under the procedure in §721.1725(b)(1) with that under §721.11 into a single step. If a manufacturer or importer is told that the production volume identified in the bona fide submission would not be a significant new use, i.e. it is below the level that would be a significant new use, that person can manufacture or import the substance as long as the aggregate amount does not exceed that identified in the bona fide submission to EPA. If the person later intends to exceed that volume, a new bona fide submission would be necessary to determine whether that higher volume would be a significant new use. EPA is considering whether to adopt a special procedure for use when CBI production volume is designated as a significant new use. Under such a procedure, a person showing a bona fide intent to manufacture or import the substance, under the procedure described in §721.11, would automatically be informed of the production volume that would be a significant new use. Thus the person would not have to make multiple bona fide submissions to EPA for the same substance to remain in compliance with the SNUR, as could be the case under the procedures in §721.1725(b)(1). VIII. Applicability of Rule to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final Rule To establish a significant ``new'' use, EPA must determine that the use is not ongoing. The chemical substances subject to this rule have recently undergone premanufacture review. Section 5(e) orders have been issued for 10 substances and notice submitters are prohibited by the section 5(e) orders from undertaking activities which EPA is designating as significant new uses. In cases where EPA has not received an NOC and the substance has not been added to the Inventory, no other person may commence such activities without first submitting a PMN. For substances for which an NOC has not been submitted at this time, EPA has concluded that the uses are not ongoing. However, EPA recognizes in cases when chemical substances identified in this SNUR are added to the Inventory prior to the effective date of the rule, the substances may be manufactured, imported, or processed by other persons for a significant new use as defined in this rule before the effective date of the rule. However, 14 of the 32 substances contained in this rule have CBI chemical identities, and since EPA has received a limited number of post-PMN bona fide submissions, the Agency believes that it is highly unlikely that any of the significant new uses described in the following regulatory text are ongoing. As discussed in the Federal Register of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376), EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as of this date of publication rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substances regulated through this SNUR will have to cease any such activity before the effective date of this rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUN requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. EPA has promulgated provisions to allow persons to comply with this SNUR before the effective date. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance under §721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between publication and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUN requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. IX. Economic Analysis EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers, importers, and processors of the chemical substance subject to this rule. EPA's complete economic analysis is available in the public record for this rule (OPPTS&hyph;50615). X. Rulemaking Record EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50615). The record includes information considered by EPA in developing this rule. A public version of the record without any confidential business information is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located at Rm. E&hyph;G099, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. XI. Regulatory Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has determined that approximately 10 percent of the parties affected by this rule could be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substances. Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by this rule will not be substantial, even if all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms. C. Paperwork Reduction Act. The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), and have been assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (2070&hyph;0012), Washington, DC 20503. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 721 Environmental protection, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Significant new uses. Dated: May 6, 1994. Lynn R. Goldman, Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, 40 CFR part 721 is amended as follows: PART 721_[AMENDED] 1.

Recordkeeping requirements as specified in §721.125(a) through (i) and (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance. (2) Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements. The provisions of §721.185 apply to this section. 3. By adding new §721.982 to subpart E to read as follows: §721.982 Calcium, bis(2,4-pentanedionato- O,O ). (a) Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting. (1) The chemical substance calcium, bis(2,4-pentanedionato-O,O ) (PMN P&hyph;93&hyph;214, CAS no. 19372&hyph;44&hyph;2) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply if the substance is embedded or encapsulated in a plastic matrix. (2) The significant new uses are: (i) Protection in the workplace. Requirements as specified in §721.63(a)(4), (a)(5)(iii), (a)(5)(iv), (a)(5)(v), (a)(5)(vi), (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), (a)(6)(iv), (b) (concentration set a 1.0 percent); and (c). As an alternative to the respiratory requirements in this section, manufacturers, importers, and processors may use the New Chemical Exposure Limits provisions, including sampling and analytical methods which have previously been approved by EPA for this substance, found in the 5(e) consent order for this substance. (ii) Hazard communication program. Requirements as specified in §721.72(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), (f), (g)(1)(iii), (g)(1)(ix), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv), and (g)(5). (iii) Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities. Requirements as specified in §721.80(l). (b) Specific requirements.

Recordkeeping requirements as specified in §721.125(a) through (d), (f) through (h), and (i) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance. (2) Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements. The provisions of §721.185 apply to this section. 4. By adding new §721.1612 to subpart E to read as follows: §721.1612 Substituted 2-nitro- and 2-aminobenzesulfonamide. (a) Chemical substances and significant new uses subject to reporting. (1) The chemical substances identified generically as substituted 2-nitro- and 2-aminobenzenesulfonamide (PMNs P&hyph;88&hyph;1937 and P&hyph;88&hyph;1938) are subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (2) The significant new uses are: (i) Hazard communication program. Requirements as specified in §721.72 (a) through (d), (f), (g)(3)(i), (g)(3)(ii), (g)(4)(i), and (g)(5). The following additional statements shall appear on each label and MSDS required by this paragraph: This substance may be toxic to terrestrial organisms and plants. Notice to user: Release to water restrictions apply. (ii) Disposal. Requirements as specified in §721.85. A significant new use of these substances is any release of the substances to land. (iii) Release to water. Requirements as specified in §721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 100 ppb for P&hyph;88&hyph;1937 and N = 10 ppb for P&hyph;88&hyph;1938). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in §721.91(a)(4), the statement that the amount of the substances that will be released will be calculated before the substances enter control technology does not apply.
