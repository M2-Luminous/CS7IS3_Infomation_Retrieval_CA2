As it were, it was an unofficial meeting of a little less than an hour, but during the meeting we covered a wide range of topics, such as the critical nuclear problems posed by North Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), the state of development of the meetings between U.S. and North Korean high government officials, Japan's political reform Diet, and the drastic reform policy by Kim Yong-sam's South Korean Government. When I took my leave of the ambassador after the passage of our allotted time, I said to him as a matter of form: "I should very much like to see you in Tokyo some day." Ambassador Han winked at me, saying: "If I were appointed ambassador to Japan, I could meet you very often. But do not tell this to the present ambassador." I was a little surprised and impressed by his ready wit and humor. The reason is that I have heard Ambassador Han is an influential person expected to become deputy prime minister and minister of the Economic Planning Board. Almost all of the influential persons who assumed important posts under the No government were purged by the Kim Yong-sam government, and Ambassador Han is a rare exception. Such an influential ambassador talked to me frankly, listened to me with attention, and furthermore made a witty remark in reply which convinced me of his greatness. At the same time, that made me think of our Japanese ambassador to the United States, and inadvertently made me compare the Japanese and South Korean ambassadors. My frank impression is there is a great difference between the two men. Takakazu Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, occupies a very high level in Japan as a diplomat. His father was also a diplomat. He has a good family background and served as a bureaucrat within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as chief of the Legal Affairs Division of the Treaties Bureau; chief of the Personnel Division of the Minister's Secretariat; director general of the Treaties Bureau; and director general of the North American Affairs Division. He was expected to be "future administrative vice minister" earlier on. He became administrative vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1989 and ambassador to the United States in 1992. He is nimble and a model of the serious-minded "elite." He is also a spirited man, for during the Gulf war he offered resistance to the dispatch of the Self-Defense Forces as proposed by Ichiro Ozawa, then secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, and was deprived of his position. In short, although both Japanese and South Korean ambassadors to the United States are excellent, they are evaluated quite differently in Washington. My cursory inquiry into the matter prompted the following responses from diplomatic sources in Washington: "Ambassador Han certainly has a good command of English. Most of all, he has a sense of humor and a rich stock of topics, which makes him popular in diplomatic circles. Therefore, he is always called upon to make a speech. However, although Ambassador Kuriyama is good at English, to our regret his speeches are uninteresting. Thus, he is rarely called upon to speak." The story goes that a member of the Japanese Embassy staff happened to listen to Ambassador Han's speech at the National Press Club in Washington in July 1993 and breathed the following remark: "He will never find this fellow." To my regret, I am obliged to say that the Japanese ambassador is slightly outdistanced by the South Korean ambassador. What Is the Ambassador Doing? Is the difference between the Japanese and South Korean ambassadors to the United States only a matter of a sense of humor and their skillfulness in making a speech? The answer is absolutely in the negative. [ Therefore, the problem is what kind of diplomatic activity are the Japanese ambassador and the embassy staff engaged in? We have heard some true stories about how Japanese ambassadors to the United States were not very useful at critical moments. For example, a famous story is told about former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Ryohei Murata (present ambassador to Germany) who, upon arriving at his post, had considerable difficulty in meeting with Secretary of State Baker despite his repeated contacts with the White House under the Bush administration. Another occasion occurred in November 1991 when the Miyazawa cabinet, which had just came to power, turned pale due to the sudden postponement of President Bush's visit to Japan which had already been scheduled. Ambassador Murata tried to meet with Brent Scowcroft (in charge of national security), but without success. Ambassador Murata managed to meet with Scowcroft through the good offices of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nobuo Matsunaga (currently a government representative) who was in the United States in connection with the public relations of the newly established Miyazawa administration, and who was an old friend of Scowcroft. Murata was told by the United States that President Bush's visit to Japan was not canceled but only postponed. In addition, recently there was another occurrence. Ambassador Kuriyama managed to meet with Secretary of State Christopher four months after the inauguration of the Clinton administration. Armacost, a former U.S. ambassador to Japan, said "the relationship between Japan and the United States is the most important bilateral relationship," but Ambassador Kuriyama could not meet with the U.S. secretary of state -- which corresponds to the Japanese foreign minister -- for four months. Ambassador Kuriyama met with Secretary of State Christopher only because they had business to attend to in preparation for a Japan-U.S. summit meeting. At that time, the rumor spread that Ambassador Kuriyama would be replaced. Compared with Japanese ambassadors who have often been slighted in this way, South Korean Ambassador Han Sung-su is conspicuous for his unique and strenuous efforts. Compared with Japanese ambassadors, South Korean ambassadors are handicapped and cannot easily meet with high U.S. officials even if they want to. Therefore, Ambassador Han tried to gain access to the White House by energetically working by himself. Through the good offices of Vernon Jordan, a big-shot lawyer in charge of the transitional team for the Clinton administration, and of former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Robert Strauss, the most influential senior member of the Democratic Party, Ambassador Han made resolute approaches to the White House. After the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit meeting held in Seattle in November last year, the Clinton-Kim meeting was realized, which was said to be largely attributable to Han's contacts. The first banquet held by President Clinton for foreign heads of state visiting the United States was for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. Whichever country it may be, ambassadors to the United States play an important role in deciding that country's diplomatic policy. This is especially the case with the relationship between Japan and the United States. Viewed from the U.S. position, this is evident by the fact that Ambassadors Reischauer and Mansfield led U.S. policy toward Japan. In this respect, Japanese ambassadors to the United States cannot compare with their South Korean counterparts. Not only the ambassador but also the diplomats of the South Korean Embassy in the United States are very active. Concerning the collection of material from public hearings in Congress, which is the important work of diplomats, diplomats of the South Korean Embassy diligently visit both the Senate and House of Representatives, and never fail to follow the themes under their charge and collect information on them. On the other hand, the diplomats of the Japanese Embassy do not visit the U.S. Congress very often, and they seldom collect materials on public hearings held by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which should be considered the most important hearings. Even if they do attend, they entrust actual work to the local staff. Top officials at the embassy say, "We are short of hands and thus we cannot cover them." The reason for their being busy is that they have "chores," which are called attendance. In short, they have to receive and welcome politicians, local government leaders, and the heads of ministries and agencies, which prevents them from completely carrying out the primary functions of diplomats. The Decline of the North American Affairs Bureau We have touched on the fringe of the malfunctioning of the Japanese Embassy in the United States. Now, how is the decisionmaking of the bureaucratic organization carried out? In other words, by what process are policy decisions made? Here we would like to investigate the actual state of decisionmaking by verifying Japan's policy toward the United States. As Mr. Taichi Sakaiya [not further identified] says, "the myth that Japan and the United States are inseparable" is one of the three "myths" that have prescribed Japanese politics under the so-called 1955 system, together with "the myth that the administration of the Liberal Democratic Party is eternal" and "the myth that the bureaucrats are dependable." Japan's diplomacy as the embodiment of the myth that Japan and the United States are inseparable is based on the Japanese-U.S. axis, and Japan's diplomacy toward the United States has been Japan's diplomacy itself. And, in the structure (organization) of the Foreign Ministry, this policy toward the United States is supposed to function under the hierarchies commanded by the administrative vice minister of foreign affairs. There are two lines of authority: One is the chief of the First North American Division (politics), the director general of the North American Affairs Bureau, and the deputy vice minister of foreign affairs (in charge of politics); and the other is the chief of the Second North American Division (economics), the director general of the North American Affairs Bureau, the director general of the Economic Affairs Bureau, and the deputy vice minister of foreign affairs (in charge of economics). In short, this is the organizational mechanism that governs the decisionmaking of the Foreign Ministry. As its name indicates, the director general of the North American Affairs Bureau is the key man who plans and implements Japan's policy toward the United States, and he holds the central post in the mechanism of the decisionmaking of the Foreign Ministry. Therefore, under the reality that Japan's diplomacy toward the United States is Japan's diplomacy itself, the holding of the post of director general of the North American Affairs Bureau has meant climbing the ladder of success for the bureaucrats of the Foreign Ministry. And, in fact, the persons who held the post of director general of the North American Affairs Bureau such as So Yasukawa and Fumihiko Togo have been promoted, through the post of administrative vice minister, to be ambassadors to big countries such as the United States. However, the popular belief that holding the post of director general of the North American Affairs Bureau will ensure one the post of administrative vice minister and eventually the post of Japanese ambassador to the United States did not apply to the last four directors general of the North American Affairs Bureau. They are: Hiroaki Fujii, incumbent ambassador to Thailand, who was director general of the North American Affairs Bureau during the Nakasone administration; Tatsuo Arima, incumbent ambassador to the Netherlands, who was director general of the North American Affairs Bureau at the time of the Takeshita administration when frictions between Japan and the United States over communications and construction issues were at their peak; Koichiro Matsuura, incumbent deputy vice minister of foreign affairs (in charge of economics), who was director general of the North American Affairs Bureau during the Kaifu administration when the Gulf war broke out; and Yukio Sato, incumbent director general of the North American Affairs Bureau and who is expected to be transferred as the ambassador to a medium-sized country in Europe. Considering that the last four directors general of the North American Affairs Bureau fell off the ladder of success, Kasumigaseki [the seat of Japanese bureaucracy] expressed the opinion that "the North American Affairs Bureau has lost its influence." Actually, the decline of the voice and influence of the bureau's director general is noticeable in various ways. However, this phenomenon is not confined to Japan. The truth is the United States has also greatly changed its diplomacy toward Japan. Under the Bush administration there was a team of three policymakers in the White House, with presidential aide Brent Scowcroft as the central figure. In the State Department there was the assistant undersecretary of state in charge of East Asia-Pacific affairs; he played a leading role in the U.S. policy toward Japan. However, under the Clinton administration the National Economic Council (NEC) was newly established, and this White House carriage is pulled by a pair: Anthony Lake, who is in charge of the National Security Council, and Robert Rubin, who is in charge of the National Economic Council. The subsidence of the National Security Council is also noticeable here, and Lake is called a "lame duck," which metaphorically means "he is virtually dead." It is somewhat symbolic that the key men for both sides -- the director general of the North American Affairs Bureau within Japan's Foreign Ministry, and the presidential aide in charge of the U.S. National Security Council -- are both on the decline. There is an interesting story in connection with this matter. Director General Sato of the North American Affairs Bureau has been friendly with Anthony Lake ever since his service with the Embassy in the United States during the Nixon administration, to the point he entered his daughter in Mount Holyoke College where Lake had taught; Lake is also the guarantor of Sato's daughter. Therefore, when it became certain Clinton would win the U.S. presidential election in the fall of 1992 and Lake would become a member of the White House, Sato no longer hid "his long association with Lake." However, the Clinton administration's diplomatic and security team made a mistake as regards the former Yugoslavia, Haiti, and Somalia, which made the resignation of Defense Secretary Aspin inevitable. In addition, Lake is also on the verge of being fired. In short, Sato could not foresee the subsidence of the National Security Council. A phenomenon considered to be a kind of diastrophism in the decisionmaking mechanism of the Foreign Ministry seems to be taking place in other posts besides the director generalship of the North American Affairs Bureau. The chief of the bureau's First North America Division is the implementor of Japan's policy toward the United States. For Foreign Ministry bureaucrats, holding this post means entering the fast track of advancement, if not the fastest track. However, recently those who occupied the post have failed to enter the fast track of advancement. It is possible they happened not to qualify for that post, but we cannot deny that former chiefs of the First North America Division have also increasingly failed to enter that track. To cite concrete examples, in the past there was Yoshio Karita (ambassador to Denmark); recently there was Sadaaki Numata (councilor in charge of press), Ryuichiro Yamasaki (minister to Britain); Yukio Okamoto (retired), and Nobuaki Tanaka (counselor to Thailand). As stated above, recently successive chiefs of the First North America Division have failed to become top bureaucrats within the Foreign Ministry. What does the subsidence of the director general of the North American Affairs Bureau and chief of the First North America Division signify? To mention one thing about the recent trend, this phenomenon coincides with changes in the U.S. policy towards Japan. Before the collapse of the Cold War structure, the Japanese and U.S. decisionmaking concerning the Japan-U.S. relationship was in good order. Under the Bush administration, Scowcroft was the number one man in the White House, while Karl Jackson, the chief of the NSC's Asian Division, and Doug Pearl, head of the Japan Section, managed the U.S. policy toward Japan. Japan conducted its decisionmaking toward the United States under the following lineup: the chief of the First North America Division, the director general of the North American Affairs Bureau, the deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, and the administrative vice minister of foreign affairs. With the end of the Cold War, there was a relative decrease in the need for security, which was the axis of the Japan-U.S. relationship. Furthermore, with the appearance of President Clinton who "decides everything by himself," the U.S. lineup collapsed, which influenced Japanese decisionmaking. As a result, the arrangement which "attaches too much importance to the North American Affairs Bureau" has lost its balance, causing chaos in the Foreign Ministry's decisionmaking mechanism. In other words, this proves that the Foreign Ministry's decisionmaking process has been conducted by a very small number of bureaucratic elite, sometimes in a very arbitrary manner and without a spirit of independence, following in the footsteps of the United States. In addition, there lies in the background the deadlock of the distinct vertical system observed by Japanese bureaucracy. The Foreign Ministry has always advocated the "centralization of diplomacy," but the "centralization of diplomacy" and the vertical system of administration have become increasingly incompatible with each other amid the mutability of the world situation due to the end of the Cold War as well as to the acceleration of a borderless economy. The reason is the Foreign Ministry finds it difficult to take the complete initiative in any given field -- such as Japan-U.S. trade frictions in every field, peacekeeping operations, the preservation of the Earth's environment, and rice. Under such circumstances, the decisionmaking process initiated by the North American Affairs Bureau has lost its authority and executive faculty. In the Foreign Ministry, the following posts of the administrative section have been regarded as the fastest tracks for success, and have increasingly acquired importance: the chief of the Policy Coordination Division of the Secretariat, the chief of the Personnel Division, the chief of the Treaties Division of the Treaties Bureau, and the chief of the Legal Affairs Division of the Treaties Bureau. For one thing, this means that men of superior ability show a strong tendency to avoid diplomatic frontline posts chock full of difficulty, and thus take the social escalator, tolerating the holding of posts. If such a mood prevails, a typical bureaucratic process will exercise greater influence in which the acting chief will make plans, the chief will flesh them out, and the director general will lay the groundwork within and without the Foreign Ministry for the approval of the plans, thus further increasing the opaqueness of decisionmaking. The Decisionmaking of the "Ichi-Ni Combination" Rightly or wrongly, there is a saying that "Japanese politics is third rate, its economics is first rate, and its bureaucracy is ultra-first rate." In the background of such a saying lies a situation in which the bureaucrats have taken the leadership under the collusive relationship among "politicians, bureaucrats, and the business world." Taking advantage of such a situation, the "bureaucracy" has taken an active part not only in the decisionmaking of ministries and agencies, but also in the process of national policy decisions. This has been made possible principally due to the weakness and corruption of "politics." If politicians are strong and steady, they can apply the brakes to undue intervention in policy decisions or to arbitrary decisionmaking by the bureaucrats, driving a wedge between them. Actually there are some cases in which "politicians" have attained hegemony amid weakness and corruption. In the field of diplomacy, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe exercised leadership as an "influential minister" during the passage of a peacekeeping operations bill and in arranging the emperor's visit to the PRC. He also mediated for the normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam, and between the PRC and Vietnam, with the greater aim of rehabilitating Vietnam. Evaluations aside, we can cite the following examples: 1) Ichiro Ozawa, deputy chief cabinet secretary of the Takeshita administration, went to the United States as a government envoy and led the Japan-U.S. construction consultations to a successful conclusion; 2) the opening of normalization negotiations between Japan and North Korea was decided upon through the visit to North Korea by Shin Kanemaru, vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party; and 3) Ryutaro Hashimoto, finance minister in the Kaifu administration, took the initiative in providing an international contribution of $9 billion during the Gulf war. However, politicians cannot wage an effective rollback policy against the bureaucrats because the information and knowledge which are the foundation of a strong initiative have been held by the bureaucrats during the long administration of the Liberal Democratic Party. Information is available only when there is knowledge and connections. In that respect, the bureaucratic organization, which has enormous power of approval and license, as well as a network of various organizations, holds a dominant position. Furthermore, to make matters worse the coalition parties which have come to power in place of the Liberal Democratic Party are in a disadvantageous position. The weakening of the base of the coalition parties, as well as the decline of the decisionmaking mechanism within policy-making government agencies, as seen in the subsidence of the Foreign Ministry's North American Affairs Bureau, has induced the Finance Ministry to expand its "hegemony." At present, "restrictions" imposed by the Finance Ministry on "politicians, bureaucrats, and the business world" are very severe. Of all the industrialized countries, Japan's Finance Ministry is said to be the only agency which monopolizes absolute power over budgets and finance. It can be said the Finance Ministry, through its supreme command of finances, is obtaining control over the bureaucracy. With contacts established widely and deeply, and with his overwhelming power to collect information, Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito -- who is said to be "a vice minister of great caliber who appears only once in twenty years" -- is among the top bureaucrats within the Finance Ministry. Saito, in combination with Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary general of Shinseito who is said to be "the behind-the-scenes producer" of the current coalition government, is said to have gained great influence. This is called the Ichi-Ni combination. Seven Men in the Inner Sanctuary Many examples show how powerful bureaucratic control actually is. For example, before the Hosokawa cabinet could implement urgent economic countermeasures, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa himself had to meet with Saito directly, seeking his cooperation on two and one occasions respectively. Moreover, Prime Minister Hosokawa had wanted to assure President Clinton of the implementation of an income tax cut at their meeting in November last year, but Hosokawa could not obtain a "tax cut" because the Finance Ministry would not forego a consumption tax increase of 7 percent as the revenue source for the income tax cut. The decisionmaking of the Finance Ministry is based on the principle of having affairs run by a few select people of superior quality. It is said a major issue like determining the rate for consumption taxes is decided upon by seven men -- the administrative vice minister, the director general of the Secretariat, the director general of the Tax Bureau, the councilor in charge of the Tax Bureau, the chief of the Coordination Division, the chief of the Second Tax Division, and the assistant chief of the Second Tax Division of the Tax Bureau. One of the reasons this is possible is that excessive sectionalism is thoroughly practiced within the Finance Ministry. For example, the chief of the First Tax Division -- one of the elite -- cannot meddle in the affairs regarding consumption taxes because he is in charge of the direct tax. It goes without saying that decisionmaking undertaken by only seven bureaucrats in the inner sanctuary of the Finance Ministry cannot be transparent. It is also needless to say that the bureaucrats are not elected by the people and thus cannot be discharged by the people. The greatest issue is whether it is permissible to let such bureaucrats, and a very few of the able bureaucrats at that, control national policies at their own will. Lynn Williams, former deputy U.S. trade representative who had a verbal dispute with Japanese bureaucrats at Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, offered incisive criticism: "We cannot understand the concrete substance of Japanese rules and regulations unless we ask the bureaucrats about them. Of the industrialized countries, Japan is the only nation which continues to have a system deficient in transparency" (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, dated 9 November 1993). However, the aim of Japanese bureaucracy is to make rules and regulations which are "incomprehensible without the help of bureaucrats." David Sanger, Tokyo Bureau chief for THE NEW YORK TIMES, asked Prime Minister Hosokawa at a news conference following the Japan-U.S. summit held in November last year: "Political reform is now being promoted with the birth of the new administration in Japan, but will it not be difficult for the prime minister to carry leadership over into Japan's powerful bureaucratic organization?" That question, which touched upon the core of the matter, frightened the prime minister's circle. The reason is that Sanger's question is indicative of his recognition that Ichiro Ozawa, the creator of the Hosokawa administration, and Jiro Saito, super-vice minister of the Finance Ministry -- the so-called Ichi-Ni combination -- have a firm grip on the coalition government. It may be needless to say such a view underlies the Clinton administration's recognition of Japan. However, Ozawa is shocking Kasumigaseki by advocating a rather bold idea of excluding bureaucratic control. The essential features of Ozawa's plan are: 1) abolition of a bureaucrat's reply at the Diet as a government delegate; 2) parliamentary vice ministers will be renamed vice ministers, and two or three vice ministers will be stationed at each ministry; 3) several Diet members will be placed under vice ministers as parliamentary deputy vice ministers. Upon hearing this, Kasumigaseki grew agitated, saying: "Great Heavens! Is Nagatacho (the center of Japanese Government) going to take over Kasumigaseki?" In response, Ozawa answered in his book "Plan for Reforming Japan": "This is not a takeover of government offices by politicians. All the bureaucrats have to do is observe political neutrality as bureaucrats and whole-heartedly assist politicians as technocrats." Whatever political aim Ozawa's idea may have, all the same it deserves attention and high evaluation in the sense that it has proposed a concrete measure against bureaucratic control. Masahisa Naito, who was the director general of the Industrial Policy Bureau and was certain to be "the next administrative vice minister of the International Trade and Industry," was advised to resign by International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagaya at the end of last year. This incident, which became the topic of discussion, is an example of the embodiment of Ozawa's idea; Kumagaya is a well-known close aide of Ozawa. At any rate, what is important now is to propose a concrete plan for breaking away from the current politics, which is controlled by the bureaucrats. In that respect, unless effective reform measures are initiated, it will be impossible to enrich our political options.
