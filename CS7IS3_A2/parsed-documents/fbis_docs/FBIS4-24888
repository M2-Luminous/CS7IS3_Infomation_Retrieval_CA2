This decision was classified as top secret. Deng Xiaoping himself prefers his health condition to be promptly announced, lest his death one day should turn out to be an event causing "turbulence" in the community. Never Have CHENG MING or TUNG HSIANG Filed Any Report Stating Deng Is Dead Reports on Deng Xiaoping's death have been filed from time to time, but never have CHENG MING and TUNG HSIANG filed any report of this kind. This year's March issue of TUNG HSIANG carried a report saying that Deng Xiaoping intended to change the past practice whereby information about central leaders' health and serious illness should be kept absolutely secret. During a meeting on 24 February, Wan Li told more than 80 veteran party, government, and Army leading cadres who had retired or retreated to the second line: The central authorities have accepted a suggestion made by Comrade Xiaoping, that is, information about Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health condition should be accurately and promptly passed on to leaders of the party Central Committee, the State Council, the National People's Congress [NPC], the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], the Army, and localities, and this information can also be faithfully passed on to friendly countries and friends who are concerned about his health. Once there is any change in Comrade Xiaoping's health condition, the central authorities and the department concerned will promptly inform the public of it. But, when should information about CPC leaders' health be publicized? A Leading Group and Medical Care Group Attend To Deng Xiaoping's Health In early April, during its seventh work meeting, the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau adopted a decision on setting up a "leading group under the CPC Central Committee to attend to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health." The group comprises Jiang Zemin as its head, Qiao Shi and Liu Huaqing as deputy heads, Wan Li and Qin Jiwei as advisers, and others as members, including Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Chi Haotian, Wang Ruilin, and Chen Minzhang. In addition, the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau also suggested that the central health care bureau be assigned to set up a group to attend to Deng Xiaoping's health care and medical service, comprising Ding Guangen as its head, Wang Ruilin and Chen Minzhang as deputy heads, and 24 medical personnel as group members who are to work in four shifts. Of the 24 medical personnel, 12 are experts in surgery, urology, and anaesthesiology, all with the title of department head or professor. They are from seven famous hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai, namely Concord Hospital, No. 301 Hospital, and Beijing Hospital in Beijing; and Guangci Hospital, Ruijin Hospital, Huadong Hospital, and the Second Military Medical University Hospital in Shanghai. Apparently the CPC does not want to make public the decision on setting up that leading group under the CPC Central Committee to attend to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health. This decision was classified top secret, bearing the document number "Zheng 015." The document has been circulated only down to secretaries, deputy secretaries, and political commissars (for the military) of the party committees of all ministries, commissions, and offices; all provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities directly under the central government; and all arms and services and all major military regions. If the information about Deng Xiaoping's health is to be released promptly as he suggested, then should this practice be introduced as soon as the above-mentioned two groups are established? If the above decision is not to be announced, then will any developments and changes in Deng's health in the future be kept top secret and not made public? Jiang Zemin on Deng's Illness When attending a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee Standing Committee in early May, Jiang Zemin was asked by some standing committee members about Deng Xiaoping's health. Jiang Zemin said: Comrade Xiaoping's health condition is good. The doctor has advised him to undergo seasonal medical treatment with a view to regulating and promoting the metabolism, and not to move around too much. He is suffering from senile rheumatic arthritis of the arms and legs, and his blood pressure is a bit high sometimes. He needs to limit the time he spends on reading documents, newspapers, and watching television. Deng Xiaoping's ailments as described by Jiang Zemin in early May are almost the same as those Wan Li spoke of on 24 February. Now that more than two months have passed, an informed source in Beijing doubts whether Deng's health condition could have remained unchanged throughout the period. If that were true, then why was it that a leading group and a medical service group were set up in early April to attend to Deng's health? Deng Xiaoping Fears Great Chaos Will Occur in the Wake of His Death The reason Deng Xiaoping wants his health condition to be promptly made known to the public, of course, is that he fears his death will throw China into "chaos." He knows some people in the outside world predict this. He wants to prevent his death from being a sudden event by enhancing the transparency of his own health condition so as not to cause social "chaos." The news of Zhou Enlai's death was published suddenly. His death caused the 5 April turbulence of 1976. The news of Hu Yaobang's death was also published suddenly. It caused "turbulence" in the late spring and early summer of 1989. But the reason the deaths of these two leaders caused social "turbulence" was not that the news came so suddenly, but because of the great explosion of crises among the masses. On the former occasion, people took advantage of the activities mourning Zhou Enlai to vent their enmity and opposition to the "gang of five." Similarly, through activities mourning Hu Yaobang, people vented their dissatisfaction and anger at the conservative forces that had controlled Hu Yaobang and had ousted him from power. A Power Struggle in the Imperial Court The deaths of dictators in totalitarian countries will surely lead to "imperial court coups" in struggles for power. Now Stalin had a stroke and fell from his bed, and his maidservant called Politburo members in, at which time Beria gave a curse, turned around, left him, and planned the next step of his plot. This plot was found in Khrushchev's memoirs and in Stalin's daughter's memoirs. Similarly, following Mao Zedong's death, the power struggle between Hua Guofeng, the legitimate successor, and the "gang of four," which had been left over from the "gang of five," also tended to be white-hot. If not, Hua Guofeng would not have agreed to dispose of the "gang of four!" At that time, Deng Xiaoping, who had then been removed from power, was also busy. He wrote two letters to Hua Guofeng, which was also what preceded the usurpation of power! It is Deng Xiaoping's turn now. Obviously, the "Jiang-Li structure," which he has chosen and arranged, is the result of balancing the struggle among factions. Jiang Zemin is a character of the "middle elements." After Deng's death, he will be a partner in the "Jiang-Li structure" and Li's rival. Moreover, in addition to the "Jiang-Li structure," other contestants for supreme power are Deng Liqun of the conservative forces, Chen Yuan of the elders' children, Hua Guofeng, who stepped down, and Zhao Ziyang of the reform faction. Will they be able to cope with them? Jiang Zemin Is Concerned About Danger From Outside Regarding China's post-Deng political situation, Jiang Zemin is now too much concerned about foreign influence. On 4 May, Jiang Zemin called a meeting of the secretaries, governors, and people's congress chairmen of five provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian) and one municipality (Shanghai) in the auditorium of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee. At the meeting, Jiang Zemin said: Hegemonism, overseas anti-Chinese and anticommunist political parties and political forces, and Taiwan's Li Teng-hui and the forces advocating Taiwan's independence all hope that turbulence and civil war will break out in China after Deng's death so that they can achieve their strategic goals. This is a dream of hegemonist and hostile forces. They lack a basic understanding of China's national conditions and political situation. Jiang Zemin maintains that the danger in post-Deng China will mainly comes from abroad. His mistake is very grave. He grew up under a communist culture and should know that it is not mainly external factors that contribute to something changing, but internal factors. He has the world in view, but does not see things around him. It was not imperialism or hegemonism that ousted Malenkov and Hua Guofeng from power. It will not be long before Deng Xiaoping falls critically ill and suddenly dies. The chain effect of this sudden incident will be a power struggle within the imperial court. This is almost inevitable and the destiny of communist countries. Tian Jiyun: The Central Authorities Do Not Agree That Deng Should Make Another Tour of Southern China When speaking on Deng Xiaoping's health not long ago, Tian Jiyun said: Comrade Xiaoping appeared to be tired when he sent greetings to the people in Shanghai during the Spring Festival. There were many reasons. Prior to that, he had vacationed in Jiangsu. He caught a cold in Shanghai after standing on a bridge for nearly 20 minutes in a cold wind. Moreover, he is an old man about to turn 90. Comrade Xiaoping himself also said after reading foreign reports: "When a man is 70 years old, he gets weaker and weaker each year. This is a natural law. However, the foreign reports are exaggerated." Tian Jiyun said: Comrade Xiaoping had planned to visit Guangdong and Hainan after this last Spring Festival. For health reasons, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee persuaded him not to do that. Moreover, his doctors do not agree that he should make a long trip. The general secretary, Comrade Wan Li, General Liu Huaqing, and Comrade Bo Yibo also joined in the persuasion. The elder Peng [Peng Zhen] also telephoned Comrade Xiaoping, asking him to take care of himself. Tian Jiyun also said: Comrade Xiaoping has rested in other provinces recently. He has another plan for a trip to southern China. But the central authorities hope Comrade Xiaoping will listen to the doctors' advice. I think Comrade Xiaoping will listen.
