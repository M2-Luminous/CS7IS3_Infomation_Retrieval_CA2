It was quite likely that it would share the fate of a project of another American giant, the Procter and Gamble company, which after one year of preparations altogether gave up the construction of a plant in the city on the Neva. However, as KOMMERSANT learned yesterday, the management of the company division in Oslo resolved to embark on construction in St. Petersburg as early as in July upon the signing of a directive to exempt the Coca-Cola St. Petersburg Bottlers from the payment of taxes in 1994 by Anatoliy Sobchak. The new enterprise should manufacture the first batch of beverages next year. Coca-Cola St. Petersburg Bottlers announced its intention to build a new production complex in the Pulkovo area for the first time in February 1993. The total area of the parcel comes to 43 hectares. The necessary volume of investment is estimated to be $34 million-$35 million. The project is advantageous from the social point of view, too: According to preliminary estimates, the new plant will provide jobs for more than 2,000 people. Since the partner companies that had previously signed contracts with the Coca-Cola St. Petersburg Bottlers joint-stock company failed to meet their obligations to build the first stage of facilities networks, the burden of financing this segment of the project has to be shouldered by Coca-Cola in its entirety. The amount necessary for this, which came to $23.8 million, turned out to be greater than the company itself had planned. At that point, Coca-Cola approached the economic development committee of the mayoralty of St. Petersburg with a request to reduce lease payments for land. It is curious that this request was accompanied by a quite categorical official statement: "The company does not give bribes in any form and will persistently seek a resolution of this problem." The tenacity of Coca-Cola representatives astounded the mayoralty. In the words of Aleksey Kudrin, the chairman of the Committee for the Economy and Finance of the mayoralty, the history of Coca-Cola representatives knocking on doors in the official echelons deserves to be published in the form of a handbook for Western businessmen, under the title "How To Work in St. Petersburg." So the company will have its way: Anatoliy Sobchak has signed the directive "On the Construction of Engineering Communications in the Area of Pulkovo Highway." In keeping with the directive, Coca-Cola St. Petersburg Bottlers shall be exempted from the payment of quite a bunch of taxes in 1994. KOMMERSANT considers it necessary to give a full listing of these taxes: They are the tax on profit, the tax on enterprise property, the land tax and lease payments for the parcel of land, the tax on advertisement, and the tax for the maintenance of housing, facilities of the sociocultural sphere, and law enforcement organs. An agreement has also been reached to the effect that the relief will be extended, taking into account the payment of the cost of construction of the engineering infrastructure. Such a case sets a precedent in the practice of work of the St. Petersburg mayoralty with foreign companies. According to an ironic assertion by Aleksey Kudrin, the pattern of tax exemptions for the debtors of the city, for example, the Vodokanal, was used in developing it. On the whole, the company has been exempted from 50 percent of Russian taxes. The tractability of the mayoralty is perhaps due to the recent defeat of another large foreign investor, Procter and Gamble, in St. Petersburg. At the end of last year, this company abandoned altogether the construction of its plant in the city (the project was valued at $300 million). Differences between the executive and legislative authorities of St. Petersburg were one of the reasons for this abandonment. The mayoralty did not want to pick a quarrel with Coca-Cola, to boot. In the committee for the economy and finance, they believe that tax exemptions suit both sides and will be used for cooperation with other foreign investors. Therefore, the "tax holiday" for Coca-Cola in St. Petersburg is the first case, but by far not the last. [Boxed item] Commentary The fact that the relief granted is quite radical is noteworthy: Coca-Cola may refrain from paying to the local authorities the profit tax, at the rate of 22 percent; the tax on property, at the rate of 2 percent; the tax for the maintenance of housing, at the rate of 1 percent of the cost of products; on advertising, at the rate of 5 percent of its cost; the tax for the maintenance of the sociocultural sphere and law enforcement organs, at the rate of 3 percent of the labor remuneration fund; and the tax on land, at the rate of R700 per square meter. It is remarkable that such radical steps of the St. Petersburg authorities are quite symptomatic of the modern economic policy of Russia. In the environment of an obvious shortage of actual financial resources, the authorities strive to avoid in every way possible the direct allocation of funds, especially those in foreign exchange, to enterprises and prefer to provide support in the form of granting tax and customs relief. This is much more convenient: It is one matter to spend the already available money, and it is quite another to spend some kind of future revenues, which are frequently very much in doubt (given the ineffectiveness of the Russian tax system, most of the future taxes ultimately remain on paper). Apparently, in the immediate future this tactic will be used extensively to attract Western investors who do not dwell in particular on the specifics of Russian taxes, in the customary belief that to get an exemption from them is the same as getting real money. For example, as Aleksandr Shokhin admits, the government intends to compensate the Mars concern for investment in Russia by relief in the payment of customs duties. Besides, local authorities have an opportunity to enjoy additional advantages of such a policy. In particular, in exchange for tax relief they can shift to investors some of the duties to finance the urban infrastructure, as well as use the amount of tax relief or leasing fees as a peculiar contribution to the statutory fund of a joint enterprise (The government of Moscow has already started to vigorously use this variant).
