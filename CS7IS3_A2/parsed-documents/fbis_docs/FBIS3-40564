This is Madam Benazir's first major blunder, and, if she does not rectify it soon, she will not have to wait long to suffer from its horrible results. Dozens of other ministers were appointed. However, no appointment was objected to in such a way as Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's appointment. This precious jewel was a minister in former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's cabinet. It was his misdeeds and slanderous activities that made Nawaz Sharif lose his seat of power. Mr. Nawaz Sharif gave him full freedom to make statements, and religious circles were greatly agitated because of his absurd talks. Mr. Nawaz Sharif demonstrated deplorable laziness and evasiveness in understanding the reality behind it. His sole remark in the cabinet was enough to show which lobby had nourished this plant. He had taken the oath to be faithful to Pakistan and its constitution which recognizes the Koran as the source of laws. However, he took pot shots at the decision on the interest system, based on the Koran and supported by the religious court. He did not hesitate from making harsh and aggressive statements against religious scholars, and Mr. Nawaz Sharif remained quiet about his attitude. This was the time when confrontation between Mr. Nawaz Sharif and religious leaders had first started. However, Nawaz Sharif did not even sense Asif Ahmed Ali's perversion. Meanwhile, his precious jewel gave Pakistan the ugly label of terrorist nation. Nawaz Sharif woke up when the whole nation objected to Ali's actions. However, the water had risen above his head by that time, and, despite Nawaz Sharif's issuing a warrant for his arrest and his voluntary resignation from the cabinet, Nawaz Sharif could not make it good and lost his bid for power. Begum Benazir Bhutto was aware of this whole background, but included Asif Ahmed Ali in her cabinet under Junejo's Group's pressure. The pressure was not just from the Junejo Group; it also came from Washington. We can understand Begum Benazir's helplessness against this pressure and her appointment of a notorious person like Asif Ahmed Ali to her cabinet. This is an open act of blackmail in front of our eyes, and she claims that she would not be blackmailed by anyone. [As the poet said] Who would not fall in love with such simplicity! Begum Benazir's helplessness is her own; however, the nation is not in the same position. Soon after this appointment, a Muslim League spokesman reacted with a statement condemning Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's appointment by the PPP [Pakistan People's Party]. The fact that this minister had jeopardized Pakistan's safety and security last April is known to everyone. The person who was actively trying to have Pakistan declared a terrorist nation should not be involved in the government at all, and, giving him such an important position as that of foreign minister, is out of the question. We have got the hint as to the kind of foreign policy Benazir's government wants. We can assume that its foreign policy will be based on efforts to make India happy, to end our nuclear program, and to adopt an apologizing attitude about Pakistan's Islamic character. This was Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's mission, and this will now be the PPP mission which he will follow as the foreign minister. General Senator Hafiz Hussein Ahmed, secretary general of the Islami Jamhoori Muhaz, was surprised that Begum Benazir has appointed a person foreign minister, who a few months ago was trying to accuse his own country of being involved in terrorism. In his opinion, such an irresponsible person should not be appointed to such a responsible position. His becoming the minister will mean he will finish what he had started to do (Daily NAWA-I-WAQT 17 November 1993). Maulana Alrouf, president of Jamiat-i Ittehad-i Ulema of Karachi, said in reaction to Sardar Asif's speech that he had played an important role in the fall of the former government and has distanced the religious groups from Nawaz Sharif. That is why the religious groups were against the Muslim League during the 1993 elections and the PPP had benefitted from it. Now the PPP's appointment of such a person, who issued an antireligious statement against condemnation of the interest system, who had insulted the religious leaders, and who was involved in a conspiracy to declare our country a terrorist nation, is equivalent to inviting Allah's wrath on us. If this man is not removed from the cabinet, the apprehension felt by the religious circles will not be removed (Daily JASARAT Karachi 19 Nov 93). These reactions indicate that Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's appointment has sowed the seeds of confrontation between religious groups, the opposition, and the Benazir government. It is a proven fact that no Pakistani government has been successful after alienating the religious groups. Therefore, we had said in the beginning of this article that the appointment of Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali to the foreign ministry was Benazir's first blunder, and, if she does not rectify this mistake, she will not have to wait long to suffer consequences . The new foreign minister announced the day after his appointment that he was going to end Pakistan's isolation at the international level. Someone should ask this foolish person when was Pakistan alone? During Nawaz Sharif's era, Pakistan led the Group-77 nations. Last year Pakistan become a member of the Security Council with the international vote in its support. In addition to the Security Council, Pakistan was appointed a member to another important UN agency, the Social and Economic Council. These honors were received with the support of majority of the countries in the world. How does it indicate that Pakistan was alone? The truth is that his eyes are masked by U.S. interests. He sees Pakistan alone in the whole world just because the United States has stopped aid to it for the last two years. Nawaz Sharif received huge amounts of aid from Japan and Korea after the United States stopped its aid, and Pakistan started such large projects as motorways to prove that it did not care for U.S. aid and could make do without it. The success Pakistan had in building planes and missiles without U.S. help has worried the United States about losing an important customer for its defense and economic markets. Therefore, it is not Pakistan that is alone; it is the United States. Asif Ali is trying to get the United States, and not Pakistan, out of this economic isolation. He will work in the Pakistani cabinet as the American foreign minister. The whole nation objects to his speech.
