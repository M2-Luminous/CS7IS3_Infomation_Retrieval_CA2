When Li Ruihuan visited the offices of the central committees of these democratic parties' he shook hands with their leaders, extended his best regards to them, heard briefings about their situations, and solicited their views. Applause and laughter could frequently be heard wherever he visited. Li Ruihuan had separate heart-to-heart talks with the leaders of the eight democratic parties' central committees. Speaking in a warm and friendly atmosphere, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, Lu Jiaxi, Li Peiyao, Cai Zimin, Yang Jike, and Hao Yichun expressed important views on many issues. Recalling the history of the united front, Li Ruihuan said: This year is the centennial of Comrade Mao Zedong. Concerning Comrade Mao Zedong's precious legacy, the thinking and theory about the united front are particularly important. Comrade Mao Zedong gave equal importance to the united front, armed struggle, and party building, describing them as the three magic weapons. We should thoroughly study this observation. The quintessence of Mao Zedong's united front thinking lies in the fact that Chinese Communists must strive to unite with their allies, unite all forces that can be united with, and mobilize all positive factors to form a mammoth revolutionary and construction army, and do everything possible to minimize hostile forces and problems so as to achieve the historic missions of national liberation and national rejuvenation, and push the revolutionary and construction cause forward. This shining thinking of Comrade Mao Zedong still has important guiding significance during the new historical period. Commenting on building a socialist democracy, Li Ruihuan said: While we do not reject democracy, we firmly oppose certain foreign forces' interference in our internal affairs under the banner of "democracy," and we also oppose any act of indiscriminately transplanting or copying other countries' democratic systems. We always believe that democracy is an important benchmark of social progress and an inevitable trend of historical development. China's Constitution, the CPC Charter, and the report of the 14th National Party Congress have all stated that building a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern country is our objective. We also believe that the form of democracy of a country as well as the process by which it achieves democracy must be determined by the situation of this country. Instead of having genuine democracy, there may even be chaos if we simply demand democracy without considering the country's situation. Facts have proved that the people's congress system and the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultations under the CPC leadership are socialist democratic systems in line with China's situation. We must make genuine, effective, and consistent efforts to expedite China's democratic construction. Speaking on the roles played by democratic parties, Li Ruihuan said: China's reform, opening up, and modernization endeavors have now entered a new stage of development, and the 14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have put forth the grand and formidable mission of building a socialist market economic system. If the people in our country do not work hard together, this mission cannot possibly be accomplished. Since you democratic parties have large numbers of talented people and a great pool of intellectual resources, and your connections are extensive, the roles you play during this historic change are irreplaceable. You should and can mobilize the masses you have ties with to contribute their strengths, resources, and efforts to the gigantic cause of building a socialist market economic system. Party committees and governments at all levels should maintain close ties with democratic parties and attach importance to giving full scope to democratic parties' roles and listen and respect their members' views. During the meetings, some democratic party leaders expressed views on expanding their organization, replacing the old leading groups, and organizational development. They also frankly reflected the practical problems about their working conditions. Li Ruihuan said: We have stressed long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, multiparty cooperation, and political consultations; but these things must be predicated on the other side's existence and development. Democratic parties' hard work is essential for their development. As the leader in multiparty cooperation, the CPC also has the responsibility of helping democratic parties do a good job in this respect. Li Ruihuan pointed out: Respecting and heeding the interests of democratic parties and people of all walks of life and performing good and practical services for them are concrete united front projects which the CPC must do to demonstrate its readiness to serve the people wholeheartedly, which is the objective of the CPC, and these projects are also important means to enable the united front to become more cohesive and to have greater appeal under the new situation. All CPC committees must consider it their responsibility to assist democratic parties improve their working conditions and solve their practical problems. The purpose of our visit is to establish ties with you [ren men 6126 7024], seek your advice, have heart-to-heart talks with you, and serve you. Party leaders at all levels must perform more good and practical services for democratic parties by demonstrating the communists' broadmindedness and high sense of responsibility.
