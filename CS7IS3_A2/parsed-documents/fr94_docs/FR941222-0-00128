FR941222-0-00128 FR941222-0-00019 Step 10: Compare the monthly amount calculated in Step 5 ($30) with the monthly amount calculated in Step 9 ($63.33). The lower amount is the formula amount. The formula amount is $30. If the borrowers choose to repay the formula amount, the husband's payment would be $30. Step 11: Calculate the wife's payback rate. Because her debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on the basis of the formula in §685.209(b)(2)(iii) as follows: •Subtract $1,000 from the amount of the wife's loans: ($15,000^$1,000=$14,000). •Multiply the result by 0.000002: ($14,000×0.000002=0.028). •Add the result to 0.04: (0.04+0.028=0.068). •The result is the wife's payback rate. Step 12: Compare the wife's calculated payback rate (0.068) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated rate is less than the maximum rate, the wife's payback rate is 0.068. Step 13: Calculate the wife's assumed AGI by multiplying the couple's total AGI ($30,000) by the amount of the wife's loans ($15,000), divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000): ($30,000×$15,000 $20,000=$22,500). Step 14: Calculate the wife's annual repayment amount by multiplying the wife's assumed AGI ($22,500) by her payback rate (0.068): ($22,500×0.068=$1,530). Step 15: Calculate the wife's monthly repayment amount by dividing the annual repayment amount calculated in Step 14 ($1,530) by 12 months: ($1,530 12=$127.50). Step 16: Calculate the wife's portion of the couple's discretionary income by subtracting the husband's portion of the couple's discretionary income calculated in Step 7 ($3,800) from the couple's total discretionary income calculated in Step 6 ($15,200): ($15,200^$3,800=$11,400). Step 17: Multiply the wife's discretionary income ($11,400) by 20 percent: ($11,400×.2=$2,280). Step 18: Divide the amount calculated in Step 17 by 12 months: ($2,280 12=$190). Step 19: Compare the monthly amount calculated in Step 15 ($127.50) with the monthly amount calculated in Step 18 ($190). The lower amount is the formula amount. The formula amount is $127.50. If the borrowers choose to repay the formula amount, the wife's payment would be $127.50. Step 20: Calculate the couple's combined monthly formula amount by adding the husband's monthly formula amount calculated in Step 10 ($30) and the wife's monthly formula amount calculated in Step 19 ($127.50): ($30+$127.50=$157.50). Step 21: Compare the couple's combined monthly formula amount ($157.50) to the $15 floor repayment amount. Because the combined formula amount is greater than the $15 floor, the couple's combined monthly formula amount is $157.50. Step 22: Compare the formula amount calculated in Step 21 ($157.50) to the capped amount, which is the amount the couple would repay under a 12-year standard amortization schedule. If the interest rate is seven percent, the capped amount is approximately $10.28 for every $1,000 of debt. In this example, since the couple has $20,000 in debt, the capped amount is approximately $205.60 ($10.28×20). Because the formula amount ($157.50) does not exceed the capped amount ($205.60), the couple's combined monthly repayment amount is the formula amount of $157.50.
