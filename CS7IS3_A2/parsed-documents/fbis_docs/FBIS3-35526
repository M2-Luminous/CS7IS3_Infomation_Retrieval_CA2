Was Yasir 'Arafat aware of the details, and what is the PLO's official reaction? [Al-Tibi] Brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] briefed me on the details this morning. He is in contact with the relatives of the victims in Hebron, and he has been informed about the details and the massacre that took place at Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. After the telephone call, I spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. We are watching the situation, and visiting our wounded in the hospitals. This is an odious and vile crime carried out by a settler, whom they say is a doctor from Qiryat Arba'. We cannot accept the story that he is a psychopath, as some try to portray him to us. [Halabi] Dr. al-Tibi, in your opinion what is the solution? [Al-Tibi] The solution is to immediately disarm these settlers. If the Israeli Army and police, who supposedly are responsible for security, cannot provide security to the citizen who carries out his daily activities and prayers, then the United Nations can do this. The solution is to expedite the withdrawal of the Israeli Army. The solution is to disarm the settlers. The solution lies in international protection, because it has been proven that the Israeli Army cannot protect defenseless Palestinians. Some of the Palestinians who were martyred today were martyred by the bullets of the Israeli Army. This is the climax. It does not suffice that a settler opens fire in an indiscriminate manner, resulting in a massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque, but the Armed forces too, instead of protecting the Palestinians, opened fire and killed at least four Palestinians. What is needed is international protection for the defenseless Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories. [Halabi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, has PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat told you to convey any message to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and the Israeli Government in this respect? [Al-Tibi] As I told you, I spoke with whom I should speak at the highest level within the Israeli Government. They know the PLO's stand and demands, not to mention that President 'Arafat has called for the need to have international protection. There could be a need to convene the UN Security Council. [Halabi] Dr. al-Tibi, in your opinion what impact will this painful incident have on the Palestinians in general? [Al-Tibi] The Palestinians have been suffering and have expressed doubts during the past week. But, today, the pain is general, and sorrow overwhelms all the occupied Palestinian territories, inside and outside the Green Line. Mourning has been announced, as you know. The Palestinians must feel that there is some change. As yet, the Palestinian citizen has not sensed that changes have taken place on the ground. On the contrary, things are getting worse. We tirelessly work to expedite the conclusion of the peace agreement so such crimes by the settlers cannot take place and to end the tribulations of the two people, the Palestinian and Israeli people. [Halabi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, thank you. [Al-Tibi] Thank you.
