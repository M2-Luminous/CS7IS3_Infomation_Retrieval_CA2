Manufacturing cost of color layers is half that of the pigment dispersion method. Previously, color printing was done one color at time, but this new method can print three colors at once. It is said that this method reduces print defects caused by particles. Sample shipments will start from the summer of 1994, and the company will actively sell to TFT panel makers. It is expected that the color filter printing method will reduce manufacturing cost since it does not require a lithography process. On the other hand, since the resolution is low, it was thought that this printing method was not suitable for high resolution TFT panels. The color filter printing method that Mitsumura Printing has developed this time increased the resolution, and even some panel makers are saying, ``it changes the concept of printing.'' In traditional printing methods, flattening and the formation of direct lines were not fully satisfactory. In addition, there was a frequent problem of defects caused by particles. The main reason for the defects is because each color is printed separately and dries, and then next color is layered on the dried print. The layered part becomes dense in the film, so that it is difficult to flatten the surface. Furthermore since a roller is used to transfer ink, the edge becomes wavy. Print Three Colors Simultaneously Leaving Gap The new method uses offset printing, three colors are printed simultaneously. For this reason manufacturing cost is reduced (see figure 1), and high resolution printing is improved. On each of RGB print boards, a roller shaped blanket body is rotated, and three colors of ink are transferred onto the surface of one blanket (see figure 2). At this time, a 10 �m gap is spaced between each color. Figure 1. Cost Comparison In Color Area Using Color Filter Figure 2. Color Filter Manufacturing Process In Each Method This blanket is pressed hard to the glass baseboard, rotated, and each color is transferred. At the same time following the blanket, a second roller is rotated, which presses and spreads each color onto the baseboard, and flattens. Ink pressed from the top is packed, filling the gap, so ``flattening and edge linearity are improved.'' said the R&D manager of Mitsumura Printing. Flatness and direct line formation are improved to less than 0.15 �m and 5 �m respectively which is less than half that produced by the traditional method (see table 1 and figure 3). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

View Of Traditional Printing Method And New Also, the flat board made by A1 was corrected, and dimensional precision was improved. It is said that correction is possible between 5-50 �m. At present the printing method employed by Toppan Printing Company which is a competitor, has difficulty with correction since the board is glass, and manufacturing cost is higher by 2 digits. Moreover, simultaneous three color printing is, Rprincipally difficult since ink gets mixed,S said the manager of R&D at Mitsumura Printing. Production Capacity Increased By 25% From calculations, a 25% improvement in production line capacity is estimated by using 3 color simultaneous printing. Improved operation idling and efficiency result from reducing the printing machines from three units to one unit, and particle generation as well as machine failure in the overall process are reduced. However, the number of rollers per unit increases three times, and tack time per piece will be longer. By Mitsumura Printing's estimate, if one color operation is involved, operational efficiency is 50%, idling is 65%, and tack time is 30 seconds; and if the three color operation is employed, the values are 60%, 75%, and 60 seconds respectively.
