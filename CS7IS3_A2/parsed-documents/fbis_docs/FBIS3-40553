With these changes, international efforts toward the development of space seem to be shifting from competition between the two superpowers of the United States and the former Soviet Union to joint efforts for the development of scientific technology for peaceful applications. The technology will be used for the preservation of the earth's environment and for other purposes that will benefit international society. These four years also witnessed the entry of the People's Republic of China into the international satellite launching business using their rockets. By taking these changes into account, the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. (SJAC) has compiled a report on the Prospects of the Space Industry in Japan for FY92. The work of compiling the latest report was subsidized by the Japan Auto-Race Association, a special public organization. The report summarizes the changes that have taken place in international society in connection with the endeavors in space development and the measures taken by the Japanese government to promote the domestic space industry. The report describes the current situation with respect to the development of rockets and other space transport systems, and the problems with promoting these endeavors. The report also refers to the importance of nurturing the space industry to promote space development, to the importance of expanding the market for the industry, and to the necessity of promoting international cooperation and contributions. Following is an outline of the latest report. Environment Surrounding Japanese Space Industry 1. Changes in International Situation The international environment surrounding Japan has changed drastically in the last few years. Because of the need to promote the commercialization of space development by alleviating financial burdens, and because of the need to promote the development of space technology to enable better observation of the earth, e.g., for monitoring the earth's environment, the trend is toward promoting international cooperation and dividing the burden, with those countries able to afford it assuming a greater burden. In the United States, the Clinton administration has placed top priority on the reconstruction of the domestic economy. As for his administration's space development policy, there are some analysts who expect that the emphasis will shift to smaller-scale scientific efforts, such as the development of earth environment-related technologies, by drastically cutting the budget for the construction of a permanent space base as well as a space station and for preparations for a journey to Mars. In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the commercialization of space development efforts has progressed under the freer economic policy introduced by the new government. These days it is becoming a popular practice for other countries to access the space technologies accumulated by the former communist state through various means. The country's space policy and other space-related activities, including negotiations with foreign countries, is guided by the Russian Space Bureau, founded in 1992. The relationships between CIS and neighboring countries are still unstable. In Europe, the budget for space development has been curtailed due to the economic recessions in the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA). This has been aggravated by cuts in the monetary contributions to the ESA by unified Germany. Germany has been forced to cut contributions due to the deteriorating domestic economy, which was caused mainly by the merger of the two Germanys. Under the circumstances, European countries are reviewing their space development policies by placing greater emphasis on promoting international cooperation. In other parts of the globe, civil war broke out over racial or territorial confrontations in a number of countries and regions after they had been freed from the restraints of the superpowers following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In the meantime, the Gulf War demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of space technology, as represented by the reconnaissance and communications satellites. The Arche and Munich summits confirmed the importance of tackling the deterioration of the earth's environment and other global problems by promoting the use of earth observation and remote sensing technologies. The importance of environmental observation from space will continue to increase in the future. 2. Recent Developments in Japanese Space Industry Sales in the Japanese space industry in 1991 stood at approximately ¥294.5 billion, an increase of 9.2 percent over the preceding year. The number of people working in the industry and related industries was 11,060 as of the end of March 1992, a gain of 7.2 percent over the year before. The major events and developments that have taken place in the space industry in recent years include: (1) Agreement in the trade negotiations between Japan and the United States to settle the issues covered by the Super 301 Article requires that Japan remove import barriers on satellites which the Japanese government or domestic organizations directly or indirectly under government supervision procure for purposes other than R&D. This will expose the domestic space industry to greater international competition. (2) With the success of the experiments conducted by the Japanese astronaut Mamoru Mori in September 1992 aboard an American space shuttle, the fundamental material creation experiment (FMPT) was completed. Experiments in a weightless environment were also conducted aboard the Russian spaceship Mir in January 1992 and by launching NASDA's small TR-IA rocket in August 1992. In 1991, the construction of the world's highest free-fall experimental tower was completed in Kamisunagawa Town on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido. (3) Until recently, the demand for channels from broadcasting and communications satellites was brisk for several years. However, the demand for additional channels by communications satellite has declined sharply in recent years due to the economic recession. Private broadcasting companies, which are using the communications satellite, are losing money because of higher operating costs, including higher program production costs, and they are now trying to reconstruct their businesses. (4) Tokyo and Washington concluded an agreement in 1989 about mutual cooperation in the construction of a space station. However, a delay of the space station program seems inevitable due to the budgetary constraints in the United States in recent years. We must continue to monitor the developments regarding budgetary matters in the United States. (5) In general, the commercial use of satellites will continue to expand in the coming years. The GPS navigation system for passenger car drivers is an example of such a service being offered using satellites. 3. Developments in Space Industries of Other Countries The space development budgets in Japan, the United States and European ESA member countries in 1991 totaled ¥2.5309 trillion, a gain of 66.6 percent over 1988 when the last report was compiled. Of the total, Japan accounted for 7 percent and the United States for 77 percent. The following are the major events and developments that have taken place in the space industries of a number of foreign countries. (1) Cooperation between the United States and Russia progressed in the field of space-related matters. In 1991 the two countries signed the START agreement. In 1992 they announced an agreement to launch a joint space program. In addition, they launched a joint business to be operated on a commercial basis. (2) The Clinton administration, which came to power in January 1993, expressed its intention the following month to cut the space project budget substantially in an effort to reconstruct the domestic economy. (3) Russia has been promoting the commercial utilization of space technology to reconstruct its deteriorating domestic economy. The People's Republic of China, armed with its Long March rockets, has entered the international satellite launching business. (4) The ESA ministerial conference held in November 1992 decided to put off some of its space programs, including the development of the Hermes space shuttle. Instead, the conference decided to promote an earth environment monitoring program and some other space endeavors in which it will be easier to produce tangible results. (5) In October 1990, INTELSAT modified part of its agreement to promote liberalization of the international video data communications and VSAT service. (6) Ariane Space Corporation has captured 60 percent of the international satellite launching business market in terms of the number of satellites scheduled for launching by offering low launching prices. The company has cut launch costs by mass producing rockets. Ariane Space is developing more powerful rockets. (7) The formation of a larger company by merger has been a popular trend among European companies in recent years. (8) The method of launching a satellite from a B-52 plane, which was employed by private companies in the United States in 1990, is drawing attention as an economical way of launching satellites. 4. Current Situation in Japan's Space Industry (1) The following is a list of the major space development projects being undertaken by the Japanese government: (a) The Science and Technology Agency is developing technology testing satellites, systems for use in space experiments (space station experiment module JEM, etc.) and space transport systems (H-II rocket, etc.). (b) The Education Ministry is promoting the development of a number of types of scientific satellites and the rockets to launch them. (c) The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is developing remote sensing satellites (earth resource exploration satellite No 1 (ERS-1), etc.), space environment utilization satellites (SFU, etc.) and some other types of satellites. (d) The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is developing communications/broadcast technology satellites (COMETS) and tropic rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellites. (e) The Transport Ministry is operating the geostationary meteorological observation satellite No 4 (GMS-4). (f) The Environment Agency is developing various types of sensors for installation on earth environment observation satellites. (2) The following are the major projects in which the Japanese government is involved that will promote the utilization of space: (a) MITI is a member of D-2, promoting international contributions to space endeavors. (b) The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is studying the construction of an Asia-Pacific satellite communications system as part of its international cooperation efforts. (c) The Home Affairs Ministry has been promoting a plan to improve regional satellite communications networks since 1990. The plan is mainly being carried out by the Local Autonomy Satellite Communication Organization to improve the communications system for fire fighting, disaster prevention and administrative information. (d) The National Police Agency is using CS-3 [communications satellite] service for obtaining image information regarding accidents and disasters. (e) The National Land Agency is using satellites for disaster prevention communications and to obtain data on the utilization conditions of land using remote sensing technology. (3) Financial Assistance Private companies have been playing an increasingly important role in space development efforts. The government policy guidelines on space development recommend the introduction of financial and tax measures to promote space development by private companies. In line with this, financial assistance is being extended by the Japan Development Bank and other establishments. Specifically, low interest loans are available for those companies investing money for the introduction of machines to produce, test, inspect and transport space-related equipment or systems. The loans are also available to encourage the construction of facilities for storing the hardware manufactured. In addition, there is a tax relief system (high-tech tax system), under which a company which acquired equipment or machines for use in the research and development of key technology for space development, such as a psuedo-space environment test system, is entitled to a tax reduction. Guidelines for Developing Space Industry 1. Industrial Scale The scale of the Japanese space industry is far smaller than that of the United States and some other countries. Further development of the Japanese space industry hinges on our efforts in the coming years. The following can be considered as factors hindering the expansion of the industry. (1) The effort to expand the industry's activity calls for long-term collaboration among scientists and engineers specializing in many technological fields. Under the current circumstances in which the scale of the industry is small with few projects being undertaken, it is impossible for a single R&D establishment to secure many able specialists on its own. (2) The fact that space development in Japan is being led by the government and public establishments causes the demand from the private sector to be lacking. Even if an increase in demand from the private sector is seen, some uneasiness over the fact that the industry must continue to rely heavily on government assistance will remain. The percentage of the budget for developing and launching satellites, both in Japan and abroad, is still low compared to that of the total space industry. In Japan, all satellites launched to date have been newly developed. In order to continue developing new satellites, it will be necessary for the domestic industry to keep many engineers for a long time. This will be impossible for the industry, which is still unable to get along on its own. To promote investment in R&D resources, it is particularly important for the government to continue fostering the industry. It will also be important for Japan to participate more actively in the future in the programs being promoted by the consortiums of European and U.S. establishments. In the meantime, of those satellites launched between 1990 and 1993, 55 percent were launched by the United States, 26 percent by European countries, and 9 percent by Japan. The average per annum launching costs worldwide are expected to reach $4.5 billion for the century. For Japan, the average is expected to stand at approximately ¥50 billion at the most, even if unreserved efforts against the restraining factors, as described above, are exerted. This will make it even more critical for Japan to promote the international division of burdens encountered in launching satellites. The space industry can produce demands for completely new goods and services among the related industries, such as the cases seen in the communications and broadcasting industries. For the communications and satellite broadcasting industries, in particular, the space industry has generated great economic benefits that have led to the growth of other related domestic industries. To promote the growth further, the communications and broadcasting industries must step up their efforts to that end. However, government assistance is also needed to nurture these and other related industries. 2. Space Industry as a Strategic Industry, and Budget for the Industry One strategically important thing if Japan is going to promote the growth of the space industry in the coming years is how to promote international cooperation by maintaining flexibility in space endeavors. The political environment in the world has changed greatly in recent years, as has the international space development environment in terms of mounting competition and the increasing need to promote international cooperation. Historically, space development has been promoted: (1) to secure international leadership, (2) to ensure security in the economic and defense fields, (3) to promote the development of services and technology, and (4) to deal with matters of global interest. Under these changing international situations surrounding the space industry, Japan must promote the formation of a more comprehensive national space policy that will not be confined to the development of science and technology. In satellite development, the global interest factor assumes particular significance. As evidenced by the operation of WEDOS, it is important for Japan to use its money and technology to promote projects that will bring benefits to the world through environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, and other satellite services. As for the development of space transport systems, it is important to go ahead with it flexibly to ensure continued progress in the development effort. The issues Japan must tackle in this effort include: (1) securing competitiveness in production costs, (2) keeping the technology up-to-date, and (3) establishing a new frame of international cooperation. It is expected that the building of an infrastructure in the space industry will become the main target of Japan's space development efforts. Taking this into consideration, it will be important for Japan to define its intentions in promoting such development, to set goals, and to work out a long-term vision for development. The government's budget for space development has recorded an annual increase of approximately 10 percent in the past few years. The expenditures for development must be increased to promote space development programs, including satellite launching for environmental monitoring. Japan lags far behind the United States and some European countries in terms of the amount of money allocated for space development. 3. Need for Development of Private-Sector Demand Japan's space industry currently has very few demands from private companies. To promote the growth of the space industry, it is essential that the government expand the space program and introduce measures that will lead to an increase in the demand from private companies. These efforts will generate quality through mass production, improved reliability, and better customer service. These improvements, in turn, will lead to contact with a larger number of customers, which could help the space industry better understand the customers' needs and develop more demand--resulting in the strengthening of the industrial infrastructure. The development tasks that private companies can perform well should be commissioned to them. By so doing, more private-sector money will flow into the space industry. This will then make it possible for the government to channel more money to new space projects. The privatization of the satellite communications business can be thought of as a method for expanding the demand generated by the private sector. However, taking into consideration the fact that the satellites that have been used by satellite business concerns have been imported from the United States, privatization has not benefited much from them. Rather, economic benefits have been extended to related industries. Since the increase in the number of customers will lead to the growth of the satellite market, the government should consider not only extending assistance to private concerns, but also to stimulate the private sector demand by, for example, the government itself acting as a major user. The demand for space transport systems from the private sector in Japan is still very small, and little effort has been made to increase this demand. However, an organization designed to develop the private-sector market has been set up, and positive results are expected to be forthcoming in the near future. To increase the private-sector demand for space transport systems, it will be necessary to (1) develop a variety of low-cost rockets, (2) promote the transfer of space technology to the private sector and make it easier to use a rocket firing center by taking legislative measures, (3) create an environment which will enable low-cost rockets to be developed, (4) study the possibility of using rocket firing centers in foreign countries, and (5) expand the launch window. Under the current situation in the space industry, tangible benefits will not be forthcoming by promoting the development of the space industry infrastructure. However, it is expected that indirect benefits will be brought about by promoting research on the instruments and other measurement/observation systems that will be used on satellites. 4. International Cooperation and Contributions In order for Japan to contribute to international space endeavors, it is important for her to be equipped with the ability to participate actively in international projects by maintaining her subjectivity. As for international cooperation, Japan must promote the development of a key technology by focusing on a specific field. Japan can contribute to the international endeavor by generating useful results in this development effort. In the fields of space science research and space development, international cooperation has been actively promoted in past years, and will continue to be promoted in the future. The launching of satellites for environmental monitoring and disaster prevention will benefit, in particular, the peoples of the Asian and Pacific regions. In the meantime, the low-altitude satellite communications project to aid in the navigation of earth-surface transport systems is a vast, costly undertaking and, thus, will offer a good opportunity for Japanese private companies to participate in international cooperation. If Japan is to be able to contribute to international space endeavors and to produce tangible results in international cooperation, it is vital that she have commercially-usable rockets. In the effort to improve the space industry infrastructure, too, it is important for Japan to be able to present constructive proposals and extend support to technologically-developing countries. For the time being, Japan must make an effort to equip itself with the ability required to actively participate in the international projects currently being promoted jointly by the United States, Russia and Europe in order to improve the space industry infrastructure. As for the on-going space station program, any shift in U.S. space development policy will affect Japan. In preparation for such a shift, it is important for Japan (1) to take the necessary precautionary measures to minimize the adverse effects of such a policy change on Japan's space program, (2) to determine the appropriate level of burden it can afford when the burden of promoting an international project is divided among the countries concerned, and (3) to secure separate operating funds. In order to promote international cooperation, it is essential that Japan establish its own technology and clarify the R&D resources it can offer, then expand the range of resources it can offer in all fields involving satellites, space transport systems and the space industry infrastructure. At the same time, it is also important to clarify its policy and the role it will be able to play in the internationalization of space development efforts. In addition, it is necessary to expand the market for the domestic space industry. Japan must make an effort to contribute to the Asian-Pacific regions by making the ideas and technologies developed by Japan available to the peoples of these regions to help them in space development and the utilization of space technology. At the same time, Japan must explore the possibility of accepting cooperation and contributions from foreign countries. When a private company in Japan introduces a technology being developed by a foreign company, it will become necessary for the Japanese government to extend financial assistance or assistance in other forms to the development effort. 5. Removal of Development-Impeding Factors and Introduction of Development-Promoting Measures The following are the principal factors believed to be hindering progress in the Japanese space industry: (1) Research for space development has been confined to comparatively narrow scientific fields, such as space science. (2) In fields in which the space industry can get along on its own, the industry has been exposed to tough competition from similar fields in existing industries. (3) The fact that the government budget and contracting method employed by governmental organizations in procuring hardware has not been sufficient to cover the development risks involved when investing huge amounts of money has discouraged private companies from offering their R&D resources to space development. (4) The demand for satellites and rockets has been very small, making it impossible to use volume production to cut launch costs. (5) The agreement reached in the Super 301 trade negotiations between Japan and the United States has resulted in exposing the domestic space industry to tougher international competition. (6) The lack of rocket firing centers, the narrow launch window, and the insufficient conditions of the satellite tracking ground station network have limited the number of satellites and rockets launched. These limitations have impeded the development of the domestic market, particularly the private-sector market, for Japan's space industry. In tackling these problems, the following measures can be considered: (1) Promoting the space industry as a national strategy by linking it with Japan's international cooperation program. Encouraging the private sector to extend stronger support. (2) Promoting the participation of private companies in international space operation-related consortiums to make them more competitive internationally. Promoting cost cutting through volume production and other means. (3) Realizing an administrative system in which it is possible to meet changes in domestic as well as international situations promptly. The introduction of governmental measures, including financial assistance and tax breaks, to promote the commercialization of the space industry and private-sector demand. It is necessary to introduce a budgetary and contract system that will be appropriate for promoting long-term development projects. (4) Making it possible for private companies to use the R&D facilities held by governmental establishments at reasonable prices, just like in the United States and Europe. (5) The serialized development of satellites, and promotion of medium- and long-term projects. In particular, the promotion of such development by having the bus instrument related to the mission instrument. (6) Securing an international consensus prior to going ahead with an international project which will benefit the world through cooperative efforts. The prompt implementation of an international project. (7) Facilitating satellite launching by using rocket firing centers abroad and by launching from aircraft. (8) Cutting the production costs of rockets. (9) Introducing measures designed to reduce the investment risks for private companies. (10) The introduction of legislative measures to protect satellite launching concerns from financial liabilities resulting from launch-related accidents. (11) Standardizing the instruments and machines used in the space industry. Improving and automating orbital maintenance services and introducing robots. (12) Securing able manpower and training. Stepping up publicity for space industry activities to help secure researchers and engineers. Epilogue These 12 measures must be introduced or taken by Japan in order to promote space development. To ensure the continued progress of the Japanese space industry, it is important for the government and private companies to cooperate with each other in promoting their endeavors by introducing the necessary measures, including the promotion of international cooperation. The author concludes this article by hoping that the proposals made in this report will lead to Japan's making greater contributions to benefit the world by promoting the development of science and space technology, and that this, in turn, will contribute to further progress being made in Japan's space industry.
