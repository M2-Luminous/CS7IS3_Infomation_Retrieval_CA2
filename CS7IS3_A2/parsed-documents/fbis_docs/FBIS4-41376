Announcing the first preliminary information to a BELINFORM correspondent, the Republic's central electoral commission made one thing clear: One can conclude from the data coming in that none of the candidates has secured the necessary number of votes. At present, one can only talk of an indicated preference for two candidates: About 30-32 percent voted for Aleksandr Lukashenko, and 24-26 percent voted for Vyacheslav Kebich. The remaining four candidates lag significantly behind, and the order of preference for them is: Zenon Poznyak, Stanislav Shushkevich, Vasiliy Novikov, and Aleksandr Dubko. The highest voter activity was recorded in Brest oblast, where over 83 percent of the eligible citizens went to the polling stations. The most passive people were in Minsk, where the figure was 69.3 percent. The central electoral commission expects to give the preliminary results at about 0700 [0300 GMT] in the morning, Moscow time.
