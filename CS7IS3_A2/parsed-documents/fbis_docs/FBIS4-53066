"When the budget is acted upon, we will again call on you to shape up," LDP President Yohei Kono said in a meeting with Hata in an indication that the LDP will submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet. Kono also noted the Hata administration is "a government under abnormal circumstances" and urged Hata to be aware that his government is a minority one, Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general, told a news conference. The remarks apparently reflect the LDP chief's belief that the Hata cabinet will have completed its duties when it passes the key budget through the Diet. Kono, responding to the prime minister's call for the LDP's cooperation in Diet debate on the long-overdue budget, revealed his party is ready to cooperate in an active manner if the government admits its responsibility for the delay in budget discussions. Hata also called on the LDP to extend a helping hand to the coalition government on political reform and tax system reform, Naoto Kitamura, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a separate news conference. The prime minister, who leads the first minority government in 39 years, spoke pointedly of the need to enact a bill that demarcates a new constituency map for House of Representatives elections, according to Kitamura. The encounter between Hata and Kono is the first since Hata took to the helm of the government on April 28. Hata was accompanied by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and Kitamura, while Kono attended along with Mori and LDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato. During the one-hour meeting held in the Diet building, Hata also reiterated there is no backpedalling in his government's policy of charting a course for sweeping tax system reform by the end of June so as to enact necessary legislation by the year's end. While the premier expressed his determination to carry out drastic deregulation, the LDP leader showed willingness to cooperate in reviewing economic regulations, Kitamura said. On former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's alleged involvement in improper financial dealings, Kono pressed a demand the government agree to summon Hosokawa to the Diet as a sworn witness, Mori said. Hata's meeting with Kono was the first in a series of meetings with leaders of political parties outside the ruling coalition. The premier also was to meet later Tuesday with Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, New Party Sakigake Leader Masayoshi Takemura, and Michihiko Kano, head of the new party Mirai.
