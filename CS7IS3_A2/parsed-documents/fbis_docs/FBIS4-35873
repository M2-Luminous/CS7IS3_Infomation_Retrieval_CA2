The statement reminded that scores of innocent Muslims had been martyred or wounded in the bombardment and added that the incident was one aftermath of the treacherous policies of some in their dealings with the Zionist regime and of the so-called appeasement policies in the region. It said such incidents are proof that aggression and trespass against others is the inherent nature of the Zionist entity and that any effort aimed at conciliation with the Zionist regime will bring only misery and self-humiliation (to the Muslim nations).
