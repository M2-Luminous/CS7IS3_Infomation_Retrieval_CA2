"If a new government bill on place names, to be submitted on Friday [17 June], is acceptable for us and the coalition I see no reason why it should not be discussed at the next parliamentary session," he said. He admitted that he told the Coalition Council today that the government should not necessarily be supported by Hungarian deputies who secure its majority in parliament. "It was necessary to recall that our agreement with the coalition as well as the recommendations by the Council of Europe are in effect. According to the agreement we support the government provided it solves this problem also. If the coalition is unwilling to do so nobody can expect blind support from us," he said. "We are flexible to a certain extent. If a new bill allows for a referendum to decide on bilingual road signs then we would be able to back it," Farkas said. He said that aggravation of the problems surrounding the place names law can indisputably be ascribed to the election campaign in which the national feelings of voters are exploited, he said. "For us, however, it is a question of our identity. We live here, and have our own language so why should not we name our villages and towns in our native language as it is generally accepted everywhere in Europe," Farkas said.
