"We have reached a stage in which the CNEA, which was born as a series of laboratories, has ended up creating a prolific industrial activity that must be broken down into component parts," Mondino said. "The state tasks that cannot be delegated must remain within the state and the productive components must be overseen by a state incorporated company. The key is to maintain the laboratory-factory unity," the CNEA chief added during the commemoration of the organization's 44th anniversary. The proposal to quote shares on the stock market, although Mondino did not go into details, still must be approved by the government. The CNEA and the Energy Secretariat still do not have a common position on how to undertake the privatization of nuclear activity, the only one that remains in the hands of the state since the energy market's deregulation began two years ago. But the CNEA Association of Professionals has demanded the sanctioning of a law that will regulate nuclear activities. The organization recalled that "the most advanced countries consider energy a strategic asset."
