FR940524-1-00032 FR940524-1-00010 The current regulation in 30 CFR part 11 was developed to certify respirators used in mining and general industry. They do not contain performance requirements for certifying air-purifying respirators against biological agents. Likewise, the modifications to the current requirements in this proposed rule were not developed specifically to certify respirators against biological agents. However, the provisions of this rule will address an important public health need regarding the control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, transmission in health care and other facilities. In response to the recognized risk of TB transmission in health-care facilities, increases in TB in many areas, and recent outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB, CDC has published draft recommendations revising existing CDC guidelines for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis in health care facilities, entitled ``Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities, Second Edition'', published in the Federal Register on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52810). This draft enumerates four performance criteria that CDC has determined are necessary for respiratory protective devices used in health-care settings for protection against TB. The only currently certified air-purifying respirator class that meets all the respiratory protection performance criteria in the CDC draft is a respirator with a high efficiency (HEPA) filter. However, all six classes of air-purifying, particulate respirators to be certified under the provisions of the new particulate filter tests (filter penetration) would meet or exceed the performance recommendations contained in the CDC document. These other classes of air-purifying, particulate respirators are expected to be markedly less expensive than respirators with HEPA filters. Consequently, immediate implementation of the modifications included in this rule should promote a substantial increase in respiratory protection provided to health care and other workers potentially exposed to the M. tuberculosis droplet nuclei in health-care and other occupational settings. For this reason, NIOSH is moving forward with a schedule to publish a final rule pertaining to particulate filters in late-1994. III. Public Meeting The record of the informal public meeting will remain open until July 8, 1994 to allow interested persons to submit written statements or comments regarding oral presentations made at the public meeting. The rule is proposed to be effective as follows: 1. 42 CFR part 84 will be effective 30 days from publication of this rule as final, and; 2. Sale and distribution of respirators listed as certified under the provisions of 30 CFR Part 11, subparts K or M will no longer be authorized effective 2 years from the date of publication of this rule as final. NIOSH is specifying an effective date for implementation for the final rule to allow the introduction of filters demonstrating enhanced performance as soon as possible. The existing 30 CFR part 11 is expected to remain in effect for 6 months after this rule becomes final to provide a transition period for manufacturers to prepare for new 42 CFR part 84 applications. NIOSH believes that this period provides ample transition time for manufacturers to assemble the information necessary for application for certification of particulate respirators under the new part 84. Additionally, 2 years from the date this rule becomes final, respirators can no longer be distributed or sold as NIOSH-approved under part 11, subpart K or M, unless they demonstrate compliance with and are certified under the provisions of the new part 84. This 2-year period was selected to ensure that an ample supply of respirators remain available for use. NIOSH believes that this timeframe will provide ample time for manufacturers to have respirators approved and manufactured in sufficient quantities to meet the demand. NIOSH specifically requests comments on the appropriateness of a 2-year phase-in period, as proposed. The administrative record of this rulemaking will consist of this May 24, 1994 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; all other relevant Federal Register notices; agency records on this subject; all written submissions made in response to the Notices; and the record of the informal public meeting. The record of the informal public meeting will consist of the meeting schedule, transcripts made by NIOSH of the oral comments at the meeting, any written comments submitted by presenters at the meeting, and statements or comments regarding oral presentations made at the public meeting submitted by interested persons within the allotted comment period. No written submission, or any portion thereof, made in response to this Notice will be received or held in confidence. The administrative record of the rulemaking will be made available for viewing and copying in the NIOSH Docket Office. All requests for any portion of the administrative record must be submitted in writing. All interested persons are encouraged to submit written comments to assure receipt on or before the close of business July 8, 1994, and to advise the NIOSH Docket Office by the necessary date of their intent to participate in the informal public meeting. All requests for appearance at the informal public meeting should contain the name, address, and telephone number, any business affiliation of the person desiring to make a presentation, a brief summary of the presentation, and the approximate time requested for the presentation. NIOSH requests that oral presentations be limited to 10 minutes. Groups having similar interests are requested to combine their comments and present them through a single representative. NIOSH will assign the time available for the meeting among the persons who properly file a request for appearance. After reviewing the submitted summaries and the requests for appearance, NIOSH will schedule each appearance and notify each participant by mail or telephone of the time assigned to the person and the approximate time the person's oral presentation is scheduled to begin. The meeting schedule will be placed on file in the NIOSH Docket Office.
