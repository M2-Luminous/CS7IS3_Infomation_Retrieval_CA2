FR940610-0-00142 FR940610-0-00025 Changes in funding will be made on an ``as needed'' basis using prior approval standards already in place under 34 CFR 74.105 and 34 CFR 80.30(c). Under these standards and the procedures in §§ 74.102 and 80.30(f), a recipient must seek prior approval for certain changes to a budget and submit the request to the Grants Division of the Grants and Contracts Service. A request for a change in a recipient's budget should be made at the time that the recipient becomes aware of the need for the change, whether the change affects the current budget period or any or all future budget periods. If the change affects the next budget period and the recipient becomes aware of the need for the change at the time that it submits its performance report, the recipient may submit the request at the time that it submits the performance report. However, the Secretary notes that submission of proposed budget changes with, or after, the performance report may delay the recipient's receipt of the continuation award. Any funding of a continuation award, whether or not made in conjunction with a request for a budget change, is contingent upon the availability of funds. Annual awards will be made after approval of performance reports by the program offices. Based on public comment, it was clear to the Team that recipients understand the importance of providing information about progress of grant activities but feel that more timely performance reports would be preferable to an annual application timed to meet the Department's award schedule. Also, there was a perception among recipients that the Non-competing Continuation process demonstrates an ``enforcement'' mentality on the part of the Federal Government, at the expense of a collaborative and assisting attitude. Recipients favored a new paradigm whereby performance reporting would be tied more to projects' reporting on results and performance, and less to the threat of a cut-off in funding (even though extremely rare in practice). This option was chosen to implement an entirely new paradigm for the NCC award process. Continuation funding will be based, as it has in the past, on evidence that the grantee has met the standards for continuation contained in 34 CFR 75.253. These standards include requirements that Congress appropriate sufficient funds to continue existing awards, that the grantee make substantial progress toward achieving the objectives of the project or obtain approval from the Secretary for certain changes to the grant, that continuation of the project is in the best interests of the Federal Government, and that the grantee submit, as required by §75.118, every report that it must submit to get the continuation award. This last standard will take on increased importance under the amended regulations because the continuation award decision_including the decision about whether the grantee has made substantial progress_will be based entirely on the submission of reports as specified by the Secretary, rather than on the submission of a continuation award application. Moreover, having recipients submit their performance reports closer to the date when funding decisions must be made will make the reports more valuable instruments than the previous continuation applications. Until now, recipients often have been required to submit performance data in continuation applications before their projects had completed more than a few months of activities. The Secretary stresses to recipients the increased importance of performance reports. Because these reports will be key to the decision to continue funding, recipients will be expected to submit high quality reports. A performance report must contain the most current performance information specified in EDGAR and any applicable program requirements. These requirements include an evaluation of the grantee's progress in achieving the objectives of the approved application, the effectiveness of the project in meeting the purposes of the program under which it was funded, and the effect of the project on the participants it serves (§75.590); and a discussion of the reasons for slippage if established goals were not met, and a computation of the cost per unit of output if the output of the project can be quantified (§§74.82(c) and 80.40(b)). If a recipient fails to submit a performance report as directed by the Secretary, the recipient will not receive a continuation award. See §75.253(a)(3). To merit receipt of a continuation award, the report must demonstrate that a recipient has made substantial progress in fulfilling the objectives of the grant. The Secretary intends that employees of the Department will scrutinize these reports closely to ensure that the recipient has, in fact, met this standard. The Department currently is developing a generic performance report for approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The new process will provide many benefits to recipients. It will free up time previously spent on duplicative processes, both internal and external. For example, certifications and assurances ( e.g., Lobbying; Debarment) must be submitted whenever an entity applies for funds. Since recipients will no longer submit an application to receive continuation funding, they will no longer be required to resubmit these assurances annually for the life of the project. The new process for making continuation awards should free up resources for both the recipients and Department staff that can be reinvested in higher quality project management, technical assistance, and monitoring. Section-by-Section Analysis Section 75.100 is revised to remove references to the application process that will no longer be used to make non-competing continuation awards. Section 75.112 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to require an applicant for a new grant to describe in its application how, in each budget period of the grant, the applicant plans to meet each objective of the project. Section 75.117 is revised to reflect the new procedure for determining the award amounts for all budget periods in a multi-year grant at the time the initial award is made. The revision ensures that the applicant provides multi-year budgetary information in its initial application since continuation applications will no longer be required.
