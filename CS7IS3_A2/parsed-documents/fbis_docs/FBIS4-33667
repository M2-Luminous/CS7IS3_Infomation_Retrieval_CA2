Thomas, who represents Trinidad and Tobago, said OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares had proposed that Cuba's return to the OAS be discussed. He noted, however, that so far no country has made a formal request to this effect. In accordance with OAS regulations, Thomas said, the readmission of a member country into the organization must first be formally proposed by one member country, and then consulted with the other members attending the General Assembly. Thomas is actively participating in the 24th OAS General Assembly, which opened on 6 June in the Amazon city of Belem, in northern Brazil. He said: "As Baena Soares said, circumstances today are conducive to reexamining Cuba's readmission to the OAS, but so far I am unaware of any country having made such a proposal." As assistant secretary general, Thomas will replace Baena Soares -- whose term expires this month, after having served 10 years in office -- during the two-month period preceding the installation of the new secretary general-elect, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. Although some Latin American foreign ministers have timidly defended Baena Soares's proposal that the OAS member countries discuss the possibility of readmitting Cuba, only Argentina has formally stated its position on the issue; that is, its opposition to the proposal. During a news conference Argentine OAS Ambassador Hernan Patino Meyer said flatly: "The OAS consists of democratic states, and as soon as Cuba takes steps toward its democratization it will be possible to readmit it into the organization." Asked why Argentina and Brazil had, then, continued as OAS member states under the military regimes, Patino Meyer said that at that time the 1992 clause that provides for the separation from the OAS of nondemocratic states had not yet been approved. "Had I been the OAS secretary general at that time, I would have expelled Argentina and Brazil from the organization," Patino Mayer said. In his opening speech at the 24th OAS General Assembly, Baena Soares said: "I have been asking for some time whether it is the right moment for the member countries to reexamine the decision they made more than 30 years ago to suspend the Cuban Government from OAS activities. The nineties are different from the sixties." Baena Soares' proposal was not immediately discussed by the OAS foreign ministers because they were more interested in discussing the Haitian crisis. Although President Itamar Franco did not discuss the Cuban issue in his speech at the OAS Assembly, he stated shortly before returning to Brasilia that "the OAS must look at the Cuban position." Cuba was separated from the OAS in 1962, three years after the victory of the Cuban Revolution led by President Fidel Castro.
