As a result, over 1,000 Thai nationals and over 15,000 Cambodians in Pailin and nearby areas fled into Thailand today through the villages of Phakkat and Khlong Yai in Pong Nam Ron District of Chanthaburi Province. More people are expected to cross the border. He said that since the task force was unable to push such a huge number of refugees back into Cambodia, the Chanthaburi Marine Task Force has been instructed to separate the fleeing Thai nationals from the Cambodian refugees, who are now being detained at Phakkat pending repatriation after the situation returns to normal.
