Handing down his budget for the year to June 30, 1995, Australian Treasurer Ralph Willis said on May 10 that a surge in business investment -- forecast at 14.6 percent for 1994-95 -- was "crucial" to his forecasts of economic growth. But the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported Wednesday that private capital expenditure fell 5.4 percent in the three months to March 31 to a seasonally adjusted 5.884 billion Australian dollars (4.2 billion US). The median market forecast had been for a rise of 5.0 percent. "The government's whole economic strategy is based on very, very poor foundations altogether," said Societe Generale Australia's chief economist, Ivana Bottini. "They recognised that the big weakness was business investment and they did absolutely nothing to promote business investment in the budget -- they assumed it would just magically improve," she said. In raw terms, the bureau predicted a six percent rise in private sector capital spending in 1994-95 from the 1993-94 estimate of 27.452 billion dollars. That rise depended on actual capital spending exceeding latest private sector expectations by about 10 percent. This had occured during 1992-93 and was likely to happen in 1993-94, the bureau said. "On the face of it, even the expectations data for 1994-95 appear likely to fall short of the rosy outlook in the budget forecasts for a 14.5 percent increase in investment," said Stephen Koukoulas, senior economist at Citibank Australia. "These figures suggest that the budget forecasts for business investment are very optimistic." Willis insisted his forecasts remained intact because actual business investment in the next financial year would outstrip private sector expectations by more than the bureau's forecasts. "With economic conditions continuing to improve and with general business confidence remaining extremely high," he said, the difference between actual investment and business expectations "can be expected to increase." Bottini, however, said Australia would be doing well to achieve a six percent rise in business investment 1994-95.
