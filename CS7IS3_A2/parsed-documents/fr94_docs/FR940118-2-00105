FR940118-2-00105 FR940118-2-00060 The Commission believes that, because this amendment appropriately clarifies the definition of a fill or kill order, the amendment should be approved. This change will promote just and equitable principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 35 35 See supra footnote 12. Rule 131(l)_Types of Orders_Not Held Order: Currently, Rule 131(l) defines a not held order as a market or limited price order marked ``not held,'' ``disregard tape,'' ``take time,'' or which bears any such qualifying notation. The Exchange proposes that orders marked ``buy on the print'' or ``sell on the print'' be included in the types of orders deemed to be ``not held orders'' because by their terms, these orders can only be executed if a print takes place at its limit. The Exchange further asserts that as with other ``not held'' orders, there are no assurances that the broker handling the order will be able to execute the order at that same price. The Commission believes that ``buy or sell on print'' orders are appropriately classified as ``not held'' orders because brokers cannot guarantee execution at the designated ``print' price. Classifying such orders as ``not held'' orders should serve to put customers on notice that they bear the price risk of an execution at a price other than the ``print'' price. The Commission approved a similar revision to the comparable NYSE Rule. 36 The Commission believes that these changes will serve to protect investors and the public interest in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act 37 by clarifying the definition of ``not held'' orders. 36 The Commission approved similar changes to NYSE Rule 13_Definition of Orders. 37 See supra footnote 12. Rule 135_Cancellations: Currently, Rule 135 only permits a member or member organization to cancel a transaction if it was made in error or for other proper reason, and unless in each case prior approval of the cancellation is obtained from a Floor Official. The Exchange states that this permits unilateral cancellations. The Exchange proposes that Rule 135 be revised to provide that a member may only cancel or revise a transaction if it was made in error or the cancellation or revision is for other proper reason, and unless both the buying and selling members agree to the cancellation or revision, and prior approval of the cancellation or revision is obtained from a Floor Official. The Exchange also proposes that the title of the rule be revised to indicate that the rule relates to revisions in, as well as cancellations of, transactions. The Exchange further proposes to amend Commentary .02 to Rule 135 to require that when a transaction is not cancelled but the member intends to assume for his or her own account the contract made for a customer, the provisions of Rule 390 apply, and any required consent of the Exchange under that rule is to be obtained from the Compliance and Surveillance Division instead of through the Membership Compliance Division. The Commission believes that the proposal should be approved because it will increase oversight of cancellations or revisions as well as prevent unilateral cancellations. The proposal is modeled after the comparable NYSE Rule (NYSE Rule 128B.10_Publication on the tape or in the sales sheet) which requires the cancellation of a transaction to be agreed to by both sides of the transaction in question in addition to obtaining the approval of a Floor Official. In addition, the change in designation in Commentary .02 to the Compliance and Surveillance Division is necessary so that this rule identifies the appropriate Division governing the regulated conduct. Rule 154, Commentary .03_Orders Left With Specialist: Commentary .03 provides that specialists may not accept ``not held'' orders or orders with such qualifications as ``keep the best bid or offer,'' ``disregard tape,'' ``take time,'' and scale orders without specific amounts and prices orders. The Exchange proposes that Commentary .03 be revised to include ``buy on the print'' and ``sell on the print'' as additional types of orders which a specialist is prohibited from accepting because under Rule 131, a ``buy on the print'' or ``sell on the print'' order is deemed to be a ``not held'' order. The Commission believes that this change is an appropriate ``housekeeping'' amendment that should be approved in conjunction with approval of the proposed amendment to Rule 131. Rule 154, Commentaries .06 and .07_Orders Left With Specialist: Current Commentary .06 provides that all good `til cancelled (``G.T.C.'') orders on a specialist's book must be cancelled on such periodic dates as may be prescribed by the Exchange, unless properly confirmed or renewed as prescribed by the Exchange. The Amex proposes to delete current Commentary .06. Current Commentary .07 requires specialists to return receipt stubs of G.T.C. orders, cancellations and confirmations on the same day in which they are received and it requires specialists to return receipt stubs of periodic confirmations of renewals promptly as prescribed by the Exchange. Current Commentary .07 also requires confirmations of cancellations of orders and confirmations or renewals of G.T.C. orders to be dated, and duplicate receipt stubs to be maintained by specialists. The Exchange proposes to delete references to the return of receipt stubs of periodic confirmation or renewals in Commentary .07 which will be renumbered as .06. 38 The Exchange also proposes to delete the requirement that receipt stubs be signed by the specialists. In accordance with the amendment, specialists will just have to stamp their name on such receipts. Finally, the Exchange proposes to delete the requirements that confirmations or renewals of G.T.C. orders be dated and duplicate receipt stubs kept for them. The Exchange states that these proposed changes are based upon the NYSE's recision of its Rule 123A.55 which had required the periodic confirmation of G.T.C. orders on the specialist's book. 39 The Exchange also states that these provisions are unnecessary in view of the automated recordkeeping ability of member firms. 38 Rule 154, Commentaries .08 through .13 will be renumbered as provided in the Exchange's proposal. 39 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29318 (June 17, 1991), 56 FR 28937 (June 25, 1991) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;89&hyph;02).
