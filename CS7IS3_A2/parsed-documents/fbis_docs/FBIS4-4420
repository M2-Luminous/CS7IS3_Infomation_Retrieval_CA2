Prime Minister Hosokawa is said to have been eager to display his leadership in mapping out the package by adding specific figures to a draft package. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura shows confidence in resuming the framework talks, saying, "(The United States) appears to have been surprised that the Japanese Government has mapped out this good package in a short period." With many issues, including the issue of tax cuts, left untouched, however, the government will certainly face a rough sailing in working out a set of concrete measures to implement the package by the end of June, and it is unpredictable how the government will patch up relations with the United States which remain chilly following the breakoff of the framework talks. Explaining to a group of Japanese reporters at the Prime Minister's Official Residence on the afternoon of 29 March why the package envisions the 1994 ratio of Japan's current account surplus to the GDP at 2.8 percent, the prime minister said, "Although some have argued that it would be difficult to set such a figure, we would be unable to have the United States understand the package if we do not present such a figure in the package." A top government official has said: The figure of 2.8 percent was once excluded from the draft package in the face of backlash from bureaucrats who asserted that "the figure may be taken as Japan's international commitment." The figure, however, was resurrected on the morning of 28 March in respone to strong instruction from the prime minister's official residence. The package, however, only indicates a direction and that the government will have a rough way in working out a set of concrete measures to implement the package by the end of June shortly before the Naples summit (the summit talks of industrialized nations) is held. As for tax reform, the government, in the package, clearly indicates that "it will seek to reform the current tax system within this year" on the basis of decisions the ruling coalition parties will make at the end of their consultations during June, and it reveals the intention to continue cuts in the income tax. Speaking at a news conference on the evening of 29 March, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura called the reform of the current tax system "Japan's commitment to the United States," saying the government will "assume the responsibility" to make a decision on reforming the current tax system during June. However, what sort of decision the ruling coalition parties will make on the reform of the current tax system remains uncertain because of backlash within the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan. In the macroeconomic area that the United States has most strongly demanded, the Finance Ministry has opposed reviewing the plan for public investment, citing financial difficulty, and as a result, the package does not indicate a specific amount of increase in the public investment. While the package envisions the 1994 ratio of Japan's current account surplus to the GDP at 2.8 percent, the United States has insisted on 1 percent. In this way, there is still a wide perceptional gap between the two countries. The prime minister's reputation was slighted following the breakoff of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. If the package contributes to restoring his reputation, it would serve as a leverage for him to overcome difficulties on the domestic agenda. His leadership will again be tested in working out the set of concrete measures to implement the package.
