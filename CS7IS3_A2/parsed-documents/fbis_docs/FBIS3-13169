Here is the text of the statement: The secretariat of the General People's Congress reiterates its anger at and condemnation of the horrible crime perpetrated in the Ibrahimi mosque and the repeated acts of aggression against the heroic Palestinian people which followed. This horrible crime and other crimes perpetrated by the occupying Israeli invaders are considered the vilest acts of terrorism against innocent people performing the morning prayer in the middle of the blessed month of Ramadan. The secretariat of the General People's Congress stresses that this crime and the others that have followed it are officially organized terrorism officially directed by the Israeli Government, which has based its existence on such a program since its establishment under the protection of the West, which has officially supported the policy of terrorism manifested in crimes, massacres, and the building of arsenals for weapons of mass destruction. The secretariat of the General People's Congress, in addressing the conscience of humanity and all honorable people of the world headed by the sons of the Arab and Islamic nation, is insistent that that an end must be put to the tyranny, oppression, and repression exercised by the Israelis for racial motives and with the support of the West. The secretariat urges all of them, Arab and Islamic countries to exercise their rights in the UN Security Council, the United Nations, and the international forums to punish the tyrants who have been blinded by force and fanaticism, to put an end to their terrorist behavior and boycott them. The secretariat of the General People's Congress asks that everyone should shoulder their responsibilities vis-a-vis these repeated horrible crimes which give warning of the results, which will have reprehensible consequences. [Signed] The secretariat of the General People's Congress of the Great Jamahiriyah
