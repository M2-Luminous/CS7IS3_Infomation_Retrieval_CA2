"Obviously, the U.S. is determined to resolve the problems and challenges it faces in the Middle East before stepping into the next century," said the paper. This is of paramount significance for the U.S. in view of the fact that Europe, in a centrifugal move, created propitious ground to gain independence from the U.S. in the post cold war epoch. Now the U.S. strives to establish absolute sway over the Middle East in a drive to recompense for having lost its grip on Europe, the article noted. "In tune with this strategy, Washington has hastily embarked upon accelerating the domino effect of compromise in the Middle East," it said, adding "Washington fails to realize that such strategies serve only as tranquilizer rather than remedies for U.S. allies in the region." Stressing that the Middle East problems can be solved through the concerted efforts of all regional peoples, the paper concluded by saying that Israel has never been able to conceal its true face in the Middle East's political scene no matter what mask it has worn.
