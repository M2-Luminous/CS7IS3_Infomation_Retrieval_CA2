In the fourth year since regaining unity, Germany is faced with great challenges. It is these challenges to which I want to dedicate all my power. Our central task for the coming year will be to secure existing jobs and to create new ones. For this reason, we must do everything we can to overcome the present recession and to change outdated structures -- wherever this is necessary. Later than most other countries, we felt the full impact of worldwide recession in 1993. At the end of the year, however, economic figures are encouraging again. In the second and third quarters, GNP in the old laender increased slightly. The Bundesbank has voiced expectations that "the bottom of recession seems to have been reached, if not passed." Experience shows that even after an upswing has started, it will take some time for its positive effects to be felt in the labor market. And what is more, like many other countries, we are not just faced with "normal" recession. Structural problems have been building up in the economy and in society for some time. A major stocktaking is required of the economy and society if we want to maintain our favorable position in the international competition for business locations. High growth rates and more than 3 million new jobs created over the last few years may have induced many sectors not to make the necessary adjustments to changing competition structures. This has brought about a need to act, which is now increasingly being felt. This means: Waiting for an economic upswing is not enough. In early September, the Federal Government, therefore, passed its report on how to secure Germany as a business location. It pointed out the priorities and areas where there is a concrete need for action. We need new approaches in matters of wage costs, working hours, education, research, and technology. Public reaction to the report has been encouraging. Industry and society will have to rethink. It has become very clear that this is necessary. Now we need to follow up the correct diagnosis by a suitable therapy. All groups of society will have to contribute their share in this. The framework conditions for employment are mainly created by the wage agreement partners. They have the power to give employment and jobs priority over everything else. By introducing flexible working hours, machine operating times can be extended and more part-time jobs can be created. Like other industrial countries, we must finally manage to increase the number of part-time jobs offered. Opinion polls indicate that the demand for part-time jobs is much higher than the supply. All over Germany, almost 2.5 million full-time employees would prefer to work part-time. By establishing new and flexible employment models, an enormous potential of additional jobs could be opened up. It is the Federal Government's central task to secure the basis for growth and employment by continuing its consolidation policy. Next year, by enforcing cuts amounting to double-digit billion German mark [DM] figures, we will be 5 percent below the estimated budget. These are excellent preconditions for a further decrease in interest rates, a stable currency, and an uninterrupted flow of foreign capital into our country. As far as the inflation rate goes, we are back to a three before the decimal point. The Federal Government also took action in several other important areas. Let me just mention two examples: The new law on work times, which has been presented to the Bundestag for debate, enables wage round parties and their partners to have new, more flexible working hours and longer machine-operating hours. The law on securing Germany as a business location cuts taxes on companies' profits and thus encourages industry to make investments in order to create new jobs. With these measures we have now achieved the lowest such taxes since the FRG was established. These markedly improved framework conditions will now have to be made use of quickly by authorities and industry, employers and trade unions, with the aim of creating additional jobs. We will intensify the necessary talks with the relevant groups, establishing what each of them can and must do to secure existing jobs and create new jobs in order to cut unemployment. Beside securing existing jobs and creating new ones, the completion of Germany's internal unity will be our central task. The year 1993 saw great progress in this respect. According to the Bundesbank, there is an increasing upward trend being felt in eastern Germany. It increasingly includes east German industry, which is going through a particularly difficult process of adjustments. In spite of recession in the west, the dynamics of investment in the east continues. Public per capita investment in eastern Germany was 137 percent of the west German rate in 1993, corporate investments were at 109 percent. This shows clearly that the catching-up process in the new laender has gained momentum. We are also making good progress in housing. At some 75,000, the number of building permits granted in 1993 was more than double the 1992 figure. What is particularly pleasing is that job cuts seem to have largely come to a halt in 1993. Meanwhile, the number of new jobs being created equals the number of old, unprofitable ones being cut in other areas. Thus, unemployment in eastern Germany went down in November, while it increased in western Germany for seasonal and economic reasons. In our active labor policy, we have spent well over DM100 billion since 1991 on social adjustments for the people in eastern Germany. Last year, we could thus help 1.7 million people who would otherwise have lost their jobs. We increased pensions in the new laender quite fast. In mid-1990, pensions in eastern Germany were between DM470 and DM602. From 1 January 1994, a citizen who worked for 45 years and had an average income will get more than DM1,400 in pension payments. Thus, pensions have increased from one-third to some 75 percent of West German standards. In 1993, we were once again able to offer a sufficient education and training program for the young generation in the new laender. Our training initiative provided more than 10,000 training facilities other than in companies. These are a number of successes, but we have no reason to lean back complacently because of these successes. In the coming year we will have to do everything we can to make new investors and their capital and markets find their way to the new laender. In 1994, public budgets, led by the federal budget, will continue to support the catching-up process of the new laender, with transfers amounting to triple-digit billion mark sums. Our economy very much depends on exports -- and this includes jobs all over Germany. That is why we have consistently supplemented structural reforms in our own country by our efforts to help liberalize world trade and advance European integration. The GATT agreement signed in mid-December is the most comprehensive liberalization package of the past decades. This great success will particularly stimulate the German economy and employment. The political unification of Europe will determine our future in peace and liberty. As the country with the highest number of neighbors in Europe, we Germans have a vital interest in preventing a relapse into the power rivalries of former times, into the selfishness of national states, and into changing coalitions. The political keynote created by Konrad Adenauer, who said that German unity and European unification are two sides of the same coin, is still valid. At the beginning of November, the Maastricht Treaty came into force. Frankfurt am Main will become the headquarters of the European Monetary Institute, and of the European Central Bank at a later date. This is a convincing sign of confidence in our policy of stability, and it encourages us to continue our course with determination. In the second half of 1994, Germany will take on the presidency of the European Union. We will use this period to speed up the process of European unification. I can see four areas where we will have to concentrate our efforts in this process: 1. Joint steps toward securing Europe as a business location and to ensure growth and employment in the Union, as was already emphasized by the European Council in December; 2. The application of the principle of subsidiarity, which will be a regular topic at European Council meetings in future, thanks to my efforts; 3. The implementation of the first plan of action to increase cooperation in internal and legal policy, in particular the establishing of the European police authority Europol; 4. The expansion of a joint foreign and security policy. During the next few years we will be faced with the great tasks of completing German unity, advancing European integration, and of preparing the reunited Germany for a future in a world that has changed profoundly. I have no doubt that we will successfully tackle these problems.
