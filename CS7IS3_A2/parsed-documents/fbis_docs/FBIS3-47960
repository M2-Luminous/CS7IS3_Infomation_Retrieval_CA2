It also said efforts to reduce inventories were making little progress. Domestic shipments of videocassette recorders, refrigerators and washing machines in January recorded year-on-year increases, however. In the nonmanufacturing sector, the value of lease contracts continues to decrease and domestic freight transport business, other than home delivery of parcels, remains slow, the EPA said.
