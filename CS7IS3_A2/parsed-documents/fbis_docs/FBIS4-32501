After the rapid start in 1992, its tempo slowed down, and preferences for individual methods changed. The current government stresses that all of the privatization methods will be used and that they will be equal. However, this contradicts the statement provided by Milan Janicina, the Slovak Republic's minister for the administration and privatization of national property, that direct sales will be used only in specific cases. [Janicina] I meant putting standard and nonstandard methods on an equal footing. The coupon method is nonstandard, and there are three standard methods: public auction, public tender, and sale to a person designated in advance--that is, direct sales. Public tender is transparent, but direct sales were, are, and will be a subject for speculation. This is why we want to restrict it, but we cannot entirely avoid it. All of the cases so far have involved enterprises in bad economic situations. We can either launch bankruptcy proceedings against them, or a prospective buyer will emerge who will pledge to revive the enterprise. The second case is more advantageous. Moreover, budget-funded organizations cannot be liquidated. We have to sell them and also consider the system of installments. A different case would be to sell it to a solvent foreign investor. The National Property Fund has obligations and needs money, and a public tender can take several months. We do not want to push direct sales into the background, but, within the standard methods, we want to use them only in justified cases. [Podstupka] There will be a second wave of coupon privatization. It will not be easy to raise 88 billion [korunas] worth of property.... [Janicina] We are short of 37 billion. I believe that we have time until the end of July to reach this volume. So far, health facilities, half of the agricultural enterprises, and some of the Ministry of the Economy's enterprises have not been included. We are counting on 17 billion worth of property in energy-generating and gas enterprises, despite the fact that, according to Minister Magvasi, the privatization of the energy-generating and gas industry should be organized in a separate law. [Podstupka] The positions of your ministry and the Ministry of the Economy differ. Is it possible to overcome this difference? [Janicina] I believe that the difference is not as great as they say. There are two extreme opinions. According to the first one, the privatization of the energy-generating and gas industry means the virtual disintegration of the state, while the other points to the example of the well-functioning British private energy-generating and gas industry. It is possible to agree with Minister Magvasi that our state is young, and intervention has to be done carefully. This is why privatization should be implemented gradually. Enterprises should be transformed into large shareholding companies, which would then establish branch subsidiaries. [Podstupka] It is expected that state-owned shareholders' companies will be anchored in the law.... [Janicina] I have the feeling that this would be a step backward, a turn toward socialist privatization. We have to make clear what state ownership participation is. As far as I know, a certain respectable legal firm is preparing a draft of this law for the Ministry of the Economy. It is slowly getting into a legislative and legal shakeup. In no case will this be easy. The strategic interest of the state can be secured if the National Property Fund has the controlling volume of shares. However, the National Property Fund was drafted as a certain catalyst of privatization and, after privatization is completed, should wither away. There are fears that it could become a kind of superministry, a super planning commission, and, moreover, an entrepreneurial subject with enormous assets. This is a great danger. This is why it is possible to abolish the National Property Fund at a certain stage of transformation by transferring the shares securing strategic interests of the state to a state body--the Ministry of the Economy, in this case. I would like to comment here that, on the part of the Ministry of the Economy of the Slovak Republic, we can feel the residue of what used to be the "ministerial" attitude: We are big, and we must control. [Podstupka] Why are some of these enterprises being privatized by the coupon method? The state is being deprived of certain income. [Janicina] Simply to improve the average quality of shares that are in coupon privatization. We cannot give only garbage to the people. The previous government believed the coupon method was marginal. They were to pick the raisins from the cake to sell them, and the rest, which no one wanted, would be put into coupon privatization. This is not what we want. In the policy statement, the government pledged also to offer prospering enterprises in coupon privatization, so we have to fulfill it. [Podstupka] The second wave of coupon privatization will begin in the fall--that is, after the elections. Could a change in political power slow it down, change it, or stop it? [Janicina] It could theoretically happen that a government that is completely against coupon privatization would assume power. Such a government would have problems because it would discredit itself at home and abroad. It is certain that, if that government had 90 deputies in parliament, it could order anything, even a return to socialism. In that case, I would fear for the fate of coupon privatization. [Podstupka] Is the Privatization Ministry, after all of the changes and reorganizations, prepared for the second wave of coupon privatization? [Janicina] I believe it is, as regards the personnel. We have certain problems with founding ministries, particularly regarding coordination with privatized enterprises. Some enterprises are doing everything to avoid privatization. They do not cooperate when completing ownership-related legal documents, particularly referring to real estate. We must overcome this. I have issued an order that every enterprise that is 60-percent prepared must go ahead with privatization. It will be transformed into a shareholding company, and, according to Section 15 of the law on large-scale privatization, the concomitant rights will be transferred onto it. [Podstupka] Is cooperation with the National Property Fund all right? [Janicina] Coordination could be better, but we cannot complain. It would be better if we had personnel connection between the National Property Fund management and the ministry. Not on the ministerial level, but it would be good if we returned to the situation where the deputy minister was the chairman of the National Property Fund Presidium. [Podstupka] What will be the fate of the enterprises whose decision about direct sale, made by the previous government, was abolished by the current government? [Janicina] Developments will tell us whether they will be sold directly or by public tender. One sale has already been made--the sale of the Nuclear Power Station Research Institute. It was sold to the same people to whom it had been sold under Meciar's government. The project was only completed by missing data. Despite the fact that my resistance to the Employees' Stock Ownership Plan for Companies is known, in this case I had no objections. Only 5 percent will go to the management, and the rest to other employees.
