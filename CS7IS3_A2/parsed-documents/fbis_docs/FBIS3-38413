The special units and the snow and mountain commandos commanded by high-ranking officers, who were already on a state of alert in southeastern Turkey, moved to begin their operation, code-named "Destroy," under falling snow yesterday morning. Several snow vehicles acquired from the United States are being used in their operations. The security forces have intensified their operations in the triangle between Diyarbakir's Lice and Hani districts, Bingol's Karliova and Genc districts, and Mus. They have also intensified operations on the heights of the Gabbar, Namaz, and Cudi mountains. It has been reported that hit-and-run attacks have been organized against predetermined PKK shelters in the region under unfavorable winter conditions. Specially trained civilian security teams have intensified their operations to control the intercity highways as a precaution against any move by the PKK to block them. Meanwhile, the planned reconnaissance flights over the border areas and the Zhalah camp have been postponed because of weather conditions. A high-ranking official who prefers to remain anonymous has recalled the government's view that 1994 will be a year of determined struggle against the PKK. He said: "The security forces will carry out spontaneous cross-border ground and air attacks in the future. The attack on the Zhalah camp has destroyed the PKK's training center. It also removed the logistics support that camp gave to PKK units in Turkey. Turkey is able to monitor the movement of PKK militants through its satellite systems. We waited for an opportunity for a long time. Significant blows will be inflicted on the PKK terrorists, who have withdrawn to their shelters because of the winter. The established targets will be quickly destroyed."
