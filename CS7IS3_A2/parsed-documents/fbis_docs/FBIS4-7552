She was reacting to remarks made by KSCM Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek during the KSCM Central Committee meeting on last Saturday [26 March] in which he said, among other things, that SLB and the People's National and Social Salvation Union (LUNSZ), led by the pre-November 1989 Czechoslovak Communist Party Prague branch chairman Miroslav Stepan, tried to feed on KSCM structures. The Czechoslovak Communist Party was disbanded in April 1992. In view of last weekend's meeting of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) National Council, which decided against sharing an election staff with the SLB, the two parties will form a common election coordination council. The SLB Central Committee, scheduled to meet on April 8, is to discuss the creation of an election staff. "We see the elections as being based on the civic principle. We are also aware that in many places, people have asked that the left insist on its candidates having adequate qualifications," Stiborova said.
