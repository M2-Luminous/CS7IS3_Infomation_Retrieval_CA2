If the applicant defers execution of the financial instrument until after the license has been issued, the executed original copy of the financial instrument obtained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall be submitted to NRC prior to receipt of licensed material. If the applicant does not defer execution of the financial instrument, the applicant shall submit to NRC, as part of the certification, an executed original copy of the financial instrument obtained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.

(d) Each decommissioning funding plan must contain a cost estimate for decommissioning and a description of the method of assuring funds for decommissioning from paragraph (e) of this section, including means for adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels periodically over the life of the facility. The decommissioning funding plan shall also contain a certification by the licensee that financial assurance for decommissioning has been provided in the amount of the cost estimate for decommissioning and an executed original copy of the financial instrument obtained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. * * * * * 6. Section 40.42 is amended by redesignating paragraph (b) as (b)(1) and adding a new paragraph (b)(2) to read as follows: §40.42 Expiration and termination of licenses. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) Upon licensee notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the licensee must maintain in effect all decommissioning financial assurances established by the licensee pursuant to §40.36 in conjunction with a license issuance or renewal or as required by this section. The amount of the financial assurance must be increased, or may be decreased, as appropriate, within 90 days of the notice, to cover the detailed cost estimate for decommissioning established pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(D) of this section. (i) A licensee who has not provided financial assurance for decommissioning at the time of submittal of the notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall provide (by 90 days after publication of the final rule) financial assurance for decommissioning in an amount and form that complies with the requirements of §40.36 according to the possession limits in the license. (ii) Following approval of the decommissioning plan, a licensee may reduce the amount of the financial assurance semiannually, as decommissioning proceeds and radiological contamination is reduced at the site, with the approval of the Commission. * * * * * PART 70_DOMESTIC LICENSING OF SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL 7.
