Are relations between the two countries, with strategic and economic interests that override everything else, worth dicing with for the sake of emotional bombast over a court judgment? If the answer is no, why does the US persist with petty acts that would call into question its commitment not only to diplomatic relations with friendly countries, but also the primacy of the written law? If the US is the only superpower left, it needs to behave like one. It would not want to look silly over a matter as routine as Fay's punishment. The Singapore Government had been proper, in the face of abuse and rabid talk from both the US media and the Fay family, in asking that both sides "focus on their larger mutual interests and put this incident behind them." And this from the party sinned against: Fay had been dealt with by the book. Singapore had nothing to be sorry for what had happened. It was a straightforward court matter. We ask if the US is serious about wanting to move on from here when, in the space of two days, a high official in the administration goes on what looks like a personal vendetta against Singapore, and the State Department continues to equivocate about the truth of Fay's injuries from caning. Mr Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, was guilty of gross indecency when he said that Singapore should be denied the privilege of hosting the World Trade Organisation's [WTO's] inaugural conference next year. The Fay link was transparent. Mr Kantor was hijacking the decision-making prerogative of the WTO's global membership, an indiscretion that should be condemned. Member states decide who shall be the host. Singapore may not get the vote, but it should not be because of the Fay case. If the WTO can be dragged into a bilateral squabble, just as the Olympic movement was debased over the argument about China's human rights record, a new and dangerous distortion would become the norm in the conduct of international relations. America would not want to claim the patent rights to that, surely. Mr Kantor's remark was irresponsible, never mind the crassness for which he is sometimes known. After the State Department had said he was expressing a personal view as the government had no opinion on who shall be host has America ever cared about such things?, Mr Kantor was unrepentant. Singapore, no -- he repeated. Question: If a loose cannon is allowed to contradict policy, how much damage could be done? President Bill Clinton, a personal friend of Mr Kantor's, needs to be fastidious about cabinet house-keeping. As for the dispute over how badly Fay had been hurt in the caning, the pertinent issue is truthfulness as it affects relations. The extent of Fay's injuries is irrelevant. Caning will invariably leave marks and it would sometimes draw blood. The Prisons Department should not have had to explain how mild the injuries had been and how well Fay had taken the caning. To the government's objections that the description of boy's condition -- as given by his father and lawyer in America based on an account given a US Embassy official here -- was exaggerated, the State Department has been waffling. If it does not believe the Prisons Department's account, it should say outright that the Singapore Government is lying. The government will no doubt respond appropriately. We have no cause to doubt the accuracy of the official account. If the U.S. accepts it as accurate, it owes Singapore an obligation to be forthright. In the process, end the spectacle of the government of the world's strongest nation being manipulated by an overwrought family. It was amusing, now it gets tiresome.
