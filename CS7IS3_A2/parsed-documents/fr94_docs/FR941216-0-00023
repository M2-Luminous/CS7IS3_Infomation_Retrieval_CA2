Interference with race activities may constitute a safety hazard warranting cancellation or termination of all or part of the race activities by the Patrol Commander. (B) Any unauthorized entry within the race course perimeter, as marked by the AC'95 or CORC Race Vessels and Official Vessels, by unaffiliated vessels constitutes a risk to the safety of marine traffic. Such entry will constitute a factor to be considered in determining whether a person has operated a vessel in a negligent manner in violation of 46 U.S.C. 2302.

The Patrol Commander may implement one-way traffic patterns, a five knot speed limit, and sailing restrictions in the regulated areas or portions thereof if the Patrol Commander deems it necessary to ensure safe navigation.

If one-way traffic patterns are implemented, participant and unaffiliated vessels are required to transit the applicable regulated area(s) in either an inbound direction (proceeding into port) or an outbound direction (proceeding to sea). No traffic in any direction other than inbound or outbound (i.e., cross traffic) will be permitted in the area of implementation. If a five knot speed limit is implemented, all traffic entering or exiting the harbors will be required to make a speed of no more than five knots through the water. If sailing restrictions are implemented, all participant and unaffiliated sailing vessels shall be operated under auxiliary power or under tow. Motor-sailing with mainsail only will be allowed. If a five knot speed limit, one-way traffic, or sailing restrictions are implemented, all participant and unaffiliated vessels shall also abide by all other nonconflicting provisions contained within these special local regulations associated with the regulated area.
