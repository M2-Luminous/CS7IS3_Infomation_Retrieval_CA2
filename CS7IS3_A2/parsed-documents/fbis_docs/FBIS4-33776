A delegation of Balaguer's political opponents led by vice presidential candidate Fernando Alvarez Bogaert has unsuccessfully tried to participate in the OAS assembly -- which is being held at the city of Belem, Para State -- through an invitation extended to them by a Central American country, possibly Costa Rica. The attempt was rejected by most of the 34 delegates, who centered their efforts on the Haitian crisis and the strengthening of the trade embargo to force the ouster of the "de facto" Haitian Government, thanks to behind-the-scenes negotiations conducted by Dominican Foreign Minister Juan Taveras and other Balaguer envoys. Mario Read-Bitti, president of the Dominican Republic Central Bank, told EFE: "It is surprising that the opposition attempted to raise a domestic subject here that concerns only the Dominican people." When it became clear that Alvarez would not be able to speak at the OAS plenum, the opposition mission sought to propose a draft resolution in which the OAS voices concern about the openness of the vote count conducted by the Dominican Central Electoral Board. Diplomatic sources told EFE that although this initiative also failed OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares may refer to the Dominican elections in his closing speech on 10 June. The OAS had sent a mission of observers to oversee the recent elections in Dominican Republic.
