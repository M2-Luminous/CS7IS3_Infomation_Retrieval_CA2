The navy is at the limit of its combat readiness, he said, and our sailors may not manage to hold out unless finances are allocated in the Navy budget to overcome the problems. [Begin Velkov recording] Most Bulgarians, for one reason or another, use the sea only for recreation, and they do not see the big problems that face Bulgaria as a naval power. [end recording] It is very expensive to maintain the old vessels, but no money is available to buy new ones. The submarines have had their armaments removed, but to acquire a new one someone will have to cough up about $170 million. A fighting frigate is too expensive for us; one costs 350 million German marks. At the moment there is not enough money even for repairs.
