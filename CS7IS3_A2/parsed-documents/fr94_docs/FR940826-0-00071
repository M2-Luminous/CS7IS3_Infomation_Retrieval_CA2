FR940826-0-00071 FR940826-0-00016 A. Definition of Small Business 42. In the Third Report and Order we adopted a definition for small businesses based on the standard definition used by the Small Business Administration (SBA). This definition permits an applicant to qualify for installment payments based on a net worth not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. 13 CFR 121.802(a)(2). 80 In the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order, we removed our generic ``small business'' definition, which was based on the original SBA size standard and indicated that we would establish a definition for ``small businesses'' on a service-specific basis. 80 The SBA has recently changed its net worth/net income standard as it applies to its Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program. See 59 FR 16953, 16956 (April 8, 1994). The new standard for determining eligibility for small business concerns applying for financial and/or management assistance under the SBIC program was increased to $18 million net worth and $6 million after-tax net income. 13 CFR 121.802(a)(3)(i). The change in this size standard was attributable to an adjustment for inflation and changes in the SBIC program ``designed to strengthen and expand the capabilities of SBICs to finance small businesses so that they can increase their contribution to economic growth and job creation.'' 59 FR at 16955. 43. Many commenters, including the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, argue that the SBA net worth/net revenue definition is too restrictive and will exclude businesses of sufficient size to survive, much less succeed, in the competitive PCS marketplace. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and the Suite 12 Group advocate adoption of a gross revenue test, arguing that a net worth test could be misleading as some very large companies have low net worth. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy recommends that the revenue standard be raised to include firms that (together with affiliates) have less than $40 million in gross revenues. Similarly, Suite 12 suggests a $75 million in annual sales threshold. As another option, the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy suggests that the Commission consider a higher revenue ceiling or adopt different size standards for different telecommunications markets. 81 81 Some parties recommend using the SBA's alternative 1500 employee standard. See, e.g., comments of SBA Associate Administrator for Procurement Assistance at 2, CFW Communications at 2, and Iowa Network at 17. A number of other commenters, including the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy, argue, however, that adoption of this alternative SBA definition would open up a huge loophole in the designated entity eligibility criteria. Specifically, they contend that telecommunications is a capital, rather than labor, intensive industry, and that a entity with 1,500 employees is likely to be extremely well capitalized and have no need for the special treatment mandated by Congress in the Budget Act. See, e.g., comments of SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy at 8, LuxCel Group, Inc. at 4, Suite 12 Group at 10&hyph;11. 44. We now realize that the cost of acquiring a narrowband PCS license will be significant and bidders may be required to expend millions of dollars to acquire a license and construct a system in PCS markets. Thus, we believe that our current narrowband PCS small business definition is overly restrictive because it would exclude most businesses possessing the financial resources to compete successfully in the provision of narrowband PCS services. Accordingly, we modify our small business definition for narrowband PCS auctions to ensure the participation of small businesses with the financial resources to compete effectively in an auction and in the provision of narrowband PCS services. 45. There is substantial support in the record for a $40 million gross revenue standard. For example, the SBA recommends that for PCS, a small business be defined as one whose average annual gross revenues for its past three years do not exceed $40 million. 82 It states that this definition isolates those companies that have significantly greater difficulty in obtaining capital than larger enterprises. At the same time, the SBA contends that a company with $40 million in revenue is sufficiently large that it could survive in a competitive wireless communications market. 83 Similarly, the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy asserts that a $40 million threshold will allow participation by firms ``of sufficient size to meet demands in almost all small markets and some medium-size markets without significant outside financial assistance.'' 84 82 Ex parte filing of U.S. Small Business Administration, June 24, 1994. 83 Id. 84 Comments of SBA Office of Advocacy at 10. Cf. comments of Iowa Network and Telephone Electronics Corporation (advocating a $40 million annual revenue criterion for telephone companies) and replay comments of North American Interactive Partners and Kingwood Associates (advocating $40 million gross-revenue criterion for applicants for the fifty most-populous BTAs, based on estimated average build-out cost). 46. For purposes of narrowband PCS, we shall therefore define a small business as any firm, together with affiliates and certain large investors, with average gross revenues for the three preceding years of less than $40 million. 85 In addition, an applicant will not qualify as a small business if any one attributable investor in, or affiliate of, the entity has $40 million or more in personal net worth. 86 To ensure that only bona fide small businesses in need of government financing are eligible, we will consider the gross revenues of the applicant, its affiliates, as well as those of ``attributable'' investors on a cumulative basis. The text that follows discusses what interests are attributable for these purposes. In addition, it sets forth exceptions to these attribution rules for minority and women-owned applicants. 85 The establishment of small business size standards is generally governed by Section 3 of the Small Business Act of 1953, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง642(a). Recent amendments to that statute provide that small business size standards developed by Federal agencies must be based on the average annual gross revenues of such business over a period of not less than three years. See Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;366, Title II, ยง222(a), 106 Stat. 999 (1992); 15 U.S.C. ยง632(a)(2)(B)(ii). 86 Unlike our proposed eligibility criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, described below, the small business definition does not include a total assets standard. We believe that the $40 million gross revenue cap for small businesses should be sufficient to ensure that only bona fide small businesses are able to take advantage of the measures intended for them.
