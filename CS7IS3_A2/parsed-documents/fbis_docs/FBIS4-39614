In his words, the Geneva meeting between the special envoy of the UN General Secretary Yasusi Akasi and representatives of the confronting Bosnian parties was fruitless. "Moslems and Croats agree only to a quadripartite ceasefire with its possible prolongation for four weeks. The Bosnian Serbs are ready to cease fire at least for four months," the diplomat indicated. As he said, "fears that the Serbs would try to preserve the status-quo and to fix themselves on 70 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina stand behind the obstinacy of the Moslems and Croats." "One cannot say that these fears are groundless. The threat of "an ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still preserved and all confronting parties are the source of this threat, noted Interfax interlocutor. But it is quite obvious that nobody will let the Serbs violate the proportion of division which was coordinated at the ministers' meeting in Geneva; in accordance with this agreement the Serbs will receive 49and the Moslem-Croatian federation -- 512000060100f the territory of this former Yugoslavian republic." According to the diplomat, "one cannot permit that the fears of one of the parties would "suspend" the process of peaceful settlement in Bosnia." "In an adverse case the world community will be forced to begin everything from the very beginning," he said.
