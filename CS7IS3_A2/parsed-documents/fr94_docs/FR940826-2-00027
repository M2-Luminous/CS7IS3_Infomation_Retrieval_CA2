SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Introduction Section 3131 of the Act (42USC7274d(6)), enacted on December 5, 1991, addresses the issue of worker training at nuclear weapons facilities. Subsection (a) provides for the awarding of grants to train workers and to develop training curricula. Subsection (b) provides for the assessment of civil penalties against any DOE contractor who fails to provide training to its employees who are engaged in hazardous substance response or emergency response at DOE nuclear weapons facilities. Subsection (b) requires that penalties shall be assessed against any contractor who fails to provide the training, or fails to certify to DOE that its employees are adequately trained for such response pursuant to orders issued by DOE relating to employee safety training. Since the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), Pub. L. No. 91&hyph;596, contractor employee health and safety protection at DOE nuclear facilities has been exempt from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforcement under section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act. This section provides that the OSH Act does not apply to working conditions of employees if another Federal or state agency exercises statutory authority to prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupational safety and health (OSH). DOE, as well as its predecessor agencies, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration, has exercised such authority with regard to contractor employees at facilities operated under authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
