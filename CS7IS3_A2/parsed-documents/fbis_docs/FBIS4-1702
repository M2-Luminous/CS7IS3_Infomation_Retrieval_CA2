FBIS4-1702 "drchi064_b_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 United States & Canada World Bank: China's Trade System More Open Than U.S. World Bank: China's Trade System More Open Than U.S. OW0104231794 Beijing XINHUA in English 2248 GMT 1 Apr 94 OW0104231794 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Washington, April 1 (XINHUA) -- China's trade system, in wake of institutional decentralization and more foreign direct investment, is now "significantly more open" than the U.S. and Japan, the World Bank said today. "Despite a complex array of tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, China has become a relatively open economy, with evidence of considerable tariff redundancy," the bank said in a recently concluded country study report. The study, entitled "China: Foreign Trade Reform", noted that the people's republic, now the 11th largest exporter in the world, has made "dramatic progress" in reforming its trade system in recent years. Import penetration in certain sectors in China, the study said, is "extremely high", standing at 28 percent of the gross value of industrial output of China's machinery and transport equipment sector in 1990. "The present is an opportune time for China to embark on a substantive program of trade liberalization," the report said, stressing that the importance of trade planning in China has been "declining". Since 1979, when the world's most populous country began its market-oriented reforms, China's exports have increased ninefold and imports more than sevenfold. "The promotion of external trade has been central to China's efforts to modernize its economy," the study said. China's economy, it said, has become "significantly more open than the U.S. and Japan." The share of merchandise trade in China's gross domestic product went from 10 percent in 1978 to 31 percent in 1991, with imports accounting for 15 percent. China "appears to be more than twice as open as India and Brazil," it said. In 1978, the study said, trade in China was monopolized by 12 foreign trade corporations and there was no foreign direct investment. But by 1992, over 3,600 such corporations competed for export business and over 90,000 foreign direct investment projects had been approved with a contracted value of 58.1 billion U.S. dollars, the study said. In the 1980s, the study said, China's exports outperformed those of most other countries, including such newly industrialized economies as Malaysia. China now exports about 17 percent of the gross value of industrial output of its overall manufacturing sector. According to China customs statistics, China's trade surplus with the United States, Hong Kong and Germany in 1992 were respectively 15.4 billion, 7.8 billion and 1.6 billion dollars. During the same period, China's trade deficits with China's Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea stood at 10.4 billion, 5.5 billion and 1.2 billion dollars respectively.
