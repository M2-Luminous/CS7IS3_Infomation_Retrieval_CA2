It was a real issue at the recent elections of the Jordanian Writers Association and continues to engage the attention of a good many Arab intellectuals. For most of them, it seems that to hold our ground culturally makes up for the setbacks we have suffered on the battle front over the past four decades. In fact, with an impending normalization in the military, economic, commercial, tourist, and water spheres, I cannot see how it will be possible to resist cultural normalization. How will it be possible to buck the trend for cultural normalization when economic normalization will bring Israel right to the core of our lives and channels will open wide between our mortal, permanent enemy and ourselves? Are we to bar access to the Israeli newspapers, counsel our viewers and listeners against tuning in to Israeli television and radio networks, and ostracize whoever reads a poem composed by an Israeli author or a literary work translated from Hebrew? I, for one, am prepared to observe a decision to combat cultural normalization. But will local and Arab intellectuals show me and other like-minded persons the way to put this decision into practice? I will admit that in this age of satellite communications, the world is now virtually a global village and culture is a universal and global concern. However, I take issue with some intellectuals who are falling all over themselves to become familiar with Israeli literary works and figures. How are we to combat cultural normalization when Israeli television gate-crashes our homes, when our radios are continually tuned in to Israeli stations, and practically every Jordanian and Arab daily runs a full page translated from one Israeli paper or another? Would it promote the cause of the fight against cultural normalization, if we were to march through the streets tomorrow and demand that Arab Education Ministries keep the same curricula and not tell our children that Israel now belongs in the camp of our friends? This may be one way to further this cause. However, assuming that Israel will continue to be viewed as an enemy in our school curricula, we must realize that an Arab child encountering Israelis and handling Israeli toys and candies is bound to be confused and perplexed. Normalization is normalization; we can't be selective. It is pointless and meaningless to combat cultural normalization when we press ahead with normalization in military, economic and other areas, and when our intellectuals seem keen to read whatever is being turned out by Israel's mass media.
