The director general of the chief minister's office, Mr. J.M. (Mahlangu), made the appeal after a task group of the TEC had reported on the disruption of essential services, increasing tension and lawlessness in the area. The task group also reported on the apparent inability of the Lebowa government at the Department of Regional and Land Affairs to resolve Lebowa's financial problems. Mr. (Mahlangu) said that the TEC had also decided that an effective administration had to be established in Lebowa as soon as possible and that administrators had to be appointed to assist in this. He said that the immediate task of the administration would be to appoint independent arbitrators to attend to the problems and complaints of officials.
