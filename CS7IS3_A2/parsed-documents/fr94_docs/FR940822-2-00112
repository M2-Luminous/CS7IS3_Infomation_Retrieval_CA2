FR940822-2-00112 FR940822-2-00061 (b) Curriculum Adaptation Projects. (1) Description of the Program. The Board is reserving up to $350,000 to provide support for adaptation and implementation of model curricula and/or model training programs previously developed with SJI support. The exact amount to be awarded for curriculum adaptation grants will depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted in this category and other categories of the Guideline. The program is designed to provide State and local courts with sufficient support to prepare and conduct a State-specific or regional modification of a model curriculum, course module, national or regional conference program, or other model education program developed with SJI funds by any other State or national organization. An illustrative list of the curricula that may be appropriate for the adaptation is contained in Appendix VII. Only State or local courts may apply for Curriculum Adaptation funding. Grants to support adaptation of educational programs previously developed with SJI funds are limited to no more than $20,000 each. As with other awards to State or local courts, cash or in-kind match must be provided equal to at least 50% of the grant amount requested. (2) Review Criteria. Curriculum Adaptation grants will be awarded on the basis of criteria including: the need for the educational program; the need for outside funding to support the program; the likelihood of effective implementation; and expressions of interest by the judges and/or court personnel who would be directly involved in or affected by the project. In making implementation awards, the Institute will also consider factors such as the reasonableness of the amount requested, compliance with the statutory match requirements, diversity of subject matter, geographic diversity, the level of appropriations available in the current year, and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years. (3) Application Procedures. In lieu of concept papers and formal applications, applicants for grants may submit, at any time, a detailed letter, and three photocopies. Although there is no prescribed form for the letter nor a minimum or maximum page limit, letters of application should include the following information to assure that each of the criteria for evaluating applications is addressed: • Project Description. Why is this education program needed at the present time? What is the model curriculum or training program to be tested? How will it be adapted for State use, and who will be responsible for adapting the model curriculum? Who will the participants be, how will they be recruited, and from where will they come (e.g., from across the State, from a single local jurisdiction, from a multi-State region)? How many participants are anticipated? • Need for funding. Why cannot State or local resources fully support the modification and presentation of the model curriculum? What is the potential for replicating or integrating the program in the future using State or local funds, once it has been successfully adapted and tested? • Likelihood. What is the proposed date for presenting the program? What types of modifications in the length, format, and content of the model curriculum are anticipated? How will the presentation of the program be evaluated and by whom? (Ordinarily, an outside evaluation is not necessary.) What measures will be taken to facilitate subsequent presentations of the adapted program?
