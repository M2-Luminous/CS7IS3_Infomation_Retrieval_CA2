Sources close to the negotiations have said that the stances assumed by both sides have not changed a bit and that differences still persist on the crossing points and the area of Jericho. [Paris AFP in English at 0210 GMT on 9 February carries a Cairo-datelined item by Haro Chakmakjian on the negotiations, which adds: "Israeli and PLO negotiators made `some progress' in a marathon session of talks deep into the night aimed at launching Palestinian self-rule, but an accord would still need more work, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said here early Wednesday. ["`We made some progress and we shall try tomorrow (Wednesday) to complete our work,' Peres told reporters after more than four hours of discussions with a PLO delegation led by Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. ["Peres said both sides would meet again at about 10:00 a.m. (0800 GMT) Wednesday, and he would meet 'Arafat at about midday. ["`We are working on a text that we are to agree on,' Peres added. ["Another Israeli negotiator, Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, said differences with the PLO had been reduced, but `nobody at this point knows how close we are' to an agreement. ["The points of disagreement were sensitive, he explained. `We haven't set a deadline yet.' ["Negotiators from the Palestine Liberation Organisation could not be reached for comment on Tuesday's talks held at the Andalus Palace in the northeastern suburb of Heliopolis, where 'Arafat was staying. ["Savir said both sides were working `word by word and paragraph by paragraph.' ["They were concentrating on security issues such as the control of international borders and road access to Jewish settlements, which, together with the size of the autonomous Jericho area, have been the main stumbling blocks. ["Earlier Egyptian leaders stepped in to try to break the deadlock after an inconclusive round of talks Monday."] The same AFP report adds: ["An Egyptian Foreign Ministry official told AFP Egypt had `made every effort to enable the two sides to reach an accord.' ["President Husni Mubarak held a 45-minute meeting with 'Arafat and Peres, after a day when the two sides reported no progress. ["Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa later met Peres for an hour to try to resolve the remaining difficulties. ["Peres said he had the `mandate of the government' and would stay on in Cairo as long as necessary to overcome obstacles. The points agreed in Davos still stood, he said, denying Palestinian charges that Israel was backing out. ["However, he told Israeli radio: `Even if we sign an agreement on security issues, which are on the agenda, there is a range of other subjects which we have not yet tackled and which will have to be settled.' ["They included the powers to be devolved to the Palestinian autonomy council, the electoral system and the transfer of civilian authority."]
