Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed the documents in Brussels today. Moscow was 21st nation to join the program that covers joint planning and exercises and other consultations. At the Brussels ceremony, Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will visit Washington in September. Before the September trip, Yeltsin will meet Clinton in Naples, Italy, during the July summit of the seven industrialized nations. In a separate development, U.S. Vice President Al Gore opened two days of talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on space, trade, energy and environment cooperation. Both Gore and Chernomyrdin are leading several joint U.S.-Russian committees working on the related areas. The committees, established 14 months ago during Clinton's meeting with Yeltsin in Vancouver, Canada, are having their third meeting here. They are expected to sign a number of agreements on cooperation in space exploration, oil and gas production and environmental protection.
