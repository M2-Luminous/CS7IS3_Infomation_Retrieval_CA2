[passage omitted] Jia Zhijie maintained that our province's current situation can be summarized in three sentences: First, the situation is unprecedented and fine rather than generally good. The main indications are that the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for production is unprecedentedly high and a momentum of breakthrough development has been maintained in grain and cotton production and the development of a diversified economy and township and town enterprises. A historic, great turn has occurred in the development of industry, which has maintained a relatively high growth rate, some state-owned enterprises have managed to get, or are getting, themselves out of their predicaments, and the industrial output in April increased by 12.2 percent over the same month last year, higher than the 5 percent for the nation's state- owned enterprises in the same month. Urban and rural markets are brisk and reforms in macromanagement structures, such as finance, banking, investment, and planning, have been progressing smoothly. Experiments in building a modern enterprise system are being carried out step by step and opening up to the outside world continues to maintain a good momentum. Second, is that in the fine situation, there are really some difficulties and problems hampering development and stability, which should not be overlooked, and we should earnestly approach and properly solve them. Third is that only when these difficulties and problems in our advance are properly solved can our province's fine situation, which has not come easily, be maintained and developed. [passage omitted] Jia Zhijie pointed out: It is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability, further remove hidden dangers, and maintain social stability. He said: What counts in solving the problem of stability is taking a two-handed approach: Take radical measures while putting stress on taking precautions. At present we should make great efforts to do the work well in the following ways: Firmly putting price raises below the nation's average levels; doing well from start to finish in improving the lives of the people in disaster areas, areas around reservoirs, and poverty-stricken areas, ensuring that they have enough food to eat and their temporary shortages are smoothly overcome; doing an earnest job of finding jobs for cadres and employees whose employment has been affected as a result of reform; encouraging the companies which were affected by reform to find a way out by increasing income and decreasing expenditure, readjusting the organizational structure, and cutting unreasonable spending, and continuing to improve the basic daily necessities of the enterprises which have suspended production totally or partially and help some university and college students solve their difficulties in their daily lives. He urged all localities to pay close attention to the development of the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects, strive for innovative advances in developing a diversified economy and township and town enterprises, and do an ever better job in rural work. He pointed out: Our province's guidelines for rural work are clear and definite. At present, all localities should seize the favorable opportunity, further implement the central authorities' and the province's various preferential policies in support of agriculture, effectively reduce the peasants' burdens, adopt effective measures to check the excessively rapid momentum of price raises in capital goods for agriculture, protect the peasants' immediate interests, further mobilize their enthusiasm for production, ensure effective supplies, and lay a solid material foundation for stabilizing the market and commodity prices. [passage omitted] While talking about running state-owned enterprises well and maintaining the good momentum of industrial production, Jia Zhijie pointed out: It is necessary to take measures to tackle difficult problems and increase efficiency. [passage omitted] All localities should give first consideration to and study the market while helping the enterprises which have suspended production totally or partially recovered production, by deciding projects to launch, making decisions, and readjusting the product mix and the enterprise organizational structure. The fundamental way for enterprises to meet market demand is to enable them to get involved in the market and strive to pump fresh vitality into state-owned enterprises by deepening reform, changing operational mechanisms, and establishing a modern enterprise system. Jia Zhijie stressed: To handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability and maintain and develop the fine situation, which did not come easily; party committees and governments at all levels and various departments should further change their work style and develop the good work style of being practical and doing a solid job. What counts in doing this is that leaders should set an example. Principal party and government leaders at all levels must: Take the lead in cutting the excessive number of document meetings and having less social intercourse; be determined to go deep into the realities of life; go down to the grass-roots units, enterprises, and the rural areas by centering around the outstanding problems in reform, development, and stability; do more investigation and study; make great efforts to carry out their work; and solve practical problems.
