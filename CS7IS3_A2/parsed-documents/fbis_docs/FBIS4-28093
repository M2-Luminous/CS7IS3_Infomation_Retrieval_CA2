At the meeting, the Defense Agency's senior staffs, headed by Defense Councilor Ken Sato, will discuss with their German counterparts various security issues, including U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping operations, the officials said. The joint talks were first proposed by German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe last November to then Defense Minister Keisuke Nakanishi while he was visiting Tokyo. The agency plans to hold bilateral meetings regularly thereafter because the two nations share common interest in acquiring permanent U.N. Security Council membership, defense sources said. The Japanese defense officials are also scheduled to stop over in France to exchange views with the country's defense officers before heading for Germany, the government officials said. Japan's Peacekeeping Cooperation Law, enacted in May 1992, restricts overseas operation of Self-Defense Forces troops to noncombat duties, as shown in the peacekeeping operation in Cambodia from 1992 to 1993. Germany's Constitution also prohibits troops from participating in U.N. combat missions outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) territory. But in attempting to occupy permanent Security Council seats, the two nations are likely to be more pressured to expand their role in U.N. peacekeeping operations. World War II victors Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States are the only permanent members at present.
