Even though these utterances may be projected as logical and popular, a deeper and precise examination will assist us to perceiving the ill-intentioned U.S. objectives. In this regard, the presidential adviser for national security affairs, Anthony Lake, spoke recently on the Persian Gulf region and explained his country's stance. In his remarks, in order to capitalize further on the resources of the Arabs of the region, he once more waxed eloquent on the defeated policy of dual containment of Iraq and Iran and stressed the dangers from both these countries to the regional countries. Even though one should admit that Washington's plan for dual containment of Iran and Iraq stems from a lack of understanding of the realities and how the needs of the region relate to U.S. foreign policy, by making such claims the United States is paving the way for a greater presence in the region. In his remarks, Anthony Lake spoke in general terms of "extremism." Dividing it into religious and national extremism, he claimed that both were dangerous for the United States and the region. Extremism is one of those expressions frequently used by Americans, but they have never clearly defined what they actually mean by this term. Even though extremism is even denounced in the religion of Islam, the U.S. hierarchy and, naturally, the regional Gulf officials have a different concept of extremism as compared with the usual concept. From Washington's point of view, the term "extremism" applies to any individual or government not willing to officially recognize the illegitimate U.S. interests in various countries around the world. The Americans freely label anyone who does not succumb to their domination as an extremist, even though they have not yet presented any specific definition of this term. For example, they refer to the Lebanese Hizballah as a conspicuous example of extremism. Have the Hizballah carried out any action other than armed resistance--which is the last resort of resistance--in the face of usurpation? Unfortunately, in today's world all kinds of freedom-seekers are suppressed by false accusations and even by force at sword point; and the subsequent struggle is labeled extremism. Lake also rejected the notion of a war between the West and Islam after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and communism. While his own country is engaged in a multifaceted war against Islam in various parts of the world, Lake claims that the United States is strongly opposed to the view that the United States should go to war against Islam in the aftermath of the failure of communism. Lake claimed that his country has no intentions of dominating the Middle East. Addressing these countries, he said that progress in the peace process will give the Middle Eastern countries an opportunity to embark on improving their economy and the lives of their people instead of squandering their resources purchasing weapons. The realities in the region however belie his allegations. The establishment of military, air, and naval bases in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are outstanding examples of this fact. The White House adviser on national security affairs made these claims at a time when the region has been stockpiling destructive and complex American weapons, whose use is unclear even to the Arab shaykhs. In the opinion of experts, the United States--by supporting the Zionist regime's existence and by generating tension between that regime and the Arab governments--intends to open up a new front of hostility and tension among the regional Muslim nations. The prolonged visit by the U.S. assistant secretary of state to the Persian Gulf region, his provocative remarks regarding the so-called dangers from Iran, his resurrecting of the claims of the Untied Arab Emirates, all were part of the U.S. policy of generating tension in the region. Some countries' endorsement of such claims against Iran is part of the overt U.S. policy of fomenting tension in the region. Unfortunately, some of these countries have fallen into the traps laid by the colonialists, and they are following precisely the same lines that the Americans have formulated to raise tension. In this regard, in his speech yesterday, Saudi Arabian King Fahd called on Iran to abide by international norms and alluded to the UAE's territorial claims against Iran, calling for the handing over of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf to the UAE. These remarks can only result in raising tension in the region, and will result in greater backwardness and misfortune for the region, with more domination and profit making by the United States. The Saudi king has thus taken a new step toward disrupting the sensitive situation in the Persian Gulf region.
