Contacted by telephone, Kabia said UNAMIR personnel were in the building, which is normally the seat of the National Development Council (Parliament), "and we had to ask the government forces to stop firing to let them out." It appeared that the rebels did not return the fire, which broke out early in the morning and lasted for more than an hour, Kabia said. He noted that the previous night had been very calm.
