Igor Nikoforov, leader of the Independent Miners' Union in the Pechorashakhtstroy concern told Interfax that the workers would continue their protest action until back payment was guaranteed to them. Currently, 121 strikers are staying underground and about the same number of them engaging in a sit-in at surface installations. Nearly 20 of them have come down with the flu. Nikoforov, who stayed the weekend with the strikers trying to convince them to leave the pit and continue their action in surface installations, said that the men were desperate. "They are increasingly irritated with the indifference on the part of the government and some of them suggest addressing the Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the theory that he would respond, at least," Nikiforov said. "The strikers are demanding what they have earned and are tired of problems in collecting the cash due them," Nikiforov continued. They told him that they did not care who the president or the prime minister is when their families are starving. The union has run out of the strike fund and has no cash to buy foodstuffs for the mine construction workers, Nikiforov said.
