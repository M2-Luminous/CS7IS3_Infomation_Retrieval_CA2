FBIS3-20683 "jpeer007__s94012" JPRS-EER-94-007-S Document Type:JPRS Document Title:East Europe SUPPLEMENT 2 March 1994 CROATIA Germany Criticized for Protecting Croatia 94P20411A 94P20411A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The Belgrade daily POLITIKA, in an article entitled "Bonn Continues To Protect Zagreb" published on page 7 of its 7 February issue, writes that while, on one hand, the Croatian leadership is being threatened with "empty words" for the policy it is conducting in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a demonstration that all participants in the bloodshed in Bosnia are being treated equally, Germany, in fact, continues to protect Croatia. POLITIKA notes that this is confirmed in that day's Croatian newspapers which "conspicuously published the information that German defense officials have denied Croatian military involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for which Croatia has been threatened with international sanctions in a most serious way." POLITIKA states that while it is clear to the citizens of Croatia that the country's army is participating in the fighting in neighboring Bosnia- Herzegovina because the citizens themselves are being "mobilized and taken across the border, many returning in coffins," the defense attache at the German Embassy in Zagreb, Colonel Per Shvan [name transliterated from Cyrillic] claims that he had just visited units of the 7th Guard Brigade of the Croatian Army which are stationed in the area of Sibenik and Zadar and that he has established that the brigade is "intact" and that it is not active outside of the territory of the Republic of Croatia. POLITIKA notes that this is the brigade reported to be fighting the Muslims in central Bosnia. Colonel Shvan, who was accompanied on this "inspection" by representatives of the German Defense Ministry, stressed that he would inform appropriate officials in Germany of his findings, POLITIKA reports. "Thus Croatia was provided with the argument -- precisely by the German side -- that it is not involved in the battles in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. The German representatives did not visit the citizens who have been forcibly mobilized in the Kroacija Barracks in Zagreb, from where they are sent to the battlefield in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although even some Croatian newspapers have written about this and published the names of persons jammed into military prisons for refusing to go to the undeclared war in the neighboring state," POLITIKA concludes.
