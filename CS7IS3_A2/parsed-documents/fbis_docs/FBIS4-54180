The article says: The work published by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song on May 25, 1967 is of great importance in the efforts of the WPK to firmly establish the monolithic ideological system of the party. The historic work expounds that the fundamental principle of party building is to firmly establish the party's monolithic ideological system as required by the law governing the party building of the working class and the reality of party ideological work. The work also comprehensively systematizes all theoretical and practical questions in establishing this system. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il comprehensively embodied the idea and theory of the great leader's May 25, 1967 work in party ideological work and all spheres of the revolution and construction so that a turn has been effzcted in the work and life of the party members and other working people. The exploits of the Workers' Party of Korea in establishing the monolithic ideological system of the party are that all the party members and other working people have been firmly prepared to be true revolutionaries of chuche type with intense loyalty to the party and the leader. The dear leader expounded that the basic requirement and criterion of loyalty are to hold the leader in high esteem, absolutize the leader's authority, make the leader's revolutionary idea and instructions and the party's lines and policies one's body and soul and unconditionally carry them out. Then he paid deep attention to letting all the party members and other working people live on that basis. The greatest exploit of our party in establishing the party's monolithic ideological system is that it has trained all the party members and working people into staunch revolutionaries who always share their destiny with the party and defend the party and the leader with their lives. Another exploit is that an unbreakable unity around the illustrious leader has been achieved. In strengthening the unity of the party, the dear leader directed deep attention to inheriting the party's tradition of unity and strengthening it. In Korea today, the tradition of unity has been creditably carried forward and the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses has been consolidated. Another exploit is that the ideological position of Korean-style socialism has been cemented. To cope with the vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries in recent years, the dear leader took measures to direct greater efforts to the ideological education of the party members and other working people than ever before and published many famous works, providing a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon to solve every problem our own way. It is because our people are resolute ideologically and a powerful ideological position has been built in Korea that our socialism is making a long drive, not wavering in any storm and stress. Impregnable is our socialist ideological position built by the dear leader.
