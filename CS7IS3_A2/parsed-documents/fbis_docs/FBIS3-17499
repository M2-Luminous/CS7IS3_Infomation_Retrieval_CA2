Despite the passage of a considerable time, the causes of this incident still remain a mystery, and two questions arise from this mystery. First, why, like the act of terrorism committed in the Baku metro, did this incident take place on the eve of Novruz? Second, what is the aim behind the dissemination of reports by the Russian and Armenian mass media that the plane crashed due to supposedly technical faults? And this despite the fact that, just a day after this incident, authoritative sources in Azerbaijan, citing indisputable facts, announced that the plane was shot down. Leaving aside this statement by the Azerbaijani side, an Iranian expert visiting the scene of the incident two days ago also confirmed that it was shot down. And contrary to the Armenian claims, the Iranian side also announced that the plane was not off course, but was forced to fly at low altitude because strong pressure caused cracks on its windows. In short, it is a fact that the plane was hit. It should be kept in mind that apparently it was shot down by those who have tried to link this incident to technical problems or weather conditions; that is, by the Armenians. Many ascribe Iran's failure to react strongly to this incident to its unwillingness to harm its warm ties with Armenia. In our view, Iran is waiting for the completion of the formal investigation; and one of the strongest states in the region cannot remain indifferent to such a tragic death of 32 of its citizens, because if such indifference is observed in the Iranian Islamic Republic, which passes itself off as the ardent supporter of Moslems and Islam in the world, it might create, at the very least, disappointment among the Islamic population of the former USSR, and trust in it might be shaken.
