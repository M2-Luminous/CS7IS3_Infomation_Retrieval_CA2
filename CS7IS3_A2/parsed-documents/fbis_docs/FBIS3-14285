However, it cannot accept that some media sources allow themselves, in the name of this freedom, to commit all sorts of excesses and fail to observe the ethics required by this freedom. This is stressed by a responsible source in the Foreign Ministry in the wake of the 22 March statements by a French Foreign Ministry spokesman regarding the Tunisian authorities' decision to ban the distribution of LE MONDE newspaper in Tunisia. The source added that Tunisia adopted this measure with great regret against a newspaper published in a friendly country. However, Tunisia did not just want to express this regret, but also to highlight and condemn what cannot be ignored, which is this newspaper continuing its hostile and slanderous stance toward a country that is known for its tolerance, and whose media landscape remains among the most open landscapes. It is also the country to which neutral observers certify great achievements in all sectors. The same source adds that these infringements on a sovereign country's dignity and this repeated failure to observe the rules and ethics of the trade are matters that are unacceptable in nature. He recalled that LE MONDE did not content itself by spreading wrong or totally distorted news and commentaries filled with false accusations, but, contrary to common practice, it also often refused Tunisia the right of reply.
