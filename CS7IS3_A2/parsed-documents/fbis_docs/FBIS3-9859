On this occasion Florin Radulescu Botica, PDSR secretary and head of the Romanian parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe, reiterated the political will and interest of both the PDSR and the government in ensuring the fulfillment of the commitments assumed by Romania upon admittance to the Council of Europe. The main target is the ratification by Parliament of the European Human Rights Convention, which will take place by 15 April at the latest. In his turn, Gunnar Jansson said this term of six months is quite extraordinary, if Romania ratifies the European Human Rights Convention by 15 April. Mr. Koenig left the meeting for a few minutes to inform the German and Austrian press -- as he later told us -- of President Ion Iliescu's act of clemency in pardoning certain detainees, an act that, according to Mr. Koenig, has been well received in Austria and Germany as they celebrate the Holy Week, according to the Catholic calendar. The next meeting of the Council of Europe rapporteurs was with the representatives of the Democratic Convention [CDR], whose leader, Emil Constantinescu, reiterated the CDR's contribution to Romania's admittance to the Council of Europe, regarded as a goal in the national interest. Koenig said that the CDR's position has played a decisive role in ensuring a majority vote in favor of Romania's admittance. Emil Constantinescu referred to several aspects that he considered to be in dissonance with the commitments assumed. Among other things, he mentioned the government's sabotaging of the local administration, where the opposition holds an important stake; the need to ensure the dependence of the justice branch; and government corruption. The CDR leader said that the freedom of the press is total and real, with the pressures applied being generally of an economic nature. Emil Constantinescu emphasized the objective stance of the national radio station and the television's dependence on the power. At the end of the meeting, Dinu Patriciu, president of Liberal Party-1993, handed over to the two rapporteurs a memorandum from his political grouping, whereby it considers itself deprived of a rightful place in the parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe. The rapporteurs of the Council of Europe met with the leaders of the parliamentary groups from the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
