These countries should exert intensive efforts to review their forms of economic development. This came in a message President Mubarak addressed to the Bucharest International Forum and read by People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fathi Surur. President Mubarak noted that the success of economic cooperation in the Middle East will not be confined within the boundaries of this region but will have a positive impact on the world economy. He said that he does not conceive of such cooperation growing amid the economic contradictions buffeting the region and the discrepancy in the level of development, as well as the difficult economic situation besetting the countries of the region. He added: Therefore, we expect the European countries to play the role of main partner in this cooperation because of the close link between security and prosperity in Europe and stability and peace in the Middle East. President Mubarak said that the Middle Eastern countries look to the big powers to help them overcome their problems, such as energy, water, infrastructure, and population. He voiced his hope that a comprehensive and fair peace will be achieved to serve as a prelude to eliminating numerous hotbeds of tension in the world. President Mubarak noted the recent political transformations in the Middle east, such as the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, which has had an impact on the whole world.
