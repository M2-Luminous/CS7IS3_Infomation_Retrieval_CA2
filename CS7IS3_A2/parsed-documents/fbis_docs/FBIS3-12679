This massacre is to be added to the crimes that the Palestinian people have been subjected to since the Dayr Yasin massacre, which was perpetrated by criminal thugs whose objective was to uproot the Palestinian people from their lands and possessions and to give these lands and possessions to tyrants and despots. And these despots went ahead with the judaization of the Palestinian land in accordance with a vile scheme that resulted in covering the Palestinian territories with settlements and colonies that are like a spearhead in the Arab nation's body. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre constitutes a crime against all humanity. It is the black fruit of the tendencies of hatred and bigotry that Zionism is planting in the hearts of its followers, thus prompting them to kill and practice violence and urging them to annihilate the Arabs so that the land will be theirs alone and Israel's area can expand to include the entire Middle East, with sovereignty over and control of all the peoples of the region. The treacherous bullets that assassinated the worshippers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque wounded the hearts of the Arabs, Muslims and supporters of right and justice everywhere. These bullets have undermined the peace hopes of everyone. Israel's rulers are secretly hatching plots while talking publicly about peace. They are the ones who gave the terrorrist an opportunity to attack the worshippers and it is they who cover up for the criminals after each massacre. The Wafd Party, which firmly believes that justice must win and injustice is bound to be vanquished sooner or later, believes that this ugly crime must open the eyes of the Arab rulers to the extent of the Israeli danger. The Arab rulers must rise above differences, conflicts, and hatreds and stand united against the schemes being hatched against us so as to turn us into lackies of the Israeli state under the slogan of the Middle East policy. The Arab peoples should be aware of the danger coming from Israel and those who stand behind Israel. The Wafd Party, while feeling the enormity of the catastrophe inflicted on the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, is confident that this catastrophe will make this heroic people more determined, stronger, and more steadfast. The martyrs who were slain by the bullets of treachery are in an Assembly of Truth, in the Presence of a Sovereign Omnipotent, in the company of prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship.
