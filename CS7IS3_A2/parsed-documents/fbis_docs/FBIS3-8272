FBIS3-8272 "dreeu045_k_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-045 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 CROATIA News Conference by President Tudjman LD0703171194 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network in Serbo-Croatian 1100 GMT 7 Mar 94 LD0703171194 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network Language: Serbo-Croatian Article Type:BFN [News conference by President Franjo Tudjman with domestic and foreign correspondents in the presidential palace in Zagreb -- live] [Text] [Tudjman] Despite the fact that the preliminary Washington agreement has been received by all people of goodwill and all responsible political factors both in the country and in the world not only with understanding but also with the assessment that it is of great importance -- this agreement to bring the war to an end and create the preconditions for a lasting peace in this area and create a new international order -- there are those who, either for reasons of political opportunism or because they do not understand or because of a malicious interpretation, want to belittle this agreement and even ascribe to it a significance that it does not have [as heard]. It could be said that there are two main criticisms. One is that this is a turnabout in previous Croatian state policy and the policy of the Croatian president, and the second is that Croatia has in this way accepted the U.S. diktat. What is our position here? Is this a turnabout? Although I have said something about this in my statements, nevertheless, precisely because this is being repeated, I too will repeat: Croatian state policy, and my own personal policy, in fact has consistently prepared for such a solution. Remember: We recommended, and I personally did so -- to representatives of the Croatian people and to the representatives of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] who were elected at the first democratic elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- that the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina should take part in a referendum for an independent (?Bosnia). After this we did not accept everything and sign everything ostensibly offered to us just like that -- as some have said -- but we sought solutions which might be in the interests of the Croatian people as a whole, in the interests of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, of the Croatian state, and also of the international community in creating peace on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in this part of southeast Europe. So we were the ones who proposed and gave impetus to acceptance from the beginning of a cantonal solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, this was not accepted because the Serb side, especially the Serb side, and the Muslim side, did not accept this cantonal system. Then it was we who, seeking a solution in those circumstances, suggested and accepted Bosnia-Herzegovina's organization as a set of provinces, meaning a community or an organization of provinces which would suit all three peoples. This was not acepted either. This means that on our part it was a matter of seeking solutions within the framework of Bosnia-Herzegovina which would satisfy all three peoples. This was not accepted either. We then went on to find a solution which would be accepted -- as the world has always said and is still saying today -- which would satisfy all three peoples. Later on, in the framework of the European conference on the former Yugoslavia, a proposal was tabled whereby Bosnia-Herzegovina would be organized as a union of three republics. Consequently, in this context of resolving the problems, far from being passive observers, we were active factors, active subjects in the course of such a solution which would save Bosnia- Herzegovina and which would also be in the interest of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole and in the interest of the protection of the Croatian state's strategic interests. From this point of view -- given that solutions were being postponed and given that the Croats first faced Serbian aggression and then when the Serbian aggression was over and when the Serbs had conquered 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, when the Muslims turned against the Croats partly because of the influence of extremist elements, we were supporting and organizing the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina throughout all that time so that they could put up resistance to aggression and safeguard Croat interests. Consequently, we also supported the creation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna as opposed to the secession of the so- called Serb republic and as opposed to the Muslim leadership's ambition -- an ambition that was clearly expressed at some stages -- to create their independent Muslim state in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, we supported the creation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and this was not in the least at odds with our continuing initiatives. On the contrary, this was geared toward securing Croat interests, toward the creation of -- both in a political and a military sense -- a situation whereby the interests of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be taken into account on the basis of what the Croat people had achieved in defending themselves from the aggression. That is enough on whether this is a turnabout or whether acceptance of the Washington agreement is in line with the Croatian policies Croatia has been pursuing since day one. After all, that can be seen from my letter to President Clinton of more than a year ago, from my repeated suggestions during talks with Messrs Izetbegovic and Silajdzic and from written proposals tabled in Bonn and Petersburg. Therefore, this is no turnabout, but a consistent policy implemented by the main Croat party in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which won absolute majority of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and by the Croatian state leadership and me personally. Concerning the other piece of criticism, that Croatia allegedly accepted a diktat, I think that I have already answered that too. Croatia has definitely not accepted a diktat and, as alleged, sold its interests for some $500 million. Croatia's policy has since the very beginning been too consistent to accept anyone's diktat or to sell itself for any amount of money. But, Croatia's policy and I personally accepted with gratitude the involvement by the United States and main European countries, and we especially appreciated and viewed as a historic event the fact that the United States managed to reach an agreement with the main European states and that it has taken over the initiative to find this solution of the preliminary Washington agreement. The Washington agreement on the creation of a Croat-Bosniak-Muslim federation in Bosnia and on federal Bosnia-Herzegovina entering a confederal union with Croatia is no diktat, but it is in line with the policy we have been implementing, which has been and remains in the interest of the Croatian people as a whole and the Croatian state. This is all I wanted to say at the beginning of the news conference. Feel free to ask me questions. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have said that this agreement in Washington has received a great deal of attention. I would nevertheless like to ask something from a journalistic point of view. It has also received a great deal of attention from the world media, over 60 TV networks carried shorter or longer excerpts from your address. The majority of international news agencies did the same. What is your comment on this really high level of interest on the part of the world media? And also what do you say about the Serb comments which say that Croatia has played a winning card and taught the Serbs a lesson about how national interests should be protected? Thank you. [Tudjman] I have not yet heard these Serb comments. Obviously, there is sometimes common sense there too, so things are seen as they should be seen. The fact that people in the world demonstrate such a high level of interest proves that this Yugoslav crisis threatened to fuel the spread of war, that the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis in objective terms was and still is one of the most complicated in today's world, and that the world sighed with slight relief as the principal factors of the world - the European Union [EU] states, the leading states of the EU, and the United States in its capacity as the main world power -- have at last realized that some more determined steps should be taken, that they have agreed on these steps and that, consequently, the world has welcomed this agreement as a way out of this war and crisis that have been threatening not only to spread the method of settling accounts by means of war but also to bring about a conflict of civilizations. This is the significance of the agreement not only for us, who are directly involved, but for the world too. After all, the involvement of the world's and Europe's powers, the United States on the one hand and the Russian Federation on the other, made it evident that this is not only a matter of drawing borders between Croatia and Serbia; Serbia and the Muslims. This is therefore also in a sense a matter of drawing borders between the worlds and civilizations which have existed here on this soil since the break-up of the Roman empire, including the well-known Yalta agreement, and so forth. Consequently, this is a matter of decisive and fateful solutions which will reverberate, not only reverberate but they will also have a decisive influence on the future development of relations in southeast Europe and, consequently, in the world too. [Correspondent] Mr. President, how do you comment on the fact that Mr. Alija Izetbegovic has so yet made no direct comment on the Washington agreement? In the latest issue of LJILJAN [Bosnian Muslim newspaper] we could read Alija Izetbegovic's seven theses which show that he has not given up on the concept of a unitary civic state. [Tudjman] I think that Mr. Izetbegovic had to agree with Mr. Silajdzic before Silajdzic put his signature on the Washington agreement. The fact that he has so far not spoken in public could perhaps be explained by Mr. Izetbegovic not being as quick as he usually was, which resulted in his search for a solution occasionally showing inconsistencies or attempts to pass the blame for the clashes between Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Croatia. Someone has drawn my attention to his recent statement on fascism from the left and right, and it is obviously not clear what he referred to. However, I think that it is important that Mr. Izetbegovic had to give his approval to the Washington agreement, and that in the talks we have held, Mr. Izetbegovic agreed that there is a need for coexistence of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have also signed public and -- I can say this today -- secret agreements on a confederal solution such as this one. However, after that he also signed other agreements, for example the famous agreement with the Serbs in which he accepted the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina because the agreement specified that in the event of the division, that is, if Serbia [as heard] opted out, the rights of an international entity -- that is the right to UN membership -- would pass on to the Muslim republic. Anyhow, all these events took place in the very complex circumstances of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. In my opinion, it is important today that we have this solution which Mr. Silajdzic already signed, and which I believe to have Mr. Izetbegovic's approval. [Correspondent] [name indistinct], VJESNIK editor. Mr. President, will a referendum be held in Croatia on the confederal relationship or a federation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? And is there a possibility that this confederation might also be joined by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]? Thank you. [Tudjman, laughing] A referendum will certainly be held because this is envisaged in the Croatian Constitution. But where you got the idea that this confederation will be joined by Yugoslavia -- this I really do not know. I do not think there will be such a referendum in Croatia. Allow me -- as I said in my message -- we are continuing to adhere to the policy of the need and necessity for the normalization of relations between Croatia and Serbia and Yugoslavia. [Correspondent] Mr. President, if I can ask a question. Something which is not looking as far into the future as my colleague (Sejakovic) suggested: What would happen -- would there be a confederation of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Croatia or the Republic of Croatia? To what extent would the Bosnian Serbs agree to a federative or rather a cantonal system in Bosnia? As far as I know Mr. Redman has just come up with this idea in Belgrade today. I have another question which is more important -- perhaps you could answer this first. You probably already know the vague outlines of the future super-counties or cantons in Bosnia. What will happen with the canton or what will happen to the Croatian part of Bosnian Posavina? Is there a possibility that this might cut through the Serb corridor with the western part of Bosnia? Thank you. [Tudjman] What might happen and what will happen if the current so-called Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina agrees to remain in a federal or confederal relationship with Bosnia-Herzegovina -- I would not like to speculate on this. It is difficult to imagine something like this. It also seems to me that this proposal and initiative by the main international factors starts from the fact that there will not be such a thing. However, in any event responsible people in Bosnia-Herzegovina must consider this but, of course, from a Croatian point of view this represents a new element which we will consider with full responsibility and bearing in mind the interests of the Croatian people as a whole and the Croatian state. Understandably, Posavina, the territory of Bosnian Posavina was -- as everyone knows -- purely Croatian in historic terms. It was envisaged as a Croat canton. This issue will be solved as a whole in the organization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, that is between the Muslims and the Croats and even the Serbs. As you said yourself, I believe that the emphasis, that the efforts will now be focused on persuading the Serbs -- something that is indicated by Mr. Redman's visit to Belgrade -- to accept a solution that would be acceptable to the other two peoples. [Redzep] Diana Redzep, Deutsche Welle. Mr. President, the Serbian press, citing Mr. Simic's statements, are heralding Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Zagreb in the near future or, alternatively, your visit to Belgrade. Are you getting ready for such a visit -- which inevitably leads to the question: Why is Croatia sending its official representative to Belgrade at a time when foreign diplomats have left it, and what is the country he has been sent to? Thank you. [Tudjman] As far as foreign diplomats are concerned, as far as I know they are just coming back to Belgrade. They left Belgrade at the moment when it was being debated whether the ultimatum and air strikes would incite large-scale flames of war, so they would be threatened. As far as I know, they are coming back. Croatia is sending its representative, it is opening its office in Belgrade in order to bring about the normalization of relations, a normalization of relations that is not only in the interest of the Croatian people, so we can integrate as soon as possible the Croatian territories under the protection of the peace forces without warfare, but also because the normalization of relations between Croatia and Serbia is also a precondition for the creation of the new world order in the area of the former Yugoslavia in this part of southeast Europe. Consequently, this was and still is our policy. But this is also the policy of the responsible world factors, Europe and even the United States, as you can see even in the fact that President Clinton's envoy is also visiting Belgrade. Consequently, it is impossible to rule out negotiations with Belgrade. We welcome the fact that the international community, headed by the United States, has at last realized that more decisive steps should be taken if these negotiations fail, if there is no success. [Correspsondent] HRVATSKI VJESNIK, Vinkovci. Mr. President, the result of your continuous policy of cooperation and friendship with Croats of Islamic faith, or Bosniak-Muslims will be the signing of the federal and confederal agreements. I would like to know whether you will accept and whether you can accept Mr. Izetbegovic's view that the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina are the occupying force and that they are not a constituent people any more, but a national minority, which has been confirmed on Croatian Television by Bosnia- Herzegovina's ambassador to Croatia. [Tudjman] I will first refer to the previous question and then I will return to yours. I have not heard so far that we had already announced my trip to Belgrade or Milosevic's arrival in Zagreb. In any case that has not been discussed and that cannot happen before our relations are normalized, until Croatia is diplomatically recognized in its borders. I would welcome such a meeting, but only provided that we have first achieved a peaceful solution, reintegrated Croatian territories into the constitutional and legal system of Croatia, and provided Belgrade has given up the occupation of these territories. Belgrade is still involved in the occupation of Croatian territories through providing weapons and through including Knin and so-called Krajina in its monetary system etc. When our relations are normalized in such a way I will accept such a meeting. As I have once said: For the sake of peace and in order to stop the bloodshed of Croat people, to enable Croats to live normal lives, I am willing to go even to hell and back. I have said this once before and I stick to it. And now your question. It is clear that the Serbs were aggressors, first through the Yugo-communist army, and then through Serbia's expansionist policy, in their attempts to create Greater Serbia. They first occupied a third of Croatia's territory, or rather that third of the territory that remained in their hands -- they had, with the Yugoslav army, held the whole of Croatia. They were holding one third, and then we liberated a part of it -- there is still a quarter of our territory under the protection of the peace-keeping forces, or under Serb occupation. It is also a fact that they are holding two thirds of Bosnia- Herzegovina under their authority, and -- clearly, it can be said -- under their occupation. But it is also a fact that the Serbs are one of the three constituent peoples there and that the international community accepts this fact and has negotiated with representatives of the Bosnian Serbs so far, as well as with Belgrade. In conducting our policy we have to take this reality into consideration, and we have to adjust our policy to the real state of affairs and to the facts of international politics. [Paradzic] Zeljko Paradzic, GLAS SLAVONIJE. Mr. President, can you comment on statements by Assembly Deputy Speaker, Mr. Djukic, that the Serbs will never accede to being a national minority in Croatia; also, which guarantee is the world community offering to ensure that the occupied Croatian areas -- that Belgrade will give them up? Thank you. [Tudjman] The position of Serbs in Croatia is set out in the Croatian constitution and in a special constitutional law which we adopted in agreement with the EC arbitration commission and the European conference on the former Yugoslavia, so statements by individuals along these lines cannot change anything. Your other question -- on guarantees. The statements by the most responsible world factors, the heads of almost all main states, not only foreign ministers but also state statesmen, and the most important European states and the United States [words indistinct]. However, the guarantee of the world organization of the United Nations -- which in all its resolutions, especially resolution 871, confirms and guarantees the territorial integrity of independent Croatia -- is more important. In these circumstances Croatia has demonstrated that it is an effective factor in precisely these international attempts to resolve all sober questions in the modern world in a peaceful way and in not allowing individual national minorities to cause the destruction of sovereign states and the provocation of general war chaos. In these circumstances when Croatia has on its side both the EU and the main world great power of the United Nations, when our agreement is also being welcomed by the Islamic countries, in these circumstances we can really be sure that we will have the support of all these international factors and that we will realize the incorporation of these Croatian territories under UN protection into the constitutional and legal system of Croatia in a peaceful way. If this is not successful, then we would have the political support for those steps which we would have to take -- and it is in this that the success of Croatian state policy and the far-reaching nature of the agreement which we have signed is reflected. [Skugor] Milana Skugor, HINA. Mr. President, how far has the process of dividing [former] Yugoslavia's assets gone, and can we see what Croatia will get? My second question is about preparations for the tourist season. What is the Croatian government doing to bring back tourists who used to come before the war? [Tudjman] Okay, please, can you ask just one question at a time from now on? I cannot remember two. Tourism. The Croatian Government is already taking steps. You could have read that there have been echoes of this [Washington] agreement at the Berlin tourist congress, whatever that gathering is called. It is certain that the agreement in itself, and especially its implementation, will have a considerable impact not only on the revival but also on the development of tourism in Croatia at a level higher than before. Your first question referred to the succession. Concerning the Croatian delegation and the delegations of the other countries -- from Slovenia to Macedonia -- they have made quite a good progress in solving all those problems with the help of the EU negotiators taking part in negotiations on the division of assets. However, the Serb -- that is Yugoslav -- delegation obstructed the negotiations and prevented them from reaching an agreement. This step in the search for peace, in forcing all those -- and primarily Belgrade -- who are in one way or another involved in the overall crisis, and consequently in the problem of the succession will be forced to solve that problem [as heard]. Both we and the world understand that the solving of the problem of the succession -- as well as the occupation of the Croatian areas -- cannot be postponed for a long time, because that means that Belgrade has the assets which belonged to the former Yugoslavia. That problem needs to be put on the agenda to be solved as soon as possible. Besides, in connection with this, there is a question of a practical nature. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now placing part of the heavy weaponry under its control. It would probably be very useful if those weapons did not come again -- for any purpose -- into the hands of the aggressor and the Serbian army, the Serbian side in whose possession they have been until now, but were instead destroyed or put at the disposal of the others. Personally, I prefer the destruction and a financial deal to solve that part of the succession, which to a large extent involves weaponry. [Ggorgyi] Orban Gyorgyi, Hungarian Radio. Mr. President, is there a certain fear that a confederal resolution of state relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia could serve the Serbs in the so-called Krajina in their demand for a confederation with Serbia, and unfortunately also statements by Mr. Churkin indicate the complexity of possible parallels [as heard]. What do you think about this? [Tudjman] First of all, one cannot compare the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina - the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia- Herzegovina -- with the Serbs in Croatia. The Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina are three constituent peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas the Serbs in Croatia -- the ethnic Serb community -- are a minority in Croatia. Their position is set out in the Croatian constitution and constitutional law. So they do not have any right to self-determination; and it is clearly stated in international conventions that minorities do not have the right to self-determination, and this is the case in practice in the world as well, because if this were recognized, if the right of all minorities to self-determination and separation were recognized, no international order would be possible and general chaos and general war would ensue. [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. Will we have a referendum on establishing of confederal relations with the Bosnia- Herzegovina federation before the Bosnian Serbs decide where they want to be -- whether they will remain in the Bosnian federation or join Yugoslavia? And which part of Bosnia can the Bosnian Serbs take out with them, and what consequences does this have, bearing in mind that Croatia has a narrow coastal strip? [Tudjman] We certainly will not hold a referendum until the Serb question in Bosnia-Herzegovina is resolved, for the final confederal agreement cannot be reached until that issue is clear. As you know, the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina at their meeting in Mostar yesterday and before that put forward a justified demand -- that they can agree to a confederation within Bosnia-Herzegovina only if a confederation with Croatia is subsequently to be founded. I believe this demand is justified, although the draft constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation also guarantees complete equality to the Croats and full sovereignty on the territories where they are the majority population. The cantons are envisaged to have their own constitutions, their legislative authorities, their own budget, police, president. It is also envisaged that the cantons where Croats are in the majority should form a Croat council for coordination of the Croat policy in federal organs. Full equality is guaranteed to the Croats within the federal organs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is envisaged that the president and vice president of the federation are elected every four years, that one is a Croat and the other is a Muslim, and that the president's nationality changes every four years. Full equality is also guaranteed in the government. At least one-third of ministers have to be of Croat nationality, although the Croat population in the federation is not as large. The prime minister, deputy prime minister, and ministers also have deputies, one is Croat, the other Muslim. Therefore, full equality and participation is guaranteed to the Croats in the whole of the state administration of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. The important issues, if they may be in the government, because the government will reflect the composition of the population, but perhaps if the government includes a larger number of ministers of other nationalities, the Muslim nationality or others that would remain in the Bosnian federation, decisions on the important issues can only be taken by a consensus [sentence as heard]. Therefore, nothing can be imposed on the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina that would contravene their interests. This is envisaged both as regards the president and the vice president of the federation, as regards both chambers of the parliament, the government, judiciary, the state prosecutor and so on. Therefore, with this solution the Croats are gaining not only what they now have in their hands, what they have managed to defend from the Serb aggression, and managed to preserve in this conflict with the Muslims, but also all the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are gaining an opportunity to secure not only their national survival, but also an opportunity to be involved in the state administration throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is then particularly included that, the confederal alliance with Croatia is also creating favorable conditions [as heard]. Of course, this does not mean that the Muslims are thus being put in an inferior position. Full equality is being secured between the Bosniak-Muslim and the Croat nations regarding their equality in interests in the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and in the confederation with Croatia, which is also in the interest, as I said in my address to the nation, which is in the interest of the Western democratic world. To exclude nationalist or extremist fundamentalist elements and to streamline this federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina toward the Western world, the Western democracy in the sense of eternal (?watersheds) in this part of Europe by relying on Croatia and through the cooperation between the Croat and the Bosniak-Muslim nations [sentence as heard]. [Correspondent] I asked [words indistinct] will go to Yugoslavia? [Tudjman] This remains to be seen. Anyway, our interests are one thing and Serbia's interests are another. Still, I believe it is evident that in this case we have reached a stage where agreement has been reached between Croatian views and the views of major European states and even the United States as the world's main superpower. Once we have reached this stage we can say that the issue is not just our issue but that of those main world powerlines and factors and that it will be examined from this point of view too. On my part I have suggested, as I put forward proposals in the past, I have now again put forward some proposals which are regarded from precisely this world and strategic point of view as very interesting and which will be considered by these factors who are being preoccupied with resolving the crisis and who will take final decisions. [al-Isa] Nada al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and TV. I would like to ask you to comment on the increasingly frequent rumors, at least that is what you can read in the Croatian press, originating in Herzegovina, Herceg-Bosna, according to which the message is as follows: We are not going to stay in any kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina union, whatever its name, unless the Serbs are there too, that is in the event of the Serbs joining the so-called Yugoslavia. Your comment, please. [Tudjman] I believe that these views were in evidence when the talk was of a union of three republics. At yesterday's meeting the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna and the political leadership of Herceg-Bosna generally welcomed this preliminary Washington agreement. Their only condition stipulates that a Bosnia-Herzegovina federation is in a confederation with Croatia. Consequently, this is my answer to your question. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the Serbs were the first to violate the cease-fire again yesterday when they shelled Gospic. What is your comment on this? [Tudjman] You have already seen -- especially in that air attack by Serb planes on the factories in Bugojno and Novi Travnik and also in some provocations on Croatian soil -- that in the Serb ranks there are those who oppose a peaceful solution and who particularly want to provoke a renewal of the war in Croatia in order to draw attention away from the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the face of the resolve of the international community to find a solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina before going for the decisive incorporation of Croatian territory under control of the peacekeeping forces in Croatia, they wanted to thwart this or rather provoke war, and the renewal of the war. Such things will happen and it is to be expected on the Serb side too -- both in the protected areas and especially in Belgrade -- that reason will prevail and that we will reach a general solution precisely with what we have achieved. [Nareshkin] Nareshkin, ITAR-TASS. Mr. President, what can be expected from Mr. Granic's visit to Moscow on 9 March? Thank you. [Tudjman] Well, the invitation sent by Minister Kozyrev to our foreign minister indicates that the government of Russia has hitherto tried to act constructively and has acted constructively to resolve the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia and, regardless of the fact that many consider that it has one-sidedly placed itself on the side of Serbia, we can say with our experience that the government of the Russian Federation has come out in favor of the territorial integrity of Croatia and that it has proposed to Belgrade that it recognize Croatia and establish diplomatic relations on this basis. Mr. Churkin -- during his stay here in Croatia and in his talks with the Serbs in Knin -- also proposed that they begin to have talks to find a peaceful solution to the Serb question in Croatia. So we see the invitation to our foreign minister, Granic, to visit Moscow as the continuation of Russia's positive policy, i.e. Russia is not one-sidedly on the side of Serbia or what it has achieved through its aggression, but Russia wants to have a positive influence in the sense that, in agreement both with the EU and the United States, Russia will also play a positive role in finding a lasting solution. [Modric] Franja Modric, NOVI LIST. Please, Mr. President, to what extent would this powerful international community led by the United States succeed in forcing the Bosnian Serbs into a Bosnian federation? Would you say in this case that Croatia should enter a confederation with such a Bosnia-Herzegovina or not? In other words, if you were to support entry at that time what would Croatia's interest be in joining a confederal union? [Tudjman] I said that we would consider this question if and when this might happen. In any event, it is one kind of confederation if there is to be only a federation of Croats with Bosniak Muslims, and it is another kind of confederation if it is also to include Serbs. I do not rule out that Croatia could have an interest in this if this were to happen, but of course, as I said, this would be in a different kind of confederation. In any event it is in Croatia's interest that conditions are created to prevent a Serb expansionist policy aimed at creating a Greater Serbia and conquering even Croatian territory -- and this kind of Serb expansionist policy -- and to this end we have strong guarantees not only for the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina but also from the international community. [Kuzmanovic] Jasmina Kuzmanovic, AP. Mr. President, if the decision on a confederation with the Bosnian republic is implemented.... [Tudjman, interrupting] I do not understand, if? [Kuzmanovic] Mr. President, if the confederation begins truly to function in real life, is there a possibility that the Bosniaks and Croats together might recover some territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina? For example, they could set out to regain the north, the corridor where the Bosnian Serbs seem to have been rather nervous over the past few days and are launching a counteroffensive in the area. Thank you. [Tudjman] The agreement which we signed, toward which we are aspiring, is not an agreement to continue the war, but to end the war. We believe that the international community -- as it is oriented today, including major European states and the United States -- must play the main role in solving the issues of borders in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Tudjen] Branko Tudjen, VECERNJI LIST. My question will not have such political overtones, something that is a little unusual. For the second time I am recalling the fact that I was a sports reporter for a number of years. There are a great deal of sports problems which in my view are not negligible. This one is about football, about coaches, selectors, Markovic, Blazevic, Ivic, and so forth. The newspapers are full of that. I am saying this as the editor of a newspaper which finds this issue very important. Your name is being plugged in a way into this issue among the public -- as if you are taking part in this, you have decided in favor of one person or another. This whole crisis is being linked to you, too. I would like you to comment on this? [Tudjman] Yes, there is no such evil. Sometimes it is good that it is ascribed to me. I am interested in having Croatian sports based on sound foundations. As far as the national team is concerned, it is a fact that today we have a number of European and world-class footballers in the world. This means that the Croatian national team could be an ambassador of this new democratic Croatia just as Ivanisevic and athletes in other fields are. Internal competitions in Croatia are organized in line with Croatian potentials. In this way Croatian clubs could represent Croatia in Europe on a long-term basis and be present as representatives of a people who have won their international recognition, something to which athletes can contribute in all areas. At the same time machinations and swindles are being prevented from taking place as well as, above all, unsupervised spending in professional sport, and to a degree Croatia, as it is, cannot bear [as heard]. This is how much I am interested in my capacity as president of state. Not to mention that I know the importance of sport, that I like sport very much and that I know the importance of sport for the health of the young and even the entire people. I have no connection with individual cases, whether this or that person will be. I do not want to take part in this.
