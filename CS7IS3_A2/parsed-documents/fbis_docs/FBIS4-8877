In the same period, Slovakia exported to Russia industrial products worth only $260 million--that is, less than 8.6 billion korunas [Sk]. A comparison of these two figures produces a frightening Slovak trade deficit of over Sk32 billion. Is the deficit really so awful? Yuriy V. Zelenetskiy, economic counselor at the Embassy of the Russian Federation to the Slovak Republic, has a somewhat different view of the data. [Rabay] You are supposed to have claimed that Slovakia's actual trade deficit is several times lower than the official statistics suggest. How is that possible? [Zelenetskiy] The problem lies in the statistical method. We are of the opinion that, for the sake of objectivity, Slovak-Russian and Russian-Slovak trade relations should be assessed within the framework of the balance of payments rather than that of the trade balance. Only in this way will we arrive at an objective picture. [Rabay] Does the balance of trade perhaps not include payment relations? [Zelenetskiy] Miraculously, it does not. The balance of trade is based only on so-called customs statistics, which only register the physical movement of merchandise across borders. It does not include a whole range of commercial services that Slovakia provides to Russia on Slovak territory, and other facts. [Rabay] But can something that never leaves our country be called an export? [Zelenetskiy] Customs statistics do not permit that. It is possible using the balance of payments, however. According to the customs statistics, Slovakia really exported only about $260 million worth of merchandise to Russia last year. However, during the same period, the Slovak gas industry provided Russia with approximately $340 million worth of services in the transit of natural gas to West Europe. Russia paid for these services in kind--in gas deliveries (according to the bilateral agreement, Russia supplied us in this way with 3.7 billion cubic meters of natural gas, which is two-thirds of Slovakia's annual consumption--editor's note). In the customs statistics, this volume figures as an import because the gas was physically imported. From the viewpoint of the balance of payments, however, this can hardly be qualified other than as $340 million worth of exports by the Slovak gas industry to Russia. If you included just this sum in the mutual balance of trade, the ratio in Slovakia's disfavor would change from five to one to two to one. [Rabay] Looking at it from this angle, however, even the rest of the gas that Slovakia imports from Russia, as compensation for deliveries of capital goods in the 1980's, looks more like exports than imports. [Zelenetskiy] Exactly. This concerns deliveries as a compensation for past credits, according to the Yamburg Agreement. Slovakia does not have to pay for this gas, the annual value of which is between $120 and $150 million. This sum must again be added to Slovak exports. These exports had actually been effected in the past, and the gas supplied to Slovakia today is only a repayment of credit in kind. From the viewpoint of the balance of trade, last year's $110 million worth of deliveries of Russian special equipment belong to the same category because a part of former Czechoslovakia's claims [in Russia] that fell due to Slovakia was repaid by them. As you see, Slovakia's actual trade deficit has shrunk again--to approximately $400 million. [Rabay] We have not yet discussed oil purchases.... [Zelenetskiy] The volume of oil supplied by Russia exceeds Slovakia's need for oil products. According to unofficial data, Slovnaft [Slovakia's sole oil refinery] exports about 40 percent of its output, for which it receives foreign exchange, with which it pays for the oil. And there is yet another aspect. Crude oil that we export to the Czech Republic is being handed over to the Czech partner at the Ukrainian-Slovak border. The Czech partner pays Slovakia for the transit of this oil across the territory of Slovakia, and, once again, this agreement is advantageous for Slovakia. Therefore, if we wanted realistically to assess Slovakia's trade deficit last year with Russia, we would arrive at a sum of only $200 to $250 million. [passage omitted]
