FR940705-2-00198 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b. Only mechanical pipetting devices are used. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;c. Eating, drinking, smoking, storing food, and applying cosmetics are not permitted in the laboratory. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;d. All procedures are performed carefully to minimize the creation of aerosols. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2. Special Practices (BL4). Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a. Biological materials to be removed from the Class III cabinets or from the maximum containment laboratory in a viable or intact state are transferred to a non-breakable, sealed primary container and then enclosed in a non-breakable, sealed secondary container which is removed from the facility through a disinfectant dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or an airlock designed for this purpose. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b. No materials, except for biological materials that are to remain in a viable or intact state, are removed from the maximum containment laboratory unless they have been autoclaved or decontaminated before exiting the facility. Equipment or material which might be damaged by high temperatures or steam is decontaminated by gaseous or vapor methods in an airlock or chamber designed for this purpose. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;c. Only persons whose presence in the facility or individual laboratory rooms is required for program or support purposes are authorized to enter. The supervisor has the final responsibility for assessing each circumstance and determining who may enter or work in the laboratory. Access to the facility is limited by means of secure, locked doors; accessibility is managed by the Principal Investigator, Biological Safety Officer, or other persons responsible for the physical security of the facility. Before entering, persons are advised of the potential biohazards and instructed as to appropriate safeguards for ensuring their safety. Authorized persons comply with the instructions and all other applicable entry and exit procedures. A logbook signed by all personnel indicates the date and time of each entry and exit. Practical and effective protocols for emergency situations are established. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;d. Personnel enter and exit the facility only through the clothing change and shower rooms. Personnel shower each time they exit the facility. Personnel use the air locks to enter or exit the laboratory only in an emergency. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;e. Street clothing is removed in the outer clothing change room and kept there. Complete laboratory clothing (may be disposable), including undergarments, pants and shirts or jump suits, shoes, and gloves, is provided and used by all personnel entering the facility. Head covers are provided for personnel who do not wash their hair during the exit shower. When exiting the laboratory and before proceeding into the shower area, personnel remove their laboratory clothing and store it in a locker or hamper in the inner change room. Protective clothing shall be decontaminated prior to laundering or disposal. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;f. When materials that contain organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules or experimental animals are present in the laboratory or animal rooms, a hazard warning sign incorporating the universal biosafety symbol is posted on all access doors. The sign identifies the agent, lists the name of the Principal Investigator or other responsible person(s), and indicates any special requirements for entering the area (e.g., the need for immunizations or respirators). Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;g. Supplies and materials needed in the facility are brought in by way of the double-doored autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock which is appropriately decontaminated between each use. After securing the outer doors, personnel within the facility retrieve the materials by opening the interior doors or the autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock. These doors are secured after materials are brought into the facility. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;h. An insect and rodent control program is in effect.
