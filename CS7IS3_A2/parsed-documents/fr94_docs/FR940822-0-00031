FR940822-0-00031 FR940822-0-00009 (3) Diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use only if the person that holds the fuel at the first moment of January 1, 1994, actually uses the diesel fuel in an exempt use. (4) Diesel fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt use if, at the first moment of January 1, 1994, the diesel fuel is held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the diesel fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, except in the case of dyed fuel described in paragraph (b) of this section, diesel fuel held by a heating oil retailer for sale for use as home heating oil is not exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax. However, a homeowner who uses the fuel for heating purposes would be eligible to claim a credit or may be eligible for a payment equal to the tax under section 6427. (b) Exception for dyed fuel. The January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax does not apply to diesel fuel that satisfies the dyeing requirements of §48.4082&hyph;1T(b) of this chapter by March 31, 1994, or by the time the fuel is sold by the person holding the fuel at the first moment of January 1, 1994, whichever is earlier. Thus, for example, diesel fuel held by a heating oil retailer for sale for use as home heating oil is exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax if the retailer or another person has dyed the fuel and the fuel satisfies the requirements of §48.4082&hyph;1T(b) of this chapter. §47.3&hyph;8 Requirements with respect to payment and return for the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax. (a) Payment of tax. The January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is to be paid without assessment or notice on or before July 31, 1994. (b) Filing of returns _(1) Form 720. Every person liable for the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax must make a return of the tax on Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. The return is to be prepared and filed in accordance with the instructions relating to the return. (2) Time for filing _(i) In general. The Form 720 required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be filed on or before July 31, 1994, and is a return for the second calendar quarter of 1994. A first return reporting only January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is also a final return and therefore, in accordance with the instructions to Form 720, the box for ``final return'' must be marked. (ii) Return reporting other taxes. A person must file only one Form 720 for a quarter. If a person is required under part 40 of this chapter to file Form 720 for the second calendar quarter of 1994 for other excise taxes on or before August 31, 1994, that person files a single Form 720 for the quarter on or before August 31, 1994. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) does not extend the time for making deposits or paying any excise tax. §47.3&hyph;9 Imposition of the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax on commercial aviation fuel held on October 1, 1995. (a) Fuel subject to tax. Section 13245 of the Act imposes a floor stocks tax on commercial aviation fuel on which tax was imposed under section 4091 before October 1, 1995, and which is held on the first moment of that date by any person. Tax is imposed under section 4091 even if imposed only at the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund financing rate under that section. (b) Rate of tax. The rate of the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax is 4.3 cents per gallon. (c) Person liable for tax. The person liable for tax on any commercial aviation fuel subject to the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax is the person that holds the commercial aviation fuel at the first moment of October 1, 1995. Fuel is held by a person if the person has title to the fuel (whether or not delivery to that person has been made) at such time, as determined under applicable local law. §47.3&hyph;10 Exceptions to the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax. (a) Exception for commercial aviation fuel held for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft. The October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax does not apply to commercial aviation fuel held exclusively for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft within the meaning of section 4221(d)(3). In determining whether commercial aviation fuel is held exclusively for such use, the following rules in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section apply:
