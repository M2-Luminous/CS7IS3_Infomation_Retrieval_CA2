This is foreseen in the Program for Restructuring the National Energy Complex approved yesterday at a meeting of the government leadership. Deputy energy minister S. Kutas, the head of the program, indicated that measures would be implemented to increase reactor operation safety during the period of time foreseen for the operation of the Ignalina atomic energy station. A decision on the continued use of nuclear energy is expected to be made in approximately five years, when international experience will have formulated a clear opinion regarding the future of atomic programs and when very safe and reliable nuclear installations will have been created. Plans call for completion in 1994-1995 of formerly halted construction on the third and fourth blocks and the upper reservoir of the Kruonis power plant. As S. Kutas told LIETUVOS RYTAS, the cost of this work is nearly $30 million. However, this sum includes the amount already paid to purchase some of the necessary equipment. There will also be incentives for projects dedicated to the assimilation and use of water, wind, and geothermal energy. In the coming two decades, specialists are planning to decrease approximately by half the amount of energy consumed to produce one unit of national production. After the draft for a health insurance law was presented, the attendees of the meeting noted the absence of a financial analysis for the draft. Prime Minister A. Slezevicius indicated that "large amounts of money were involved and this threatened an increase in taxes." The draft foresees two types of health insurance--compulsory and voluntary--with supplemental health care services compensation on the basis of a voluntary contract. Because this version of the future law "takes into account insurance traditions as well as the experience that the world has gained in the past 100 years," as its authors noted, it differs from the alternative drawn up by the Social Democrats. L. Alesionka, a member of the Seimas Health, Social Affairs, and Labor committee, also criticized that alternative version, asserting that he supported the draft being presented at the meeting "as a physician and a future patient", and proposed that the working group give "a detailed explanation of the mechanism" to the members of the leadership. The proposal was accepted and the draft will be deliberated again in May. 167,600 litas from the government reserve account was earmarked to increase the wage fund for the executive and government institutions of cities and district local governments, in order to be able to hire more workers at agencies that are organizing land exploitation. According to agriculture minister R. Karazija, one specialist is no longer able to both prepare and record in time the legal documents associated with land ownership and land use--"they are falling behind because there are not enough workers." As long as the right of ownership is not recorded and the lots are not marked on the land cadaster map, the land market will not be able to operate and there will be problems in resolving disputes. Nationwide, 350,000 house possessions have to be legitimized, and about 50,000 farmers want to settle their land ownership matters each year. Transportation minister J. Birziskis responded: why should the number of officials be increased, perhaps it would be worthwhile to reassign them in a more efficient way? In response, R. Karazija said that there is no precedent for the case of returning all the land in Lithuania. At the meeting, amendments were approved to laws allowing citizens to receive monetary compensation for still existent real estate that they had previously owned. However, Kaunas city deputy mayor J. Vengraitis reiterated how urgent the problem of recovering ownership of buildings is in the cities, especially in Kaunas. Property owners there want to regain ownership of about 1500 houses. If an incredibly large sum of money--10 million litas--were allocated each year to the local government there, this process would take 18 years. He presented a radical proposal by the Kaunas city council--to settle with the owner for his property at the market price, but to discuss financial issues related to the return of property after a corresponding portion of state property had been privatized for cash. Although finance minister E. Vilkelis--who was chairing the meeting then in place of the prime minister, who had departed--said that "the train had already left the station" and that such a discussion should have taken place before the laws being amended on this day were adopted, the proposal received the support of industry and commerce minister K. Klimasauskas, and subsequently also the support of others--"the train can still be caught." The minister believed that it would be worthwhile to try to sell at least 10 percent of property for cash. The industry and commerce ministry as well as the economics ministry were charged with preparing drafts of such a proposal. 2 million litas in this year's state budget are earmarked for implementation of the Restitution Act. The constitution also recognizes other traditional religious communities, so these funds are also allotted to traditional non-Roman Catholic confessions, taking into account their approximate number of adherents and the requests of the heads of the religious communities. A resolution was approved at the meeting, on the basis of which the Supreme Orthodox Council of Lithuania, the Protestant Lutheran Consistory, the College of Reformed Protestants, the Greek Rite Catholic Community, the Karaite Religious Community, the Orthodox Eparchy of Vilnius, the Vilnius Sunni Muslim Community, and the Vilnius Jewish Religious Community will also receive some of this money.
