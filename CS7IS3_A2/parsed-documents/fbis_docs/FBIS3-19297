Yilmaz attacked European countries' stance on the problem in southeast Turkey and accused them of maintaining double standards "particularly on issues relating to human rights." He said: "The approach maintained by several countries against the PKK, including their move to ban the PKK after ridiculously accusing it of being a `terrorist organization' indicates that they support the tyrannical country that maintains an unjust approach and that is responsible for bloodshed. We know of the sources that provide arms and economic support to Turkey in the unjust war against the Kurds. That is unacceptable. I want to stress that the effort to solve the problem in the absence of our party [not further specified] will be an interference in our people's will. That will not be allowed. We won't remain inactive in the direction of the governments and international organizations that maintain that approach while claiming that they want to take initiatives or steps toward solving the Kurdish problem. Several friendly countries know our position in that regard." [passage omitted] Ocalan Sends Message to the Conference PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan conveyed a message to the conference in Brussels. It listed his views as follows: 1. We will remain open to every proposal for a solution. We will also remain open to initiatives by foreign countries and organizations to solve the problem. 2. I want to point out that we do not want to divide Turkey and that the propaganda against us conflicts with our approach. 3. I want to point out that we will agree to be a side to any democratic dialogue that the Turkish Government may want to establish, a dialogue in which we can outline the legitimate demands of our people and achieve a result. We have neither rejected nor opposed any concrete proposal for a solution since the problem began. Within that framework, we are prepared to discuss all the alternatives, including the establishment of a federation. 4. We won't try to avoid and we won't try to impose our views if an initiative is taken for a cease-fire agreement and talks to solve the problem under international supervision. 5. Most importantly, I want to stress that we guarantee we will agree to the decisions the conference may adopt for a solution. I also want to stress that we will end the armed struggle if the ground is prepared for a political solution and free political activity.
