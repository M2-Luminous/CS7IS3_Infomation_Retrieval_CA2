Gen. Chhim Chhorn, with his new role, will receive orders directly from the first and second prime ministers. Thousands of soldiers from the PDK, the only faction that boycotted last year's UN-supervised general polls, have defected and rejoined national community following the implementation of national reconciliation policy under the august directive of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk. In northwestern Battambang Province alone, the number of the Khmer Rouge returnees had reached 3,364 by the end of December last year. Among the 235 Khmer Rouge troops incorporated in the KRAF, 58 former officers and noncommissioned officers have been promoted as senior and junior officers.
