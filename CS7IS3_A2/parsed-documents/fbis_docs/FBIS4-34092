According to Sedena reports, the total number of weapons the Mexican Army and Navy seized during the first six months of 1994 reached 5,626. Reports indicate that of the total seized, 95 percent entered Mexican territory through so-called small-scale smuggling, especially through Chihuahua, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Jalisco, and Nayarit. Meanwhile, Navy Secretary Admiral Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo has said the weapons the Mexican Army and Navy seized belong to drug traffickers, "but we have not found caches of weapons or anything similar." Interviewed during the inauguration of the 15th Navy Health Medical Campaign, Ruano said the drug traffickers have economic resources to buy weapons, but "too much propaganda is being given to what you call goat horns [AK-47 submachine guns]." [LA JORNADA] In light of these circumstances, which are being denounced in the United States, isn't it necessary to change surveillance measures? [Ruano] There really is no need for that. Wherever weapons are being smuggled, it will be stopped. According to Sedena reports, only 5 percent of the weapons that enter Mexico are brought in legally. Those weapons are given to state governments to supply their police forces, and a small portion winds up in the hands of civilians. The cost of the weapons varies in accordance with their brand, caliber, condition, and use, and prices range from approximately 300-7,000 pesos Mexican Army figures indicate that during the government of President Salinas de Gortari, the Armed Forces seized 54,208 rifles and 60,673 handguns. In addition, 98,644 weapons, both rifles and handguns, that were seized are available to Sedena. The report adds that in the first six months of 1994, Sedena seized 2,591 rifles and handguns in addition to another 3,035 that are at the disposal of civilian authorities. The Army seized 5,626 weapons during that period. According to Army reports, most of the arsenal comes, presumably, from the United States, China, and the former Soviet Union. Reports also indicate that the weapons enter the country by land, sea, air, and in small amounts; that is, through so-called small-scale smuggling. Reports reveal that the federal organizations that receive a greater portion of the weapons are in Chihuahua, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Jalisco and Nayarit. The weapons presumably enter these states mostly by land and in an "organized" manner. Meanwhile, Sedena makes, through its General Directorate of Factories, weapons under a German trademark exclusively for the Mexican Army. Sedena stipulates the requirement that a citizen must meet to legally buy a weapon. Requirements include that the person live honestly, comply with military service, and have no record of being sentenced for weapons use. Permits to bear weapons can also be obtained based on the nature of the person's occupation, the special circumstances of his place of residence, or any justifiable reasons that merit it. A document in which the Mexican Army warned the Government Secretariat on the possible illegal entry of 20,000 AK-47 submachine guns, better known as goat horns, was disclosed recently. The first shipment would reportedly consist of 2,000 weapons of this type of (rifles). Later, Sedena stated the entry of those weapons, which would represent less than 20 percent of the weapons seized in the past six months, into Mexico has not been detected so far.
