Rees] [Text] Bethlehem March 20 SAPA -- A Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] government would expropriate all land without compensation, PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] President Clarence Makwetu told about 1,000 supporters in Bethlehem's Bohlokong township on Sunday [20 March]. Speaking at the end of a three-day election swing through the [Orange] Free State, he said the land would be restored to the people or held in trust by the state."All people have equal claim to the land," he said. Mr Makwetu told the crowd fears that the PAC's land policy spelt economic disaster were unfounded. While no land would be for sale between individuals, land allocated to citizens would, for surety purposes, carry leasehold title with the same force and effect as freehold titles. The PAC president said farmers could continue farming, but only on land sufficient for their purposes. The rest would be claimed by the state and allocated to other citizens. A vote for any party except the PAC was a vote for disaster as other parties promised houses but not land, Mr Makwetu said."A vote for them is a vote for a constitution which will never give you freedom or justice, and will perpetuate your enslavement and misery while entrenching the privileges the minority continue to enjoy at your expense." Mr Makwetu said the PAC promised an end to violence and repression and would deal efffectively with poverty and the lack of houses and jobs. Recent events in Bophuthatswana should be a lesson for those still refusing to allow free political activity in any part of South Africa, Mr Makwetu said. "It is that there is no amount of force which will ever silence the will of the people to be free."
