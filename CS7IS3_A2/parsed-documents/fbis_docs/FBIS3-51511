First, the Chamber of Deputies opened its session and elected by majority (Juan Antonio Memidip), PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] deputy for the state of Veracruz, as president of the special session. Before this, the Permanent Commission of Congress met briefly to receive the report from the commission of deputies and senators who traveled to Chiapas to study the conflict. Basically, the report, which was read by PRI Senator Victor Manuel Tinoco, indicates that the legislative commission learned about all of the demands of the people of Chiapas. They proposed that Congress continue to contribute to resolving the conflict and that all political parties draft a legislative agenda offering solutions. The Joint Government and Constitutional Affairs and Justice Commission of the Chamber of Deputies met tonight to receive proposals from all political parties on the draft amnesty bill. This will permit them to draft a resolution that will be presented to the plenum on Thursday. The proposals are varied and include: 1. The PAN [National Action Party] asked that those believed responsible for kidnapping and amassing weapons not receive the benefits of the amnesty. It also asked that the amnesty bill be publicized not only though the official newspaper but also through edicts in all places, both in Spanish and all dialects spoken in the region. 2. The Cardenist Front demanded that the amnesty not be limited to offenses committed after 1 January 1994, because several offenses were committed in late 1993. 3. The PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], in addition to demanding that constitutional reforms be passed to offer integral solutions to the problems of the Indians of Chiapas, asked that first negotiations be held, problems be resolved, and then amnesty be offered. 4. The Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution proposed that no Mexican or foreign mercenaries be given amnesty. 5. The PPS [Popular Socialist Party] demanded that fundamental solutions be found to the Chiapas conflict, because an amesty law alone will not resolve anything. All political parties agreed that terms for surrendering weapons must be eased and time must be permitted for negotiations. Upon beginning its analysis of the draft amnesty bill, one of the first changes made by the Government and Justice Commission was to extend the deadline for crimes that qualify for a pardon from 16 to 20 January 1994. The resolution on the draft amnesty bill will be ready Thursday morning, and if no changes are introduced, it will be immediately discussed at the plenum of the Chamber of Deputies.
