Taking part in a discussion meeting with university students in Brno, he said "the decline of GDP was 14.2 percent in 1991, 7.1 percent in 1992 and 0.3 percent last year, while this year we expect growth of around 2 percent." Dlouhy said that "we can expect inflation to be under 10 percent" this year. He stressed that the Czech Republic in this point differed from other post-Communist economies, including Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. Dlouhy also said that European Community countries had 20 percent share in the Czech Republic's exports at the end of the 1980s, while last year the figure was 55 percent and this year it may reach 60 percent. He attributed the figures to the fact that a number of companies had managed to find new markets and at the same time penetrate "hard world markets, when the soft, socialist ones, simply disappeared."
