A survey shows that business people from 54 countries and regions have set up 7,547 projects in this, China's largest economic center, and 64 percent of them have gone into operation. These projects have a combined investment of 14.9 billion U.S. dollars on contract, and actual investment amounts to 5.1 billion U.S. dollars. In particular, service trade projects are playing an important role in Shanghai's municipal economy. Last year saw them deliver 3.8 billion yuan to the municipal government in taxes, an increase of 73 percent, or 2.2 billion yuan, over the previous year. The proportion of taxes accounted for 16 percent of the city's total collected in that year. A local official in charge of foreign investment said that exports by foreign-funded enterprises here earned 7.34 billion U.S. dollars last year, occupying 21.8 percent of the city's total. Economists here agree that Shanghai already has effectively combined the use of foreign investment with its development of services first, industry second and agriculture third. Of the city's contractual foreign investment, projects involved in agriculture account for 0.17 percent, in industry for 41.46 percent and in the service trades for 58.37 percent. Shanghai's improved investment environment has drawn the attention of noted trans-national corporations. Altogether, 44 trans-national corporations set up 68 projects involving a total investment of 950 million U.S. dollars in Shanghai last year. So far, 128 trans-national corporations have launched 206 projects in shanghai, involving a total foreign investment of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars. Of the trans-national corporations, at least 90 percent come from the United States, Japan and European countries, and 35 out of the 200 largest industrial trans-national corporations in the world have invested in Shanghai. The official noted that the municipal government approved the establishment of 205 projects, each with an investment of more than 10 million U.S. dollars, last year, an increase of 200 percent over the previous year. These projects involve a total investment of 4.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 220 percent. By the end of February this year the municipal government had approved 466 projects, each with an investment of at least 10 million U.S. dollars. These projects, with a total foreign investment of 9.7 billion U.S. dollars, accounted for 65 percent of the city's total. "The large foreign-funded projects have brought funds and advanced international technology, and become backbone enterprises of the city," the official said. He disclosed that the foreign-funded industrial projects are mainly in the fields of integrated circuits, optical fiber communications and equipment, compressor for air-conditioners, digital program-controlled telephone exchanges and mobile telephone terminal equipment. They have played an important role in helping adjust Shanghai's industrial structure, according to the official. One example is the Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation, a Sino-German joint venture, which produced 100,000 Shanghai-Santana cars last year. More than 80 percent of the car parts were made in China. With an annual sales output value exceeding 10 billion yuan, the corporation has become a key enterprise in Shanghai. Another example is the Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment Manufacturing Co. Ltd, also a Sino-foreign joint venture, of which the telecommunications products occupy at least one half of the Chinese market. The official said that service trades have become favorites for foreign investment, which has penetrated the fields of banking, real estate trade, commerce, culture and recreation, information consultancy, catering, design, education and public health.
