FR941019-1-00018 FR941019-1-00002 The BSC concluded that it was not appropriate to address these problems with a significant departure from the existing methodology used in the Accord. The BSC decided that it would be appropriate to preserve the conversion factors existing in the Accord and add new conversion factors. Consequently, the revision proposed by the BSC retains the existing conversion factors for rate contracts but applies new higher conversion factors to such contracts with remaining maturities of five years and over. 13 The proposal also introduces conversion factors specifically applicable to commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts. The new conversion factors were determined on the basis of simulation studies that used the same general approach that generated the original add-on conversion factors. 14 13 The conversion factors for rate contracts with remaining maturities of one to five years are currently applied to any contracts with a remaining maturity of over one year. 14 The methodology and results of the statistical analyses are summarized in a paper entitled ``The Calculation of Add-Ons for Derivative Contracts: The Expanded Matrix Approach'' which is available upon request from the FDIC's Reading Room by calling (202) 898&hyph;8785. The proposed matrix is set forth below:
