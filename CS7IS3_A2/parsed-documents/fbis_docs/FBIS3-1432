The varying reception accorded these forces by the Somali leaders opened the door to the arrival of many more troops, which at first greatly feared [words indistinct] among the entire Somali people. The first forces to come to our country sought to save the [words indistinct] who were dying barely a mile away from our country's main port, which was full of food [words indistinct] looted by the bandits. These bandits ignored the starvation killing their brothers. The foreign forces came to protect the relief workers who were threatened by the bandits [words indistinct] who only wanted to loot the food. This was a difficult time for our country. It was surprising how quickly the forces took the food wherever it was needed [words indistinct]. These welcome first steps taken by the forces from the developed world pleased the entire Somali people and revived their hope in the future, which had been undermined by the bandits throughout the country. After these forces totally defeated the problems in the country [words indistinct]. In addition to delivering aid, the U.S. and allied forces [words indistinct] also did useful work in destroying the technicals used in looting and patrolling areas. They also helped advance peace in the country by stabilizing its political system, settling differences, organizing Somali aid and reconciliation conferences, resettling and assisting displaced people, streamlining reconstruction in the country, building welfare centers, creating a Somali police force and courts, opening schools and hospitals, and much more. They did all this in an energetic and tolerant spirit [words indistinct]. While these forces were doing such good work, they unfortunately encountered mistakes as a result of which they suffered loss of life. The killing of the Good Samaritans who had come to help us shocked the people of the donor countries to the point they wanted to withdraw their troops, particularly when their good work was being replaced by civil war. The withdrawal of the troops was first announced by the U.S. Government, to take effect within 16 months [as heard] and the Western countries followed suit, fearing difficulties with the Somalis. The United States left behind only 50 soldiers to guard its embassy in Somalia. All the forces made it clear they were sorry to leave at a time when there was not even a central administration. [Word indistinct] their departure coincided with a time when Somali leaders arrived at a peaceful agreement in Nairobi, belying the claim that Somalis will return to fighting. The forces which left under the leadership of the United States have truly done important and praiseworthy work for the Somalis, who harbor affection for them and wish them peace and a safe journey. The Somali people are urged to participate in the reconstruction of the country.
