FR941130-2-00023 FR941130-2-00011 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;211&hyph;001, et al.] Transwestern Pipeline Company, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings November 21, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Transwestern Pipeline Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;211&hyph;001] Take notice that on November 16, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), 1400 Smith Street, P.O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1188, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;211&hyph;001 a request for modification of a Commission order. Transwestern filed the request for modification pursuant to Rule 212 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.212. Transwestern, ``due to changed circumstances'', proposes to modify the sale which was granted by the Commission in its Order Authorizing Abandonment, issued November 1, 1994 in Docket No. CP94&hyph;211&hyph;000, 69 FERC 61,130 (1994). That November 1, 1994, order approved Transwestern's abandonment of the Vaca Lateral by sale to Enron Oil and Gas Company (Enron). Transwestern now proposes to modify the transaction as a spindown whereby the Vaca Lateral will be transferred to Transwestern Gathering Company (TGC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Transwestern. Upon conveyance of the Vaca Lateral facilities to TGC, TGC will in turn reconvey such facilities to Enron, the original transferee. Comment date: December 12, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. East Tennessee Natural Gas Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;66&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 9, 1994, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;66&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205, 157.212 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212, 157.216) for authorization to abandon and replace an existing delivery point facility in Sevier County, Tennessee for its customer Sevier County Utility District (Sevier) under East Tennessee's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;412&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. East Tennessee proposes to install a 4-inch stopple assembly on its Sevierville lateral Line, 581 feet upstream of the current tap which will be abandoned. This abandonment and replacement is necessary for safety since the current tap is located adjacent to a heavily traveled highway. The gas will continue to be metered and transferred to Sevier upstream of the proposed tap. East Tennessee proposes to abandon all pipe and the current S.V.3302A&hyph;111 downstream of the new valve by removal. Sevier's current FT&hyph;A contract will reflect the relocation of this tap. There will be no maximum daily quantity increase with the tap's construction and peak day and annual deliveries will not be affected. East Tennessee will own, operate and maintain the proposed facility. The estimated cost for current facilities abandonment is $8,700, new facilities construction is $16,000, and the total project cost is fully reimbursable to East Tennessee. The total quantities to be delivered to Sevier after abandonment and replacement of the facilities will not exceed that authorized to be delivered. East Tennessee has sufficient capacity to accomplish deliveries under the proposed change without detriment or disadvantage to other customers. Comment date: January 5, 1995, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.
