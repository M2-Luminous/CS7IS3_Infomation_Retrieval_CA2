Chief Designer of Reactors, Vasiliy Stekolnikov, on the past, present, and future of Russia's nuclear power plants. Vasiliy Vasilyevich granted only one interview in his life and that was in America. When he arrived, the chief designer, naturally, was at the center of the attention not only of his colleagues but also of newspapermen. One of them managed to "get Stekolnikov talking." The interview was published the next day and, much to Stekolnikov's surprise, he read in it things he had not said! That is when he made a pledge: "No interviews!" And since Vasiliy Vasilyevich is an acerbic person and does not mince words, he added a couple of "strong expressions" and since that time has had no contact with journalists. Our relations with him were different. We have visited the nuclear power plants several times and attended various conferences together and we have discussed the vicissitudes of life over a glass of vodka. But I never once asked him for an interview, and ultimately Stekolnikov could not help asking: "Why not?" I admitted honestly: I do not want to spoil our good relationship. He hemmed and hawed a while and never returned to the "problem of the interview." But this was the anniversary of Atomenergoremont--an organization that does perhaps the most difficult and dangerous work at nuclear power plants. So it turned out that we spent a good deal of time together. And ultimately Vasiliy Vasilyevich "waxed generous": He agreed to speak frankly about the problems related to nuclear energy engineering and his work in it. [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, who are you? [Stekolnikov] An interesting question...but I myself do not know: perhaps a Russian, perhaps Veps...those who were not conquered by Genghis Khan. My ancestors are from around Pskov, areas that have always been considered "Russian land from time immemorial"; that is where our village is. I was unable to go there for a long time--I did not have the time, and then when I managed to get to these parts--there are most beautiful landscapes...but that does not interest you and so I will give you a straightforward answer: Since 1962 I have been the chief designer of Gidropress and director at the same time. Over 25 years we have created it with our own hands and that is why the firm now looks extremely representative--there are only 48,000 square meters of production area, 19 buildings with 100 apartments each, two kindergartens...We did some real work! [Gubarev] A strange name, Gidropress.... [Stekolnikov] It is arbitrary...or rather--secret. Which we have been since 1946 when we began to work on reactors. Speaking of the "bare essentials," not including trifles, it is a number of research reactors, the first steam generator in the world, we make steam generators for Siberian combines--in Krasnoyarsk and Tomsk, and then VVER's [water-moderated power reactors], particularly 35 "440's," 19 "millions," and modifications of reactors for submarines. The Americans called them "alpha," and a turmoil even began in their Congress at that time: Why have the Russians gotten ahead of us? Incidentally, for these reactors I was awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labor. [Gubarev] It is strange that for military reactors you are designated a Hero, but not for VVER's. [Stekolnikov] I was a prize winner...Gidropress was the first circuit, that is, a "nuclear island." We are in charge here. In general we work where there is radioactivity, and we are not interested in places where there is none...other people are in charge there. [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, how did you become chief designer? Did you start from "scratch".... [Stekolnikov] I graduated from the tekhnikum in Kaliningrad. I had always been interested in diesel engines and steam engines. But I went into power machine building, to the boiler department for another reason: the stipend there was larger and by that time I was alone--both my mother and father were dead. So in terms of my higher education I am a boiler worker. I was a fairly good student and almost graduated with distinction. After the institute we were sent to Nefteapparatur. We were not asked--at that time they needed fuel for jet aircraft. That was in Podolsk. We began to draw up blueprints. And my friends became section chiefs, things turned out very well! We received excellent training...and the first thing they said was: "Forget about what you have learned before! You have a head on your shoulders--so use it!" In the section we graduated from two universities--no, I am exaggerating! In November 1954 after two months of testing I was transferred to Gidropress although, true, at that time it had no name--it was simply an enterprise with a number...and I was immediately assigned as a senior engineer. My wages were high--180 rubles. For some reason I began to rise rapidly--soon I was a section chief. [Gubarev] And what was your first job working with the "nuclear subject"? [Stekolnikov] Cooling channels on submarines. If I came up with something new I was immediately given a prize. Although, to be honest, I was not very interested in this subject matter...but at that time there was the concept of "necessity" and therefore we did everything that was required of us, the more so since I was the chief of the water reactor section and the other guys were in charge of ship installations...but nonetheless they put me on the ships, and the curious thing is that it worked out! At that time I invented a compact apparatus which I think is still used to this day...it would be nice to know this.... And in general my first design was a column 28 meters high weighing about 800 tonnes. It was for petroleum processing. It took perseverance to calculate it, the stiffening ring, etc. I calculated everything according to the formulas and then I looked and saw that something was wrong. I added something of my own. And I turned out to be right! No, it was not a matter of playing it safe, it was engineering intuition. In our business you cannot get by without that. In those days we acted like hooligans. We made a pipe for an oil refinery that was 40 meters high. We came up with a new "reamer" for it--we saved a great deal of metal. And do you know why we did all this? We were not paid very much and from efficiency proposals we [passage illegible] very useful in real design work--we had no stereotypes in our heads, we were always trying to think of something new. As it were, this was training for real work. [Gubarev] And this time came? [Stekolnikov] Of course. The atomic submarine. Seventeen years of my life. Imagine how many chiefs have come and gone?! And difficulties? First vibration, then excessive weight...but still we managed! In the Kremlin at a meeting of the military-industrial commission when I was asked: "Well, how is the ship?" I answered: "It will be done! I believe we will end up with a first-class submarine." We achieved it through sweat and blood... But when we lowered it, we wept. Not just me--many people...perhaps from happiness, perhaps from what we had been through, but we wept...snow was falling, it was night--that was so the enemies could not locate us!--and we lowered the ship into the water and wept because we had devoted some 17 years to it. I have never told anyone about that before--even my wife, but I am telling you so that you will understand how difficult it is to get the star of a Hero. It is only fools who can say that they give out these stars left and right. Perhaps some people have received them without justification, but we designers and scientists have earned each one of them with many years of sweat and blood, coronaries and pain, sleepless nights and everything we have missed out on in life in order to do what was necessary for the country and the people. [Gubarev] But why was it so difficult for you to make this ship? [Stekolnikov] There was a great deal of competition. Dollezhal was working, as were other chief designers. But they were already academicians, Heros, and enjoyed a great deal of authority. People listened to their opinion, and then here was this Stekolnikov...we had to prove that we had come up with something better. [Gubarev] Was this something principally new? [Stekolnikov] Of course. Water is one thing, but we had something altogether new. This had to do with the compactness of the installation, the absence of noise, and a great deal of power. A completely different kind of reactor. But the ship was "clean"--it could be received in any port. [Gubarev] Were there any accidents? [Stekolnikov] Well, how do you avoid them! But if there was an accident one day, the next day I crawled in there myself: I wanted to know what happened. But that was possible only in our own reactor; you could not get inside anybody else's reactor, those of the competitors. We had "alpha" activity; you cover it up with a newspaper and it is safe. There was no gamma radiation. [Gubarev] And you were working on civilian reactors more or less "as a sideline?" [Stekolnikov] To my "personal account" I credit the boiling reactor, BOR-60; done entirely by our department. It ended up a compact reactor... submarine [reactor]--order [figure illegible] ... steam generators for Shevchenko and heat exchangers as well... VVER-440, VVER-1000, and some other things. And I am proud of all this; after all, it was not in vain that I spent 40 years in the nuclear industry. [Gubarev] [passage illegible], for example, from the automobile? [Stekolnikov] Actually nowhere. Physicists and mechanics have the same law. The only peculiarity is the nuclear part--residual heat release, that is, after the reactor is shut down it continues to release a great deal of heat. If an ordinary furnace is shut down it becomes cold within an hour or two, but a reactor will remain "warm" for another hundred years. The residual quantity of energy is extremely great and it must be controlled. [Gubarev] I thought you would talk about radiation. [Stekolnikov] Of course the danger of radiation exists. This is a reality that must be dealt with and necessarily taken into account. But, I repeat, there are laws of physics, and this means that we must not fear them but take them into account. That is why science exists. And we must create reliable designs. Unfortunately, I have now come to the conclusion that we cannot see the degradation of material in time. There is no such science. I would call this branch the "life of materials." Why does graphite function for only 40 years? It will not work any longer than that...in general, materials, like man, get old and go out of commission. We live for 70 years, but we will never get to 200. Why? There is no answer to this question yet--either for man or for material. [Gubarev] You have apparently forgotten about Chernobyl. Is this not the main thing in atomic engineering? [Stekolnikov] I am not to blame for Chernobyl...of course one must look into the causes and effects of the catastrophe, but not in the way your fellow journalist sometimes does. Why write about a goat with two heads if it was born before Chernobyl?! Or about the fact that he, the journalist, is prepared to watch television--and this was printed!--in candlelight?! A great tragedy occurred in Chernobyl, very great, but we must not capitalize on tragedy, we must not! [Gubarev] Those are the consequences...but nonetheless the accident occurred, did it not? [Stekolnikov] That is hooliganism...the same thing as riding in a car without brakes. You may make it home once, but the next time you will definitely get into an accident. Unfortunately, nuclear energy workers frequently drove without brakes, hoping that everything would turn out all right.... It is clear to me that the people in charge of the reactor in Chernobyl were at fault. There should be no argument here. But the reactor itself, of course, had great shortcomings. It accelerated; that is, when the safety rods were released, instead of shutting down the reactor began to pick up speed. The designers and scientists are to blame for this. And this too must be admitted...but still the main thing is that they should not have been careless with the reactor. It is dynamite. [Gubarev] Is the same thing possible with yours? [Stekolnikov] No. [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, what will become of nuclear engineering in 50 years, what do you think? [Stekolnikov] I think that the "fast reactors" that produce their own fuel will occupy their proper position in energy engineering. But I have doubts about thermonuclear installations where it is possible to obtain a large amount of energy as well. There are problems with materials there and not everything works. A great deal has been done in nuclear energy; the necessary base has been created--from prospecting for uranium to various kinds of installations. This is mainly to the credit of Yefim Pavlovich Slavskiy, who for many years was in charge of our nuclear industry and was able to think about the future. [Gubarev] Is the nuclear infrastructure being destroyed now? [Stekolnikov] A very stupid thing is being done. We are not living and working efficiently...of course the question of questions in nuclear energy engineering is safety. You are not afraid when you drive in a car or travel on a ship even though you may get into an accident and die. And yet the probability of having a collision or sinking is much greater than suffering from nuclear energy. People must understand this and then make their choice. [Gubarev] How do you assess the present state of nuclear energy? I have in mind its division--into Russian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, etc.? [Stekolnikov] Pardon me for being so blunt, but it is a crime! What we are doing with nuclear energy today is a crime against people, against ourselves. What are we afraid of? It is thought that genetic mutations will occur under the influence of radiation, that is, mankind will begin to degenerate. Are there data or precise conclusions for this? No. So why are we so ready to work with them and use questionable theories? Large doses of radiation--that is understandable. Six hundred roentgens--and you are no more...but small doses, I am convinced, cause no harm. The entire history of mankind--since ancient times!--has proceeded with stronger radiation than the norms we establish for nuclear power plants. So we should be speaking about psychology and not about the real impact of radiation. [Gubarev] I asked about the condition of the nuclear power plants in Russia and Ukraine. [Stekolnikov] We have become accustomed to babbling about safety: they say it begins with the mining of ore and ends with the burial of the waste, and the nuclear power plant is somewhere in between. So we talk a lot about safety but we deal with it only when forced to; we do nothing without orders and directives from the higher leadership...let me give this example. In Germany in Nord we worked with an active zone. We had to look at 30 cassettes showing what was going on there. We took six or seven of them. I looked at them and it became clear to me. I said: We do not need any more...but the German was persistent: no, we will continue to work until I get all of the cassettes--those were his instructions... Essentially he was right, but I threw up my hands and left. It turns out that people perceive one and the same thing in different ways. We Russians still probably need the "stick," but we are beginning to "dodge," shameful as it is to admit it.... [Gubarev] As a chief designer have you frequently had to use the "club"? [Stekolnikov] It has happened...I have driven my close comrade to tears a couple of times. I tell him to do this or that. And he responds: That is not my job, it is the job of another department chief. I insist, and he agrees. Then I explain to him that I cannot--and we are friends!--work with a person who does not obey my orders, and therefore I dismiss him from his duties. [Gubarev] And did you fire him? [Stekolnikov] Of course...and he is a respected person, a prizewinner...well everyone protected him and defended him. Then he came to me and started crying. I withdrew the order. [Gubarev] And does your conscience still bother you? [Stekolnikov] I no longer have one. But discipline is necessary in our business, and responsibility as well. And that is why the orders of the chief designer have to be carried out. Unfortunately, we, that is, the chief designers, have to make "intellectual" decisions that are sometimes unusual. And they must be implemented, even though frequently many people do not agree with them. Therefore, we must be "strict"; otherwise, nothing will work. [Gubarev] Where are your reactors in operation now? [Stekolnikov] Let us try to list them. We will begin with Bulgaria--there are six blocks there. Hungary--four blocks. Czechoslovakia--four. Four blocks have been in operation in Germany and a fifth was started but now they have been removed. In Finland--two blocks. We now have in Kola--four, Voronezh--two, Rovno--two, well and there are others...quite unfortunately, the construction of new blocks has been postponed, and these are the reactors that are the most perfect. We have taken into account all mistakes from the past, created reliable machines, but these are the ones that the public attacked. I think a great mistake is being made. Oh, how we will regret this mistake in the near future! [Gubarev] Are you familiar with foreign reactors? [Stekolnikov] Of course. I have seen them in Italy, France, Belgium, Japan, Germany, and the United States. And I have crawled into all of them, felt them with my own hands, and inspected each unit down to the details--I always wonder whether they have thought of something better than ours. The designer has a terrible enemy--vibration. In Hungary I even talked the leaders into letting me go down under the reactor--I had to feel precisely how the vibration was occurring in the pipelines. They objected for a long time but I finally persuaded them--I crawled down there and felt it. There was one problem with it.... [Gubarev] Can you compare them and us? [Stekolnikov] We began to design reactors literally "from scratch." At least I did. About four people knew what had to be done--Kurchatov and his closest colleagues. As scientists they had calculated everything and we were supposed to make the concrete designs. With time came experience and a deeper understanding of the processes that take place in a reactor. Today it seems to me that our scientists and designers are just as good as the Western ones, who have travelled the same path as we have. In some things they have achieved successes and outpaced us, but there are many areas where they have something to learn from us. So I cannot and will not bow to the West. We will cooperate with them on an equal basis; everyone stands to gain from this. And if someone wants to prove that they are "better" or we are--these people have no notion of science or technology. Most frequently this is the way politicians think. And bad ones at that.... I know for sure that in the history of the development of nuclear energy over the decades we have not fallen behind anyone at any time. And we have the right to be proud.
