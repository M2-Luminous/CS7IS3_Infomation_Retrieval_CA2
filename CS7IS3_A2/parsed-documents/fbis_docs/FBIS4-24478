According to Zhou Dunyou, official in charge of the region's nationality and religious affairs, the project, started in 1980 and consuming more than 260 million yuan from the central government and Tibet regional government, has given a new image to over 1,400 monasteries. Of these, 553 were seriously damaged during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76). Zhou said that the renovation campaign has covered a wide range of lamaseries and temples. The cost of renovating the Potala Palace in Lhasa alone, which will be completed in August, has totalled 50 million yuan. Dealing with a crack in the wall of the Johkang Temple in Lhasa has cost the central government three million yuan. About 66 million yuan and 600 kg of gold went to build a stupa (shrine) and memorial hall for the late 10th Panchen Lama, who died in 1989. Zhou noted that the central government and the regional government are now concentrating on helping the monasteries have enough funds to support themselves. Lamas in the Tibet region have been encouraged to take up some subsidiary business to raise funds for the monasteries' everyday expenditure. "The move is going with the tide the of market economy," Zhou said. Over 90 percent of all the 1,400-plus lamaseries and temples in the region still live on alms given by religious followers. Any business activity by lamas usually consists of handicrafts, restaurants or transport services for local farmers. The region now has about 34,000 lamas. According to Zhou, major monasteries in Lhasa have solved the problem of shortage of funds by such measures, while the other areas still have difficulties in this direction. He added that lamas enjoy a good "business image" because of their respectable standing. Local residents prefer lamas' service as they do not seek excessive profits. For instance, lamas in Shannan Prefecture who are offering transport services have two hand-carts, a truck and a ferry boat. Poor farmers can get free-of-charge ferry crossings if they cannot afford the fare.
