Indeed, Kazakhstan inherited the military districts of the Soviet Union that were not the worst. Their geopolitical situation made it imperative for the leaders of the USSR to continuously monitor the combat readiness of the troops and to equip them with the most up-to-date materiel. Present-day judgments concerning the army of Kazakhstan are conflicting--from unreserved recognition of its potential advantages to sharply worded criticism of the government for squandering the people's money to maintain "toy" troops. Clarifying the real situation in the army turned out to be a difficult affair. The endless red tape on the part of employees of the press center of the Ministry of Defense who must ensure liaison between the military and the press suddenly ran into the impenetrable fence of military and state secrets. Nonetheless, Major General Sabit Taulanov, chief of the cadre directorate of the military department, acknowledged that it is premature to refer to high combat readiness on the part of the army of Kazakhstan. However, in case of need, the residents of Kazakhstan will be protected by ground forces, the Air Force, the Air Defense Troops, and, strange as it may sound, the Navy. This service, which is new for our republic, importunately conjures up the children's joke about "a submarine on the steppes of Kazakhstan" and for now is represented solely by the Naval Department of the Ministry of Defense. Kazakhstan does not have any submarines yet; however, there is hope that in the future military vessels of the republic will ply the expanse of the Caspian Sea. In the opinion of General Taulanov, problems in the republic's army began because of non-Kazakh officers leaving the country. According to data from the Ministry of Defense, the shortage of officers in the Army as of now comes to 30 percent. However, according to data received through unofficial channels, the actual cadre shortage exceeds 50 percent. It is no secret that an overwhelming majority of officers who served on the soil of Kazakhstan spoke Russian. They have been leaving for Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. Nobody is holding them back. Most of the officers left because of beggarly pay and social and housing problems which had gone unsolved for years. The junior command echelon (from lieutenant to major) has been particularly thinned out, that is, precisely those whose duty it is to make new recruits into soldiers and directly lead them. They are trying to fill the void by using the higher military command school in Almaty, the only one in Kazakhstan. It graduates 200-210 young officers a year. Only 53 persons from the last class remained in the republic. The rest of the non-Kazakh officers left for their native parts. Previously, the school graduated only motorized infantry personnel; now, motor vehicle, artillery, and tank personnel train next to them. In the new school year, logistics and engineering cadets will be added. In addition, the total number of those admitted to the school will increase by a factor of two. Diversification is a good thing, but unfortunately, under our conditions quantity seldom turns into quality. The Ministry of Defense sees the annual assignment of 450 residents of Kazakhstan for study at the military schools of Russia as the next scenario for the replenishment of the lost officer cadres. However, the difficulty is that our cadets are frequently expelled from the schools. It is likely that insufficient level of knowledge, large distances from home, and complications in mutual relations are factors. Besides, there are no guarantees that, having become an officer, a cadet from Kazakhstan will not remain in Russia to serve. Following many years of oblivion, short military courses of the "takeoff + landing = officer" kind have been resurrected in our country. National Hero of Kazakhstan Sagadat Nurmagambetov, minister of defense of our republic, began his military career in similar courses during the war years. From the history of the war we also remember how latter-day lieutenants led soldiers into battle after two months of training, were the first to perish, and left the rest on the ground. A call-up of reserve officers who received their military ranks simultaneously with college diplomas for a two-year stint became the last trump card played by military officials. Some 1,500 "students," strictly civilians, ended up in the army. They are reinforced by 700 volunteers from among reservists. However, a majority of both groups do not have the necessary knowledge and experience in operating materiel and commanding soldiers. It is necessary to discuss the soldiers and sergeants of the Kazakhstan Army. They will and do carry out the orders of their officers. General Taulanov maintains that the troops have a 100 percent complement of enlisted men and sergeants, despite the fact that in the last five years the authority of the Army has been substantially undermined. Cases of evasion of service and absence from units have been reduced to a minimum. To a great degree, the fact that residents of Kazakhstan serve for the entire 1.5 years only within the republic has contributed to this. As far as "dedovshchina" [recruit abuse] is concerned, in the opinion of the general, it afflicts "guys who are unaccustomed to labor and do not wish to accomplish the assigned tasks. This prompts fellow servicemen to physically influence disobedient ones." We believe that not everything is that simple within the community of soldiers. Inductees begin to experience their first problems in military commissariats during examinations by medical commissions. Colonel Galim Aldamzharov, deputy military commissar of Almaty and the capital city oblast, states that according to the findings of physicians, one in three draftees is unfit to serve. Their weight falls 20-25 kilograms short. They are afflicted with intestinal disease, tuberculosis, and a bunch of other conditions. Employees of military medical commissions admit that they are pressured in certain military commissariats, and a certain proportion of the "unfit" are put in the ranks of soldiers. It is precisely of unhealthy soldiers that the first group of escapees, deserters, and military criminals is comprised. The second group consists of those who, according to the general, do not wish to carry out commanders' orders. These guys are not prepared for service either physically or morally. We cannot help thinking of the system of school-based and pre-induction training. It was also destroyed in the heat of "disarmament." The third group consists of "martinets," the mainstay of "dedovshchina," mainly sergeants and second-year servicemen. They establish their own rules in view of the reluctance and inability of officers to discharge their official responsibilities. According to data from a well-informed source, the number of crimes committed by servicemen keeps growing. Based on the totals for last year, in the capital city oblast alone more than 500 criminal cases were instituted, including those involving particularly dangerous crimes. Some 320 servicemen left places of service without official leave; 118 of them have already been convicted, and the search is on for the rest. The issue of omitting Article 232 of the Criminal Code (absence without official leave) which draws up to two years of disciplinary battalion for the escapee is being worked on. Otherwise a good proportion of the Army would trade in barracks for cells. A one-month disciplinary confinement to the guardhouse is proposed as an alternative. The combat readiness of all armies is judged not only on the basis of the strength of troops but also on the results of army exercises. In the two years of existence of the Kazakhstan Army not a single large-scale exercise has been held. They have restricted themselves to command post exercises, unit commander training, and end-of-training performance evaluations. The Ministry of Defense is inclined to associate this fact with difficulties in forming the Armed Forces of the republic. However, other reasons making it impossible to conduct such exercises are also apparent. Between December 1991 and May 1992 a power vacuum prevailed in the former Union army. The Union no longer existed, republic armies did not yet exist. In the words of many military men, this period was sufficient for once menacing districts to be stripped. Weapon depots were plundered, elements of air defense and space surveillance systems were removed. All drugs of any value were removed from the central military hospital. Of course, we cannot call the Army of Kazakhstan indigent troops. It does have modern combat materiel. Under a military treaty with Russia signed this year our Army will be able to mitigate a weapons shortage. This is necessary and advantageous for both sides. However, use of weapons needs to be learned. Meanwhile, trainers are clearly in short supply.
