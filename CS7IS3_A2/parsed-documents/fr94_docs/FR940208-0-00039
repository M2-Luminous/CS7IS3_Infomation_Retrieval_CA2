FR940208-0-00039 FR940208-0-00019 Thus, in one portion of the proposal Iowa seems to require, like the Federal regulations, that all changes to a permit be approved by the regulatory authority. However, in another portion of the proposal, Iowa seems to require such regulatory authority approval only for a particular type of change to a permit. Moreover, Iowa does not insure that all revisions (significant departures and amendments) be incorporated into the permit and all public copies of the permit. Third, the Federal regulations set forth criteria for approval at 30 CFR 774.13(c) that govern all permit revisions, whether significant or nonsignificant. Iowa has, at proposed 27&hyph;40.32(207), incorporated by reference the Federal provision at 30 CFR 774.13(c) into the Iowa program. However, in the context of the Iowa program, the term ``permit revision'' only includes significant revisions. Thus, the Federal regulations require that the criteria at 30 CFR 774.13(c) govern the approval of all revisions, while the State proposal requires that such criteria govern only the approval of significant revisions. Finally, Iowa has not outlined what permit application standards and procedures apply to amendments. The preamble to 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) dated September 28, 1983 (48 FR 44344, 44377), clearly requires the regulatory authority to establish guidelines as to what requirements will apply to nonsignificant revisions (i.e. amendments) to the permit. In light of the concerns outlined above, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1) and 32(6) to be inconsistent with and less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving them to the extent that these proposed rules attempt to distinguish between permit amendments and revision. b. Permit review. Iowa proposes to revise IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1) and .32(1)(b)(2)(ii) in response to a required program amendment placed on the Iowa program at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(5). This required program amendment directed Iowa to require that the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 773.13, 773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21 apply, at a minimum, to all significant permit revisions and that the division may, at any time, as well as at midterm review, require reasonable revisions or modifications. Iowa, at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1), proposes to require that 30 CFR 773.13, 773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21 apply, at a minimum, to all significant permit revisions. However, since the Director is not approving Iowa's proposed distinction between permit amendments and revisions, this proposed language does not work in the context of the existing rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1). Therefore, the Director is not approving the proposed language at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1). Iowa, at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1)(b)(2)(ii), proposes to require that the division may, at any time, as well as at midterm review, require reasonable revisions or modifications. Therefore, the Director finds that Iowa has adequately addressed this portion of the required program amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(5) and is approving the proposed language at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1)(b)(2)(ii). The Director will amend the required program amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(5) in accordance with this finding. c. Incidental boundary revisions. Iowa proposes to add a requirement to IAC 27&hyph;40.32(3) that incidental boundary revisions (IBR's) shall be considered, on demonstration by the operator, for an area in which the proposed mining operations are contiguous to the approved permit. OSM interprets the proposed language to mean that before an area of land can be added to a permit as an IBR, it must be contiguous to the approved permit. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 774.13(d) do not specifically require that lands subject to an IBR be contiguous to the approved permit area. However, in accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart provisions exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director finds that the reproposed rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(3) is not inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations and is approving it.
