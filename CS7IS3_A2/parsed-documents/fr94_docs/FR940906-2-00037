ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, PL 92463, EPA gives notice of a two-day meeting of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues, and this meeting is being held to discuss NACEPT's agenda for the coming year. The Administrator has asked NACEPT to concentrate on ecosystem management and how long-term ecological, economic, and social needs can be integrated to achieve a place-driven approach to environmental management. Three new NACEPT standing committees will be formed to examine different aspects of ecosystem management. •One will evaluate the opportunities to re-orient existing statutory and regulatory authorities to integrate place-driven environmental management into the Agency's decision-making process. Specific areas this committee will investigate include enforcement and compliance programs, and financial and technical assistance mechanisms. •Another committee will examine the role and use of data and information in ecosystem management strategies. Some of the issues the committee will evaluate include data needs, data accessibility, and opportunities for partnerships and data sharing with public and private sector organizations. •The third committee will examine issues associated with harmonizing economic activity and ecosystem management, and will focus on the economic, social, and political factors needed to achieve sustainable economies. NACEPT comprises a representative cross-section of EPA's partners and constituents, but to gain additional insights and perspectives from all interested parties as these committees begin their work, time has been allotted during the meeting for oral comments from the public. Any member of the public wishing to present oral comments on any of these issues can schedule an appointment by contacting Abby Pirnie at the address and telephone numbers listed below. Due to time constraints, oral presentations will be strictly held to five minutes and slots are limited. Available time slots will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis to those scheduling a presentation in advance. Written comments will be accepted at any time prior to the meeting.
