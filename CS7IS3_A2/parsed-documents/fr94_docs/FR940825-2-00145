FR940825-2-00145 FR940825-2-00095 In addition to the listing requirements in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual which are applicable to all ELDS, an ELDS issue linked to a security (including sponsored ADRs) that is traded in the U.S. and is issued by a non-U.S. company subject to U.S. reporting requirements must also satisfy the following criteria: (1) The term of the ELDS may not exceed three years; (2) the trading volume requirements in Paragraph 703.21(C) of the Manual shall be based on U.S. trading volume; 19 (3) with respect to ADRs, an ELDS may only be linked to sponsored ADRs; (4) the Exchange shall use trading volume data for the six months prior to listing for purposes of determining U.S. Share Volume and Relative ADR volume (both as defined in the proposal); (5) there must be a minimum of 2,000 holders of the underlying security; (6) the ELDS issuance may not exceed (i) 2% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 30% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, (ii) 3% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market; and (7) an ELDS may not be listed if less than 30% of the worldwide trading volume in the underlying security (for ADRs, trading volume in the ADR and related securities) for the prior six months occurred in the U.S. market. 20 19 See supra notes 16&hyph;18 and accompanying text. This will also apply to ELDS overlying U.S. securities. 20 See Amendment No. 1, supra note 4. The Exchange believes that allowing ELDS to be issued based on the value of eligible securities (including sponsored ADRs) traded in the U.S. and issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements, will provide significant benefits to investors and the capital markets by providing increased investment and corporate financing flexibility. The Exchange further believes that this flexibility will be achieved without compromising investor protection by ensuring that either the primary market for the linked security is in the United States or the Exchange has access to surveillance information from the primary exchange in the country where the security underlying the ELDS is primarily traded (in the case of an ADR, from the primary exchange in the country where the security underlying the ADR primarily trades). The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) 21 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, in the Commission's order originally approving the listing and trading of ELDS, the Commission stated it would reexamine the issue of allowing ELDS linked to ADRs if such a decision were justified by the subsequent trading experience of ELDS and if sufficient safeguards were put into place to ensure the pricing integrity of both the ELDS and the underlying ADR. 22 The Commission is satisfied that these preconditions have been satisfied. As of July 1, 1994, the NYSE had two series of ELDS listed for trading. The Exchange represents that no problems have arisen and no complaints have been received by the Exchange with respect to the trading of these series of ELDS. 23 Accordingly, the trading history of ELDS to date has not raised any regulatory concerns that would cause the Commission to be concerned about expanding the listing of ELDS to include ELDS linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) that are traded in the U.S. on a national securities exchange or through the facilities of a national securities association and are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements. 21 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 22 See Exchange Act Release No. 33468, supra note 5, at note 12. 23 Telephone conversation between Vincent Patten, Assistant Vice President of New Products, NYSE, and Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, on July 8, 1994.
