The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E airspace at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and Spokane, Washington, to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure and missed approach holding pattern at Coeur d'Alene Air Terminal. The areas would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas are published in Paragraphs 6004 and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993, (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (Air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71, in effect as of September 16, 1993, as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation of 14 CFR part 71 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1348(a), 1354(a), 1510; E.O. 10854, 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959&hyph;1963 Comp., p. 389; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 11.69. §71.1 [Amended] 2. The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, is amended as follows: Paragraph 6004␣Class E airspace areas designated as an extension to a Class D surface area. * * * * * ANM ID E&hyph;4 Coeur d'Alene, ID [Revised] Coeur d'Alene Air Terminal, ID (Lat. 47 ○46 ’28 ’ ’ N, long. 116 ○49 ’11 ’ ’ W) Coeur d'Alene VOR/DME (Lat. 47 ○46 ’25 ’ ’ N, long. 116 ○49 ’14 ’ ’ W)
