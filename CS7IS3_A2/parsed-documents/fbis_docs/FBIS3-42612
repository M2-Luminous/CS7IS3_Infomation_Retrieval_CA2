However, I will not hide the fact that every forward step will not come easy. The plenum took the course of reforming the entire activity of the trade union, determining the basic directions in reform: personnel, organizational structure, social partnership, receipt and use of membership dues, and information support. Therefore, we will have to work, as the saying goes, rolling up our sleeves and not complaining about difficulties. Everyone will have to work--from the chairman of the trade-union central committee to the chairman of a republic, kray, and oblast trade-union committee and of a primary trade-union organization. The plenum of the trade-union central committee did not become an ordinary event held according to the traditional scheme. In my opinion, the speeches by my colleagues are interesting and their thoughts and deeds are not standard. The following is the plenum's special feature: having given recommendations and having adopted decisions, the plenum--and this is the basic thing--developed the mechanism of reforming and the principles of transforming and changing trade-union activity. The plenum also gave the following advice: to work more actively with government structures, using only a constructive and reasoned dialogue. Applying this form of mutual relations, we have already solved a number of problems in favor of the sector's workers. I will recall the recent one: jointly with Russia's State Committee on the Administration of State Property an agreement on principles of interaction under privatization was signed. What does this document give? First of all, it makes it possible to more efficiently protect the interests of labor collectives against arbitrary decisions of the local administration and regional committees on property and to carry out privatization on the basis of law and order. You will agree that this is not all that little. The following opinion has existed since time immemorial: there is a central apparatus, let it think. And if something is amiss in the trade union, it will be made responsible for this. The plenum posed the question differently. In no way relieving the trade-union central committee of responsibility for work on protecting the interests and rights of trade-union members at the federal level, the plenum, proceeding from the objectively existing situation, considered it necessary to increase the responsibility of republic, kray, and oblast committees in the solution of socioeconomic problems affecting the vital interests of workers in regions and in the establishment of an equitable system of social partnership. Is this necessary? Yes. I will say openly: the sector does not have an efficiently operating system of social partnership. An analysis shows that at almost every second enterprise collective contracts are drawn up formally, almost one-half of our workers do not know at all that at present the collective contract is the only legal form of collective regulation of mutual relations between entrepreneurs and workers at enterprises, and only 10 percent of the workers effectively realize their rights through collective contracts. Statistics on territorial and sectorial agreements are also distressing. They were concluded in only 10 regions! What did the plenum decide? What life itself and the interests of trade workers demand under market conditions: in 1994 it is necessary to regulate relations and social guarantees through collective contracts of enterprises and to ensure the signing of territorial tripartite agreements. A complex task? It is not simple, but we must accomplish it in order to serve our purpose. The trade-union central committee made proposals for the general agreement for 1994 concluded among the government, trade-union associations, and Russia's entrepreneurs. All of them were examined and taken into account. The composition of the Russian Tripartite Commission was formed. More than 70 all-Russian trade unions and associations have formed the trade-union unit of the Russian Tripartite Commission out of 28 trade-union leaders. It also includes a representative of our trade union. What is my forecast? Work in the commission will make it possible to raise our problems before the government and to seek ways of solving them. The plenum also approved the position of the trade-union central committee with respect to elections to the State Duma. I will recall that we not only actively supported the political movement "Russia's Women" during the preelection campaign, but also concluded an agreement on cooperation. Today candidates for deputies from the movement "Russia's Women" have received more than 20 mandates. A working meeting with the leaders of this movement--A. Fedulova and Ye. Lakhova--was held. The principles of our relations were refined and a program of actions was outlined at it. The plenum also made the following conclusion: the trade union will be able to operate only if it is strong financially. What must be done for this? First of all, it is necessary to reform the entire system of collection and expenditure of trade-union dues and to create financial stability from the primary trade-union organization to the trade-union central committee, concentrating the bulk of the funds at the territorial and sectorial level in special trade-union funds. If we do not do this, we will be doomed. Of course, the essence of the problem lies in how to do this. It is impossible to ignore the settled traditional view of the role of the trade union as an organization where one can receive some social and material benefits (passes, places in children's preschool institutions, and so forth). Such an attitude toward trade unions is not speculative. Not long ago about 60 percent of the members confirmed it when they were questioned at the Moscow Oblast Regional Trade Union of Trade Workers. It is impossible not to take this into consideration, as well as the fact that the financial situation in the trade union is critical. Many primary organizations have not developed a system of monthly collection of membership dues and of control over the completeness of collection with due regard for the total income of trade-union members and spend trade-union funds inefficiently. The possibility of receiving income from the deposit of temporarily free balances of monetary assets in banks is not utilized. There are numerous cases (especially where chairmen are not exempt from primary jobs) of delay by the administration in deductions of dues and their use for economic needs. Many primary organizations transfer part of the funds to republic, kray, and oblast trade-union committees irregularly and, moreover, not in a full volume. The plenum determined the basic directions in the strengthening of the trade union's financial stability--rise in the level of organizational work and permanent control over the course of collection of membership dues and over prompt deductions into trade-union committees. Gradually, while constantly informing primary organizations of the results attained by the trade union with respect to the protection of workers' interests, to strive for the redistribution of funds between the primary organization and oblast, kray, and republic trade-union committees. Are we on the correct path? The plenum answered: Yes! Today there is no other path. Under market conditions the role of the trade union is changing fundamentally. A new financial policy should correspond to this change. Now finances are needed not so much in order to provide assistance to primary organizations for conducting all kinds of cultural activities (although this is important in itself) as to train trade-union workers, to establish a strong legal and economic service, and to form special funds. The plenum approved the practice of a number of trade-union committees, which use the collective insurance of trade-union members at the expense of part of the trade-union dues for the establishment of a real mechanism for their social protection, redistribution of trade-union dues, and increase in the motivation for membership in the trade union. Among the reform paths of development of the trade union, for the purpose of increasing the mutual responsibility of primary trade-union organizations, republic, kray, and oblast trade-union committees, and the trade-union central committee for the fulfillment of statutory requirements, the plenum considered it useful to change over to a system of contractual relations. The trade-union central committee worked out and sent a draft contract on mutual relations to all trade-union committees--membership organizations. The establishment of a single information field is one of the basic directions in reform. It is extremely important that the trade-union aktiv and every trade-union member know their rights and the forms and methods of protecting their interests. For these purposes a plan of publications by specialists of the trade-union central committee was worked out. TORGOVAYA GAZETA constantly acquaints you with their materials. The issue of an information bulletin of the trade-union central committee--TORGOVOYE YEDINSTVO [TRADE UNITY]--was organized. The issue of our first number--GOLOS PROFSOYUZA [VOICE OF THE TRADE UNION]--was prepared. Will we fulfill what has been envisaged? I am confident that we will, if in the new year we work a great deal and with efficiency. It is impossible otherwise. Trade, public catering, consumer cooperative, and entrepreneurship workers must have a strong authoritative trade union. Our duty is to justify their trust.
