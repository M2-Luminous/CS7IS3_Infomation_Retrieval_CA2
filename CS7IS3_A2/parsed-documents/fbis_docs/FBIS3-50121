How does one intend to help the Croats in besieged enclaves in central Bosnia or are they simply sentenced to death? [Prlic] One thing is for sure -- we help those enclaves and will keep helping them as much as we can. I cannot reveal details on how we intend to help them survive, for everything depends on the outcome of present Croat-Muslim negotiations, but I can say that it is a combination of political and military solutions. [Dadic] Was the attempted breakthrough of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] to reach Novi Travnik via Gornji Vakuf, which began when General Roso was appointed commander of the HVO, interrupted due to a military failure or as a consequence of a political decision? [Prlic] This is a strictly military question and I do not want to reveal any details. The fact is that the HVO managed to keep their defense line and that HVO units hold some important points in that area. [Dadic] Is there a strong possibility that the HVO units might blow up the explosives factory in Vitez? [Prlic] Yes, that is a strong possibility. Muslim-Serb Offensive Is Possible! [Dadic] What is your opinion about the proposal of the Croatian opposition to request the Security Council to put the valley of the Lasva under UN protection? [Prlic] We officially filed that proposal already five months ago, demanding that besieged Croatian enclaves be declared safe zones under UN protection, so that this proposal of the Croatian opposition does not say anything new. [Dadic] Do you think that, after the possible fall of besieged Croatian enclaves, the Muslims and the Serbs could join in an attempt to gain access to the sea, regardless of whether they will use military or political means? [Prlic] Everything is possible in this war, and that as well. [Dadic] The Vance-Owen plan planned to give 24 percent of the territory to the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and after it failed, the Owen-Stoltenberg plan talks about 17 percent. It seems possible that another plan might give even less to the Croats, since they presently militarily hold only 9 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Prlic] I do not agree that the Croats presently hold only 9 percent of the territory. We control a far bigger territory, but the problem lies in the fact that they are not tied into one whole. And with regard to the comparison of the Vance-Owen and Owen-Stoltenberg's peace plan, many are wrong here, for those two plans significantly differ in their content. The Vance-Owen plan did not give the Croats 24 percent of the territory but provinces where the Croats constituted a majority, which greatly differs from what is offered by the Owen-Stoltenberg plan. [Dadic] The fact is that the Croats do not completely control a single town. [Prlic] The Croats did not have absolute majority in any town. That was the case in Banja Luka, Zenica, Tuzla, and Sarajevo, and those are facts we cannot deny. Indeed, the Croats made up a large percentage in many towns, but there were nowhere a majority, and that is a fact. We consider Mostar the capital of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, and it is a fact that there was approximately an equal percentage of the Croats and of the Muslims. In Mostar, the Party of Democratic Action was proposed forming the authorities according to the principle of parity -- 50:50 -- but the Muslims did not agree to that. The Croats never said that Mostar was an exclusively Croat town. It does belong to the Croats, but also to other nations which live there. [Dadic] Does that mean that Herceg-Bosnian authorities agree to divide power in Mostar and thereby give up liberating the entire town? [Prlic] It is normal that people who live in that town participate in the authorities. You cannot expect the Croats to hold 100 percent of the authorities while there are 50 percent of the Muslims living in that town. The problem of Mostar will have to be solved by its inhabitants, the local population. Consequently, in Mostar, there will be no room for all the newcomers and refugees who changed the demographic structure and who were the main element of destabilization of situation and later on caused military conflicts in this town. [Dadic] Can this problem be solved peacefully at all, since the Croats and the Muslims are still fighting each other in Mostar. [Prlic] That is a quite difficult process, but do we have any alternative? [Dadic] In his interview for GLOBUS, Mile Akmadzic, who is presently negotiating for the Herceg-Bosnian side, did not give a categorical answer to the question whether Mostar would remain a part of Herceg-Bosna. [Prlic] Mostar will remain in Herceg-Bosna, that is for sure. What Does S. Praljak's Letter of Resignation Say? [Dadic] Do you still think that the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina republics is possible? [Prlic] That is the only remaining possibility to preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina as a country. [Dadic] In the event of the final disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina, will Herceg-Bosna join Croatia? [Prlic] Herceg-Bosna will never be the first to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina and secede unilaterally. If the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina republics is possible, Herceg-Bosna will remain a part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, if Bosnia-Herzegovina should nevertheless disintegrate as a result of secession of one of other two republics, then Herceg-Bosna would have no alternative but to join Croatia. [Dadic] How true are rumors that Mate Boban will no longer be the president of Herceg-Bosna and that Mile Akmadzic will take his position? [Prlic] I do not know anything about that. Mate Boban is the president of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna and Mile Akmadzic is the minister for international cooperation, and that is all I can tell you. [Dadic] Why does Boban no longer participate in negotiations? [Prlic] Our foreign minister participated in talks with Mr. Granic, and I think that is normal. [Dadic] Why was Slobodan Praljak replaced? [Prlic] Slobodan Praljak resigned from his position as the head of the HVO, due to illness, and I personally read his letter of resignation. [Dadic] The rumor has it that he left because the Old Bridge of Mostar was destroyed. [Prlic] Praljak left before the bridge was destroyed. [Dadic] Will General Roso manage to reorganize the HVO? [Prlic] The process of reorganization is under way and it is moving at an optimal rate. We have already had some results, but also some difficulties in the process. However, the direction of reorganization was defined and we are trying to stick to it as much as we can. [Dadic] Is it true that members of the HVO from Kiseljak, who allegedly made a few fatal mistakes in defending Vares and thereby caused the fall of that town, are to blame for that? [Prlic] No, that is not true. Every time a town is conquered or an area is lost, there are rumors that it was either sold or betrayed or that someone else is to blame rather than those who lived in that town and were supposed to defend it. It was very difficult to defend and keep Vares, especially since it was attacked by two Muslim corps. Vares had one brigade of 1,500 soldiers and a frontline about 60 km long. The involvement of the Tuzla corps was here crucial and totally unexpected. [Dadic] But, that happened after the atrocities committed by Croatian units in Stupni Dol. [Prlic] Yes, and we are making an investigation with regard to Stupni Dol and we will reveal its results to the public. But there are difficulties in carrying out that investigation, for the HVO does not control that area and it is not possible to get all relevant information necessary to get the whole picture. [Dadic] When will you pull out the Vares HVO brigade "Bobovac," whose men are still practically a buffer between the Serbs and the Muslims on the area of several square kilometers near Vares? [Prlic] That brigade holds a part of the Vares municipality and it is a matter of strategic, military, and other estimates how the brigade will be used in the future. (Un)Controversial Departure for Banja Luka [Dadic] Tell us about future county organization of Herceg-Bosna? [Prlic] The Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna will be organized in four counties: Herzegovinian-Hum, Zavrsje-Ram, Bosnia-Lasva, and the county of Bosanska Posavina. [Dadic] However, politicians from Bosanska Posavina decided to establish their own province and thus said "no" to the planned county of Bosanska Posavina. [Prlic] There is a large number of refugees in that area, approximately 120,000, and it is possible that there are some ideas which are not quite realistic. The county of Bosanska Posavina has a high level of independence as it always did, but there were no people who could perform important functions. Regarding stories about autonomy, let me ask the advocates of that idea -- autonomy from what? For, autonomy is usually founded by a nation which constitutes a minority, which is not the case here. Certain processes are going on in Posavina and the government is prepared to consider all political options. [Dadic] Your departure for Banja Luka, a couple of months ago, was controversial. Not long after you returned, several Croats were killed in the vicinity of that town, and a large group of Croats were exiled. To what extent are such visits to Chetnik centers justified, in your case, the visit to Banja Luka? [Prlic] First of all, that information that some Croats were killed is not true. [Dadic] But the Banja Luka Bishop Komarica wrote that in his letter. [Prlic] I stay in contact with Bishop Komarica and he is really doing his best to improve the position of the Croats living in that area in a very difficult situation. I think that there have been some results with regard to that. Most importantly, the Croats are no longer mobilized into the Serbian Army and I think that is an extremely important achievement. In most parts, we managed to get free passage for humanitarian convoys for the Croats and we are trying to organize a special surgery and even a hospital in Banja Luka which would employ Croats. [Dadic] What do the Serbs get in return for granting concessions for those Croats you mentioned from Herceg-Bosnian authorities? [Prlic] Nothing. [Dadic] Nothing? [Prlic] Nothing, this simply a matter of reciprocity, for a large percentage of the Serbs live in Mostar and other areas of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. No Conflicts With the Church [Dadic] Will the "Serbian republic" and Herceg-Bosna recognize each other? [Prlic] Yes, if there is a union of three republics; in that case, the mere formation of the union will imply the existence of three republics in Bosnia-Herzegovina which will recognize each other. [Dadic] We have noticed a rift between the authorities and the Catholic Church in Herceg-Bosna. [Prlic] No, there is no such rift. I think that is exaggerated. The Church is an institution and we know how valuable it is. The Church will stay, and politics will change. My view is clear, and I presented it to church officials on several occasions -- I am the head of executive authorities in the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, i.e. I implement a certain politics and I do not want to be an instrument of the Church or to suit their interest, nor will we use the Church for realizing certain political interests. [Dadic] Still, the guardian of the Franciscan monastery in Siroki Brijeg, father Jozo Zorko, reproaches Herceg-Bosnian politicians for avoiding the church, ignoring it, and manipulating it today, almost like the communists did before. [Prlic] I have already mentioned instrumentalization and I think I was clear enough. Otherwise, one must find faults in everything, even in politics, and I am more critical than many others with regard to the operationalization of politics and functioning of the authorities. However, if we want to retrieve the legal system, then we have to support those authorities in their attempt to do that. If not, if we criticize the present authorities too much, that will lead to chaos and anarchy. [Dadic] To what extent has the Government of Herceg-Bosna managed to revitalize the legal system and succeed in fighting black-marketing in Herzegovina? [Prlic] Most of those rumors about this area were proved unfounded. Today it is obvious that Herceg-Bosna simply served as a cover for black-marketing in Croatia. [Dadic] What are the main mistakes of the Herceg-Bosnian authorities which caused the loss of a large part of Herceg-Bosna? [Prlic] There were mistakes, first of all in the operative realization of some functions, both in the army and in other segments. However, we must consider the fact that the ratio of powers in the war between the Croats and the Muslims is several times higher in favor of the Muslims. On the other hand, due to information that there would be an agreement with the Muslims, as well as due to various negotiations with the Muslim side, many military operations were stopped. Still, the main problem was that, outside the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, we had seven elite HVO brigades which, if they withdrew to the area of Herceg-Bosna, would strengthen the defense line and the situation would be quite different. But we had no strength for making that political decision, due to many factors which should be evaluated in the future. [Box, p 5] "Soldiers Blocked the Government!" While we were wrapping up the interview with Jadranko Prlic, we suddenly heard heavy marching in the hall and soon also some shouting in the office of Prlic's secretary. Prlic thanked us for the interview and immediately went out to see what was going on. He then went to the conference room with a couple of soldiers and his associates. We wanted to leave the building, but we were met by a large group of armed soldiers at the entrance, who literally blocked the building of the Herceg-Bosnian Government. A whole battalion came to protest, for they had not received their salaries for three months, and its representatives went to talk to the head of the Herceg-Bosnian Government. They kindly asked us to go back into the building. "Not even Tito-Mate Boban will leave here until we get paid," said one of them. Only after an hour and a half, after Prlic himself intervened, could we leave the building, but no one else, members and personnel of the government, was allowed to leave. Agreement was reached only one hour later.
