Will It Be Able To Survive?"] [Text] On the morning of 28 March, when a reception was held for Kazakhstani President N. Nazarbayev in the Kremlin with all the honors befitting the leader of a sovereign state, one could hardly have expected a significant breakthrough in Russian-Kazakhstani relations, which have over the last few months noticeably cooled, primarily owing to the acute disagreements over the future of the Baykonur Cosmodrome. However, that very same evening, even before the package of around two dozen documents had been signed, it became clear that B. Yeltsin and N. Nazarbayev had succeeded in eliminating the mutual bones of contention -- of which there had been plenty during the lengthy talks between experts and the leaders of the Ministry of the Economy and the Foreign Ministry -- and adopted a determined decision which promises to prolong the life of the unique space rocket complex. What happened during the eight-hour talks in Moscow? Why did Nazarbayev so rapidly abandon the excessive claims that Alma-Ata [Almaty] had put forward during the negotiating marathon? There is every indication that the solution should be sought in a practice that has become traditional for experienced politicians: Ask for as much as possible and get as much as you can. By the time the Kazakhstani delegation arrived in Moscow the set of documents prepared by the various departments looked like this. The heads of state were to discuss and sign treaties on military cooperation, on deepening economic integration between the two countries, and on the basic principles for resolving matters of granting dual citizenship, as well as, of course, the agreement on the basic principles for the use of the Baykonur Cosmodrome. The heads of government were to settle questions of collaboration in the field of military-technical cooperation and the servicing and maintenance of the strategic nuclear forces, and also to finally make joint efforts to remove a nuclear device left in a silo at the Semipalatinsk test site following its closure. According to one participant in the talks, these and other draft documents did not give rise to particular dispute. The Baykonur draft, which was submitted to the presidents in a very "raw" form, remained the thorn in the flesh. And not because the experts were unable to reach agreement. They had been given mutually exclusive paramaters for the cost of leasing the cosmodrome. Moreover, the cosmodrome is doomed without the city of Leninsk, without the Russian specialists living there. But Russian citizens cannot live and work normally in this city, which is under Kazakhstan's jurisdiction, unless the legal status of Russian specialists in this country is defined. The situation at the talks changed dramatically straight after the two presidents had a one-on-one conversation lasting roughly an hour. In his introductory address to the delegations Yeltsin said: "There were some questions over the documents, but we have settled them...." Soon many participants in the talks on both sides began leaving the Kremlin. It turned out that they were going off to the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of the Economy since the presidents had given them strict instructions: Coordinate your positions within six hours so that the Russian side's leasing of Baykonur becomes a reality. Economy Minister A. Shokhin described the gist of the draft during a conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent. The term of the cosmodrome lease is to run for 20 years. The amount of rent proposed by the Russian side must not exceed $82 million, which has already been enshrined in this year's budget. (Yu. Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency, cited a figure of $105-150 million). As for the city of Leninsk, Russia cannot fund it with the present number of inhabitants -- around 150,000 people. We may be talking about 40,000 specialists and members of their families. The Kazakhstani authorities are also to participate in funding the city. Needless to say, all these problems cannot be settled in six hours. Therefore some of them will be postponed until Yeltsin's visit to Alma-Ata, which will most likely take place this May. He received an invitation to that effect from Nazarbayev. After the joint document signing ceremony the presidents told journalists in unison that Baykonur will survive. "We had no political disagreements. There were just technical difficulties," Yeltsin said. Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev described the latter in an interview with your IZVESTIYA correspondent. The idea that has been around for some time of dividing up the cosmodrome and handing it over to an international company (the information "leak" about the creation of a Kazakhstani-Ukrainian company was most likely arranged with this in mind -- author's note) rapidly collapsed. And there is no need to look for intrigues on the part of the military here. Everyone who has studied the problem realizes that the cosmodrome is unviable without Russia. It must remain a unified complex. "In other words, Nazarbayev had no other options?" I asked. "I would say this: Kazakhstan is not the loser here," the minister replied. "Preserving the cosmodrome boosts that state's status. What is more, we will be paying to use it. And there is no one else to pay. U.S. launch technology, for instance, simply cannot be reconciled with ours." The saga of the rescue of Baykonur has been declared over, but it is too early to draw a line under it. Remember that it was decided in Massandra to buy out the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet. But nothing has budged an inch.
