The NATO ambassadors in Brussel held a meeting to discuss the latest situation in embattled Bosnian town of Gorazde. They endorsed the UN request for air strikes, but delayed a final decision pending military advice on options for using air power. The allies agreed "we have got to find a way to respond positively" to the request, Britain's Ambassador, Sir John Weston, said Wednesday. However, UN Commander Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose said it is too late for air strikes around Gorazde because Serb troops are too close and bombing would most probably endanger the 50,000 civilians huddling in the war-ravaged town. "There is nothing we can do to sustain the fences of Gorazde," rose told reporters. In Gorazde, UN aid workers strongly pleaded for their lives as Serbs relentlessly shelled the hospital and other buildings in the Muslim enclave. Workers said in a message to UN offices in Geneva that three rockets hit the hospital, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 15. They spoke of despair after a three-week Serb offensive that has reportedly killed at least 367 people and wounded more than 1,000. A new cease-fire agreement was signed by Serb leaders and the UN late Tuesday, but it appeared to be only the latest in a string of broken promises. Serbs' political leader Radovan Karadzic today issued a statement saying: "The Serbian side unilaterally proclaims peace in Gorazde. With this, the Gorazde crisis comes to an end." He made the statement in an apparent response to appeals for a cease-fire by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. NATO planes launched three rounds of air strikes in the past three weeks after serb offensive on Gorazde, one of six UN-declared "safe area" in Bosnia. Two air attacks only infuriated the Serbs while a third attack was thwarted Saturday when a British jet was shot down. Bosnian Serbs began the war in April 1992 after a Muslim-Croat vote to secede from Yugoslavia. The Serbian armed forces have seized about 70 percent of Bosnia in fighting that has killed or left missing more than 200,000 people.
