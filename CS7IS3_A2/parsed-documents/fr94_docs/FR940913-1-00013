FR940913-1-00013 FR940913-1-00004 As in the case of the 29 seat version, the required main cabin aisle widths would be established using measurements taken between seatbacks, which form a path in angular segments. The aisle width measured normal to the fuselage centerline above 25 inches from the floor, would extend from the seat back to the opposite cabin sidewall. Thus, while the required 15-inch dimension at cabin heights below 25 inches from the floor would be completely within the projected 20-inch width vertically, the 20-inch position would not be centered over the 15-inch position (See Figure 1.)

The regulations do not specifically prohibit the arrangement proposed; however, the policy in effect is predicated on a largely straight aisle which has only one or two lateral deviations; in other words, a traditional cabin arrangement. Therefore, special conditions were developed to establish design criteria which result in a level of safety equivalent to configurations on which the regulations were based. Jetstream has requested that the FAA amend Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 to allow a maximum passenger capacity of 30, to account for a new customer demand, and be responsive to the market. In their request Jetstream contends that there is no technical basis for the limitation on passenger capacity, and that the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) have, in fact, already granted such approval. Jetstream has proposed that on the basis of harmonization with the JAA, the FAA should consider their request favorably. Jetstream further contends that the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions for the 29 passenger Model 4101 illustrated that there is no impediment due to the aisle arrangement for 30 passengers. Jetstream argues that the concern that prompted the requirement was therefore demonstrated not to exist. In developing the special conditions, the FAA took account of the several favorable cabin safety features that the 29 passenger Model 4101 incorporates. One of the major features was the good exit-to-passenger ratio for the number of passengers requested. That is, one pair of Type II exits and one pair of Type III exits for 29 passenger seats, where the regulations allow up to 39. In this regard, 29 passenger seats was the largest arrangement proposed for a US customer. Consequently, the FAA did not consider a greater passenger capacity, and the issue of harmonization did not come up. With respect to the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions, this demonstration was a modified version of the demonstration specified in part 25, Appendix J. The principal modification was the use of a single exit (in this case, the forward Type I exit) instead of one half of the total number of exits installed. The demonstration was conducted this way in order to provide for maximum usage of the aisle, by the maximum number of passengers. While this demonstration was completed in 54 seconds, the resultant overall rates of egress were not particularly fast for this type of exit. In addition, the evacuees appeared to steady themselves on seatbacks to a higher degree than is typically seen in such demonstrations. Thus, while there was no clear obstruction due to the aisle, the overall egress rates did seem to be somewhat reduced. The FAA therefore considers that the aisle arrangement should result in a limit on maximum passenger capacity that is reduced over the theoretical limit in the regulations.
