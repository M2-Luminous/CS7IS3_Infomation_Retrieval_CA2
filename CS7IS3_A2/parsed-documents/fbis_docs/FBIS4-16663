The unusual subunit has ceased to exist in its former capacity, and its staffers have ended up under various "roofs." So as not to lose the ties, the mutual understanding built up over the years, and the mutual assistance, the group's officers have decided to reunite. The initiative has come mainly from those who have retired and who are filling out their pension documents. They have proposed setting up the Fund for the Social Protection of "Vympel" Group Staffers and inviting to participate in the fund all who have ever served in this subunit. The idea has been supported by many "Vympel" staffers, including those who have gone to serve in other structures. The founding document has been registered in accordance with the procedure laid down, and a search is now being conducted for premises to house the headquarters. On learning of the fund's creation, some firms and organizations at once started offering their services -- with premises and transport. But the "Vympel" staffers are in no hurry to make their choice. Nor are they as yet entirely clear about their future commercial activity. Everyone realizes right from the start that it will be necessary to earn money, and nobody in the fund entertains any illusions that some sponsor will give selfless assistance. One small thing is lacking -- a decision on how they can earn money. The special group's former staffers intend initially to provide consultative services to respectable commercial organizations and state structures, suggesting how best to guard themselves against industrial and economic espionage and terrorist activity. They will also be able to indicate vulnerable points in the already developed systems of security measures of any firms and organizations and to make recommendations on methods for checking out future partners, including foreign ones. The group's former staffers intend to use the funds earned to support the families of their comrades who died in Afghanistan, for those injured while fulfilling various assignments, and for all "Vympel" veterans who need assistance. The creation of the fund has hardly been publicized anywhere, but this idea has created obvious alarm and displeasure in certain high offices. And this, I believe, is perfectly explicable -- all the conditions for the breakup of the group were not brought about merely so that its staffers might once again come together in a single team which would no longer be subordinate to anyone and would live according to its own regulations.
