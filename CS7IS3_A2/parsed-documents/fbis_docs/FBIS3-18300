Speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a marathon negotiating session underway here since Friday [25 February] to enlarge the European Union to include Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden, Andreatta noted that a full report on the episode has not yet been compiled and that, until then, a final judgement could not be made. "What is certain, is that the planes violated the UN resolution banning military flights over Bosnia," he went on. If these planes were also involved in an attack, then the NATO intervention would have "even further justification," he added. Andreatta said that the pilots of the American jets had requested and received from their commanders authorization to open fire. The Italian foreign minister also pointed out that planes like those downed today were at the disposition of Croats, Serbs and Bosnian Serbs and that, as a result, the situation was still "a bit confused." Ever since UN decreed the no-fly zone over Bosnia, there have been hundreds of violations, he added, noting however, that it was mostly helicopters that had invaded the banned airspace.
