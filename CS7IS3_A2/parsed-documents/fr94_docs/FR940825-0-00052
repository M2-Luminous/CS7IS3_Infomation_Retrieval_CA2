FR940825-0-00052 FR940825-0-00013 Fees of $100 or more were rounded to the nearest $10. Fees between $2 and $99 were rounded to an even number so that the comparable small entity fee would be a whole number. The Office has detailed cost calculation worksheets fro each fee amount. These worksheets are available for public inspection in Suite 507 of Crystal Park 1, 2011 Crystal Drive, Arlington, Virginia. Workload Projections Determination of workloads varies by fee. Principal workload projection techniques are as follows: Patent application workloads are projected from statistical regression models using recent application filing trends. Patent issues are projected from an in-house patent production model and reflect examiner production achievements and goals. Patent maintenance fee workloads utilize patents issued 3.5, 7.5 and 11.5 years prior to payment and assume payment rates of 80 percent, 57 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Service fee workloads follow linear trends from prior years' activities. Any fee amount that is paid on or after October 1, 1994, would be subject to the new fees then in effect. For purposes of determining the amount of the fee to be paid, the date of mailing indicated on a proper Certificate of Mailing or Transmission, where authorized under 37 CFR 1.8, will be considered to be the date of receipt in the PTO. A Certificate of Mailing or Transmission under Section 1.8 is not ``proper'' for items which are specifically excluded from the provisions of Section 1.8. Section 1.8 should be consulted for those items for which a Certificate of Mailing or Transmission is not ``proper.'' Such items include, inter alia, the filing of national and international applications for patents. However, the provisions of 37 CFR 1.10 relating to filing papers and fees with an ``Express Mail'' certificate do apply to any paper or fee (including patent applications) to be filed in the PTO. If an application or fee is filed by ``Express Mail'' with a proper certificate dated on or after the effective date of the rules, as amended, the amount of the fee to be paid would be the fee established by the amended rules. Cost Calculations APS&hyph;Text at a Patent and Trademark Depository Library (PTDL) The costs for one hour terminal session time on APS&hyph;Text at a PTDL include license fees that must be paid to Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for its proprietary text and structure search software. Other costs are included for a portion, projected at 3.65 percent, of the lease of a computer mainframe for memory storage purposes; all costs associated with training PTDL staff (equipment rental, materials and time); personnel to provide client support to the PTDLs; telecommunication costs. A summary of the costs are listed below. APS&hyph;Text Cost of One Hour of Terminal Session Time at a Patent and Trademark Depository Library 1Cost element 1Public share Client Support Overtime $10,203 Additional Mainframe Costs 43,216 Software (license fee) 273,000 Training Costs 10,000 n,s Subtotal 336,419 General & Admin.

Each PTDL will select a maximum use subscription tier based on its anticipated usage and be responsible for monitoring their own use. The PTDLs will also be responsible for establishing their own policies regarding the provision of APS&hyph;Text in their library. If during the year a PTDL is about to exceed its chosen level of maximum use, the PTDL will be allowed to move to a higher tier (and pay the additional subscription rate) or to use up to the subscribed level and cease continued access mid-year. ‚ê£ 1Tiers 1Annual usage 1Annual subscription rate I 0&hyph;300 hours $2,250 II 301&hyph;600 hours 6,750 III 601&hyph;900 hours 11,250 IV 901&hyph;1200 hours 15,750 V 1201&hyph;1500 hours 20,250 The subscription rates were derived using the $15.00 per hour access charge previously calculated. There will be no additional charges or refunds to each library. For each tier, a discount mechanism is included in the annual subscription calculation. For example, the annual subscription rate of $2,250 for Tier I is calculated by taking the mean average of the annual usage range (in this case 150 hours is the mean of zero and 300 hours) and multiplying it by the $15.00 per hour access charge. Therefore, for a PTDL in Tier I, any usage over 150 hours is free to the library. But if a PTDL in Tier I were to not use at least 150 hours, the PTO would not be required to refund the amount of the subscription fee that was not used. APS&hyph;CSIR at the Patent Search and Image Retrieval Facility (PSIFR) The costs for one hour terminal session time on APS&hyph;CSIR at the PSIRF include license fees that must be paid to Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for its proprietary text and structure search software. It is estimated that 40 percent of the terminal time will be used for text searching, which requires the search software from CAS. Other costs are included for a portion, projected at 2.25 percent, of the lease of a computer mainframe for memory storage purposes; additional personnel for the PSIRF and the Office of Computer and Telecommunications Operations; computer acquisition, installation, and maintenance; supplies and equipment dedicated to public use; and general and administrative overhead. A summary of the costs are listed below.
