FR941021-0-00179 FR941021-0-00022 173. Motorola and LQP agree that the Commission must regulate Big LEO space station licensees as common carriers to the extent that they provide CMRS to end users. 225 If the licensees offer only space segment capacity to resellers, however, the parties contend that this provision of service does not fall within the definition of CMRS, and therefore need not be made available on a common carriage basis. 226 LQP argues that in this situation, the public is assured common carriage access to the service because, at some point a reseller will meet the definition of a CMRS provider and will be required to operate as a common carrier. 227 225 Motorola Comments at 67&hyph;68. 226 See e.g. , TRW Comments at 153&hyph;54 & n.239; LQP Comments at 97&hyph;98. 227 LQP Comments at 97, 100. 174. Big LEO space station licensees providing service directly to end users must be regulated as common carriers if the service offering meets the definition of CMRS. We will determine whether a service offering meets the definition based on the service description contained in the operator's application. Operators with pending applications may amend their applications to the extent necessary to enable us to make the determination regarding the nature of the service. 228 228 See para. 2, supra . 175. Pursuant to section 332(c)(5), however, if space segment capacity is offered by a Big LEO space station licensee to a reseller or other entity who then offers CMRS to end users, we have the discretion to determine whether to require the Big LEO licensee to offer such service on a common carriage basis, or to permit such offering to be made on a private carriage basis. In making this determination, we have looked to the analysis enunciated in NARUC I. 176. Regarding the first prong of the NARUC I test, the commenters agree unanimously that nothing in the nature of the applicants' service proposals supports a conclusion that their services will be offered indifferently to the public. Motorola points out that it and the other applicants propose to market their space segment capacity to a small number of resellers, and to tailor these offerings to the individual requirements of these few customers. Motorola contends that such offerings have never been viewed as ``common carriage'' under the NARUC I standard. 229 Constellation, LQP, TRW, and AirTouch concur, noting that Commission has historically viewed a service provider's lack of intent to serve end users as an indication of non-common carriage. 230 229 Motorola Comments at 64&hyph;65 (asserting that space capacity on the IRIDIUM system will never be offered directly to the public; rather, it will be provided on a wholesale basis to the operators of the IRIDIUM system gateways, who in turn may provide services to end users or sell capacity in bulk to service providers, or both). 230 Constellation Comments at 60; LQP Comments at 97&hyph;98; TRW Comments at 158&hyph;160; AirTouch Comments at 9&hyph;10. 177. We agree with the commenters that the record in this proceeding does not support a finding that the proposed space segment services are likely to be offered to the public indifferently, a basic characteristic of common carrier service. 231 First, in cases where licensees have not intended to serve the user public directly, the Commission has found services to be non-common carrier in nature. In Domestic Fixed-Satellite Transponder Sales, for example, the Commission noted the slim likelihood that non-common carrier domestic satellites would hold themselves out indifferently to serve the user public as key to its decision to permitted qualified persons to apply for domestic satellite licenses for non-common carrier purposes. 232 More recently, the Commission, in assessing its discretion under section 332(c)(5), held that non-voice, non-geostationary (NVNG) MSS space station licensees would be permitted to provide system access to CMRS providers on a non-common carrier basis. 233 Second, these limited offerings will be tailored to provide resellers with a wide variety of options, ranging from position determination and data messaging services, such as those proposed by the NVNG MSS proponents, to global telephony. Consequently, there is nothing in this record to support a finding that the services will be offered indifferently to the public. 231 See para. 171, supra.

Cir. 1984), modified Martin Marietta Communications Systems, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 60 Rad.Reg. (P&F) 2d 779 (1986). 233 NVNG MSS Order , note 48, supra , at 8456. 178. Regarding the second prong of the NARUC I test, the commenters unanimously agree that there should be no legal compulsion for space segment provides to serve the public indifferently. AirTouch and other commenters allege that there will be significant competition in the provision of these services to CMRS providers, both from Big LEO systems, as well as from GSO MSS and NVNG MSS systems. 234 These commenters also assert that sufficient capacity will be available to assure service availability to those that wish to receive it. 235 TRW further contends that the danger of unreasonable or anticompetitive practices that common carrier regulation is designed to prevent will not exist in the competitive environment in which Big LEO licensees will operate because five applicants seek authority to operate these services. 236 234 See, e.g. , AirTouch Comments at 7&hyph;8; Ellipsat Comments at 46; TRW Comments at 156&hyph;157. 235 AirTouch Comments at 8; TRW Comments at 157; Ellipsat Comments at 46. 236 See TRW Comments at 156. See also Motorola Comments at 63. 179. We concur that there does not appear to be a need to impose common carrier requirements on Big LEO licensees at this time. The Commission has found the presence of capacity and the resulting competition to be an important factor in determining whether non-common carrier treatment should be permitted. 237 As the commenters state, competitive voice mobile services already exist or are imminent. Furthermore, satellite-delivered radiolocation and messaging services are currently provided by a Commission licensee, 238 and are proposed by a number of NVNG MSS applicants. 239 Moreover, under our rules adopted today, sufficient spectrum is available to support the grant of up to five of the pending Big LEO applications. 240 Thus, significant direct competition is approaching. 241 We accordingly believe that sufficient competitive capacity will be available to assure the public of ample access to these services. Therefore, we find that there is no reason to require the provision of space segment capacity to be offered to resellers on a common carrier basis. 242 Of course, if a space segment capacity provider chooses to provide service on a common carrier basis, that service provider would be subject to regulation as a CMRS provider. 243 The Commission has forborne from applying certain provisions of Title II to CMRS providers. 244 237 Domestic Fixed-Satellite Transponder Sales, note 232, supra , at 1250&hyph;53. 238 See Qualcomm, Inc., Application for Blanket Authority to Construct and Operate a Network of 12/14 GHz Transmit/Receive Mobile and Transportable Earth Stations and a Hub Earth Station, 4 FCC Rcd 1543 (1989). 239 Final rules have been adopted establishing the NVNG mobile-satellite service, and three applications are pending. See NVNG MSS Order, note 48, supra . 240 See paras. 44&hyph;45, supra . 241 There is also support in antitrust law and policy for examining potential competition for that purpose. See Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services, Amendment of Part 90 of the Commission's Rules To Facilitate Future Development of SMR Systems in the 800 MHz Frequency Band, Amendment of Parts 2 and 90 of the Commission's Rules to Provide for the Use of 200 Channels Outside the Designated Filing Areas in the 896&hyph;901 MHz and 935&hyph;940 MHz Band Allotted to the Specialized Mobile Radio Pool, GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, PR Docket No. 93&hyph;144, PR Docket No. 89&hyph;553, FCC 94&hyph;212, at paras. 69&hyph;70, (released Sept. 23, 1994). 242 We emphasize that our decision with regard to the regulatory status of the provision of space segment capacity is taken pursuant to the Commission's authority under Section 332(c)(5). Therefore, our actions here should not be viewed as altering our decision in the CMRS Second Report and Order regarding individualized or customized service offerings made by CMRS providers to individual customers. As we explained in the CMRS Second Report and Order, individualized or customized offerings will be classified and regulated as CMRS, regardless of whether such offerings would be treated as common carriage under existing case law, if the service falls within the definition of CMRS. See CMRS Second Report and Order note 220, supra , at 1439 and n.130. We also explained that the public availability prong of the CMRS definition is met unless the service is used for a licensee's internal use or if Commission rules limit eligibility to specified user groups. Id. at 1441. 243 See CMRS Second Report and Order, note 220, supra , at 1475&hyph;90. 244 See 47 CFR 20.15. 180. In so finding, we recognize that the commenters argued the imposition of common carrier requirements may have an adverse effect on the development of this service. AirTouch and others argue that Section 310(b) restrictions on foreign involvement in the affairs of domestic common carrier licensees may significantly hinder investment by foreign entities, as well as their willingness to allow a U.S. licensee to operate within their own borders. 245 The commenters allege that this investment is critical to the development of a global satellite service. 246 Further, Motorola states that the submission of U.S. service providers to common carrier requirements will inhibit their ability to compete with foreign systems that are not similarly encumbered. 247 LQP concurs, noting that the space station licensees should be free to tailor their business plans to their respective customer bases. 248 245 See AirTouch Comments at 4&hyph;7.
