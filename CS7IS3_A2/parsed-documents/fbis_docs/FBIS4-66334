In this DDN project, MPT will import from Canada a 3600 bandwidth management system and from the U.S. some DACS 11-2000 digital cross-connect (DXC) equipment. DXC node computers will be installed in 24 provinces and municipalities nationwide. The main channels of this DDN are scheduled to be completed and operational by July of this year. DDN users will be provided with digital channels for data/image/videoconference transmission services at a variety of bit rates up to and including 2 Mbps, and will have trans-provincial transmission capabilities via public telecommunications networks, packet-switching networks, and local/provincial-level DDNs now being built.
