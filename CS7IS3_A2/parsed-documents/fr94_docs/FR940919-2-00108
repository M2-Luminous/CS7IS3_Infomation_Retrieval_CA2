FR940919-2-00108 FR940919-2-00046 Overview The disability process redesign is a high-level process description that provides a broad vision of how a new process would work but leaves operational, organizational, and other details for later development and implementation. SSA must now begin to transition from the high-level analysis into this latter phase. As SSA implements the new process, the five objectives of the redesign effort must continually be kept in the forefront of implementation planning, execution and assessment: the process will be user-friendly for claimants and those who assist them; the right decision will be made the first time; decisions will be made and effectuated quickly; the process will be efficient; and the new process will provide employees with a satisfying work environment. The success of the new process must be measured against these objectives and emphasis must continually be on overall measurement from the customer's perspective, and not individual component results. Implementing a process of the magnitude of the new disability claim process will require a strategy that is comprehensive, creative, and inclusive. The following provides a general framework for how implementation activity will proceed. Implementation Framework Planning for the implementation of the new process vision requires a comprehensive approach that moves forward on multiple fronts simultaneously. Although the new process will not be fully implemented until FY 2001, SSA must start on October 1, 1994 (the beginning of FY 1995), to initiate activities, changes and improvements that will establish the plan and pace for the long-term full implementation of the new process. The goal is to make near-term, visible improvements while at the same time building for long-term results. Multiple Track Approach Immediate or near-term implementation activities are those that can begin in FY 1995 and will be fully implemented nationwide by the end of FY 1996, or for which the research and development or site testing can be initiated within the next two fiscal years. These activities include streamlining and simplification initiatives or other procedural elements of the new process that can be implemented using existing administrative or regulatory discretion. They also include client-service activities associated with improving the claimant's access and entry into the disability claim process; the development and site testing of options for streamlining parts of the administrative appeals process; the provision of consistent training and direction to disability decisionmakers; and the establishment of new measures and the testing of new quality assurance mechanisms. Additionally, because the decision methodology associated with the new process depends on significant amounts of research, consultation, development and refinement, SSA must identify the specific research needs, develop the appropriate scope of work and award research contracts as near-term activities. Long-range implementation items are those requiring extensive research and development that could not be tested fully before FY 1999 or could not be fully implemented nationwide before FY 2001. These activities are those associated with the full development, testing and refinement of a new decision methodology. They also include the implementation of advanced technology enhancements that provide a single, fully-integrated disability claim processing system which supports paperless claim processing and provides interactive capabilities for claimants and those who assist them, and for providers of evidentiary information. The remaining mid-term items or activities are those elements of the new process that can be developed and tested in FYs 1997 and 1998 and/or fully implemented nationwide by FY 1998. Mid-term activities would include such items as the phased testing and implementation of new service options; full development, testing and implementation of a streamlined appeals process; the testing of more advanced technology enhancements; and the activities associated with developing the decision methodology based on the results of research efforts completed by the end of the near term.
