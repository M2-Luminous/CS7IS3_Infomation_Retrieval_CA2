Yakubchik] [Text] The KFZ-1 high-explosive shaped charge is designed for accelerated demolition of roads, airfield runways, and emplaced objects, and working frozen ground by the explosive method. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Composition of KFZ-1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Stowage box--launching equipment |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |ID-120 rocket motor |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Z-23 high-explosive charge |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |VZ-ZOM firing mechanism |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KZ-5 shaped charge |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Accessories |1 set | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The KFZ-1 charge is assembled and set up at the place of use by a two-man crew. The charge is actuated electronically using a communication control line 100 meters long. The electric pulse transmitted over the control line actuates the pyrotechnic cartridge of the rocket motor. The rocket motor is started from the pyrotechnic cartridge. After the motor achieves the required reaction force, the KZ-5 shaped charge is detonated. The shaped-charge jet of molten material thus formed creates a borehole in the ground, which the high-explosive charge enters under the action of the motor's reaction force. The high-explosive charge detonates at a depth of 1.5-2 meters and leads to the destruction of the buried object and formation of a crater. Depending on the task to be carried out, the KFZ-1 charge can be used alone or as part of a group of charges. The number of charges in the group is limited only by the capabilities of the current source. Basic Specifications Weight of charge in stowage box, kg 76 Dimensions of charge in stowage box: length, mm 1560 width, mm 382 height, mm 335 Thickness of seasonally frozen ground up to 2 that can be broken up, meters Destruction of objects installed in up to 3.5 the ground, depth in meters Size of crater formed: diameter, meters 5-7 depth, meters 1.5-1.8 Preparation time, minutes 5 Method of actuation electrical Crew size 2 Temperature range of usage, degrees C -40 to +50 Guaranteed shelf life, years 10
