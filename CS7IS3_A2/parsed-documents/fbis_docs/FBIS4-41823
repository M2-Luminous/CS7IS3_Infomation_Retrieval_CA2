The latest reports from the NKR have confirmed that no incident has occurred in the confrontation areas. The sides have been trying not to allow any incident which may create a new tension in the region. In general, the cease-fire agreement is being heeded. The situation in the front line areas is peaceful, that is, not taking into account the shooting by Azerbaijan's military units from time to time. In view of that, we hope that the peaceful situation will not be temporary and that a result will be achieved through the talks that are held at various levels to convince the two sides to end the confrontation. Regrettably, a stable situation has not been established on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The reason for that state of affairs is the frequent shooting from Azerbaijan in the direction of various settlements in Armenia. Azerbaijan's military units have fired mainly on Armenia's Idzhevanskiy, Tavushskiy, Noyemberyanskiy, and Araratskiy Rayons. Other areas also have been fired on. It must be stressed for the sake of justice that the Armenian side has refrained from returning the fire in several cases. The Armenian Ministry of Defense Information Service has disclosed that Azerbaijan's military units fired on several border towns in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon with various types of arms last night. The Armenian side did not return the fire.
