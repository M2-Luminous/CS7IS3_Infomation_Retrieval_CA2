Now, it has been shown clearly, through the roundtable meeting, who the warmongers are and who does and does not want peace. Three planeloads of government officials went to attend the meeting as if to beg the Khmer Rouge for peace, but the Khmer Rouge refused to accept peace through negotiation. The government accepted an unconditional cease-fire in place to begin at noon on 15 June before holding any further talks. But Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan rejected it, claiming that foreign troops are still in Cambodia. At the same time, he demanded the dismantling of all national institutions from the monarchy, government, and National Assembly down to village committees. Should we agree to dismantle the national institutions that we have built with the assistance of the international community? Both the Cambodians, who own this country, and the international community will certainly not agree to this. Therefore, we have only one alternative, that is, to continue the war to smash the Khmer Rouge, which is just a paper tiger. We have said earlier that only by using war against war can we achieve peace. That is, if the roundtable fails due to the Khmer Rouge.
