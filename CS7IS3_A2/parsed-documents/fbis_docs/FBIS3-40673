The Uruguay Round formally concluded on the scheduled date of December 15, 1993. The flurry of negotiations towards the end mainly involved the two major trading partners, the United States and the EC and, to a limited extent, Japan, India and the other developing countries were on the periphery of the negotiations throughout. For them the final package remained almost the same as assembled by Mr. Arthur Dunkel, the former Director-General of GATT, in his celebrated text. Since the adoption of the text, in order to defend its position the Government of India seems to have mounted a publicity blitzkrieg in which no holds are barred, and no argument or interpretation, however flimsy or far-fetched, is to be discarded. From all this one very nearly gets the impression that the final outcome of the Uruguay Round is tailor-made to suit India's interest. It is claimed that our exports will go up by an additional $1.5 to 2 billions annually, that there will be a real spurt in our agricultural exports, that the IPR regime will bring us a lot of benefits, that our policies and practices in the vital areas of investment, food security, farmers' right to reuse and sell patented seed varieties, and obligation to grant minimum access, for agricultural imports, will remain intact. It is also claimed that with the adoption of the Uruguay Round we have emerged from the twilight of the old jaded GATT trading system to a new liberal "orderly multilateral trading system." In defending the Dunkel Text the Government and its supporters are mixing up two entirely different sets of arguments. At one level, they are defensive and are arguing that India had no alternative but to accept the Dunkel Text because we were isolated and because we cannot keep out of the multilateral trading system. This implies that there is something intrinsically wrong with the Text, but we can neither avoid it nor do without it. At the other level, they go on the offensive and interpret the specific provisions of the Text to bring out how they serve India's interest. There is definitely a contradiction in these two sets of arguments. On both the issues of India's isolation and the perils of India remaining outside the multilateral trading system, a number of related questions arise which have never been answered. Why did India allow itself to be isolated? When did the isolation occur and who were responsible for it? Were there any objective factors, internal or external, accounting for this isolation? Similarly, why did we allow ourselves to be led like a sacrificial lamb to the altar of the multilateral trading system? Did we really have no leverages at all? How about the size of our economy, and market, our infrastructural base and our trained manpower, of which we are never tired of boasting in other contexts? How about the bargaining value of the massive liberalisation that we have undertaken as a part of our structural adjustment programme? Were we able to take advantage of them? And if we were not then what were the reasons? Some day the Government will have to come out clean on these points. Keeping these arguments of tactics and strategy aside for the time being, let us examine what we have lost and gained in certain key areas. In most of these areas, the Government's argument runs on the following lines. "We have been given a transitional period of 5 to 10 years. We can maintain our present regime for the time being. No changes need be made in our present policies." This is good as far as it goes. But should we not pay greater attention to the new international regimes that have been established or would emerge and see how we are going to fare under them rather than harping on the temporary relief or reprieve that we have been given? The most dismal part of the score card is TRIPS. Here we have gained nothing and lost everything that we could have. In 5-10 years time, India will no longer be able to manufacture life-saving drugs based on process-patent. All these drugs will have to be imported. Statistical figures relating to some 30 drugs in the category show that today the United States prices are 2.63 times to 71.29 times costlier than those prevailing in India and the U.K. prices are 2.45 times to 47.88 times costlier. On what basis can then the Government say that the price increase will be only by 20 to 60 per cent. Apparently, they are quoting the average figure, taking into account all drugs--life-saving or otherwise, and patented as well as unpatented. The measures the Government is talking about for keeping the prices at a reasonable level are in the nature of bravado. The Drug Control Rules will not help because there is no way the importers can be forced to sell the drugs they import at a price 5-10 times lower than what they paid. Of course, the Government can subsidise; but this will be at the cost of the exchequer. The Government will also find itself helpless in getting the drugs manufactured in the country because, according to the Dunkel Text on TRIPS, for the application of the patent "importation" is as good as "local production." Moreover, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Government to ensure the working of the patent. There is no provision in the Dunkel Text on "compulsory licensing" of the kind provided in the Indian Patent Act of 1970. The provision for "other use without the authorisation of the right holder" contains so many safeguards--such as offer of "reasonable terms and conditions," payment of "adequate remuneration," and all these--that it will be well nigh impossible to oblige the patent holder to work the patent in the country. Thus, we will remain perpetually dependent on the import of patented drugs. The much-touted argument that consumers can switch over from the more expensive on-patent drugs to less expensive off-patent drugs is misplaced. There is no consumers' sovereignty in the market of life-saving drugs. The patient goes by the doctor's prescription and the doctor prescribes under the influence, both direct and indirect, of the sales drive of the drug companies. Thus the consumers in India must brace for paying 3-4 times more, and in many cases, even high prices, for this category of drugs. The new IPR regime will have a debilitating effect on our technological development which is a critical factor for economic growth. All scientific and technological activities based on process patenting will have to be wound up in 5-10 years. An important source of obtaining technology, i.e., by the compulsory working of patents, will no longer be available. It is claimed that the provisions in the Dunkel Text on agriculture will give a great fillip to our agricultural exports. This claim is highly exaggerated because our agricultural exports depend on a variety of factors many of which have nothing to do with the Dunkel Text. In the exports of high-value agricultural products, such as fruits, vegetables, plants and flowers, the price factor is not all that important. The two factors that are important are micro-management, and availability of adequate infrastructural facilities. We have to have much improved transportation system, refrigeration facilities, we have to maintain quality, ensure timely delivery and apply very high sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards laid down in the Dunkel Text. All this is not going to be an easy task. Besides, it should be remembered that the reduction in the barriers to trade in agriculture is not going to exceed 30 per cent on an average. It is doubtful if a 30 per cent increase in prices will be enough for us to break into the international market. Besides, this is going to be available to our competitors also who are all lower cost producers of agricultural products. Finally, we should not dismiss the far-reaching consequences of our accepting the obligation of importing a minimum of 3.3 per cent of our total consumption of agricultural product. This is bound to affect the entire pattern of our agricultural economy--our food security, our agricultural price system, our crop pattern, our subsidisation system, etc. The fact that we are not obliged to provide minimum access now because we are applying import restrictions on balance-of-payments ground is not much of a comfort. As already stated, we should think of the regime that is being put in place and not the temporary relief we can get. Besides, we have today accumulated a reserve of about $8 billions. It is now open to the IMF to certify any day that India is no longer facing balance-of-payment difficulty and the new regime should apply to it. How long shall we be allowed to go on invoking the GATT balance-of-payment clause? We should not forget that negotiators from the developed countries have always said that this clause provides free-ride for the developing countries and that one of their objectives is to eliminate the free-riding privilege.
