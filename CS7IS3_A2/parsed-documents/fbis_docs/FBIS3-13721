Speaking to reporters after meeting Vatican Foreign Minister Jean Louis Tauran, 'Arafat said that what is needed is a response by the U.S. Administration, the United States [as received], and Russia, who are the cosponsors of the peace conference, and the Security Council to the just demands of the Palestinian people, namely, international protection for our children, women, men, masses, and the Islamic and Christian sacred places. He added: I ask the U.S. Administration to release the Security Council resolution it has been detaining for 19 days by not allowing a vote at the Security Council. He added: Our people and the rest of the world have a right to hear the Security Council opinion on the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 'Arafat noted that this massacre committed by extremist settlers against worshippers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque for no reason cannot be the work of a mentally disturbed person, as Israel says. He asked: The commission of inquiry noted that the murderer fired 111 bullets, but how could 111 bullets kill or wound over 200 people? 'Arafat stressed that more than one person must have participated in the crime. He asked: Why didn't the Israeli army, which was stationed in front of the mosque when Israel took over the place and turned it into a Jewish synagogue, interfere? Where were the Israeli guards, who are present night and day, at the time of the crime? 'Arafat added another question: Are we facing a new secret organization within the Israeli Army or is the entire Israeli Army involved? I want a clear, explicit answer before I give any answers about the Palestinian position, he concluded.
