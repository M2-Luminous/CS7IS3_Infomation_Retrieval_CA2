At the close of the interview President Iliescu termed the Romanian-German relations as increasingly good, saying Germany was the country that understood the best Romania's difficulties caused by the processes of transformation that resembled those of the former GDR. "We have found with Germany a more exact perception of our problems in the process of transition," the Romanian head of state said. As far as the economic relations between the two countries were concerned, the president pointed to the existence of mutual interests, explaining that both Romania and Germany were located "on the Rhine-Main-Danube trans-European axis, with two terminals, Rotterdam and Constanta, and with the German economy at the center, which will be the engine of the general process of the European integration." The German guest noted the good level of the bilateral relations. "I believe the reforms these last few years in Romania, and especially the situation after 1993 can stir the interest of foreign investors," he said. The German minister of economic cooperation, Carl-Dieter Spranger met on Friday, 6 May, in Bucharest with the Romanian minister of state, head of the Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, Mircea Cosea. Within his presentation of the Romanian economy, Mircea Cosea said that Romania was giving a very special attention to its relations with Germany, because there existed a tradition of German industry presence in Romania in the sectors of railroads, iron and steel industry, and telecommunications. The Romanian minister expressed hope that Romania would benefit from German aid of capital and technology in the process of reform. Cosea said that the German business mentality could be a very important factor in the process of reform. The German minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said his visit was a signal for the extending of the relations with Romania. The signing of the agreement on the non-reimbursable economic assistance granted to Romania is a relevant sign, said the German minister. Minister Spranger said that Germany would send in Romania experts in privatization, banking system updating, stock exchanges, industrial restructuring, and social protection. Romania is interested in developing a proper collaboration framework with Germany, that should allow for the presence of German businessmen here, the setting up of joint ventures, as well as the intensification of the actions of cooperation and commercial exchanges, said Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu on 6 May, during his interview with Carl-Dieter Spranger, federal minister of economic cooperation of Germany. The Romanian premier assessed that the signing of the technical assistance agreement between the two countries was part of the preoccupations to improve the management of the commercial companies and update and retool the industrial units, especially those built with German technology. Minister Spranger said Germany would further back Romania's efforts in the European Union, the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development], and the World Bank. Referring to the German minority in Romania, Spranger said the Romanian state's policy with respect to that community was favorably regarded in his country.
