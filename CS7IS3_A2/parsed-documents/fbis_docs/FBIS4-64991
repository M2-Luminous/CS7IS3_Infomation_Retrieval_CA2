They wanted to indicate in a violent way that the Islamic Armed Resistance cannot be brought down by repression, which is particularly harsh at this moment, nor by the "national reconciliation" advocated by head of state Liamine Zeroual. [passage omitted] The [French] Foreign Ministry has condemned "this odious crime" and has reissued a warning to the remaining 3,000 or so French citizens in Algeria to return to France (some 5,000 have already left the country). Government Spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy stated that "Today, Algeria is one of the prime minister's primary concerns."
