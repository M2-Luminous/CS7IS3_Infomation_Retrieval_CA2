It has been reported that they can go either by air or by land. Is it indeed so difficult to withdraw these 450 blue helmets from there? [Van Puyvelde] During the few months of the UNAMIR [UN Missionin Rwanda] operation, much equipment has been amassed in and around Kigali, and it obviously will be very difficult to get this equipment out speedily via an airlift to Nairobi or Belgium. That is why the land route solution is being opted for. Obviously, this route can only be followed if the situation is safe. [Allcock] It is not safe? [Van Puyvelde] As things stand now, there is a chance that they will go overland. So, the situation is considered to be safe. [Allcock] And all the equipment, or at least as much a possible, will be recovered. [Van Puyvelde] Yes, obviously.
