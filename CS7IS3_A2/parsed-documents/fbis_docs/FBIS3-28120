The crisis delayed the announcement of a long-awaited economic stimulus package because the new "national welfare tax" is designed to finance a planned 6 trillion yen reduction in income and residential tax, the focus of the economic pump-primer reportedly totaling some 15 trillion yen. Representatives of the seven coalition parties continued last- ditch negotiations to try to break the deadlock Thursday night. Hosokawa expressed willingness to modify the new tax plan following a threat from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the largest force in the coalition, that it would withdraw its six cabinet ministers unless Hosokawa drops the new tax plan. The premier said the SDP is "important" for the coalition, adding, "If the ruling coalition tells me to do something, I am not concerned about saving face," according to Akio Nakajima, a House of Representatives member of Hosokawa's Japan New Party [JNP]. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference the government is ready to change the details of the new indirect tax. The chief cabinet spokesman said the administration is ready "to correct the wrong" if it helps to ensure the unity of the coalition and alleviate public distaste for the new tax proposal. Hosokawa announced early Thursday without getting consent from the SDP that his coalition government has decided to introduce the 7 percent "national welfare tax" to finance the planned 6 trillion yen tax cut in place of the consumption tax. Hosokawa said the government wants to introduce the new tax on goods and services on April 1, 1997. The SDP said the "welfare tax" is nothing more than the renaming of the 3 percent consumption tax because its mechanism is almost identical to that of the consumption tax. The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the consumption tax, bolstered its parliamentary strength in a 1989 House of Councillors election shortly after then Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita introduced the tax. In the negotiations the SDP demanded nullifying the rate of 7 percent and the timing of implementation of the new tax and setting up a consultative body to discuss the tax. But the talks stalled because the Finance Ministry stuck to the rate of 7 percent, coalition sources said. Aside from the SDP, opposition to the new tax was voiced by the JNP and Sakigake (Harbinger), both coalition partners, at a meeting of their legislators. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and his Democratic Socialist Party counterpart Takashi Yonezawa agreed that it would be best to nullify the new 7 percent tax, coalition officials said. Yonezawa conveyed the accord to Hosokawa by telephone and urged renewed talks on the tax plan. Shinseito, a key party in the coalition, and Komeito took the leadership in formulating the new tax, and the subsequent row has revealed a power struggle within the coalition, political analysts said. The political crisis came after the six-month-old fragile Hosokawa government overcame another crisis over political reform last week. Hosokawa managed last Saturday to hang onto power by reaching a last-ditch deal over the government's political reform bills with the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party. The prime minister told reporters after the passage of the bills that he had no intention of raising the consumption tax. Hosokawa scored high public approval ratings following his success in enacting the political reform bills in late January. Some political analysts attributed the crisis to his arrogance. The SDP has been frustrated after being forced to accept compromises over key issues such as the opening of Japan's rice market last year and political reform in January since joining the seven-party coalition last August. The party said in December that it opposed a GATT compromise proposal on partially opening the rice market, but had no choice but to abide by Hosokawa's decision to accept the plan. The party was forced to accept a compromise plan on political reform bills reached between Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono for fear that SDP opposition might bring about the collapse of the coalition government.
