FR941110-0-00203 FR941110-0-00016 This interpretation flows very logically from the wording of section 1919(h)(3)(D), which gives the Secretary permission to continue payments (``The Secretary may continue payments *␣*␣*'' emphasis added). Since the Secretary has ample authority elsewhere in the Act to pay facilities, he does not need this ``permission'' and therefore the provision would appear to be redundant. It acquires meaning only if it is understood as making an exception to a situation where the Secretary would otherwise be barred from making payment. One commenter believes that sections 1919(h)(3)(D) and1819(h)(2)(D) of the Act, if not redundant, were incorporated into the Act to constitute guidance in a situation that otherwise would make it unclear as to whether or not payment should continue, that is, disagreement between HCFA and the State. Other commenters noted that, ``A reasonable reading of the statute does not require the Secretary to second-guess every determination by a State that intermediate sanctions should be attempted before resorting to termination.'' The commenters assert that the statutory provision should only apply in those very rare circumstances where the Secretary concludes that termination is necessary, but yields to the State's recommendation that intermediate remedies be imposed instead. Response: While we agree that the Secretary has the authority to pay Medicare facilities and pay States for Medicaid facilities in accordance with sections 1861(v)(1) and 1903 of the Act, respectively, the provisions of sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) limit the Secretary's authority to make payments for Medicare providers and States (for Medicaid providers), respectively. However, that is not the only situation in which there would be lack of clarity as to whether or not payment should continue. The clearer reading and the one we have adopted is that, without this provision, a lack of clarity would exist over whether or not payments should continue despite noncompliance with the statutory participation requirements. Further, we do not agree that the Act provides for the scheme offered by the commenter (that is, that we only invoke section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act if there is disagreement about termination). Such disagreements between the State and the Secretary over termination and establishing remedies are addressed at section 1919(h)(7) of the Act. Comment: One commenter expressed the opinion that there is almost universal agreement that terminating nursing homes from Medicare and Medicaid is harmful to residents. The commenter believed that in most terminations, residents are transferred to other substandard nursing homes farther away from family and friends. The end result of most provider terminations is to expose residents to relocation trauma without getting better care. Other commenters also expressed concern over the resident's reaction to a potential termination. Commenters believed that even when a facility has come into compliance, residents suffer from the uncertainty of their situations. Although commenters agreed with our statement in the preamble that we see provider agreement terminations generally to be the enforcement response to the most serious deficiencies, they believed the proposed regulation allows almost unrestricted use of termination as a sanction. Response: We disagree with the commenter, who gave no evidence to support the contention that most provider terminations expose residents to relocation trauma without getting better care. We acknowledge that there are instances in which termination will cause some hardship to residents, but the advantages of removing residents from a noncompliant nursing home could outweigh any disadvantages. Usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative remedies prior to terminating or in addition to terminating a facility in hopes that a facility will achieve substantial compliance. We believe that in those cases in which termination becomes necessary, the termination is for the ultimate benefit of the residents to assure that they receive the care to which they are entitled. Comment: One commenter stated that section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act requires the Secretary to establish guidelines for the approval of corrective actions requested by the States. The commenter pointed out there are no proposed rules that address this statutory requirement. Response: We will issue these guidelines in manual instructions. We do not believe including them in regulations is required or necessary.
