For he has no doubt whatsoever that, after the early parliamentary elections in the fall, he will come back victorious at the head of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] to reclaim his position as prime minister. Much has been written about this 52-year-old politician during the past several weeks. But let us hear from Vladimir Meciar himself, without whom, whether we like it or not, Slovak internal political developments in the immediate future cannot be imagined. [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Mr. Chairman, how do you evaluate the current political developments in Slovakia? Can the unanimous vote to hold early elections be considered something that will calm the situation here? [Meciar] New elections will not resolve a single substantive problem facing Slovakia. At most, they will succeed in changing the representatives who are to solve those problems. The elections mean postponing the threat of a possible confrontation within society. It will take the present governing coalition a long time to recover from the way we maneuvered it into voting to shorten the electoral term. Before the vote, it was agreed that Weiss's SDL [Party of the Democratic Left] will not join the government if the new date for elections is not approved. But it broke this agreement nevertheless, as it did many others before, and the government was formed. At the same time, the present governing coalition did not want new elections. It voted in favor of the elections because it was convinced that we did not want them and that the law therefore would certainly not pass. From the viewpoint of the internal political situation in Slovakia, the present situation is very bad. The continuity of all of the processes that were successfully under way was interrupted. Moravcik's government will be doing nothing for at least a month but searching for a new program or looking for mistakes of the old government for the sole purpose of giving the appearance of being better. The former, or, if you will, my government, was a minority government, but it came out of the democratic elections a winner. The present government is again a minority government. Represented in it are both the SDL and the KDH [Christian Democratic Movement], as well as two steering committees of parties that are still in the process of being formed. Also represented in it is Knazko's Alliance of Democrats, which no one elected to the parliament. The coalition is a minority that is dependent on the support of Hungarian political parties. The same as in Jan Carnogursky's government, the Hungarian political parties presented their bill to this government, which it will have to pay willy-nilly. Nor were relationships within the parliament resolved. The disintegration that followed the democratic elections, particularly in our movement because of our mistakes as well as external pressures, be it from the president or the then opposition parties, resulted in there now being 24 deputies in the parliament who were originally elected as representatives of different parties. They are now "programless" and Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik is "unattached"; he has no political party behind him. The makeup of his character allows, of course, for obedience in the relationship between the president and the prime minister.... An interesting situation developed in connection with the fact that, in a manner unheard of in the history of democratic countries, the president, who does not have the right to control the activities of the government, utters criticism of the prime minister although he knew that the entire government will fall, and makes his own function in the government hang in the balance because the prime minister has different views on some matters. This is a case without precedence in the world. Many problems are related precisely to Slovakia's efforts to halt the overall pace of economic decline. But this situation will last for some time and its impact will be deeper. The desire for power with which a few people in party leaderships, even those who are not in the government today, became intoxicated was greater than the feeling of responsibility toward the citizens for the consequences. That is bad. Slovakia is also undergoing a crisis of personalities, a crisis of political entities, and these political entities have a negative impact on the country. [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] While you were prime minister you were often criticized for centralizing power and for your controversial character. What do you think of such criticism, criticism that comes not only from the president. [Meciar] To talk about centralization of power is to show a great lack of understanding of how, in fact, the power spheres of a state work. The HZDS never had a majority in the parliament and was always dependent on the support of somebody else. So what is this about centralizing power in the parliament? A minority that centralizes the majority?! That is indeed ingenious nonsense. Who then wants to talk about concentration of power? And that I became prime minister on the basis of democratic elections. That is, after all, normal. I have never once lowered myself to using administrative instruments or power to conduct public policy. Today even many of my friends blame me for being too democratic, for having too liberal an attitude toward everybody. But even so, I think that the path I followed was the right one and that power is used only by those who do not know how to govern any other way. Moreover, the talk about centralization of power was heard mostly at the time I held the post of minister of privatization. I did not privatize anything for myself, my family, or relatives. I placed those who thought they had priority rights to everything in line according to importance, the same as everybody else. The slogan "Stand in line and wait to see if you are better" was felt as a threat by many. That is why they began spouting nonsense. We all have a certain character makeup, and political personalities in particular cannot be such that they suit everybody. In all of us there is something good, something bad. Show me a person who is ideal.... It simply cannot be a flesh and blood human being. But I am glad that it is mostly my character traits that are being criticized because that means that no faults are being found with my work. After everything I experienced during the four years of my political life, and obviously will yet experience during these six months, I think that each of us writes his references through his own work. Whether people want a certain politician must be decided precisely through elections, not by the person who sits next to me and thinks I should play second fiddle or by someone who holds another position and thinks his function is more important, maybe in just one power structure, and someone else would suit him better. If you do not have a majority in the parliament, the president is in opposition to you, the courts are independent, and so try to talk about concentration of power. Lord, forgive those who do not know what it is! [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Constant attacks on President Michal Kovac are incensing the crowds. People have a feeling of uneasiness, which will probably end only after the new elections. Are such attacks on the president necessary, and will they be part of your election campaign? [Meciar] There is a good passage in the Bible that says woe to those with whom scandal originates. I do not think at all that the president is being attacked. Rather, I believe that Michal Kovac's actions are engendering a justified anger among the citizens. The point is that the president does not have the right to step beyond the constitutional sphere of activities and powers the Constitution accords him. When he goes beyond the scope of his powers, the citizen has not only the right but also a duty to protest. The president simply cannot ignore the political will of the citizens, the president cannot intrude into political parties and try to break them up, the president cannot engage in intrigues--whether openly or covertly--against a government that was formed on the basis of democratic elections. But, if he does that and thinks he is justified in staying in office, he is very much mistaken. The only decent solution is for him to resign in the interest of the stability and purity of national life. I do not believe we need to stoop so low as to mount some kind of attack on Mr. Kovac, who, by the way, used to be my deputy in the HZDS. After all, he will take care of everything himself.... Everyone is the architect of his own good fortune or misfortune. I, too, proposed him for president of the Republic. Today, I must admit, I should not have done it. [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Eighteen people have already left the HZDS deputies' club. According to our information, there are still a number of people in the movement who have social democratic tendencies or lean toward other parties of the center. Do you suppose that in the preelection period a further splintering will take place within the HZDS? [Meciar] The HZDS meets Slovakia's needs by its stable, strong, centrist position. Therefore, no turn to the right, no turn to the left, but straight ahead! That is why the HZDS also had mass support among the voters. This movement could not be broken up from the outside--only from the inside. Pressure could be applied from the outside, but, without allies on the "inside," the objective would not have been achieved. The first signal for departure was Knazko's signal, with whom seven people left. He failed as a politician, he failed as a government official. Naturally, he blames his failures on somebody else. The departure of another group from the HZDS was connected with Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik. True, their work came under extremely critical scrutiny in my government. They felt themselves personally threatened, and they reacted by trying to break up the club, taking with them eight persons. They created the so-called alternative, but, basically, even before they created it, they talked with the opposition about forming a new government.
