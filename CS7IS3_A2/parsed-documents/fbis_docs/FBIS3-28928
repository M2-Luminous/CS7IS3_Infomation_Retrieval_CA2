Fujii repeatedly told a regular press conference that there appeared to be speculative elements in currency trading, but he declined to tie the surge to any cause. He said Tokyo would take "appropriate measures at the right time" but refused to be specific. The Japanese currency soared 2.56 yen in Tokyo trading to 105.69 yen to the dollar, with dealers citing the failure of Japan-U.S. trade talks at last Friday's summit in Washington. Market players have said failure by the two countries to pare Japan's huge trade surplus would invite high-yen pressure from Washington, and U.S. officials were quoted by the Japanese press as saying a higher yen would not be surprising. But Fujii said, "I would like to avoid comment" on causes of the yen's rise. He said it is the "common understanding" of seven leading industrial nations that exchange rates should move in a stable manner, reflecting economic fundamentals. Asked about Japan-U.S. trade relations, Fujii defended Tokyo's macro- and microeconomic efforts, saying "misunderstandings remain" on the U.S. side. On the insurance sector, which is under his ministry's jurisdiction, Fujii refuted charges that Japan is dragging its feet, saying the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is making every effort to "solemnly" deregulate its insurance market. Separately, a senior ministry official said the two sides had nearly agreed on the insurance sector before Friday's meeting of Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton, remaining hung up on how to define "objective criteria" to gauge progress. Japan remains opposed to U.S. calls for what he said were essentially numerical targets of market share, which is decided by private business decisions, not government fiat, he said. Deregulation is the key to improving market access in insurance, and measuring market share is unrelated to progress on deregulation, the official said. Despite U.S. warnings that it may review the bilateral trade "framework," the official said a July deadline for the talks has not changed and that Japan will proceed with its insurance deregulation. Fujii said Japan's politically divisive tax cut, decided last week, has also been misunderstood. Although the nearly 6 trillion yen worth of income and residential tax cuts were proposed for one year only, they are not single-year rebates, Fujii said, stressing that they comprise reduced rates of application. The tax cuts are "the first step in a full-fledged tax reform" promised by the governing coalition, he said. Fujii also defended the strict curbs in growth of spending on the military and for official development assistance (ODA), agreed Monday for inclusion Tuesday in the government's draft of the fiscal 1994 budget. The final adjustments reflect the accumulated individual policy needs of each ministry or agency, Fujii said. As all the government's cabinet ministers visited the Finance Ministry in turn for final budget talks with Fujii, attention focused on the record low 4.8 percent ODA rise from the initial fiscal 1993 budget and the 34-year low 0.9 percent increase for the Defense Agency.
