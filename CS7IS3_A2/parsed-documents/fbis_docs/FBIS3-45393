With the deepening of the enterprise restructuring, the introduction and perfection of the social security system are essential to the success of reforms in other areas. In China, social security includes old-age pension insurance for employees in manufacturing, government offices and other institutions in urban and rural areas, unemployment relief, medical insurance, birth insurance and insurance for industrial accidents. Under the old planned economy the state was responsible for providing unemployment relief, and employers for covering virtually all their insurance. Practice shows that that approach has failed to meet the needs of a socialist market economy and a modern enterprise system. The new social security system will free enterprises, especially major state-owned ones, from the burden of "running society" -- taking charge of all employees' welfare -- so that they will able to participate in fair market competition. The funds for social security will come from mutual assistance funds and will be distributed by relevant government departments. Mutual assistance funds will come from the state, enterprises and employees. An official of the Labor Ministry said that the pension insurance system has already been instituted in the overwhelming majority of urban businesses. The nation's funds for old-age pensions, shared by the state, employers and employees, now total 30 billion yuan a year, he said. He said that most provinces in China have begun to institute an unemployment relief system, considered an urgent reform measure. Under that system, enterprises withhold 0.6 to one percent of their employees' wages as mutual-assistance unemployment insurance funds. As a result, the country can use 900 million yuan in such funds annually to assist workers who have lost their jobs, he said. He also acknowledged that the reform of the medical insurance system is the "most difficult" task and is still in the experimental stage. Nationwide, the bulk of medical costs for most urban workers are now still covered by their work units. In a change from the past practice, however, workers now have to cover a portion of their medical costs -- ranging from five percent to 20 percent. The official said that the distribution of unemployment relief funds has begun. For example, such funds were granted to 900,000 unemployed workers in 1993. Insurance agencies attached to government labor departments will give such funds to jobless workers in line with internationally accepted practices. Furthermore, they will train such workers and help them find new jobs. To date, China has set up 2,200 training centers and 9,700 job placement agencies, he said. Medical insurance costs are set to be shared by the state, work units and employees, he said. With the implementation of the wage reform and the increase in wages, the ratio of medical costs to be covered by individuals is expected to rise gradually, he added. According to the official, this year China will try to expand the coverage of social security to all urban workers and to improve the functions of social security departments. Following the revision, the labor law drafted by the Labor Ministry and other central departments will be submitted to the National People's Congress for approval, he said. The drafting of China's social security law is well under way, he added.
