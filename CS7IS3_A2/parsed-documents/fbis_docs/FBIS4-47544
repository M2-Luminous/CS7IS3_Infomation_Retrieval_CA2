I. Dreval; UDC 577.391] [Abstract] The effect of ionizing radiation on protein-lipid liposome complexes with ferrihemoglobin and ferricytochrome C was studied. Vesicular membranes were obtained by extracting phospholipids from chicken egg yolks and exposing the suspension to ultrasound. The ferrihemoglobin was obtained by oxidizing human oxyhemoglobin with potassium ferricyanide and then gel-filtrating it on a G-25 molselect. The ferrihemoglobin and the ferricytochrome C were bound to the liposomes using a buffer and gel-filtrated on a G-200 sephadex. Protein concentration was registered on a SF-46 spectrophotometer at 750 nm. The concentration of peroxidation products was found from their reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid and expressed in terms of MDA (malonic dialdehyde) concentration per 1 mg of membrane lipid. Irradiation was performed on a linear accelerator with an electron energy of 5 MeV at doses of 10, 50, 100, 1000, 5,000, and 10,000 gR. The data obtained were processed using Student's t-statistic and the correlation coefficient, r, on an Iskra-1030 computer. It was found that the irradiation reduced Soret band intensity, a finding that is consistent with previous data, and induced structural changes in the proteins. Calculations performed for the binding constant, binding locations, and change in free energy revealed that the irradiation induced peroxidation of the lipids in the liposomes and altered the structure of the ferrihemoglobin, causing instability in the protein-lipid interactions. It was theorized that the lipid component plays a key role in this instability. Figures 2, tables 1; references 22: 17 Russian, 5 Western.
