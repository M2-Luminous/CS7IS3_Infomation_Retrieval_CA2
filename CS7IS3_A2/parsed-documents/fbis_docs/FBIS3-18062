It appears that Italy finally has the opportunity to become a mature democracy, with an electoral system that makes it possible for one homogeneous coalition to govern while enabling another to fulfill the role of a credible opposition and -- at the next election-- to become a possible alternative. One can therefore -- and one should -- speak openly about government programs, because it will ultimately be the nation -- and no longer the SpA [private corporation] of the party secretaries -- that will make the decisions. In this connection I feel it is essential to introduce foreign policy issues into the debate, not only because of my official responsibility (that of encouraging discussion of Italian foreign policy and possibly reaching a consensus), but also -- and above all -- because despite the fact that the international dimension is becoming increasingly important to the well-being of our country, discussion of this subject has heretofore been imprecise and totally inadequate to the task of making the great decisions that lie ahead of us. In particular, Italy must decide whether to stay the course on which it has already embarked -- that of fulfilling its responsibilities and making its contribution to the construction and maintenance of a "new world order" -- or to change course in the direction of an improbable unilateralism (as the right would wish) or an imprudent neutralism (as some on the left would wish). The various forces that aspire to govern the nation should therefore propose explicit solutions to these dilemmas and discuss their proposals among themselves in an effort to reach an appropriate consensus in this regard. I believe that a stable and well-ordered international environment is undeniably necessary if we are to successfully exploit the great opportunities opened up by the defeat of the Soviet threat. If abandoned to anarchy, the great processes that could finally bring us a universal family of nations -- in which war would be a rare exception rather than the rule -- might instead break down, with disastrous consequences for those concerned and for the entire world community. 1. The development of democracy and of the free market has enabled many countries to be emancipated in terms of their freedom and well-being. It has, however, also increased the vulnerability of modern and complex societies to transnational processes over which the individual governments have little control (narcotics, terrorism, migrations, economic crises, and the environment). 2. The integrative forces of the markets have given rise to a welcome integration (and consequent rationalization) of diverse economies whereby even industrialized countries are united with developing countries, as in the case of NAFTA. If, however, this process is not supported by a parallel development of the global economy through the GATT, it could lead to a harmful division of the world into spheres of mutually antagonistic economic powers -- a situation that would have a potentially counterproductive impact on the world economy as well as dangerous political repercussions and the inevitable exclusion of the poorer countries. 3. Because it serves as an important instrument for mobilization and socialization, the rediscovery of national identity has revitalized many countries that were formerly enslaved by dictatorship and poverty. An exacerbated nationalism, however, could lead (and in some cases has already led) to intolerant and discriminatory political practices that have consequences of a manifestly conflictual nature. This is especially true in the youngest democracies (such as those created following the collapse of the communist empire), in which the actual capacity for reform is not adequate to fulfill the ever growing expectations of societies that have been waiting all too long. 4. Lastly, it is undeniable that nuclear weapons -- despite their diabolical capacity for destruction -- had a stabilizing effect on relations among great powers, because governments found the very possession of such weapons to be reassuring. The proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction, however, threatens to upset this process. If even weak, illegitimate, paranoid, vulnerable, and nonsocialized governments within the family of nations are able to possess the immense power of nuclear weapons, then international order cannot prevail and we shall all lapse into an anarchic nightmare in which any megalomaniac dictator will be able to keep the entire international community at bay. An international order capable of ensuring that these processes will not break down is therefore a basic prerequisite for bringing prosperity and peace to the people. It is accordingly in our interest -- and it is also our duty -- to contribute to the creation of that stability. Italian politicians, however, are not always clear as to the means necessary to make that contribution. A generic profession of faith in the international organization that is currently most favored or most in vogue will not suffice. International organizations are in fact not sufficiently developed to solve -- by themselves -- the problems confronting us, although governments often make them scapegoats in an effort to avoid their own responsibilities. International organizations do in fact play an essential role, in that they provide the individual nations with a forum for making collective decisions -- thereby legitimizing possible international action -- but they do not affect the implementation of such decisions, which today -- rightly or wrongly -- is the responsibility of individual governments. Only individual governments (especially the democratic governments) can decide whether the lives of their soldiers should be put at risk. The international organizations -- such as the UN and the CSCE -- have therefore not eroded the sovereignty of individual states sufficiently to be able to develop their own independent means for implementing decisions. Proof of this is the fact that these organizations have been unable to equip themselves with the decisionmaking mechanisms that would overcome the one state, one vote rule (which in the case of the CSCE is actually one state, one veto) so that the actions taken by these organizations could be more in accordance with the relative proportions of the individual contributions made to their common goal. Moreover, even when the international organizations are not stymied by the obstructionism of one or more states that are driven by selfish and unilateral motivations, they can sometimes be genuinely hesitant when they have to base their action on contradictory principles: for example, having to choose between the principle of the inviolability of national borders and the principle of the self-determination of peoples. You cannot, therefore, have a clear conscience merely by declaring that you are in favor of action by the UN if you are not prepared to pay the physical and moral costs of carrying out that action and are not prepared to carry out strong political intervention if the UN organization in question is stalemated. Italy cannot, of course, accomplish this unilaterally, but the De Gasperian perception of an Italy that is European and Western -- a perception that many would like to disregard now that the Berlin Wall has fallen -- takes on renewed significance in this context. Only the European and Atlantic West has the resources necessary to support the decisions of the international community; and only the European and Atlantic West is motivated by political objectives that a great part of the world recognizes as appropriate, that is to say, the consolidation of democracy and freedom. The anti-Western and Third World interpretation of the purpose of the UN -- an interpretation shared by much of the Italian left (which is still operating in accordance with the models of the Cold War) -- disregards the identity of interests between the UN and the Western nations and therefore runs counter to the interests both of the UN and of Italy itself, which would be isolated if it followed such a policy. Together with its partners [preceding word in English], Italy must therefore support decisions that will make it possible to carry out the work of the international organizations. First of all, this means maintaining national unity (the constituent parts of a confederation would in fact be too weak to make their point of view prevail in the international arena) and taking a decisive stand in favor of the creation of a European Union that would have the political capacity to mobilize the resources it needs to contribute -- together with its allies -- to the construction of a new world order. Second, this means accepting responsibilities, and not all of the would-be government leaders have been explicit on this subject. We live in an imperfect world that has been rendered even more imperfect by the uncertainties of the transition through which we are passing. If we wish to make our contribution to the kind of world order that would be capable of defending our interests, promoting peace and development, and complying with our vision of justice, we must have a clear understanding of the bold effort necessary to meet these responsibilities. Indeed, not only must we prepare to defend ourselves from an unlikely direct threat; we must also be ready -- in terms of material and moral resources -- to intervene in areas of the world where human and civil rights are violated, in confirmation of the right to carry out humanitarian intervention with the aim of protecting all human beings, even those who have had the misfortune to be born in the wrong country. If we wish to reassure all peoples and guarantee them the stability necessary for their development, we must be available to intervene in difficult situations by all means necessary (including military means, just as the police ensure public order within the individual states), with all the risks that this entails. We must therefore be ready to defend our interests (as was the case during the Cold War) and to carry out the UN's humanitarian missions (as in Somalia and Mozambique). We must also, however, be prepared to cope with situations which -- although risky in military terms -- do not affect our vital interests in a way that would make the need for intervention self-evident. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall we have twice found ourselves in a similar situation: in the Gulf and in Bosnia. The Gulf War demonstrated that such interventions by the international community are possible, and Bosnia has demonstrated that they are not easy to carry out. These problems are of the greatest importance, inasmuch as they involve our nation's security for the next generation. It is therefore worthwhile for the various political forces to let the Italian people know their views on these questions even before the elections, in order to give our citizens the opportunity to base their vote on these opinions concerning such important issues, among others. From this standpoint, the newborn Pact for Italy's decision to exclude the MSI [Italian Social Movement] forces of the right -- who have always been opposed to the concept of a Western-oriented Italy -- is, I believe, a wise one, as well as its wait-and-see attitude toward the Lega, some of whose representatives seem to be calling for an Italy divided into three parts that would not be equal to the tasks that I have discussed. As for the other side of the political spectrum, I believe the Left may have difficulty expressing itself in a coherent manner. Whereas the Democratic Alliance appears to be ready to discharge these responsibilities, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] seems to me to be more irresolute, midway through its transition from old conditioned reflexes (that led it to oppose the Gulf operation) to a new culture of government. As for the extreme left (Rete, Communist Renewal, and the Greens), it is light years distant from the kind of attitude called for under the current situation. In any case, I do not believe it likely that before the elections the "coalition of the forces of the left" will succeed in resolving these contradictions. If it does, however -- and that would be desirable -- it would be at the cost of a schism within the coalition and a clarifying separation of groups and personalities whose conceptions of the world are not easily reconciled.
