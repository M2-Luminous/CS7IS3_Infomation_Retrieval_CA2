While delaying his trip to Jericho because of his organization's financial difficulties, 'Arafat also asked for speeding up the transfer of 42 million dollars promised in emergency aid, the PLO news agency WAFA said Saturday [18 June]. 'Arafat made the requests in separate talks Friday and Saturday with ambassadors John McCarthy of the United States and Jean-Noel de Bouillane de Lacoste of France as well as with envoys from Greece, Germany and Belgium. The international community has already promised 2.5 billion dollars to help launch Palestinian autonomy, including more than 600 million dollars for this year, but the PLO has complained that donors are hesitant. A Palestinian official said 'Arafat is angry at the slowness in disbursing the 42 million dollars which international donors promised on June 11 in Paris to cover a deficit in the operating budget of the new authority. Self-rule was launched on May 4. A representative of the World Bank involved in the transfer of the sum is in Tunis, but only "for consultation" and "not for handing over the money," the official said. A new meeting of donor nations is planned for July 10-11 in Paris, where the PLO leader is expected on July 6 to receive a prize from UNESCO. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said he told 'Arafat here last Saturday that the PLO leader should be patient while ways are found to make sure the money is not wasted.
