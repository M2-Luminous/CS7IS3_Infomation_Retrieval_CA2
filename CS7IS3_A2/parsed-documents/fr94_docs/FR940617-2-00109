FR940617-2-00109 FR940617-2-00068 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC_466] Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to Minority Health Professions Foundation Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announce the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for a sole source cooperative agreement with the Minority Health Professions Foundation (MHPF) and its member institutions to assist them in expanding and enhancing their educational and research opportunities for minorities and disadvantaged students. Approximately $1,000,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund the Minority Health Professions Foundation. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 29, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to five years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to continue assisting the MHPF Institutions to: (1) increase the number of minority health professionals in public health; (2) improve the health status for minority and disadvantaged persons; (3) expand health services to underserved populations; (4) increase research in minority health; and (5) enhance both didactic curricula and practical experience for students at the member institutions and strengthen the curricula of the school. Students will be better prepared to improve the health status of minorities and disadvantaged people and be more focused as a centralized group of minority health professionals to implement the strategies for health promotion/disease prevention. Further, this will encourage public health research among investigators at all member institutions of the MHPF. The CDC will: (1) Collaborate with MHPF and member institutions in expanding the opportunities for faculty, staff and students for field experience in environmental and occupational health, and preventive medicine public health; (2) Collaborate with MHPF to help identify research issues that its member institutions are uniquely able to investigate related to the ``Healthy People 2000'' National Health Objectives; (3) Assist the MHPF with the activities of member medical, dental, pharmacy and veterinary medical schools in strengthening their research infrastructure; (4) Assist the MHPF in working with medical, dental, pharmacy, and veterinary medical schools and public health agencies in strengthening instruction in the theory and practice of disease prevention and health promotion; (5) Provide technical assistance to MHPF in developing, coordinating, and distributing, and evaluating instructional materials for preventive practices and clinical preventive services; (6) Provide technical assistance to MHPF in (i) the publication of a professional journal, (ii) the distribution of information on graduate programs in public health, and (iii) recruitment of professionals, especially those who represent minority groups; (7) Assist the MHPF in information exchange through conferences and workshops on instruction, practice, and research in environmental, medical, and public health objectives listed in ``Healthy People 2000''; and (8) Collaborate with MHPF in the implementation of the program activities under this agreement. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Educational and Community-Based Health Programs and Clinical Preventive Services.
