In talks with the British minister for overseas development, Lynda Chalker, held today at State House in Dar es Salaam, President Mwinyi said Tanzania wanted to assure the world that it was capable of taking essential measures in tax collection by means of firm steps and of controlling expenditure. For her part, the British minister said she was encouraged by the measures taken by the government aimed at consolidating the country's economy, but said the results of these decisions were being awaited. She said the British Government wanted to extend technical assistance to Tanzania in the major sectors of customs duty and tax collection as an indication of cooperation, and to support measures which the government was determined to undertake. Minister Chalker commended President Mwinyi and his leadership for peacefully undertaking steps towards a multiparty system. She said the international community was pleased with the successes of Tanzania in the political field, and that it was a good example, worthy of being emulated by other African states.
