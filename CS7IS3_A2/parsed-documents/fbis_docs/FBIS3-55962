Some of its points are ill-thought, Shokhin told Interfax. He described as ill-conceived the decision to scrap the post of Vice Premier for trade cooperation with CIS states given that they introduced similar posts following Moscow's suit. Shokhin says this is a sudden diversion from the scheme that Russia has itself introduced. Attempts to try to saddle the First Vice Premier with that duty in addition to his responsibility for areas of the economy, finances and other macroeconomic matters is tantamount to pushing CIS cooperation into the background which is unacceptable, he said. Shokhin said that though the Vice Premiers were at odds about the pace of CIS integration, the possibility of letting Yeltsin and his Prime Minister know about them would no longer exist. Nor is it clear, he said, why the Russian agency for international cooperation and development is to be merged with the ministry for foreign economic relations as a government body. Shokhin said he would seek the repeal of the decree's point on the agency and a new resolution on that body designed to attract foreign investment. He does not rule out being offered a Vice Premiership for agrarian or social matters in the new government. However, he says Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Yuriy Yarov, Yegor Gaydar and Oleg Soskovets responsible for agriculture, social security, economics and industry respectively may retain their jobs. Shokhin believes other changes may take place if First Vice Premier Vladimir Shumeyko fails to be elected as Speaker of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament. It is most likely that new appointments will announced piecemeal rather than in a matter of one day, he said.
