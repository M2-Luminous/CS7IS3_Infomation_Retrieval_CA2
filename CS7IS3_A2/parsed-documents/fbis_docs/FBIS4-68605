Yakovlev: "The New Yak-77 Model"] [Text] The economic reforms and privatization under way in the country and the appearance of numerous nonstate enterprises and organizations resulting from these processes require new approaches to air transport problems. Our traditional system of air transport does not fully meet the specific demand for air service that is emerging. The inflexible scheduling and insufficient frequency of flights and the fairly low level of service create considerable inconvenience. This has a particular effect on businessmen from other countries because it forces them to look for alternative routes for trips or to ship cargoes. Lately we have observed the emergence of numerous airlines which do not make regular, but occasional (charter) flights. However, the opportunities to select the most suitable aircraft for such flights are extremely limited: there are no aircraft of the appropriate class in the country today. The Yak-40 is utilized most often in the business version at present. There is no question that the aircraft is reliable and quite comfortable in versions with a "cabin" configuration. But strictly speaking, the Yak-40 is an aircraft intended for an entirely different purpose. And the main features it lacks for business flights are speed and range. Taking this into account, work has been under way at the OKB imeni A.S. Yakovlev to study the potential market for business-class aircraft. As a result of research, we have determined the appearance of a prospective aircraft which has been given the designation Yak-77. The basic characteristic of the new aircraft which determines practically all its remaining parameters is its range of nonstop flight. A somewhat unusual path was taken in selecting the latter. Study of the typical routes within Russia and abroad--to the CIS countries, Europe, and Asia--showed that an aircraft for this purpose should have a range of no less than 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers with six passengers on board. We know that domestic industry is not producing engines suitable for the aircraft planned. Although work on such an engine with a thrust of 4,000 to 5,000 metric tons has already been begun at the "Soyuz" Design Bureau under the supervision of V.K. Kobchenko. However, new domestic engines will not be making their appearance soon. We had to turn our eyes to the West. They have units of the dimensions and thrust needed here. Only we must pay for them with dollars. Will we find many here who are willing and able to pay for them? How do we proceed? We settled on what in our view is the best possible alternative: develop and sell the aircraft with imported engines installed in it in other countries to start with. And utilize the foreign exchange acquired in this way to purchase additional foreign engines. And install them in the aircraft offered to Russian consumers at acceptable prices. It is no secret that it is very hard to sell a business-class aircraft abroad. First of all, the market for this kind of aircraft is quite limited and it was divided up among producers a long time ago. Secondly, it must be confessed that the reputation of our aviation industry is far from good. First of all because of its inability to reliably supply spare parts and other technical service for the aircraft it turns out. For this reason, entering the market to sell something similar to aircraft which have already proved themselves, such as the "Gulfstream" or the "Falcon," is an undertaking with hardly any prospects. We needed to find something which potential competitors are not in a position to offer at present. In our case, we counted on development of a business aircraft with a range of 10,000 kilometers or more. From Moscow to Los Angeles, for example. There is nothing like it in the world yet. Afterward everything was relatively simple: the payload of six passengers and the range were determined by the takeoff weight and the required thrust of the engines. Calculations showed that a flight of 10,000 kilometers at a cruising speed of 800 kilometers per hour would take over 12 hours. Such a lengthy flight requires very careful study to provide comfortable conditions for the passengers and crew. As apparent from the configuration diagram of the Yak-77, its passenger cabin is quite large. It has "a great deal of air." The height of the ceiling makes it possible for even the tallest passengers to stretch their legs and walk about the cabin. There is a compartment with a sofa for the crew (three pilots, incidentally) to rest. The specific nature of a long-range business aircraft also determines the approaches to selection of the on-board equipment complex. The important factor here is the high degree of automation; navigation support when flying over extensive unpopulated areas (water or ice); advanced radio communications; and redundancy of the main systems of vital importance. It is planned to determine the composition and types of on-board systems more specifically with participation by the aircraft's buyers. The OKB is prepared to provide the aircraft with domestic as well as foreign equipment. It is planned to complete work on development of the Yak-77 and its testing and to obtain an airworthiness certificate no later than 1997. Our venerable competitors intend to have their new aircraft ready by this time. I am referring to the three most prestigious manufacturers of business-class aircraft: the Gulfstream firm (United States) with the "Gulfstream-U," Dassault (France) with the "Falcon-9000," and Bombardier (Canada) with the "Global Express." It is very hard to compete with such "opponents." Our advantages may be only the shorter production periods and comparatively lower price. But in order to lower the price of the Yak-77, we must produce it in a large series in addition to everything else. We have a unique opportunity in this respect. Because as already pointed out, the dimensions of the Yak-77 fuselage are unusually large for a business-class aircraft. It makes it possible to install 32 standard seats in the cabin when necessary. And then it will not be necessary to reeinforce the construction or change the engines, inasmuch as the takeoff weight will be unchanged. We know that a higher payload means a reduction of the amount of fuel in the aircraft. But even under these circumstances the Yak-77's range with 32 passengers will be more than 5,000 kilometers. In this version it becomes a regional passenger aircraft for scheduled airline routes, according to European standards. Consequently, there may be considerable demand for different configuration arrangements in the Yak-77. Especially as our OKB intends to offer customers two more versions of this aircraft--to seat 50 and 70. With a lengthened fuselage, of course, but with engines of a single type. These are the studies conducted by the OKB A.S. Yakovlev and the Saratov Aircraft Plant on the Yak-77. It remains to be added that its price for foreign customers will be no more than $20 million. This is significantly lower than the price suggested for competitive aircraft. It will be less expensive for Russian customers, and paid for in rubles as well. Before the Yak-77 comes out, which as I noted will be no earlier than 1997, the OKB imeni A.S. Yakovlev is offering an extensive "set" of modifications for the Yak-40 aircraft. Owners of the "forties" will be able to significantly extend their capabilities, including in business-class versions. By increasing the fuel up to 6 metric tons, the Yak-40's range will be increased to 2,000 kilometers. The Smolensk Aircraft Plant is prepared to modify the wings for the increased fuel tank capacity. Another very promising modification, in our view, is provided by replacement of the Yak-40's power plant. The OKB plans to install two LF-507 engines made by the American Textron-Lycoming firm to replace the three AI-25 engines. The aerodynamics of the aircraft are improved and relative fuel consumption is reduced at the same time. It is sufficient to say that the cruising speed of the Yak-40TL [the designation with Textron-Lycoming engines] will be increased by 10 percent and the range with the same fuel will be increased by 25 percent. Operating expenses to maintain the twin-engine version of the Yak-40 are 15 to 20 percent lower than the original version. But if a wing with fuel tanks for 6 metric tons is installed on the aircraft, the Yak-40TL will have a nonstop range of 2,500 kilometers with a payload of 1 metric ton. The on-board equipment may be replaced altogether or individually by more advanced equipment--in any variation at the request of the buyer; the passenger cabin arrangement may be changed in accordance with individual requirements; and imported materials are used in its finishing. In addition, the OKB is prepared to extend the service life of the Yak-40 based on an individual approach in each specific case. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Basic Specifications of the Yak-77 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cabin configuration |business |regional | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Takeoff weight, in kilog-|25,200 | |rams | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Payload mass, in kg |880 |3,500 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Engine takeoff thrust, i-|4,500 each engine | |n kg | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maximum cruising speed, |850 | |in kilometers per hour | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Economy cruising speed, |800 | |in kmh | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cruising altitude, in me-|12,000 | |ters | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Range at maximum speed, |9,000 |4,500 | |in km | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maximum range, in km |10,000 |5,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * * * Address for all questions: Russia, 125315, Moscow, Liza Chaykina Street.
