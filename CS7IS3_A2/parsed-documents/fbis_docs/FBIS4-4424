With a Fukuoka high court ruling on the Minamata lawsuits close at hand, they intended to urge EA Director General Hironaka again to "settle the litigation prior to the ruling" because she was trying to break the deadlocked situation. For example, she has indicated an idea within the government of providing "money as a token of the government's sympathy" to Minamata disease victims. Because Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during his governorship of Kumamoto Prefecture, had asked the central government to conclude an amicable settlement, the plaintiffs expressed great hopes that the central government would change its policy on Minamata disease lawsuits. However, EA Director General Hironaka just repeated: "Now that I have joined the government, it is difficult for me to have things my own way. I am sorry." Throughout court trials, the government has maintained that there were no legal grounds at that time for the government's possessing the authority to control industrial water, and that hence it has no responsibility to compensate the plaintiffs for the failure to prevent the emergence and spread of Minamata disease. The plaintiffs have maintained that the government should be held liable for this. Later, EA Director General Hironaka explained why "she cannot have her own way in dealing with the issue." She said: "While the Ministry of Finance [MOF], which has authority over financial affairs, does not intend to agree on [compensation], the Ministry of Justice, which is in charge of lawsuits, is not saying `yes.' Because the administrative organizations are united, I cannot make a move unless the administration as a whole says `yes.'" Senior Officials Opposed a Proposal Made by a Minister "We should tackle the Nagara River project." It was summer of 1990 when EA Director General Ishimatsu Kitagawa of the second Kaifu cabinet made that proposal during a meeting with senior EA officials, including (then) Administrative Vice Minister Tadashi Yasuhara. [passage omitted on review of the Nagara Dam construction project and residents' opposition to the project] (Then) EA Chief Kitagawa was ready to use the "EA director general's right to issue recommendations" based on the law establishing the EA in a bid to suspend the dam's construction. Senior EA officials, however, unanimously opposed him, saying: "Minister, please set aside your plan." Kitagawa stood isolated and had no choice but to give up his intention. [passage omitted on comment by unidentified official] Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi put his signature to a document opposing the dam's construction three years ago when he was an opposition party member and was regarded as a "dissenter" against the project. When he met with Prime Minister Hosokawa prior to his inspection of the Nagara River at the end of last year, Construction Minister Igarashi made a proposal that an organization be set up within the government to review large-scale public works projects formulated under the Liberal Democratic Party administration. This is as far as he can go. However, the Construction Ministry and the EA "have done nothing" about the proposal since then (as stated by a senior Construction Ministry official). The Government "Delayed in Dealing With" Comfort Women Issue An MOF division chief stated: "If we do not do our best, the ideal picture of the state cannot be maintained." However, it may be said that such a self-conceit has led to bureaucrats' having the following view: "There are no mistakes in our work." And, as a result of being hung up about the practice of making no mistakes, bureaucrats may see their greatest value as "maintaining order" by adjusting their policies to past policies and existing laws. Their obstinacy sometimes delays a political decision and this aggravates the situation. In December 1991, former Korean comfort women [who were forced to serve as prostitutes during World War II] filed lawsuits against the Japanese Government for compensation. This resulted in a major issue pending between Japan and South Korea of how far the former Japanese Imperial Army was involved in collecting and controlling comfort women. The issue concerns Japan's shameful acts. Originally, the government stated that it was unable to "confirm the incident" under the pretext that there were no documents which would provide evidence. Nevertheless, "documents" were found one after another by researchers. [passage omitted on statements by former chief cabinet secretaries on the comfort women issue] Before the Japanese Government admitted the fact that the Japanese Imperial Army forced Korean women to serve as prostitutes, the government gave the impression that it was compelled to make efforts to deal with the issue under pressure. [passage omitted on a statement by a South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman and an editorial on Korean paper TONG-A ILBO] "Bureaucrats Are of Good Quality But Take a Narrow View of Things "Is the Diet the supreme organization of state power?" Mr. Masaharu Gotoda, who became a politician after serving as commissioner-general for the National Police Agency and deputy chief cabinet secretary, is now writing a book on the theme of "politics and bureaucrats." Mr. Gotoda intends to put the above question, which concerns Article 41 of the Constitution, in the introduction of his book, and intends to discuss how relations between politicians and bureaucrats ought to be. He said: "It goes without saying that government officials are well-intentioned people and are of good quality. However, they see the world only from the viewpoint of a government office. It is politics that makes the final decision. If government officials take an attitude of sticking to one direction, they go to extremes."
