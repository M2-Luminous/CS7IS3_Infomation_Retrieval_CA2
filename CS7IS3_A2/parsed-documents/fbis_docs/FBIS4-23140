The MPLA-PT, as in the past, has directed its murderous fury on civilian wards. Our correspondent Lourenco Bento says not even National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiators' houses were spared. The house of UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, who is currently in Lusaka, was destroyed yesterday. His family escaped unhurt. At present, crying can be heard everywhere. The hospitals are unable to cope with the increasing number of wounded people and face a shortage of medicines.
