The economic regeneration taking place in the developing world, specially in Asia is giving the West a bit of its own medicine. Their products have been overselling the West's, thanks to their competitiveness. Western economies under the spell of a major recession, have been attempting to look outward for enhanced trade to narrow their trade deficit. Consequently, a great deal of effort was put into resolving the stalemate that Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had come to. But while they wanted to pry foreign markets open, they were anxious also to insulate their own economies from the growing competition that newly industrialised countries were giving them. A policy of "managed trade" was resorted to. It was throughly discredited as was witnessed in the case of US-Japan trade talk. The American demand for quantitative targets for imports by Japan backfired. A more subtle tool is being used now. Developed economies today are busy laying the ideological foundation for "social", non-tariff barriers to trade. As more and more developing economies modernise, industrialise, and compete in a wide range of markets with the developed indusrtrial economies, two centuries of inter-country comparative advantages are going haywire. This turning of the table on the developed world, is only in part due to the lower wages in developing world. But the West has made "labour welfare", its major plank for criticism. The Uruguay Round of GATT is to be formally adopted in Morocco by the end of April this year. Although the Dunkel proposals for resolving the deadlocked was approved by all members, the US supported by such countries as France has made it known that, the social clause would be legal ground enough to ban import of products from the developing economies. The US has contended that low wages in the developed world gives an artificial advantage to their products which amounts to "social dumping" in the developed world. This move is extremely distressing. The G-7, especially the US and the European Union are pushing developing countries to see how far they will go in accomodating the former's protectionist moves. The inclusion of environmental protectionism, "green barriers to trade" and the threat of countering "social dumping" by banning products produced by cheap labour are the latest weapons in their arsenals. But all these aim at undoing the gains of the Uruguay Round. Such attempts by the West are not new. For over two years Western governments have been linking political, especailly human rights and environmental issues to economic relations with the developing economies. Developing world leaders have reacted sharply to the above moves. Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao made a hard-hitting speech at the G-15 summit in New Delhi against the unilateral interpretation of some of the provisions of the GATT against the interests of the developing countries. He cautioned the advanced economies against putting up artificial barriers to free trade. The Malaysian prime minister, Mahatir Mohammad, speaking in a similar vein criticised the West for resorting to measures detrimental to the interests of the developing countries. He urged all developing countries to come together to oppose the "social clause". It is in this context that the final agreement in April on GATT, will be taken.
