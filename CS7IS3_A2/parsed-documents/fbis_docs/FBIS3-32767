According to the minister, the two countries are no longer working on the basis that the law will be approved by 28 February, the date with which the United States is working to decide whether it begins a policy of retaliation. Amorim on 7 February met in Itamaraty with Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas; Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Minister Elcio Alvares; and Culture Minister Luis Roberto do Mascimento e Silva. Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, president of the Industrial Property National Institute (INPI [Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial]); Paulo Tarso Flecha, ambassador to Washington; and his colleague, Jose Arthur Denot Madeiros, who last week headed a meeting with the U.S. Government. The meeting was held on 6 February in order to discuss government ideas regarding the topics discussed in Washington. The foreign minister's evaluation indicates that the meeting with the North Americans was a failure. "There was progress in the aspect of wanting to reach an agreement regarding the points that merit a more profound study," he said. Amorim said it would be "easy" to say that there is not a risk that sanctions will be applied, but he considers as "reasonable" the expectation that the United States will close the case on 28 February. The minister is still considering whether he will travel to Washington to give the negotiations a political jolt. According to one of the participants in yesterday's meeting, it will be difficult to reach an agreement between the two countries. The points of disagreement surpass the points on which there is agreement. During a news conference on 7 February, the minister himself cited just one point that the two countries have in common: The computer program software [preceding word in English] must be protect by authorship rights like literary works. The major disagreement lies in the fact that the text concerning intellectual property contained in the GATT's Uruguayan Round Accord, which closed in December, is ambiguous" [no beginning quotation mark as published]. Thus, for example, Brazil understands that the GATT's text considers that a patent can only be exploited when the product is manufactured locally. But the United States feels the opposite -- that the patent can be exploited through imports without the obligation of manufacturing the product patented in the country. Another disagreement refers to parallel imports: The United States wants the patent holder to have the right to block parallel imports, in other words, those imports that are made without the authorization of the patent holder. The Uruguay Round Accord does not mention this point, but the amendment the Brazilian Government intends to send to the Senate restricts the scope of the type of patent protection the United States wants because parallel imports would only be possible between member countries of a common market or based on international agreements such as Mercosur. This means, for example, that a person in Argentina who has the license for a product with the patent holder living in the United States could supply the product in a parallel form to Brazil without the patent holder's direct authorization. There is also disagreement regarding the "pipeline" [preceding word in English], or transitory protection. The United States wants a "pipeline" [preceding word in English] that protects products already patented in other countries and already being commercialized for the same period of time for which the products are patented in the country of origin. The government is going to suggest an amendment to Draft Law No. 115/93 that will authorize the protection of the "pipeline" [preceding word in English] only for those patents that have been registered abroad, but not for products that already are being commercialized. The Uruguayan Round text does not clearly define the state of microorganisms and living beings, but the United States considers that they should be patentable, giving as examples the super tomato that has been developed in a laboratory and the Harvard University rat that has been genetically altered [rato transgenico de Harvard], which is used to test products against mammary cancer. The draft bill indicates that Brazil's position is that of granting a patent only for microorganisms (not living beings) that are used in industrial processes. The Brazilian Government is trying to close the gap between the two countries' positions. Ambassador Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima will continue to be Brazil's contact with the U.S. Government. He departed for Washington on 7 February. Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PA [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Para State]) is the new rapporteur for the industrial property draft bill. He will try to present his argument on 16 February to the Senate's Economic Affairs Committee.
