"Warn the Estonian Government that even if a hair should fall from the head of the representative of Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Pyotr Rozhok, the Estonian Government will have to think about the fate of 900,000 Estonians," Zhirinovsky told a BNS correspondent today. "I swap one Rozhok for 900,000 Estonians," he said when asked to comment on charges brought against the representative of his party in Estonia. Rozhok has been charged for instigating inter-ethnic hostility. "If Rozhok is put into an Estonian jail, end will come to Estonia and Tallinn. We will implement such measures that the Estonians will forget that they are Estonians," Zhirinovsky said without hiding his emotion, then turning his back to the BNS correspondent. The extremist leader's remarks were hailed by the group accompanying him.
