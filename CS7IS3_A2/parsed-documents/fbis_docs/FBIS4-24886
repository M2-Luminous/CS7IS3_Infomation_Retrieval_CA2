The diehards insist that the massacre was "reasonable." This finds full expression in their analysis of and conclusions on the causes of the 1989 "turmoil." In mid-December 1993, a discussion meeting was held by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee to review and sum up the causes of the political "turmoil" in 1989. Also attending the meeting were such institutions as the Policy Research Office of the CPC Central Committee, the Policy Research Office of the State Council, the Policy Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the International Relations Research Institute, and the Information Institute of the Ministry of Public Security. The subjects discussed at the meeting included the main causes of the evolution of the "political turmoil" in 1989, the current unstable factors inside the country, and their relationship with external factors. The meeting also drew conclusions on the serious deviations of bureaucratism and rightism in the party's work. The material on the meeting, although a bit out of date, remains useful for reference. When reviewing the main causes of the 1989 political turmoil, the meeting enumerated six points. First, it was correct that the party focused its work on economic construction, but the party neglected the existence of the hostile forces in society, which continued to organize activities with the support of certain external forces from 1984. Second, from the central to local levels, the party leaders neglected the existence of the ideological struggle between the right and the wrong; and for a certain period, neglected and even negated the existence of the ideological trend to oppose the "four cardinal principles" inside the party. Third, a number of bureaucratic and corrupt elements inside the party and government leading organs violated and disrupted the party's established principles and policies, and thus harmed the relationship between the party and the masses. Fourth, a considerable number of party organizations gave up political and ideological studies and did not properly consolidate themselves. After criticizing and correcting the previous ultraleftist line of putting politics in command, they slipped into the rightist deviation of regarding political and ideological work as useless. So they were bogged down in a helpless position and became panic-stricken when the turmoil occurred. Fifth, some people inside the party neglected the fact of the U.S. hegemonists' nature and basic strategy of subverting, infiltrating, and interfering in socialist China; and they even neglected the fact that the United States had never stopped its ideological infiltration aimed at effecting peaceful evolution in China. Sixth, some party leaders tried to split the party, and they used the turmoil and the party's lack of preparation against the turmoil to divert people's attention from the serious mistakes in their work and style. They even did not scruple to split the party and support the turmoil. Only the third of the above-mentioned six points is somewhat pertinent. This showed that the diehards inside the CPC did not have any guilty conscience for the social unrest in 1989 and the 4 June massacre; on the contrary, they just put the blame on the so-called "hostile forces," "hegemonists," and "splittists" (referring to Zhao Ziyang). How ridiculous this is! They also summed up four external factors: First, the hostile elements inside and outside the country and inside and outside the party made use of the problems in the implementation of the party's line in the realm of superstructure and the rightist deviation of the party leadership to create public opinion against the party's leadership and against socialism. Second, the hegemonist forces and power politics represented by the United States used the opportunity of China's concentrating on economic construction to instigate, abet, and support domestic hostile forces to stir up trouble and create turmoil in order to overthrow the current socialist system, to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and to make China follow the system of the United States. Third, the Western mass media continued their habitual practice of cooking up rumors and creating sensational events in their anti-China and anticommunist propaganda so that they played a role in adding fuel to the flames and aggravating the seriousness of the events. Fourth, hostile elements in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas areas took advantage of the turmoil to create sensational news, thus instigating people who were not aware of the true facts to donate money in order to achieve their anti-China and anticommunist purpose and to aggravate the turmoil in China. The so-called "external factors" were also based on the stereotypical "class analysis" method and "class struggle" theory. They did not mention the actual and important external factor. That is, in the contemporary world, democracy has become a historical trend, and the autocratic system is at its last gasp. Why did the CPC authorities not dare to face this reality squarely? The meeting pointed out the unstable factors and the possibilities inside China: First, the rightist deviation still existed in the thinking and routine work of some party organizations in terms of being alert to the activities of hostile forces and their destructive effects. Second, the bureaucratic style of work of some party and government institutions produced very bad effects among the masses, and the relationship between the party and the masses had yet to be further improved by initiatives taken by the party. Third, although corruption and abuse of power among party and government cadres were rectified to a certain degree, the state of affairs was not improved to the degree of winning trust and support from the masses. Fourth, the price hikes aroused discontent among cadres and the masses, who hoped to improve their living conditions. Fifth, there were difficulties in the implementation of the rural and agricultural policies; and local leaders had certain wrong ideas about the rural work and the issues concerning the peasants. This led to certain problems in the rural work. Sixth, the exodus of the rural population and the increasing jobless population in society added pressure to society as a whole and caused problems in law and order. Seventh, although the hostile forces in society did not act as flagrantly as before, they were still carrying out seditious activities by making use of the errors of local party organizations and local governments in the implementation of the policies and in their routine work. Eighth, the local party and government institutions did not correctly understand and effectively carry out the policies and principles laid down by the central authorities; some local leaders made mistakes in the course of carrying out the policies and produced negative effects among the masses. It seemed that the discussion meeting came to recognize some problems in reality only in the last part of its agenda, but it still adopted some improper and extremely erroneous approaches, such as criticizing the "rightist deviation." The criticism of the "rightist deviation" just showed the leftist deviation of the meeting's participants. The conclusions of the meeting were, on the whole, the product of leftism, and were used as the "ideological grounds" for further suppressing the pro-democracy movement.
