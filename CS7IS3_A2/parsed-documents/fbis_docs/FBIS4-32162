The MSZP won 209 of the total 386 seats in the recent elections, while the SZDSZ took 69. It is almost certain that in the coalition, or as the parties themselves define it, "common government," MSZP President Gyula Horn will be appointed prime minister. Gabor Kuncze, SZDSZ parliamentary party leader and prime ministerial candidate, will fill the newly created post of "coalition deputy prime minister." However, according to the Constitution law, it is not the coalition deputy prime minister who will replace the prime minister in the case of his absence, but the minister of finance and economy, Laszlo Bekesi. The new, re-structured Ministry of Finance and Economy will have increased responsibilities compared to the present Ministry of Finance. The privatisation process may also be managed by Bekesi, dubbed the MSZP's "economics guru." Bekesi was responsible for the party's economic manifesto and was finance minister in the Nemeth government of 1988-89. Of the ministries, Gabor Kuncze is likely to head the Ministry of Interior, and another SZDSZ member, Gabor Fodor, the Ministry of Culture and Education. A Socialist politician is expected to head the Ministry of Labour. The Ministry of International Economic Relations will be integrated with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, where the minister is expected to be Socialist politician Laszlo Pal. His name has also been mentioned as the possible head of a unified State Property Agency (SPA)-State Holding Company (AV Rt). An SZDSZ politician is expected to head the Ministry of Infrastructure, which will be formed from the Ministry of Transport, Telecommunications and Water Management. The minister of justice is also expected to be appointed from the SZDSZ, although according to some sources the SZDSZ is seeking to exchange this portfolio for the Speaker of Parliament. The Socialists' candidate for speaker is Zoltan Gal. If he is appointed, then the deputy speaker(s) may be Alajos Dornbach from the SZDSZ, and/or Peter Boross, the outgoing prime minister. Since the SZDSZ has refused the defence portfolio offered by the Socialists, this position is also expected to be filled by the MSZP. Pal Kovacs and Laszlo Kovacs, both MSZP, are expected to head the Ministry of Welfare and the Foreign Ministry repectively. The minister of agriculture is also expected to be an MSZP politician, Laszlo Lakos. Two candidates, Gyorgy Keleti (MSZP) and Imre Mecs (SZDSZ) are running for the post of the minister of defence. The head of the environmental protection portfolio is expected to be former Expo commissioner Etele Barath. The number of ministers without portfolio is expected to be reduced to 1 or 2, and the present internal structure of the ministries maintained. The arrangement of public administration state secretaries, who organise political and professional activities of the ministries, will also remain. However, the state secretary positions remain an area of dispute, the question being whether or not the secretary should be from the same party as the minister.
