According to the charges, the police chief has allegedly supported a lucrative drug trade between Colombia and the United States, through Haiti. Gabriel Taboana, a former Colombian drug trafficker, asserted before the Drug Trafficking and Terrorism Subcommission that he met Michel Francois during a meeting with Pablo Escoblar in (?Colombia). Former Haitian President Prosper Avril also participated in that meeting. The source, who wishes to remain anonymous, pointed out that Col. Francois' last trip took place in 1981 before...

Francois in 1984, our source wonders. Remember that upon Col. Francois' return, he was appointed to the Heavy Vehicles Corps of the presidential guard at the National Palace.
