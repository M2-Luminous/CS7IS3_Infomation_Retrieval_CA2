FR940404-0-00004 FR940404-0-00002 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 78 [Docket No. 94&hyph;009&hyph;1] Brucellosis in Cattle; State and Area Classifications; California AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments. SUMMARY: We are amending the brucellosis regulations concerning the interstate movement of cattle by changing the classification of California from Class A to Class Free. We have determined that California meets the standards for Class Free status. This action relieves certain restrictions on the interstate movement of cattle from California. DATES: Interim rule effective April 4, 1994. Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 94&hyph;009&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Michael J. Gilsdorf, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Cattle Diseases and Surveillance Staff, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 729, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;4918. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Brucellosis is a contagious disease affecting animals and man, caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. The brucellosis regulations contained, in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations), provide a system for classifying States or portions of States according to the rate of Brucella infection present, and the general effectiveness of a brucellosis control and eradication program. The classifications are Class Free, Class A, Class B, and Class C. States or areas that do not meet the minimum standards for Class C are required to be placed under Federal quarantine. The brucellosis Class Free classification is based on a finding of no known brucellosis in cattle for the 12 months preceding classification as Class Free. The Class C classification is for States or areas with the highest rate of brucellosis. Class B and Class A fall between these two extremes. Restrictions on moving cattle interstate become less stringent as a State approaches or achieves Class Free status. The standards for the different classifications of States or areas entail maintaining (1) a cattle herd infection rate not to exceed a stated level during 12 consecutive months; (2) a rate of infection in the cattle population (based on the percentage of brucellosis reactors found in the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) program_a program of testing at stockyards, farms, ranches, and slaughter establishments) not to exceed a stated level; (3) a surveillance system that includes testing of dairy herds, participation of all recognized slaughtering establishments in the MCI program, identification and monitoring of herds at high risk of infection (including herds adjacent to infected herds and herds from which infected animals have been sold or received), and having an individual herd plan in effect within a stated number of days after the herd owner is notified of the finding of brucellosis in a herd he or she owns; and (4) minimum procedural standards for administering the program. Before the effective date of this interim rule, California was classified as a Class A State because of its herd infection rate and its MCI reactor prevalence rate. To attain and maintain Class Free status, a State or area must (1) remain free from field strain Brucella abortus infection for 12 consecutive months or longer; (2) maintain for 12 consecutive months an MCI reactor prevalence rate not to exceed one reactor per 2,000 cattle tested (0.050 percent); and (3) have a specified surveillance system, as described above, including an approved individual herd plan in effect within 15 days of locating the source herd or recipient herd. After reviewing the brucellosis program records for California, we have concluded that the State meets the standards for Class Free status. Therefore, we are removing California from the list of Class A States in ยง78.41(b) and adding it to the list of Class Free States in ยง78.41(a). This action relieves certain restrictions on moving cattle interstate from California.
