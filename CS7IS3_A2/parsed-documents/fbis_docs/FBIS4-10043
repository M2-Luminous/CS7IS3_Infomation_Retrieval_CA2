Either of these two affirmations is prejudicial to us because neither is believable, said Robaina, who began an official two-day visit to Uruguay on 4 April within the framework of a South American tour that also includes Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, and Peru. In speaking to the International Affairs Committee of the Uruguayan parliament, Robaina maintained that political changes are associated with systems and that the conditions for such changes do not exist in Cuba today. Robaina cited sovereignty, independence, and the ability to speak with one's own voice as nonnegotiable principles. Unacceptable, too, are any solutions that would mean backsliding in the spheres of education, health, the sciences, and sports. Touching upon the subject of human rights, Robaina stressed that Cuba has an extremely clean past, and he affirmed that the nation can display the very strong reality of not having people disappear, get assassinated, or be tortured.
