On its third day of sessions, the forum will establish contact with the peasant, women, and religious sectors; with community organizations, associations of friendship and solidarity with Cuba; and with intellectuals and artists. Martinez pointed out to PRENSA LATINA the importance of this meeting, which, in his opinion, makes evident the vigor and maturity of the region's new left. He said: The diversity prism that this meeting displays, is giving shape to a new social and revolutionary transformation project that has no traditional conceptual framework, although Marxism is an important component of it. Martinez said that never before had the left had the broad and diversified social setting it has now, with the presence of political forces that include movements of towns people, women, peasants, religious people, and ecologists, among others. With regard to the criticism that regional organizations such as the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Inter-American Development Bank, have made of neoliberal programs, the legislator said that some new economic proposals mean economically acknowledging neoliberalism and at the same time rejecting the inevitable social results of that policy. He said: It is aberrant to consider only the economic face of the neoliberal policy while trying to lessen its negative social consequences. It is like trying to mix oil and vinegar, he said. When asked about the U.S.-sponsored initiative of holding a Pan American summit, Martinez said that in his opinion this is an attempt to counter both the Iberian American summits and the possibility of a high-level Latin American and Caribbean meeting. The Initiative for the Americas is an integrationist design subordinated to U.S. economic plans rather than to Latin American integration. The meeting will conclude tomorrow with reports from the work commission and a probable, and expected, concluding speech by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
