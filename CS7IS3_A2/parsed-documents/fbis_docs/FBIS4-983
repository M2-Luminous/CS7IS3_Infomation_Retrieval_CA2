The really serious business is being conducted on the battlefield in Angola -- where South Africa mercenaries are now fighting in a bizarre change of sides. While the United Nations-brokered negotiations have made some progress, they have failed to reach any agreement that would end the fighting. Neither side has yet reached a point where it would see its interests best served by a political solution. Though ordinary Angolans continue to suffer horribly, neither political party is hurting badly enough to settle. The MPLA at present has the advantage politically through the international support that followed its declared victory in the 1992 election. It is trying now to seize the military advantage as well. UNITA, increasingly friendless in the world, is now dependent on military successes to give it bargaining power in the negotiations or, alternatively, to fulfill what some analysts believe is the continuing ambition of its leader, Jonas Savimbi, for a partition that would give him control of a new republic in the south. Undismayed by their long history of failure to smash UNITA, the hawks in the MPLA see in the present situation yet another chance to win total victory, even without Cuba's help. They are going all out for a military solution, pushing the doves for the moment into the background. The hardliners were emboldened by the United States' decision to recognise the MPLA government and by the international sanctions imposed against UNITA. While the sanctions have made it difficult for UNITA to get munitions and petrol, the MPLA has been spending millions of dollars of its oil revenue on strengthening its armed forces. More than R3,500 million [rand] is reportedly being spent on buying weaponry from Europe, Brazil and China. The Lisbon newspaper O INDEPENDENTE says the MPLA is in addition buying R330 million worth of missiles and armoured assault vehicles from North Korea. According to the London newsletter AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, R140 million of the MPLA's military expenditure has gone on a contract with the Pretoria-based firm Executive Outcomes to help train commando units in counter-insurgency warfare. It is presumably under this contract that the firm has hired the 500 former SADF [South African Defense Force] soldiers who are now reported to be serving with the MPLA in Angola. When the South Africans first appeared on the MPLA side they were said to have been engaged only as security guards to protect strategic points such as the oil installations at Soyo (which has since been captured by UNITA) and Cabinda, and they certainly were once involved in this way. However, some have recently been reported killed in action in areas far removed from known security points. UNITA said, for instance, that 12 South African mercenaries were killed on March 16 in an action in Lunda Norte province, between the Lovige and Luxa rivers, an area far from Soyo or Luanda. This claim, if true, would indicate the involvement of South African mercenaries in the MPLA's current efforts to drive UNITA out of the diamond-mining area of Kafunfo in Lunda Norte. UNITA says the South Africans are also being used in an offensive against Soyo and that in both areas they are using North Korean weapons, among others. It puts the number of South African mercenaries at 2,000, but this could include Angolans who formerly served with the SADF's 32 Battalion and with Koevoet [crowbar; former South-West African police counterinsurgency units] in Namibia. Executive Outcomes' manager, Lafras Luitingh, was recently quoted as saying: "The successes that the government soldiers in Angola have had against UNITA are undoubtedly due to the South Africans who are involved there." He may have been referring to training, but the deaths of the South Africans indicate that they are doing more than that. It seems clear that former SADF soldiers who once fought alongside UNITA against the MPLA and the Cubans are now fighting against UNITA for the MPLA in a combat as well as a training role. In effect, they are doing for the MPLA what the Cubans once did, but on a smaller scale. AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL says the new MPLA commando units, 2,000 men strong, are being used "in a an aggressive strategy, employing long- range reconnaissance and self-sustaining platoons reminiscent of the Rhodesian Selous Scouts'. It might have added that these are equally reminiscent of the SADF Recce units that operated with conspicuous success against the MPLA and Cuban forces in Angola. The MPLA's current offensive appears to have two main objectives in the north: first, to drive UNITA out of the Kafunfo diamond area and so deprive it of what is now its main source of revenue; second, to cut or restrict UNITA's supply lines from Zaire. And in the centre, the aim is to drive UNITA out of Huambo, to where it has moved its capital from its former headquarters in the bush at Jamba near the Caprivi Strip. UNITA's diamond mining and military operations in Lunda Norte province are at present beyond effective range of MPLA aircraft, and to overcome this disadvantage the MPLA has reportedly been improving the airfield at Saurimo. While UNITA is believed to have enough weaponry to wage a guerilla war for several more years, it will find it increasingly difficult to take on the MPLA in conventional warfare or to hold the few cities it now controls. The MPLA probably aims at least to drive its enemy back into the bush, lessening its political clout and its ability to demand concessions in the negotiations. The new commando units might be especially useful at this stage. So far, the MPLA offensive has produced no substantial gains. Nevertheless, UNITA's vulnerability to the MPLA tactics may have been exposed when it made important concessions in the negotiations, beginning with an acceptance of the fact, if not the manner, of its defeat in the 1992 elections. Concessions have been made by both sides in the Lusaka talks, and significant progress has been made on military and political issues. But the MPLA has steadfastly rejected UNITA's demand for the governorship of the provinces in which it won the majority of votes in the election. Since these include the southern provinces of Huambo, Benguela and Cuando Cubango, the MPLA understandably fears that control of them would enable UNITA to secede. Never far from the centre of the negotiations is the old problem of how to fit the ambitious and strong-willed Dr Savimbi into a new dispensation that must inevitably be built around a government dominated by the MPLA. But that, too, will probably have to await the outcome of the struggle now being waged on the battlefield.
