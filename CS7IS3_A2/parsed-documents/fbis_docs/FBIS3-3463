Tian Jiyun, a vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made the remark at a reception given by the General Office of the NPC Standing Committee here today. Attending the reception were ambassadors and diplomatic envoys of relevant foreign countries in Beijing and members of the NPC's 35 groups for the promotion of friendly relations with foreign countries. In his toast, Tian reviewed the NPC's external activities since its first session a year ago. In the past year, the NPC Standing Committee and its specialized committees sent 21 delegations on visits to 49 countries, participated in 26 international and regional conferences and hosted visits to China by 96 foreign parliamentary delegations including 24 speakers and four deputy speakers. "The NPC's external exchanges in the past year were unprecedented in terms of rank, extensiveness and frequency," he said. Activities of the friendship groups are part of the NPC's external contacts, Tian said. So far, the NPC has reorganized and established 35 such groups, and more will be established in the future in response to the wishes of foreign parliaments. The purpose of these groups is to promote understanding and cooperation with the parliaments and peoples of foreign countries, thereby cultivating better state-to-state relations, Tian said. Tian described the current second session of the Eighth NPC as "having been very successful."
