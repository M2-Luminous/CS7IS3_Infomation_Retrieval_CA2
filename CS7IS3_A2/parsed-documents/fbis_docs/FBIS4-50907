The reports commanded broad interest from the participants. Economic experts and entrepreneurs from various countries spoke highly of China's tremendous achievements in reform and opening up, offering many valuable opinions and suggestions for reforming China's economic structure through discussions and replies to relevant questions. The two-day, high-level economic forum concluded at the China World Hotel today. During yesterday's and today's sessions, Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission; Gui Shiyong, vice minister of the State Planning Commission; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation; Finance Minister Liu Zhongli; Chen Yuan, vice president of the People's Bank of China; and Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, reported on the status of and prospects for reforms in their respective fields. Speaking of the strategic ideas for China's enterprise reform, Wang Zhongyu said: In carrying out this reform, we aim to strengthen enterprise-related legislation and place enterprise reform within the legal framework, with the general goal of establishing a socialist market economic structure. We also seek to further improve the system of legal persons in the form of enterprises while carrying out reform of property rights in enterprises, and to further change enterprises' operating mechanisms while following the basic course of instituting a modern enterprise system. We aim to create a favorable external environment for deepening enterprise reform while closely meshing such reform with the efforts to establish a market network, to reform the macroeconomic management system, and to institute a social security system. The ultimate goal of enterprise reform is to make enterprises more dynamic and to improve their economic efficiency as much as possible. After reporting on the substantial progress in reforming the planning and investment structures, Gui Shiyong analyzed the current major problems in the planning and investment structures. He noted: These problems include the failure to fully harness market forces in those economic activities in which market forces should play their roles and enterprises should make decisions independently; some of those activities have even been subject to improper administrative interference. A macroeconomic regulatory and control system, which satisfies market economic demands, has yet to be established, and there is a lack of effective mechanisms based on the combination of various regulatory and control means. New functions, contents, and methods of planning have yet to be explored, and there are not enough strategic, macroeconomic, and policy-oriented plans. The extent of participation by people in planning is relatively small, and the legal footing of planning work remains rather fragile. A risk-control mechanism in connection with investment has yet to be instituted, and the practice of "eating from the same big pot" has not yet been truly shattered. These problems need to be solved by continuing to deepen reform. In noting the striking differences between the new reform of the foreign trading system currently under way in China and the reform carried out over the past 15 years, Wu Yi said: The current reform of the foreign trading system is proceeding simultaneously and in concert with reforms in other key sectors of the national economy -- finance, taxation, banking, investment, planning, foreign exchange, and the enterprise system. The current reform has never been more extensive, forceful, and difficult. Our reform plan was hatched after conducting investigations and studies over an extended period of time, summing up reform-related experience over the past 15 years, and drawing on the successful practices of foreign countries. In the current favorable domestic and foreign environment, the opportunity for carrying out reform is quite good, and the conditions for doing so exist. After discussing the satisfactory results of the way the new financial and taxation systems operate, Liu Zhongli said: Some foreign media recently reported that we are trying to mitigate the central government's financial troubles by increasing enterprises' tax burdens and collecting more local financial revenues; such reports are groundless. Under the current financial and taxation reform, the central government will not collect a single cent from local governments' existing financial revenues; it will only claim a slightly larger share of any additional financial revenues. Local governments understand and support this move. As for enterprises' tax burdens, the country's general ledger is designed in such a way that no increases in such burdens will be reflected; however, some increases or decreases in individual enterprises' tax burdens are normal because of the changes in the tax structure. Chen Yuan explained the prime goals for the future reform of the banking system. These include the establishment of a central banking system that implements independent monetary policy under the State Council's leadership; the establishment of a network of banking institutions that undertake separate policy-related and commercial banking business, with state-owned commercial banks playing a dominant role among other banking institutions that exist side-by-side; and the establishment of a unified, open, and strictly managed network of banking markets which permit orderly competition. In discussing the opening of China's stock markets to foreign companies, Liu Hongru said: Some foreign companies have expressed the hope of issuing shares on China's stock markets. Although China's stock markets are currently closed to foreign companies, they will open up gradually over the long term, in the same way as other commodity markets have. We are carefully studying relevant proposals made by foreign companies. In his closing address, Li Tieying, state councilor and concurrently minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission, said: This international seminar has been a complete success, having attained the goal of further enhancing mutual understanding between China and the rest of the world, and of expanding cooperation and trade contacts between China and other countries and regions. He noted: As China enters a new era of full-scale socialist economic construction, it doubly needs to increase exchanges and cooperation with other countries. China will not change its policy of opening up to the outside world, nor will it change its policy of actively supporting and encouraging foreign investment.
