The Kyoto police said it will present the document to the Kyoto Chapter of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyun) and other Chongnyun-related groups raided on unjustified suspicion of violating the National Land Utilization Law. The statement will be issued under the name of Hisao Asakura, head of the crime prevention department of the prefectural police, officials said. It will repeat the police's view on the raid, saying that false information obtained from the Kyoto municipal government is to blame for the mistake, but that the Kyoto police regret the trouble given to the Chongnyun groups, they said. However, Chongnyun demands the Kyoto police apologize, not just regret. Police searched 27 Chongnyun-related sites after it was tipped by the Kyoto City Government that the group contravened the law obliging purchasers of land to report the deal to authorities. More than eight hours after the raid, the city found evidence that the group had reported the purchase of a 43,000-square-meter plot of land it obtained to relocate its school. The Kyoto police decided to issue the statement after the National Police Agency (NPA) instructed it to convey the feeling of regret clearly, officials said. The NPA also issued a memorandum Tuesday to all prefectural police departments in connection with the mistaken raid, asking the heads of the prefectural police forces to be cautious in investigations and keep in mind "the rare case" of the raid in Kyoto.
