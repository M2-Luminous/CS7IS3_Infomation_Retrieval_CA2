FR941207-0-00108 FR941207-0-00018 (2). Sampling/Testing and Additional Limits: Sampling and Testing of the coal and wood waste sludge is discussed within the August 30, 1994 TSD. Sampling and testing followed USEPA methodologies and ASTM Practices. Net SO 2 emissions were determined using AP&hyph;42 Estimation Factors. Additional ``trigger limits'' were set for the boilers, which requires additional sulfur testing of prior fuel if the current fuel is found to exceed 90 percent of the enforceable SO 2 emission limit. (3). Monitoring: The source has agreed to conduct meteorological monitoring. The State will conduct additional ambient monitoring, which USEPA requested for additional background information on local conditions. The original hillside ambient monitor that recorded the original violations will be maintained indefinitely. No recorded exceedances have been monitored since the last SIP revision request was submitted to USEPA on April 28, 1989. III. Final Action Because USEPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. This action will become effective on Februray 6, 1995. However, if we receive a notice of intent to comment by January 6, 1995, USEPA will publish a document that withdraws this action, and will address the comments received in the final rule on the requested SIP revision, which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register . The public comment period will not be extended or reopened. IV. Miscellaneous A. Applicability to Future SIP Decisions Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. The USEPA shall consider each request for a revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. B. Executive Order 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. C. Regulatory Flexibility Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. This approval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of the State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976). D. Petitions for Judicial Review Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 6, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such a rule. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (section 307(b)(2).)

Note: Incorporation by reference of the State Implementation Plan for the State of Wisconsin was approved by the Director of the Federal Register on July 1, 1982. Dated: November 14, 1994. Valdas V. Adamkus, Regional Administrator. 40 CFR Part 52 is amended as follows: PART 52_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 52 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Subpart YY_Wisconsin 2. 52.2570 is amended by adding paragraph (c)(79) to read as follows: ยง52.2570 Identification of plan. * * * * * (c) * * * (79) On October 21, 1994, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted a plan modifying the SO 2 emission limits applicable to Rhinelander Paper Company facility, located in the City of Rhinelander, Oneida County, Wisconsin. (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) A Consent Order (AM&hyph;94&hyph;38), effective August 22, 1994 issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) and signed by Donald F. Theiler for the WDNR and Melvin L. Davidson for the Rhinelander Paper Company. Rhinelander Paper Company is located in Rhinelander (Oneida County), Wisconsin. This Order limits the overall SO 2 emissions from the Rhinelander Paper Company, and imposes more stringent SO 2 limits for the source's stoker and cyclone boilers and vapor compression evaporator. Sampling and testing of fuel, as well as monitoring criteria are documented within the Order. (B) A letter dated August 29, 1994 from the WDNR to Jerry Neis of Rhinelander Paper Company, requesting clarification for sampling methodologies for all fuel and the source of the sludge used as a fuel source. (C) A response letter dated October 19, 1994 from Jerome T. Neis of Rhinelander Paper Company to the WDNR, detailing sampling methodologies for all fuel and clarifying the source of the sludge used as a fuel source.
