Plans are for the evaluation to end in January. Yudo Swasono, temporary acting head of the Manpower Planning and Development Board, made this statement to MERDEKA after giving a presentation on Monday (20 December) in Jakarta at a one-day seminar on the role of women in the economic sector. In connection with this presentation, Yudo Swasono said that a reexamination of the labor laws which regulate the problems of female workers would also be carried out. He explained that the labor regulations which regulate the problems of a female worker's employment in a corporation have been considered excessive. He was referring to the protection of female workers. He believes that excessive protection will make it difficult for female workers to compete with male workers in the labor market. Among the labor regulations about female workers to be examined by the Department of Manpower are the problems of menstrual leave, maternal leave, and so forth. "If we consider it necessary to supplement them, we will supplement them; but if they should be reduced, things which are not fitting will be deleted," affirmed Yudo Swasono. Yudo believes that a reevaluation of the regulations is very important for the development of the female workers themselves. What he means is that women should have the same work opportunities as men. Up to now women have been discriminated against. For example, the field of manpower training is still largely dominated by men. Even though they (the women) are being trained, applying this training is difficult. Yudo believes that this also affects the level of productivity of the corporation concerned. In answer to a question about female workers' productivity, Yudo said that the level of productivity basically depends on their level of education and training. At this point the level of education of female workers is still considered low; "and existing BLK's (vocational training halls) cannot yet guarantee increased worker productivity," he stated. For that reason, the minister of manpower is also going to carry out a large-scale evaluation of the quality of existing BLK's. One of the matters to be looked at is BKL membership, which is still dominated by men. For that reason, one of the future targets of this BLK evaluation is to develop female worker productivity as a human resource.
