The fire comes from the United States and from the EU [European Union], it is combined and coordinated. The target is obvious. In the Aegean, friends and allies want full restoration of Greek-Turkish relations. They are indifferent to Greek rights. They want the friction stopped; this is what interests them. With their actions, they are encouraging Turkey to provoke a crisis in the Aegean in order to force a meeting between Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller under conditions that will be negative for Greece. This is the reason why suddenly the United States raised, particularly with its written statement, the issue of air space by challenging Greece's 10 mile limit. For many years now the United States has not gotten involved, at least publicly, in this Greek-Turkish dispute. It also asked for the disarmament of our planes. Furthermore, the WEU [Western European Union] upgrades Turkey's position despite the just objections of Greece. Concerning the Macedonian issue, we are pressured by the United States and Europe to make the first step toward solution of the issue. In addition, the French National Assembly refuses to ratify Greece's accession to the WEU as long as the Greek embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] is still pending. On the Cyprus issue, U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major are exerting pressure on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to change his report in order to satisfy the Turkish Cypriot side. As for the Greek minority in Albania, the United States maintains its doubts that the minority is persecuted and that minority rights are violated. The outline of these actions by friends and allies are convincing that Greece is under pressure. The pressure is suffocating. There are dangers and the immediate one is in the Aegean. A Greek-Turkish crisis would also affect the developments of other national issues. That is why Greece should be careful with its moves and reactions. It should not fall into the trap of provocations. The Greek Government avoids Turkish provocations, and this is correct. This is not a time for pseudo-bullying and hectoring. Greece is also refraining from deteriorating its relations with its friends and allies, and this is right. But it should be careful. Deterioration of relations is one thing, but it is another to remain firm in its demand to place these relations based on justice and respect of the country's national rights. It is necessary for the government to activate and guide its foreign policy carefully and firmly. It should seek and secure the agreement of the opposition as well. The danger is in the Aegean. With daring moves, it should constructively close national issues with Skopje and Albania. This move will also weaken Ankara's provocations and its support in the United States and Europe.
