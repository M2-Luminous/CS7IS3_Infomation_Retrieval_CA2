Aguinaldo] [Text] Talks with another rightist group, the Kawal ng Sambayanang Pilipino [Soldiers of the Filipino People] (KSP), are progressing smoothly in contrast to the talks with the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] (RAM). Professor Alfredo Tadiar, government panel chairman, also said government and the military soldiers known to be loyal to former President Marcos have signed three drafts over the weekend. Meanwhile, all his panel and the RAM have done is exchange position papers, he added. According to a source close to the government panel, the KSP's advantage lies in its small membership. "Being a smaller group, it is easier for them to come into position and express what they want during discussions," he said. The KSP, led by Brig. Gen.Jose Maria Zumel, signed with Mr. Tadiar's panel drafts on reform in administration of justice, reform in the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police (PNP) and government reforms. Mr. Tadiar said that unlike with the RAM, his panel only has a few issues to settle with the KSP. Although there are similarities in their talking points, many issues have been set aside by the group in order to give way to more substantial issues, he said. Meanwhile, government is not making much progress with RAM panel led by Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina. A government negotiator who requested anonymity said all efforts have to be exerted in order to leach RAM's working committee members. He also admitted that aside from exchanging position papers, nothing else has been achieved with the military reform group. At present, a meeting is being scheduled to discuss electoral reforms proposed by the RAM. The government panel already has a response to the group's proposals, he said, but could not arrange for a meeting. He also said the RAM has yet to submit their formal objection to the government's attrition policy. On a less brighter note, talks between government and the National Democratic Front (NDF) are in peril after the Philippine National Police refused to release captured communist Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon and four others even as charges filed against them have been dismissed. In a faxed statement, Luis Jalandoni, NDF vice chairperson for international affairs and representative to the talks, threatened to back out of talks if government "will not respect the rights of communist Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon." "The NDF will officially disengage from talks with the Philippine Government and cut off communications with government panel headed by Mr. Howard Dee, should the rights of Tiamzon and her companions not be respected by the Ramos regime," Mr. Jalandoni said. Ms. Tiamzon, third in the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) hierarchy, was arrested by police authorities last week with three other ranking communist leaders and one active member. The PNP Intelligence Command said Ms. Tiamzon has a standing warrant of arrest for two counts of kidnapping with serious illegal detention. The group was also charged with illegal possession of ammunition and violation of election gun ban which were dismissed by a Bulacan prosecutor. The NDF demanded the communist leaders be released immediately in order that the moribund process be saved. According to Chief Superintendent Jewel Canson, the arrest of Ms. Tiamzon and company should hasten the resumption of the stalled talks with the Left. Government panel chairman Howard Dee also said that with the arrest, government and the NDF have all the reasons to sit at the negotiating table. But Mr. Jalandoni said the arrest will not in anyway enhance the chances for peace. He also called for the immediate release of Ms. Tiamzon and objected to government's plans of filing additional charges against her based on offenses allegedly committed during the past.
