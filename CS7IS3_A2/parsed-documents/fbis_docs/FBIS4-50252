The Chinese premier made the remarks during his meeting with Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. presidential national security adviser here today. He said that China will not export its own ideology nor its concept of values; neither will it allow any country to impose its ideology or concept of values on China. China respects the internal affairs of other countries and will never allow any other country to attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs and detract China from its own road of development, he stressed. Li said that China's present policy and road of development, which are based on prolonged efforts of exploration and practice, conform to the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. The premier said that great changes has taken place in the world since Brzezinski's previous visit to China more than six years ago. China takes economic development as its central task and pursues a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping the initiative in its own hands, Premier Li Peng said, and these should be the basic starting point for foreign observers to understand China. "Foreign statesmen will surely make mistakes in their decision- making if they base their understanding of China merely on the words or views of a tiny number of Chinese to the ignorance of the interests and wishes of all other Chinese people," the premier said. Li said that China's development and growth in its strength constitute an important factor contributing to world peace, adding that in international exchange, China strictly observes the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, posing no threat to any other country or provoking any disputes or confrontation. On Sino-U.S. relations, Li said he appreciated President Clinton's attitude of hoping to see a powerful, stable and prosperous China and the Chinese Government hopes that Sino-U.S. relations will gradually improve and develop. Brzezinski said that China is a very important country, both regionally and globally, and it is a major factor for world stability. He believed that a closer U.S.-Sino relationship would be good for both countries and this fact cannot be changed by the differences between them. Expressing his happiness with China's progress in its foreign relations, Brzezinski said that he had carefully studied Premier Li's recent speeches concerning China's policy of developing relations with four Central Asian countries, and he believed the policies were of universal significance. From a long-term point of view, he said that he was optimistic about the future of U.S.-Sino relations, which will occupy a most important position in the U.S. foreign policy. Prior to the meeting, Premier Li Peng gave a brief interview to CBS reporter Constance Yu-hwa Chung and answered her questions on U.S.-Sino relations.
