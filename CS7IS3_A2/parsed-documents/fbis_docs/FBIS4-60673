The two were scheduled to be released in two days, but the Hasharon prison authorities received an order to remand them in custody. Our correspondent has learned that both the detainees and the police were surprised by the news, and the detainees intend to appeal it. The High Court of Justice rejected the appeal of Gil'on Ben-Sa'id, a Qiryat Arba' settler and a major in the reserves, whose weapon was confiscated after the massacre in Hebron. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that the judges ruled that the commander of the Central Command's decision to confiscate his weapon was appropriate and was based on reliable information whereby Ben-Sa'id had previously been involved in violent activities. Our correspondent points out that a restraining order has been in effect against Ben-Sa'id banning him from the boundaries of Hebron.
