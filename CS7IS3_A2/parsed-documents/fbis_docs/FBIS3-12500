Various types of weapons were used. Sources in Abyan Governorate emphasized that the clashes moved yesterday to Ja'ar, the second largest city on Abyan. The scale of the losses resulting from these clashes is not known. Forces from the 1st Tank Division led by Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, half brother of Yemeni 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, supported by a tribal force from the Hashid tribes, specifically from the al-'Usaymat tribe, and units from the 2nd "'Urubah" Brigade, which is stationed in Sa'dah Governorate, launched an attack with various types of weapons late last night on the 5th Infantry Brigade, which is loyal to former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad and whose elements fled to the north following the 13 January 1986 incidents but confirmed their loyalty to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] recently, namely after the rebellion they staged against the president's brother, who could not appoint a replacement for Col. 'Abdallah Shalil, who is from Abyan, because of the refusal of the force's commanders. Military sources in Aden told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fighting in which forces of the 5th Brigade are engaged with the forces led by Col. 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar in the Jabal al-Aswad (Harf Sufyan) in 'Imran have resulted in 12 killed and 30 wounded from the 5th Brigade, and that the forces belonging to President Salih's brother used all types of medium and heavy weapons in the fighting. The sources added that units of the 1st Tank Division and forces of the 2nd "'Urubah" Brigade are still besieging forces of the 5th Brigade, cutting off supplies, including food and water supplies, and preventing it from moving the wounded and the dead from the camp. An official spokesman for the Defense Ministry in Aden held military leaders, whom he described as "extremists" and who control the centers of decisionmaking in the General People's Congress [GPC], fully responsible for these actions. However, an authoritative GPC source described the ongoing fighting in Modiyah as terrorist actions carried out by YSP militias. The source said that "two military aircraft flew at low altitude over Zanjibar the day before yesterday evening near the command of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade camp, breaking the sound barrier in a provocative manner to terrify citizens in the city." Information from Abyan says that Lieutenant Colonel Husayn 'Ali Haytham, former security commander in Abyan Governorate and a GPC member, is seeking to storm the security command center in Zanjibar to regain his position by force, as he was dismissed from his post by the YSP, which appointed 'Ali Ahmad al-Ghawshah as his successor. The information confirms that Husayn 'Ali Haytham is seeking protection inside the al-'Amaliqah Brigade camp in Abyan. At the same level, ambassadors of the EC states in Sanaa have confirmed that a number of victims have fallen over the past few days as a result of the violent clashes which have taken place in Yemen.
