FR941128-1-00032 FR941128-1-00005 k. Two methods of stability classification which use wind fluctuation statistics, the s A and s E methods, are also described in detail in reference 66 (note applicable tables in Chapter 6). As a primary method, these two techniques may only be used for processing data collected within 1 year following the promulgation date of Supplement C, and then only when data are unavailable to implement either the preferred Turner method55 or the SRDT method. After promulgation of Supplement C, these turbulence methods should only be used to provide back-up stability category estimates for missing hours in the record according to an established data substitution protocol g and after valid data retrieval requirements have been met. 2 Such protocols are usually part of the approved monitoring program plan. Data substitution guidance is provided in section 5.3 of reference 66. l. In the case of the s A method it should be noted that wind meander may occasionally bias the determination of s A and thus lead to an erroneous determination of the P-G stability category. To minimize wind direction meander contributions, s A may be determined for each of four 15-minute periods in an hour. However, 360 samples are needed during each 15-minute period. If the s A method is being used for stability determinations in these situations, take the square root of one-quarter of the sum of the squares of the four 15 minute s A 's, as illustrated in the footnote to Table 9&hyph;3. While this approach is an acceptable alternative for determining stability, as qualified above, s A 's calculated in this manner are not likely to be suitable for input to models that are designed to accept on-site hourly s 's based on 60-minute periods, e.g., CTDMPLUS. For additional information on stability classification using wind fluctuation statistics, see references 68&hyph;72. m. In summary, when on-site data are being used, P-G stability categories should be determined by (1) Turner's method55 using site specific data which include cloud cover, ceiling height and surface (~ 10m) wind speeds, or (2) the radiation-based technique (SRDT) described in reference 66. n. The following techniques may only be applied to on-site data bases collected within 1 year following the promulgation date of Supplement C, and then only when data are unavailable to implement the preferred Turner55 or SRDT method; or to provide back-up stability category estimates for missing hours in the record according to an established data substitution protocol g and after valid data retrieval requirements have been met (choice is based on data availability and site suitability): (1) s E from site-specific measurements in accordance with guidance;66 (2) s A from site-specific measurements in accordance with guidance;66 (3) Turner's method55 using site-specific wind speed with cloud cover and ceiling height from a nearby NWS site. o. Meteorological Data Processors. The following meteorological preprocessors are recommended by EPA: RAMMET, PCRAMMET, STAR, PCSTAR, MPRM,135 and METPRO.24 RAMMET is the recommended meteorological preprocessor for use in applications employing hourly NWS data. The RAMMET format is the standard data input format used in sequential Gaussian models recommended by EPA. PCRAMMET138 is the PC equivalent of the mainframe version (RAMMET). STAR is the recommended preprocessor for use in applications employing joint frequency distributions (wind direction and wind speed by stability class) based on NWS data. PCSTAR is the PC equivalent of the mainframe version (STAR). MPRM is the recommended preprocessor for use in applications employing on-site meteorological data. The latest version (MPRM 1.3) has been configured to implement the SRDT method for estimating P-G stability categories. MPRM is a general purpose meteorological data preprocessor which supports regulatory models requiring RAMMET formatted data and STAR formatted data. In addition to on-site data, MPRM provides equivalent processing of NWS data. METPRO is the required meteorological data preprocessor for use with CTDMPLUS. All of the above mentioned data preprocessors are available for downloading from the SCRAM BBS.19 * * * * * 8. Appendix W to Part 51, section 12.0, is amended by: a.
