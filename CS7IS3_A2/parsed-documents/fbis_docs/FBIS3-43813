The conference, which had been going on for four days, discussed the destruction inherited from the civil wars and the attainment of peace and total unity. The conference was attended by 176 people consisting of chiefs, distinguished people, peace-seekers, religious leaders, politicians, intellectuals, officers, and youths drawn from these communities. Iman Mohamoud Iman Omar's speech was given due consideration. An evaluation of living conditions, peace, and other matters affecting the communities was also made. The communities decided on the following resolutions: Peaceful coexistence should be practiced and any conflict should be resolved through joint dialogue; destruction both to life and property during the civil wars should be forgotten; expropriated properties, be they movable or immovable, should be returned to their rightful owners in line with Islamic law; roads connecting regions should be opened up for free movement; and concerted efforts should be made to combat bandits in line with Islamic law. The conference appealed in fraternity and peace to other Somali communities to observe peaceful coexistence. The conference resolved that a 19-member committee conversant with laws and customs be formed. A committee composed of 15 members will be formed. Its task will be the implementation of the said resolutions. It will start functioning seven days after the signing of the agreement.
