According to a report by PESTI HIRLAP, Laszlo Csucs explained his decision by stating that the editors of the Sunday cultural program -- Gabor Ocsovai, Miklos Gyoerffy, and Julia Varadi -- have been producing programs which were biased and have incited passions. The deputy chairman expressed the view that the producers of the last edition did not adhere to even the most elementary ethical requirements. In Laszlo Csucs's judgment, further experimentation would be an abuse of the patience of the audience, and although the radio's cultural weekly was still needed, it would be produced not by the current staff and probably not under its current name.
