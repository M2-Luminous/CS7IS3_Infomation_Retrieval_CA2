It was attended by Yevgeniy Primakov, director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS]. In an interview with our correspondent, Yuriy Kobaladze, the head of the FIS's Press Bureau, described the aim of this meeting in the following terms: [Begin Kobaladze recording] This is normal international practice. This was simply a way of telling MP's what the intelligence service is doing, the tasks it is facing, and the way it is tackling them. [end recording] [Merkulova] At the same time, our correspondent learned the following: [Begin Correspondent Aleksey Venediktov recording] Moscow Echo's sources say that in his address, Primakov referred to certain inconsistencies between the Constitution adopted on 12 December and the law on foreign intelligence. However, arms exports were the main topic. Primakov expressed conviction that arms sales must be controlled by a single monopoly, Rosvooruzheniye, rather than several firms competing among themselves. The FIS director said that arms exports could earn the country substantial profits -- and not just in Russia's traditional markets. He stressed that Russia's intelligence service had observed a drawing together of the positions of Iran and Turkey, both in Afghanistan and the Transcaucasus. Referring to the United States' stance on various questions, Primakov noted that according to his information, the United States supports Belarus' entry into the ruble zone and advocates the preservation of Russia's unity. According to our sources, the hearings on foreign intelligence were more reminiscent of a scholarly seminar than a chance for MP's to learn about state secrets. However, the important thing is that the first contact has been established, our sources stressed. [end recording] [Merkulova] Yuriy Kobaladze reacted in the following manner when we asked him to confirm or deny that information: [Begin Kobaladze recording] I cannot comment on those points. If Duma sources supply you with such information, you should quote Duma sources. [Merkulova] Let me add that the State Duma's Committee on International Affairs also refused to comment. It advised that this report should not even be broadcast.
