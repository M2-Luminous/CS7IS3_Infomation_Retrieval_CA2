According to evaluations from Tirana, some U.S. organizations are possibly behind this tension. A simultaneous action from Turkey, which if not a part of this crisis is surely exploiting it, is not ruled out. Some observers go even further by saying that the explosion that has been expected in Kosovo or Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] may happen at the Greek-Albanian borders. The Albanian leadership has every reason to pursue this alternative out of its political deadlock. Apart from the domestic situation, which goes from bad to worse, the leadership of the Democratic Party and Albanian President Sali Berisha have failed in their foreign policy. Specifically, the situation in Kosovo appears to be easing up as the leader of the Albanian minority, Ibrahim Rougova, seems to accept the solution of autonomy. In Skopje, the smart moves of Gligorov's government have temporarily minimized the dangers of a clash in the region. So, the only region that is open for President Berisha is Greece, in which he says--in an arbitrary addition of Arvanites, Tsamidhes, and illegal Albanian immigrants--there are 3 million Albanians.
