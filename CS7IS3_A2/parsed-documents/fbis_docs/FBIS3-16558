Another provocation was averted near Skrunda. The executive of the Latvian National Independence Movement [LNNK] expressed its opinion on this today in a statement for the press. Mirdza Vitola reports on the statement. [Vitola] The package of interstate agreements initialled at the talks between the Latvian and Russian delegations -- which provides guarantees for the military personnel of the Russian occupation army, who were discharged before 28 January 1992, to stay in Latvia and which offers the possibility of aspiring for citizenship, as well as provides for the keeping of the Skrunda radar station in Latvia for five and one half years -- means securing the legal status of the Latvian occupation and of its consequences. The government delegation has acted against the interests of Latvian citizens and of their unequivocally expressed will. The treaty has been drafted in secrecy, without familiarizing the public with its conditions. The LNNK categorically demands the immediate publication of the full texts of all the agreements in the press and considers that the action by the government and its delegation should be qualified as an act of betrayal of the state interests of the Republic of Latvia. First, the LNNK calls on the president of the Republic of Latvia not to sign agreements with Russia. Second, it calls on all Saeima deputies who are able to realize the tragic and fatal meaning of these agreements for the future of the Latvian state and people, not to ratify it. Third, it calls on all Latvian citizens and political forces who feel responsible for Latvia's future and independence to become involved in protest actions with the aim of stopping the ratification of these agreements. [passage omitted] [Studio announcer] And now some details about the incident itself. Yesterday evening, the Kuldiga district police defused an explosive device which had been placed by the concrete base of a pylon carrying a high-tension power supply line approximately 1 kilometer from the check point of the Skrunda radar station. This information has been supplied to the BALTIC NEWS SERVICE by Ilgonis Heinackis, head of the Kuldiga district police department. The Latvian Interior Ministry Press Center reports that the device was made up of approximately 12 kilograms of TNT -- in 200- gram briquettes and divided into two batches -- an electrical detonator, wires, a timing device, and a battery. The district police was informed about the explosive device by a resident of Ranki rural district. The command of the Russian army unit stationed at Skrunda refused to take part in defusing the device.
