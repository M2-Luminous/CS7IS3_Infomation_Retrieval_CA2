The demobilized members of the 3-80 Northern Front, following orders from its Council of Commanders headed by Jose Angel Talavera Alaniz, alias El Chacal, had decided to suspend their disarmament because the government was unable to fulfill its promises made during the disarmament negotiations. It definitely created a serious concern among the political, economic, and social circles that see in the 3-80 Northern Front the most serious threat to the Nicaraguan peace process. Salvador Talavera Alaniz, alias Esteban, brother of Jose Angel Talavera, El Chacal, who was the political leader of the armed group for a long time, said they were able to reach a compromise with the Government Ministry to fulfill the agreements reached in Quilali last week when the first meetings between the 3-80 Northern Front Council of Commanders and the Government Ministry began. Now that the impasse has been overcome, the former armed groups will be able to purchase the lands they need. The former armed groups need more than 1,300 manzanas of lands to return to civilian life.
