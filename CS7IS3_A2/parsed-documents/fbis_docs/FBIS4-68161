This was decided at a meeting held by the Central Command last Wednesday [11 May]. The five-hour meeting addressed the latest developments, particularly the Cairo agreement, ways to respond to the recent developments, activating confrontation with the enemy, and the situation of the Palestinians in Lebanon.
