This is an important measure for implementing the relevant spirit of the central authorities in our province and strengthening the attack on severe crimes. It is of great significance to preserving social stability, consolidating and developing the present favorable situation of stability and unity, ensuring smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic construction, and protecting the lives, property, and safety of the masses. At present, a handful of criminal elements in society are swollen with arrogance and feel reassured and emboldened. Some of them waylay or kill persons to seize their goods. Stealing has become second nature. Some rape women, or form criminal gangs to ride roughshod in their home villages and towns. Some criminal elements commit all manner of crimes which make one's hair stand on end. Some are economic criminal elements who are blinded by greed. They abuse their posts to wantonly practice corruption, take bribes, and harm the interests of the state and collectives. All this criminal activity has severely jeopardized society and obstructed the smooth progress of reform, opening up and economic construction. They are a social hindrance to deepening reform and speeding up development. The masses clap and cheer when these criminal elements are prosecuted and heavily punished according to law. We need a fine social environment to carry out reform and opening up and to develop our socialist market economy. Social stability is the foundation for smooth progress in all work. Comrade Deng Xiaoping points out: "Without a stable environment, we can achieve nothing. We will even lose those achievements which have been scored." Recently, central leading comrades have repeatedly stressed that we must pay attention to the overall situation of the work of the entire party, correctly handle relations between reform, development and stability, and ensure social and political stability. With the continuous deepening of reform and opening up, our task of preserving social stability has become increasingly important. Party organizations at all levels throughout the province must conscientiously implement our strategic guidelines of "doing two types of work simultaneously and attaching equal importance to both." They must proceed from the overall situation of the great cause of modernization to understand the importance of maintaining social stability. On the one hand, we must continue to uphold the principle of "dealing heavy blows to crime" to severely and promptly crack those unrepentant criminals guilty of crimes for which even death is insufficient punishment, criminal gangs which severely harm the society, serious economic crimes, and arch criminal elements who despise social morality and laws and wantonly trample on our residents' life and property. This will embody the deterrent role of our laws and the great power of our people's democratic dictatorship. On the other hand, we must persist in doing well in comprehensive management of public security, and attach importance to cracking and preventing crimes and bringing about temporary and permanent solutions with emphasis on permanent solutions. Establishing a socialist market economic system is a new undertaking and a magnificent, systematic project as well. It needs coordination and cooperation from various quarters. It needs a fine social environment and effective legal protection. The faster we speed up the pace of reform and opening up, the greater efforts we must exert to crack various kinds of criminal activities and preserve social stability and unity. As long as we make unremitting efforts and truly "do two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both," our reform, opening up, and modernization will progress in a still faster and better manner.
