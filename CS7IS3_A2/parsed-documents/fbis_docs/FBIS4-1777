In connection with this question, this reporter today interviewed Qiu Xiaohua, an economist and SSB spokesman, and asked him to talk about related matters. Qiu Xiaohua said: In general, internationally GNP [gross national product] or GDP [gross domestic product] is used to measure the index of a country's economic development. China began to use GNP and GDP as a transitional measure in 1985, hoping at the same time to preserve the indexes such as total industrial and agricultural output value, total social output value, and national income, which it used in the past. Beginning in 1992, the state abolished the total output value index in its statistical communique released for foreign consumption and retained only the GDP and other related indexes. GDP is the sum of the added value from various departments. What are the defects of the total output value index which China used in the past? Qiu Xiaohua said: Total output value is merely a statistic of the total production result of a material production department. As far as the price structure is concerned, total output value includes newly created value and material consumption in various links of production, such as the two main consumptions, energy and raw and semifinished materials consumption. Because total output value includes material consumption from the intermediate link, the double computation factor exists. For example, in the textile industry if spinning, weaving, printing, and dyeing are done separately by various industrial enterprises that conduct business accounting independently, the value of these raw and semifinished materials are again added to the total output value. This makes it difficult to truly reflect the national economy's growth. With the development of various types of social services, it is also difficult to comprehensively reflect, using only the total output value indexes of material departments, the economic and social development of a country or a region. What is an increment value index? Qiu Xiaohua pointed out: The increment value index covers all national economic departments, including the original material production departments as well as the nonmaterial production ones. As far as the price structure is concerned, an increment value index only includes newly created value and depreciation but excludes energy and raw and semifinished material consumption in the various production process links. Thus, it avoids the factor of overlapping computation and more truly and accurately reflects changes in the national economy. Qiu Xiaohua pointed out: The replacement of the total output value index with the increment value index has the following benefits: First, it will encourage production enterprises to reduce consumption and save energy and guide all sectors of society to develop the economy while keeping efficiency in mind; it will also help overcome the tendencies of one-sidedly going after total output value and growth rate. Second, it is conducive to bringing the indexes of various industries in line with the GDP or GNP, because the sum of their increment values is equal to the GDP. Third, it will help enterprises upgrade their equipment and technology, increase their economic efficiency, and strengthen their competitiveness. Fourth, it will make it easier to make international economic comparisons.
