FBIS4-59542 "drnes094_j_94034" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Al-Bid's News Conference Comments Criticized Al-Bid's News Conference Comments Criticized JN1405075094 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0439 GMT 14 May 94 JN1405075094 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A responsible official source has rebutted the lies and fabrications 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the war criminal, the leader of the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] command, and the killer of children and women in defenseless cities, made at a news conference the day before yesterday. The source emphasized that everything he said is the figment of the imagination of a man who has been overwhelmed by the thirst for absolute power since the era of the one-party dictatorship and a man who is fond of statements that emanate from the complex of leadership and abhorrent megalomania. The source explained that it is uprising and ironic that the deposed al-Bid speaks about legitimacy and delivers legal opinions about it, he who has been divested of legitimacy after he refused to comply with the people's will and accept the results of the legislative elections on 27 April 1993, to be sworn in before the House of Representatives as vice chairman of the Presidential Council, and to respect this constitutional body. He is well aware that this position was given to him although the constitution does not provide for such a position. He also insisted on being given this title in the news, despite of the fact that he had not taken the constitutional oath. The YSP also assumed the third position on the Presidential Council in accordance with the results of the elections on 27 April 1993, in which the YSP won 56 seats, coming third after the General People's Congress [GPC], which came in first, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, which in came second. In spite of this, the GPC gave up its right to three seats on the Presidential Council in accordance with the elections results and gave the YSP two seats on the Council. The GPC also agreed to give al-Bid the position of vice chairman out of concern for national interests and national accord and to avoid any exacerbation of the crisis that al-Bid started with his return to Aden on 19 August 1993. It is strange that al-Bid speaks about the legitimacy of the others, who enjoy full legitimacy and who were elected by the constitutional establishment as representatives of the entire Yemeni people out of their free will, which they translated through the legislative elections. This butcher continues to call himself vice chairman of the Presidential Council knowing full well that he is not legitimate because he has violated the Constitution and has not taken the constitutional oath and because such a position is not provided for in the Constitution. The source explained that al-Bid was the first to circumvent democracy and party pluralism when he refused to comply with the people's will and did not accept the results of the elections. The source added that the criminal butcher al-Bid goes so far in his lies and falsification of facts as to deny the indiscriminate use of weapons of mass destruction -- long-range missiles -- to hit secure civilians in Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Rahidah and other cities in the republic. As a result of this odious crime and treacherous, brutal act of aggression, many innocent civilians among the elderly, children, and women were killed and many houses and civilian installations were destroyed. We do not know what the butcher al-Bid can say about those innocent victims who were killed under the debris of the houses destroyed by the missile that he and his gang fired on 11 May. Nor do we know what al-Bid can say about his missile that landed on the al-Rahidah hospital, killing many patients lying on their beds in the hospital, or what this butcher and his clique can say about his media trumpets' haughty, conceited, and insane appeals and threats to fire more missiles into cities to intimidate citizens who have been terrorized by the rancorous missiles that poured down over their heads while they were sleeping in their homes. The source added that al-Bid is shamelessly lying and continues to lie, believing that he can deceive others. He is a psychologically disturbed person suffering from a state of psychological, political, and media schizophrenia, with his words constantly contradicting his acts. Because of this illness, the butcher al-Bid triggered the war in Yemen and mired the Yemeni people in a cycle of bloody fighting to peddle his secessionist plan, the features of which have begun to become clear since he ignited the crisis on 19 August 1993, the subsequent steps of the military explosion, and then the starting of the war. This plan started on the eve of the signing of the pledge and accord document in Amman. Then, military units were moved from Hadhramaut, Shabwah, and Aden to besiege and destroy al-'Amaliqah Brigade in Abyan. Afterward, they fomented sedition in (Harf) Sufyan, the Shabwah Governorate, 'Imran, and Dhamar, and attacked central security personnel in Aden and the personnel of the 2d Armored Brigade in al- Rahah, Lahij. The source explains that this criminal butcher and his secessionist clique would do well to leave the homeland or surrender themselves for fair trial so as to spare our Yemeni people further bloodshed and suffering and the homeland further destruction. The source stressed that our Yemeni people and public opinion abroad have become fully aware of the reality of al-Bid and his rebellious, secessionist gang and their lies and fabrications, which cannot fool anyone anymore.
