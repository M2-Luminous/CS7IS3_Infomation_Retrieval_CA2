In an interview with INTERFAX on Monday, he expressed the hope that the two sides would ultimately sign a final accord. "We wish to live in peace and intend to persuade the Ingush side to take the same position," he said. North Ossetia believes it is impossible to stabilize the situation in the zone of the conflict between the two Republics unless Ingushetia gives up its claim to North Ossetia's Prigorodny District, the expert said. But he said none of the documents drawn up by the Ingush side had a provision to that effect. "In Kislovodsk, we agreed that we would not interfere into each other's internal affairs, but the Ingushes' claim to North Ossetian territory is precisely an instance of such interference," he said. The expert said that, at the second round of talks, which ended on Friday, it had been suggested that North Ossetia's leadership get in direct contact with Ingush refugees wishing to return to Prigorodny District. "To date we only have 14,000 applications from Ingushes, but, at the same time, we know that not all of the 40,000 wish to come back," he said. According to some sources, the third round of talks is tentatively scheduled to start in a week. Meanwhile, experts on both sides will be working on the agreements, the sources told INTERFAX.
