The nine-member group, asked to review Japan's two-decade-old defense policies, exchanged views after listening to briefings from officials of the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Agency, the panel chairman told a news conference. The group spent considerable time discussing the Foreign Ministry's explanation that the world is in a transition period after the end of the Cold War, said Hirotaro Higuchi, also chairman of Asahi Breweries Ltd. Many group members raised doubts about the notion, arguing that frameworks already exist to maintain a new world order such as the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and the United Nations Security Council, Higuchi said. The next meeting of the panel is scheduled for March 16. The panel, after debating overall defense matters once a week, will offer recommendations to Hosokawa by around summer for a revision of the National Defense Program Outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976, Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies, including Japan's future role in U.N.-led peacekeeping operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995. Higuchi denied the possibility of the panel discussing the interpretation of the current war-renouncing constitution, saying the group will talk about defense matters within the scope of the current constitution.
