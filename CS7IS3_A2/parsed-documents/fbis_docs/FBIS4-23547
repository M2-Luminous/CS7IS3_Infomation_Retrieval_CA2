The Campaign for Democracy said that from next week, "market women and men should lock their shops, drivers and transport owners should remove their vehicle from the streets. Workers should stay off their offices. "Our brothers and sisters in the armed forces and the police are advised to take side with the civil society," it added. The struggle between the Nigerian government and opposition has intensified in recent weeks with the opposition accusing the regime of dragging its heels over a return to democracy after annulled elections and a military coup last year. However, a nationwide umbrella group, the National Democratic Campaign, Wednesday cancelled a big rally at the Lagos home of Moshood Abiola, the unofficial winner of presidential elections held last year. The campaign wanted to forestall a breakdown of law and order that could jeopardize its objective of having Abacha's military regime stand down and hand over power to Abiola, a spokesman for the group said. The number two official in the junta, General Oladipo Diya, said the government was determined to continue with a phased return to democracy, with the first element, a constitutional conference, due to open June 27. This is intended to show the opposition that the government is a "responsible military administration," Diya told state-run radio. However Nigerian security forces earlier in the day arrested four leaders of the opposition National Democratic Coalition, press reports said. In a communique, the British High Commission, or embassy, in Lagos said it "regrets the recent arrests of a number of prominent politicians and hopes they will soon be released." The declaration, which diplomats said reflected the joint position of the European Union, said Britain and its partners were studying trade sanctions they took after the annulment of the elections last year and the military coup last November. "These are being kept under close review and will be modified in the light of progress towards the establishments of democratic civilian rule," the statement said. The detainees were a former information minister, Anthony Enahoro, and three former civilian state governors, Christian Onoh of Anambra in the southeast and Yahaya Abdulkarim and Balarabe Musa of Sokoto and Kaduna in the north. Four members of the disbanded Senate, including speaker Ameh Ebute, and another former civilian governor, Segun Osoba, had been arrested previously. The opposition coalition and members of the dissolved Nigerian parliament, issued separate statements declaring Abacha's six-month- old government illegal and called for a government of national union to be set up under Abiola. Abiola has meanwhile written to US Vice President Al Gore asking the United States and other countries to recognise a parallel Nigerian government he said he intends to name by Sunday, the first anniversary of the annuled poll. The millionaire businessman told a crowd of supporters of his intention and challenged the military to arrest him. "I will be sworn in as the president and commander-in-chief by the popular wish of the Nigerian people by the first anniversary of the election (June 12), and then let heavens fall," he said to a thundering ovation. The crowd included ambassadors and representatives of 25 countries, reporters said.
