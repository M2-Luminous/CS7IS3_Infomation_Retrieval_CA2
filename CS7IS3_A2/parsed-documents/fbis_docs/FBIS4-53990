Czech Minister for Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy in a press conference after signing the agreement with his counterpart, Indonesian Minister for Trade S.B. Judono, said that the two countries' business circles are expected to realize the trade agreement. Previous trade agreement between Indonesia and Czechoslovakia, signed in 1975, terminated when Czechoslavakia was split into two countries, Czech and Slovakia, on January 1, 1993. According to Dlouhy, Czech offers ample and good opportunities for Indonesian businessmen to increase exports to the East european countries because Czech is now an open market with a favourable macro-economic condition. He also said that Czech businessmen are interested to form partnership with their Indonesian counterparts in manufacturing Tata truck engines, which have been exported to Egypt, Turkey, China and North Korea. Besides, he went on, Czech automotive industry is also interested to export Skoda cars to Indonesia. Czech businessmen are also interested to be involved in the construction of a toll road betleen Cikampek and Padalarang in West Java, he added. In the meantime, Judono said that Czech is indeed a potential market for Indonesia's commodities and that it is the right gateway for Indonesian commodities to enter the eastern and central European markets. He also appealed to Indonesian businessmen to make harder efforts so as to gain access to the Czech market, especially in view of a trade deficit of 4 million U.S. dollars recorded in 1993 in favour of Indonesia. Indonesia usually imports from Czech among other things steel, raw materials for plastics, milk, machinery and equipment for cement factories, glassware and chemical products, and exports inter alia its natural rubber, coffee, plywood, office machinery, furniture, fisheries produce, telecommunications equipment and textiles.
