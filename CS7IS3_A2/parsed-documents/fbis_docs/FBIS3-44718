In the first letter, SEF agreed to ARATS' suggestion on holding the Chiao- Tang talks on 31 January. SEF said that Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho will leave for Peking [Beijing] on 31 January for a five-day visit. The agenda includes consultations on related matters concerning the meeting between SEF and ARATS and on increasing communications and understanding between the two organizations. The second letter welcomed ARATS' suggestion on holding early talks on the 4th follow-up working-level discussions of the Ku-Wang talks, following the Taipei talks. SEF stressed, however, that the talks should not involve political and legal issues. [SEF Spokesman Shih Chi-ping] Working-level consultations between the two sides of the Strait should not involve political issues and be mixed with political views. However, only by taking into account the reality of different legal systems between the two sides of the Strait; only then, can we work out a realistic and effective arrangement to solve problems. [Yang] Shih Chi-ping stressed the agenda of the Chiao-Tang talks will include the SEF and ARATS meeting and related matters, and further discussion of the differences which cropped up during the past three working-level consultations, so as to make arrangements for the 4th working-level talks. The second Ku-Wang talks, however, will be not included in the agenda.
