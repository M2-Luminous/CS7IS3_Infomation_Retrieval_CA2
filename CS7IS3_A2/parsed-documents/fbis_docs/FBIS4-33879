The foreign minister acknowledged the U.S. Government had made a request to Venezuela to accept a group of refugees, but they will definitely not be received. "We have sufficient poverty and masses of uninvited immigrants here who are causing us problems, and we are not going to increase those problems with groups of foreigners," Burelli Rivas indicated. Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom also commented on this matter, stating Venezuela cannot be tasked with resolving the problems of the peoples of other countries. The official added that "all the immigrants who want to cannot enter our country, only those who are part of a selective immigration program based on the national interest." Opposing the arrival of refugees are political and social sectors, including the Senate Foreign Policy Committee. Through its chairwoman, Haydee Castillo, the Committee indicated on Tuesday that "the country does not have the economic and social conditions to receive those persons."
