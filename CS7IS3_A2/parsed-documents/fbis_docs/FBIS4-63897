But the Defense Ministry immediately gave a date and time for the meeting. And the talk began with a very topical theme: preparation for the celebration of Belarus' liberation from the German fascist invaders. [Kozlovskiy] Actually the Defense Ministry is already taking part in these events. The army is quite unable to stand aloof from the nationwide holiday. A state commission which includes representatives of the Defense Ministry has been created for holding the celebrations. A special badge has been approved which will be presented to the veterans of the republic's liberation. However banal it may sound now, the military units are assuming patronage of the veterans, helping them, and tending the monuments and graves. A special plan has been compiled. [Mirgorodskiy] Comrade minister, do you believe a Belarusian army has been established and what traditions -- before and after the October period or relating to recent years -- have been most acceptable to it? [Kozlovskiy] We are in favor of the good army traditions of all periods and generations being preserved. But the traditions of recent generations of the USSR Armed Forces are more important. Fraternity, mutual assistance, friendship, honor -- these are sacred concepts for any soldier and officer. There is no doubt that we do not have the right to forget the many years of history of the Belorussian Military District. Outstanding military leaders served here and sophisticated equipment was tested. If we are able to retain the links and traditions of the generations, that will have a beneficial effect on the army's combat capability. And it is now in the process of reform which according to the plan ends in late 1994. The establishment of the armed forces is proceeding on the basis of the republic's legislation. But to ensure that they acquire their own national identity we still have a great deal of work to do. [Mirgorodskiy] You mentioned that the Belorussian Military District used to test sophisticated models of weapons and equipment. So they are not being tested now? And in general where do you get weapons, equipment, fuel, uniforms, spare parts, and food supplies? [Kozlovskiy] A fine question. You should have put it to some deputies who accuse the army of every sin. Yes, previously there was a single supply system for the armed forces. The Belorussian Military District was considered the best in the Union. Moscow gave it everything. Today the situation has changed. The tough system of centralized material supplies has been destroyed. We have been obliged to embark on bilateral agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and other countries in order to maintain our combat readiness. Once again difficulties with finances have arisen. If only the power gave us as much as we need for arms. But alas! We are obliged to engage in commercial activity, for which we are mercilessly and perhaps sometimes rightly criticized. But the main function of any army, you will agree, is in no way trade and commerce. [Mirgorodskiy] The unit's banner. It is sacred to any serviceman. Its loss is shameful. How do matters stand with regard to our units' old combat banners? Will they be kept in the ranks or replaced with the white, red, and white flag? [Kozlovskiy] We delivered an appeal to the Supreme Soviet Presidium on the retention of the units' combat banners, orders, and names. They are our history, our memory. In the republic's top instances there is a proposal to approve the national banner of the Republic of Belarus Armed Forces with all attributes. We believe that both banners -- the old and the new -- should be in the ranks together. [Mirgorodskiy] Let us suppose that some adversary has decided to attack the republic. Will the Belarusian army be able to defend us? [Kozlovskiy] The troops are in a state of combat readiness. That is unequivocal. The question lies elsewhere. Is the army prepared alone, and I stress that, alone, to deliver a fitting rebuff to a potential foe? It all depends on the level of the conflict. Of course, the army will fight, but it is nonetheless better to defend ourselves in alliance with other friendly states. At least it is far more reliable. [Mirgorodskiy] How much money has been earmarked for the Defense Ministry this year? [Kozlovskiy] About 4 percent of the republican budget. This money should be enough only for the army to survive. Incidentally, for your information in Russia 20 percent of budget funds are earmarked for this purpose. [Mirgorodskiy] You say we are short of equipment. But to judge by the recent rapturous newspaper articles we are destroying it quite successfully: destroying tanks, aircraft, and missiles. That is illogical.... [Kozlovskiy] It is all logical. If logical is part of our reality at all. We are fulfilling international treaties. Although it is permitted to use some of the equipment in the national economy and as exhibits. A painful subject. But even the vehicles we are reequipping for use for civilian purposes are not, alas, finding customers. Moreover we have the right to sell only those tanks, for instance, which were allowed to have according to the quota. The others must be scrapped. [Mirgorodskiy] And where does the metal go? [Kozlovskiy] To Khlobin to be melted down..... [Mirgorodskiy] Let us turn from strictly army questions. And let us talk a little about politics. The presidential election campaign is about to begin. How will the army take part in it? [Kozlovskiy] The army by law is outside politics. But no one has deprived the soldiers and officers of the right to vote. Campaigning work will not be carried out in the military collectives. As you know, there are no political parties in the army. So that each person will make his choice independently. [Mirgorodskiy] We have touched on the subject of the shortage of fuels and lubricants, spare parts, and ammunition. But how are exercises proceeding? According to a curtailed program? [Kozlovskiy] Combat training is being carried out in full. Various simulators are being used, including those developed at our own firms. We are merely trying to restrict the troops' movement. [Mirgorodskiy] It is known that the officer cadres are not trained in all specialities in Belarus. How is the Defense Ministry recruiting the specialists it needs? [Kozlovskiy] We are now short of about 1,500 junior officers. We are developing our own academy and schools are being reoriented. Cadres are also being trained abroad. One month of training for a cadet costs $300-350 [figure as published]. Is that expensive? Undoubtedly. Now those cadets who arrived to study during the existence of the USSR are completing their study in our schools. But few are expressing the desire to serve in Belarus. Because a Russian officer's salary is considerably higher than a Belarusian's. Incidentally, our draftee soldier receives half the minimum wage. [Mirgorodskiy] Let us complete the subject of money with the following question: What is the actual cost of one artillery round (as a comparison a pair of shoes used to be cited) and one cartridge for a Kalashnikov assault rifle? [Kozlovskiy] One artillery round, depending on the shell, costs $100-600. A Kalashnikov cartridge costs 25 cents. You can do the sum and make the comparison.
