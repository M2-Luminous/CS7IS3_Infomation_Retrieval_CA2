French diplomats said the meeting had "gone well." It dealt with the contest to name a successor to European Commission president Jacques Delors, and with France's military intervention in Rwanda. They said Balladur had been "agreeably surprised" by the performance of the Italian Government formed by Berlusconi in April, but shared general concern at the presence in his coalition cabinet of five neofascist members. Berlusconi called the meeting "very cordial," and said he had raised the possibility of another meeting between the two men. Earlier on the sidelines of the summit, Berlusconi had talks with British Prime Minister John Major. The two men agreed to meet again soon, but did not announce a date.
