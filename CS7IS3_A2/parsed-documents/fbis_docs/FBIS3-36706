Observers believe that since Admiral Baltin effectively takes orders only from the defense minister and the commander in chief of the Russian Federation Navy (although the Black Sea Fleet is under the command of two presidents -- Russia's and Ukraine's), Boris Yeltsin should say his word regarding the situation. It cannot be ruled out that Yuriy Meshkov's election as Crimean president may speed up the determination of the Black Sea Fleet's status. As is known, however, leaders of many Ukrainian parties and movements and a part of the Ukrainian parliament's deputy corps insist on a return to the Yalta agreements, while ignoring the latest ones -- those signed in Massandra. Observers believe that Boris Yeltsin will find himself in a difficult situation after the trilateral American-Russian-Ukrainian statement set forth the principle of the inviolability of borders. Meanwhile, a confrontation between the Crimean president and the current lineup of the peninsula's Supreme Soviet is in the making. Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bagrov has taken a vacation after submitting an application requesting the parliament to accept his resignation. So far the resignation has not been accepted. The parliamentary session decided to return to the subject after Bagrov's return from vacation. Crimean Council of Ministers Chairman Boris Samsonov has also announced his resignation and taken a vacation. As many as three deputy Council of Ministers chairmen have suddenly gotten sick at the same time: Tatyana Krasikova, in charge of social matters; Pavel Pashkov, who supervises trade and consumer services; and Aleksandr Formanchuk, responsible for international affairs. An effective paralysis of power and a breakup in the peninsula's entire life-support system are now a realistic possibility. For the time being, however, Yuriy Meshkov has announced the first appointments to his administration. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA wrote in summer 1992 about Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov, commander of the Crimean Army Corps, who was discharged from service by the Ukrainian defense minister. On 29 June 1992 he was elected Crimean Supreme Soviet deputy. Now Dmitriy Kuznets is a presidential military adviser. Colonel Valeriy Grishankov, former chief of the Crimean army corps' special department, who was dismissed following Kuznetsov, was appointed the president's chief of staff. Col. Vladimir Demin, a staffer at the special department, was discharged at the same time. Now he has the office of presidential adviser for foreign economic affairs. It was together with Grishankov and Demin (and no one else) that Yuriy Meshkov flew for a meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on 4 February. Information on the meeting was very scanty from both sides, but Igor Azarov, press secretary of the Crimean president, told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent on 8 February that "Kravchuk does not object to the simultaneous circulation of the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian karbovanets." "The president of the Republic of Crimea attempted to back away from concepts worked out by Nikolay Bagrov and to start everything from scratch," Igor Azarov said. The presidential press secretary also told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that Russian President Boris Yeltsin called Yuriy Meshkov and that a meeting between Yeltsin and Meshkov "may take place in the very near future; currently it is being prepared." Now about yet another appointment made by the Crimean president, one important for Meshkov's fledgling relations with the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly. Anife Seytumer-kyzy, a Crimean Tatar and president of the Crimean-Turkish trading house, Kara-Kaplan, has assumed the post of presidential adviser on national matters and relations with public organizations.
