Hata, also deputy prime minister, told a hastily arranged press conference at the Foreign Ministry that he considers it is more important to make adjustments within the ruling coalition government than to become the next prime minister, KYODO said. He also said the next cabinet must be a stable and full-fledged one, according to the news agency. However, a senior member of Shinseito, a powerful party in the coalition government, said it would push for its leader Hata as the next premier, TV reports said. But Hajime Funada, former state minister for economic planning, had this to add, "there is the question of how we should address this within the current coalition framework. It is a delicate thing to find a balance."
