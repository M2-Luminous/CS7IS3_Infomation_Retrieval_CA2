ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) is amending its regulations governing abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation fee payments. The revised rule establishes a new dollar threshold of $25,000 or more for quarterly fee payments made by electronic transfer of funds to the Treasury Financial Communications System (TFCS) or other electronic fund transfer mechanisms approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The increased use of the electronic transfer of funds by those making reclamation fee payments will allow the Department to expedite and streamline its fee collection efforts. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: JoAnn F. Hagan, Division of Financial Management, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Room B 2125_Building 20, P.O. Box 25065, Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado 80202; Telephone (303) 236&hyph;0368. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background. II. Discussion of Final Rule and Response to Comments. III. Procedural Matters. I. Background On August 30, 1993, OSM published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (58 FR 45736) which would amend its regulations at 30 CFR 870.15 to require that surface coal mine operators who owe $25,000 or more in quarterly reclamation fees for one or more mines shall forward payments by electronic transfer. The comment period closed on October 29, 1993. The rule was proposed pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the Act) (30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq., as amended). Section 402(b) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1232(b)) provides that a reclamation fee on produced coal shall be paid no later than thirty days after the end of each calendar quarter. Section 413(a) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1242(a)) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to do all things necessary or expedient, including promulgation of rules and regulations, to implement and administer the provisions of the Act relating to Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (Title IV). This rule amends OSM regulations at 30 CFR Part 870.15(d) by lowering the wire transfer threshold from $100,000 to $25,000. This rule will require those companies which owe $25,000 or more for quarterly reclamation fees to submit such payments through the use of an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The first electronic payment for those companies which owe $25,000 or more shall be made no later than 30 days after the end of the first complete quarter following April 27, 1994. Approximately 100 companies currently pay via wire transfer; however, by lowering the threshold to $25,000, OSM estimates that approximately 1,500 companies will utilize the wire transfer method of payment. Payments from these companies total approximately $55 million per quarter. Instead of submitting checks to OSM for these amounts, these companies will be required to have their banks wire funds using an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
