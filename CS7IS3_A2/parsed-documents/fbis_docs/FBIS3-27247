The report on the findings of the provincial trade union organisation's investigation is the latest in a lengthy series of studies lambasting foreign-funded firms and joint ventures for their treatment of Chinese workers. Some 18 percent of workers at the 20 firms investigated by the union in the southern Chinese province said they had been regularly beaten or insulted, the report published in International Business News said. Twenty-five percent had had their identification cards confiscated by the management, and 37 percent had been threatened with the loss of their jobs for complaining. Forty percent had never signed a contract, the report said, adding that 61 percent of the workers put in a seven-day week, averaging eight to 10 working hours a day. The investigation also found evidence to back up repeated allegations that foreign-funded firms put profits before safety as they rush to grab a slice of China's economic boom. Some 36 percent of the workers had received no training in safety regulations, while 44 percent had no medical or industrial accident insurance. More than 10 percent of the 206 large-scale industrial fires in China last year involved foreign-funded firms. Two fires within a month at the end of 1993 killed 80 employees in a Hong Kong-funded toy factory in the southern special economic zone of Shenzhen and 64 workers in a Taiwan-funded textile plant in the eastern city of Fuzhou. Most of the victims were female factory workers. The investigation found that 47 percent of the women workers were denied maternity leave, and any who failed to return to work soon after giving birth were automatically fired. The union said its inquiry revealed a total disregard for Chinese laws and regulations, and it also blamed local authorities for failing to curb exploitation. Local labour rules in China follow general guidelines set by the central authorities and are often loosely implemented. The eastern province of Shandong recently became the first Chinese province to publish its own set of regulations governing employment conditions in foreign-funded enterprises.
