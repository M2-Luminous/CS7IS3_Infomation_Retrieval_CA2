Switzerland plays host only once a year to an official visitor from a foreign state. Poland is the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to have received an invitation for such a visit. President Walesa will head a delegation including Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, head of the president's chancellery Janusz Ziolkowski, National Bank of Poland President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz and Deputy Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak. Lech Walesa will also be accompanied by 15 representatives of Polish business since the visit is intended to strengthen Polish- Swiss economic ties. At the moment Switzerland is in 13th place in the league of Poland's trading partners, and 234 Swiss firms operate in Poland with a small capital of 170 million dollars. The last significant Polish-Swiss business deal was the purchase of the Poznan firm "Goplana" by Nestle. No trade agreements are intended to be signed but several meetings are planned which should bear fruit later on. Among these is a "round table" meeting planned with representatives of Swiss economic circles which will be chaired by the presidents of both countries. The Polish delegation has plans to visit four Swiss cantons -- Berne, Zurich, St. Gallen and Solure (which is represented by the Swiss president). President Walesa is to meet representatives of the thousands-strong Polish community. This will be Walesa's first visit to Switzerland in his capacity as Polish president. But in June 1981 as leader of Solidarity he headed a delegation to the International Labour Organisation in Geneva. Bronislaw Geremek, who is now one of the leaders of the Freedom Union, accompanied him at the time. Several meetings took place then. This was one of the elements of the "existence of Poland in the world up to the achieving of independence," presidential press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said.
