Sharp criticism and disgust had been levelled against him when he fled the country for the United States as President Kim Yong-sam's anti-corruption campaign reached the once untouchable military buildup projects known as the Yulgok program. Kim has come under suspicion of receiving bribes by allegedly peddling influence as a trusted aide to President No Tae-u. Officials at Chongwadae [presidential office] received the news with stunned disbelief as the reports said Kim might be seeking a political asylum in the United States. "How could he, once a prominent public servant, sell himself out to a foreign country just because he is being pursued by the law of his country as a criminal?" asked one Chongwadae official said, requesting anonymity. [sentence as received] Political asylum is usually asked by those whose life is threatened by dictators or by other colonial overlords. It is not something given by a foreign country to a criminal on the run, he said. It was being reported Saturday that the Seoul government is considering using diplomatic channels to the United States to ask the U.S. Government to reject Kim's application for permanent residentship. "Kim Chong-hwi had pretended that he was a clean official," said another Chongwadae official. "He never even bought a cup of coffee for other officials. "If he is that clean, why doesn't he come home and answer the charges?" Aides to former President No were also expressing their disgust, calling Kim a "disgrace to the Sixth Republic." Since he once commanded the nation's foreign and security policy from a prestigous and exulted position, he should have come home when his mother died and buried her and answered questions by the prosecution, rather than abusing his former position and seeking political asylum in another country, they said. Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], told reporters: "It is big trouble. "All politicians are responsible for their country. How could the man act like that? I simply couldn't understand his mentality." "I cannot help doubting about the stability of his mind," said Rep. So Chong-hwa. "If he is really seeking political asylum, it's a mind-boggling thing to do." There have been a lot of "problems" with the previous administration but this case aptly and glaringly illustrates the real character of the No government, another DLP lawmaker said. The main opposition Democratic Party [DP], meanwhile, is trying to make a political issue out of the affair. The DP defined it as a product of the current administration's "unfair and unbalanced" prosecution of corrupt officials. In an official commentary, DP Deputy Spokesman Kwon Il-sun said that there had been suggestions the current administration could have helped Kim escape to the United States even though he had been the main player in irregularities in connection with the selection of the mainstay fighter aircraft. Noting that the U.S. Government should not grant political asylum to Kim Chong-hwi, he said, "the Seoul government should recall Kim at any cost following talks with the U.S. Government through diplomatic channels."
