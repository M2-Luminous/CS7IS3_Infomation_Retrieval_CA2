FR940324-0-00004 FR940324-0-00001 The other commenter questioned the manner in which FGIS determined that the Neogen test kit was the best method to be declared official and suggested that the agency publicly release the testing data regarding the test kit. FGIS announced its intent to examine vomitoxin (deoxynivalenol) test kits in the February 4, 1992, Federal Register (57 FR 4184). Specifically, FGIS solicited input regarding the availability of commercial test kits for qualitatively and quantitatively determining the presence of vomitoxin to conduct a study under field conditions. Manufacturers were requested to notify FGIS of the commercial availability of test kits and to provide information on the performance of these test kits. In response to this request, only Neogen Corporation submitted information regarding their test kit for vomitoxin. FGIS, after examining the Neogen test kit, determined that it was suitable for official use. The test kit provides qualitative or quantitative results and is adaptable to the existing environment of official aflatoxin laboratories. Further, the chemical compounds used in the test procedure comply with FGIS' established safety and waste disposal programs. FGIS examined the Neogen test kit for accuracy at several different known contamination levels in wheat and corn samples. Overall, the FGIS field study revealed that the kit was capable of producing accurate results in 89 percent of the wheat tests and 91 percent of the corn tests.

Final Action FGIS has determined that offering official vomitoxin testing services for grain under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act and establishing a fee to recover the cost of this service would facilitate the orderly and timely marketing of grain. Accordingly, the interim rule amending 7 CFR part 800 which was published in 58 FR 49421 on September 23, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change.
