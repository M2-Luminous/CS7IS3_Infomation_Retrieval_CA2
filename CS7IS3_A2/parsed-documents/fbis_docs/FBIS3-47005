Undersecretary of State Joan Spero said Washington is disappointed with the progress in the four-month-old negotiations aimed at securing U.S. access to the automobile and other key market sectors in Japan. Spero was particularly critical of Japanese resistance to U.S. proposals to use "quantitative indicators" as yardsticks to measure whether Japanese markets are as open to imports as other developed nations. "I don't think this is something that is negotiable," Spero said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE and JIJI PRESS. Spero, the top State Department official in charge of economic issues, gave the interview ahead of a trip to Japan on Friday for talks with Japanese officials on the framework negotiations. Japanese and U.S. negotiators are committed to concluding the current phase of negotiations prior to a summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11. "We don't want to settle for some cosmetic fix on February 11th. We want to have a real change in this relationship," she said. She laid the blame for an apparent stalemate in the talks on Japanese negotiators, who she described as tough, rigid bargainers. "It seems that in all areas our Japanese interlocutors are being quite rigid," Spero told a news conference earlier in the day. The current negotiations, based on the so-called "framework" trade accord concluded last July, focuses on four key Japanese market areas of particular interest to U.S. firms. In addition to increased auto and auto parts sales in Japan, the U.S. wants the Japanese Government to buy more foreign telecommunications and medical equipment and to allow foreign firms unrestricted access to the Japanese insurance market. While the Tokyo Government has promised to make it easier for foreign firms to do business in Japan as part of a commitment to reduce Japan's trade surplus, Japanese officials have balked at using numerical figures to assess progress. "They don't want to talk about measurement even though we agreed very clearly in our written document that we will discuss these indicators," Spero said, referring to a provision in the framework agreement for the use of objective indicators. Spero said Japanese negotiators are particularly negative in talks on Japan's automobile market. "They are totally resisting any serious dialogue in automotive and auto parts issues," she said. Spero accused what she described as her "Japanese colleagues" of misrepresenting U.S. intentions on the framework talks. "One of the things that our Japanese colleagues have been saying to you in the press, and you have been saying in your articles, is 'the U.S. wants another series of (market share-setting) semiconductor agreements.' I think this is disinformation," she said. Spero said the United States is not asking for one single indicator but multiple benchmarks to show that foreign firms enjoy the same level of penetration in Japanese markets as in other developed countries. "By any standard, Japan is not as open as the other developed market economies," Spero said.
