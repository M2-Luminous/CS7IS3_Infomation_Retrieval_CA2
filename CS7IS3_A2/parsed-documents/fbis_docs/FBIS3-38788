A discussion that focuses primarily on troop strengths neglects the complicated links between the tasks of the Bundeswehr and the capability resulting from the situation, between the operational readiness level and mobilization, and between structure and deployment. In addition, the links between the Bundeswehr's obligations as an alliance partner and domestic defense, and finally the defense system and the funds that are available play a decisive role here. Changes in one of these factors also change the entire system of the Bundeswehr. Minor adjustments in one area may exacerbate the situation in another sphere. Thinking about the future of our armed forces means first of all getting used to the idea that we are facing two phases of a longer process. After Germany's reunification, it was, above all, important for the Bundeswehr to take over and dissolve the National People's Army, to establish the Bundeswehr in eastern Germany, to reduce the all-German armed forces by almost 50 percent, to reorganize part of their deployment, and to prepare them for new tasks. After the reduction of the armed forces to the stipulated level of 370,000 soldiers this year, the first phase of this process will largely be completed. It is now important to redefine in detail the capabilities and planned structures of the Bundeswehr while taking into consideration the security-political situation, our increased international responsibility, and the tasks resulting therefrom for the Bundeswehr and the armed forces that Germany wants to have and to keep. In spite of limited funds, the Bundeswehr must fulfill its future tasks. An analysis of the strategic situation shows that a large-scale aggression can no longer be the central criterion and yardstick for our defense concept and military planning. The supreme goal of German defense policy will naturally remain the protection of Germany and of our alliance partners within NATO and the European Union against attacks from outside. This is the most dangerous but at the same time most unlikely scenario. Crises and conflicts that erupt at smaller or larger distances but which may turn into a threat for individual or several alliance partners through regional escalation are more likely to occur in the future. It is in Germany's vital security interest to contain such critical developments regionally and to prevent them from spreading to Central Europe. Thus, the Bundeswehr will have to fulfill two main defense tasks in the future. First, it must be in a position to contribute to settling probable international crises and conflicts together with allies and partners; second, it must be able to increase its strength and provide sufficient defense forces for the unlikely and most dangerous case -- that is for the defense of Germany and the alliance. These main functions of the Bundeswehr are to be coordinated with each other and, as a result, they must ensure that Germany will retain its defense and reaction capability and continue to be able to develop policies and to fulfill its duties as an alliance partner in crises. The needs and possibilities for domestic defense and crisis management will require a clear differentiation of the training and operational readiness in correspondence with the task. The strategic situation makes it possible to clearly reduce the operational readiness level for domestic defense. The militarily usable warning time for the highly improbable event of a large-scale planned aggression suggests shifting the training for operational readiness for individual units of the expandable main defense forces to times of crises. Thus, part of the main defense forces might then be relieved from their operational mission in peacetime. Because of Germany's geostrategic situation, a special contribution to the strength of the main defense forces in Central Europe that are based on the principle of mobilization is a decisive factor for Germany's influence in the alliance. The mobilization capacity of the main defense forces is a vital element in national defense and for Germany's weight concerning a major task of NATO, that is collective defense. National defense and compulsory military service are two sides of the same coin. Just like in France, compulsory military service is a central element of Germany's defense culture. Generally, the Bundeswehr is equipped with relatively modern weapons for domestic defense. What we are lacking is the capacity to be able to participate efficiently in the settlement of international crises. Thus, we need a German contingent of crisis reaction forces that is capable of carrying out combined operations in cooperation with alliance partners while covering the whole spectrum of possible operations. The need for adaptation within the Bundeswehr results from the need to efficiently establish a basic capacity for crisis management, to make sensible use of the compulsory military service, and to gain planning leeway in view of the tight budget situation to make it possible to fulfill the task with the funds available. This also includes that rationalization measures within the Bundeswehr should lead to investments. The Bundeswehr will be developed further as a whole organic system. Priorities that reflect the changed tasks of the Bundeswehr will be set in this respect. First of all, they will affect the required fundamental military capabilities. The future strength of the crisis reaction forces, the greater extent of differentiation among the main defense forces, the operational rationalization, and the streamlining of structures will make it possible to reduce personnel. This will have an impact on the internal structures of the armed forces, the personnel strength, and the deployment. However, fast changes concerning the basis for financial planning will ruin every orderly process. Thus, what the Bundeswehr needs for its development in the next few years is a secure conceptual and financial basis.
