FR940830-1-00035 FR940830-1-00004 Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1027, Revision 3, dated December 10, 1993, which describes procedures for replacing the shouldered bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which will prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;207&hyph;048(B), dated December 8, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors, and correction of discrepancies, if necessary. The proposed AD would also require replacement of the shouldered bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. Correction of certain discrepancies would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by the FAA. The FAA estimates that 99 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take approximately 72 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $392,040, or $3,960 per airplane. It would take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,670, or $330 per airplane. Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $424,710, or $4,290 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption addresses. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Airbus Industrie: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;94&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model A320 series airplanes on which Airbus Modification 22422 (reference Airbus Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1027) has not been installed, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency, accomplish the following: (a) Within 450 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, perform a detailed visual inspection to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors, in accordance with Airbus Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1047, dated April 25, 1994.
