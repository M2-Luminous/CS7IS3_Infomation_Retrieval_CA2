The company the government is dealing with has not responded to a letter requesting it to transfer the F-16 airplanes immediately to Pakistan as per the agreement. Pakistan has already paid the huge amount of $680 million to this company, and this company has demanded payment of another $150 million before March 1994. Pakistan, however, has taken the correct stand that the airplanes should be sent to Pakistan as per the agreement before the next installment is paid. The delivery of F-16 planes to Pakistan was stopped under the Pressler amendment using Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program as an excuse. It is unfortunate that the agreement to purchase F-16s was made in 1989 and the Pressler amendment was passed in 1990. On principle, an agreement made before the Pressler amendment should not be affected by it. However, as the result of the U.S. government's unfair and unprincipled stand, economic and military aid to Pakistan was suspended using the nuclear program as leverage to put pressure on Pakistan. This issue could not be resolved despite several high-level talks. The question arises, how long can Pakistan tolerate the situation where it has paid for, but cannot get the airplanes? At the same time, we are being asked to pay the other installments for the planes. The Pakistani government should raise this issue at all political and diplomatic levels with the U.S. government. It should also take legal action in U.S. courts so that either the money paid in advance is returned or the F-16 planes are supplied to Pakistan.
