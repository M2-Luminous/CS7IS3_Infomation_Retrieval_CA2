"This action may shipwreck the fragile truce which is currently under way," Communist Renewal stated. "We are asking ourselves what NATO's true motives might be. Having been forced to renounce the implementation of the ultimatum as a result of Russia's intervention, NATO now seems to be looking for other pretexts to address the issue once again in military rather than in diplomatic terms." The Northern League did not share this opinion: "This is the first time that the violation of a cease-fire imposed by the United Nations in Bosnia has been penalized, and this is undoubtedly a positive fact. NATO's role in the Bosnian conflict is confirming how essential NATO is for European security, contrary to what certain political forces within the so-called progressive alignment are saying."
