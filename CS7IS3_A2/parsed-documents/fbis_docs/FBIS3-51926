About 58 of them participated in the 25 January session. This time, all leanings were represented at the session. A true debate took place under the presidency of Deputy Frantz Robert Monde. Several issues were tackled. The president of the assembly took the opportunity to deny allegations by the Committee of Actions for National Reconciliation [CARENA] spokesman Adyjeangardy relating to possible participation by the Chamber of Deputies in the national conference on 6 February. It is simply false, he uttered. I have given my support to the principle, but the Chamber cannot send an official delegation to this conference, he explained. What most attracted attention at this session was the resolution project presented by a group of parliamentarians of the south who have enjoined President Aristide to designate a new prime minister within the next 48 hours. This resolution caused much ink to flow in the Haitian parliament. It is a true ultimatum. An ultimatum cannot be issued to the president of a republic, one deputy objected. It was a very animated, passionate debate during which partisans and opponents changed their viewpoints. Finally, the Assembly gave its sanction. Thanks to votes by the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion and the socialists, the principle of urgency was adopted by the Chamber. A special committee was constituted to give a ruling on the matter. Urgency or ultimatum? The question remains unanswered. Behind the scenes of the Chamber, a resolution project aimed at dismissing President Aristide for serious violations of the Constitution is being discussed. On the side of the ACP, steps are being taken: they are reportedly finishing up this resolution project. But at yesterday's session, they were concerned instead with the justification or nonjustification of a resolution summoning the head of state to designate a new head of government.
