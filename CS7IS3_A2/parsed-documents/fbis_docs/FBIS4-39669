Chernomyrdin's trip to Germany appears to be a rather strange one, if one takes into account the fact that the best medical institutions in Russia are located in the resort where he was vacationing, Reuters considers. It was reported by the DPA agency that all the experts examined Chernomyrdin and acknowledged his state of health as excellent. According to a correspondent of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the question arises as to whether the unexpected trip to Germany by Chernomyrdin is window-dressing preparation for his resignation due to the state of his health. It is interesting that, according to a report from Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, people surrounding First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets have unambiguously given it to be understood that their boss may soon become prime minister. Another probable candidate for the post of head of government is Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Federation of Goods' Producers. This is what KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes. According to reports from informed sources in the government of Russia, the issue of the resignation of Viktor Chernomyrdin from the post of prime minister due to his state of health and the appointment of Yuriy Skokov has fundamentally been decided among those surrounding Boris Yeltsin. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin himself allegedly agrees with this formulation. According to unofficial information, Yeltsin already met with Yuriy Skokov last Monday, as a result of which the necessary draft presidential decrees only need to have Yeltsin's signature added to them.
