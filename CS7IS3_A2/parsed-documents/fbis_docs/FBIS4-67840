And Norway cannot afford to give very much help. This was Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal's conclusion yesterday when he yesterday put before the Storting a report on nuclear safety and chemical weapons in the regions close to northern Norway. The Cold War has been succeeded by major environmental challenges. In areas very close to Norway there are enormous temporary dumps of nuclear waste, several dozen abandoned nuclear submarines, an old and unsafe nuclear power station, and large quantities of nuclear arms. ``It goes without saying that Russia has an indepednent responsibility for safety at nuclear installations and for solving the problems of waste. But neither Russia nor the other states of Eastern Europe are able to give this the highest priority. Such enormous resources are needed to sort all this out that the only possibility is broad international cooperation,'' the foreign minister said. He mentioned NATO, the EU [European Union], the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council as possible forums for such cooperation. The foreign minister stressed strongly that Norway can only be involved in a small way in paying the bill for the biggest nuclear cleanup operation ever. Hitherto Norway has spent only 36 million kroner in aid for the East. In the past it has been estimated that it will cost somewhere in the order of $150 billion to clean up the nuclear chaos on the Kola Peninsula. ``But Norway is assuming a lobbying role to get nuclear safety in northwestern Russia onto the international agenda,'' Godal said. But who will actually pay the bill, he was asked. ``Russia and Europe's taxpayers will have to foot the bill,'' he said. Asked whether Norway has plans for further short-term assistance for the Kola region in the absence of a larger-scale international aid operation, he replied: ``We are keeping the situation under constant observation, but we have no plans for measures at present. These are sensitive issues on which we naturally want to work closely with the Russian authorities.'' In the course of last winter there were several minor accidents at the nuclear power station on the Kola Peninsula, further nuclear submarines were mothballed, and the situation regarding several of the temporary waste dumps -- such as the dump ship Lepse, for example -- deteriorated dramatically. In the light of this the foreign minister was asked if Finnmark is today facing a real nuclear threat: ``The potential dangers are considerable. But the situation is not acute,'' Bjorn Tore Godal said. Yesterday the foreign minister was able to announce that the Russian authorities with the foreign minister at their head have given permission for a third Norwegian-Russian research expedition to former nuclear waste dumping sites in the Kara Sea. Now the way is clear for an expedition to the formerly forbidden Ambrosimov Bay on Novaya Zemlya where there is reason to believe that considerable quantities of solid nuclear waste has been dumped. The foreign minister's report to the Storting is the first public document on nuclear safety in the Kola region. Hitherto it has been the Bellona Environmental Foundation which, since the fall of the Iron Curtain, has constantly been digging up new information about the piles of radioactive waste the Cold War is leaving behind in the northern regions.
