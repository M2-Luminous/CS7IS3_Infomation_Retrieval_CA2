[Lobov] Most stress was placed on the joint documents we have signed that create a Bulgarian-Russian Intergovernmental Commission on Defense Industry Cooperation, the protocol on cooperation in military equipment, and the problem of the new transport link between Bulgaria and Russia. I gave Dr. Zhelev an oral message from the Russian president that confirms all the accords that the two leaders reached in 1992 during your president's visit to Russia. In his message, Boris Nikolayevich drew attention to the fact that, despite the well-known difficulties in our bilateral economic relations arising from the transition to a market economy, our mutual trade increased by 20 percent in 1993. Because our transportation and communications system had deteriorated and been interrupted, which you know about (we now have to pass through eight borders and customs posts between Sofia and Russia), the president and I discussed our proposal to find an overall solution for this problem by restoring the direct sea link between Varna and Novorossiysk. Dr. Zhelev showed great interest in the completion of this project. [Aleksandrov] What problems did you discuss regarding regional security? What are the prospects for expanding (not only on paper) our mutually beneficial cooperation in military production? [Lobov] Yes, our visit is mainly in connection with security and cooperation issues in the field of military defense production. Bulgaria created its army on the basis of Russian weapons and arms produced in its own military plants, mainly under licenses granted by Russian enterprises. Of course, your country has weapons even now that it produces itself, because it has its own specialists, engineers, and designers. However, Dr. Zhelev and I agreed that this cooperation in the military industry field can be continued and further developed on a mutually beneficial basis, insofar as our economic, financial, and human resources permit. You yourself realize that it is illogical for each of us to separately invest immense funds "to reinvent the bicycle" when it, or at least parts of it, already exists both in Bulgaria and in Russia. Accordingly, in view of this fact we should think about how to draw mutual benefit from it. There is no disagreement between us on this, that is, in the defense industry we can successfully develop mutual cooperation, and I hope to investigate the conditions for this during our visit to Bulgaria. [Aleksandrov] Mr. Lobov, what concerns you in the Black Sea region? Bulgaria has signed the Partnership for Peace initiative, but Russia has yet to sign it.... [Lobov] The problem is that the geopolitical situation has changed in the Black Sea region and the Balkans. We have to take these realities into account and consider them carefully, because we must maintain Russia's defense at a dependable level. This is why we want the Black Sea basin to remain a zone of peace, not a region for developing conflicts, and I believe that not only we Russians but also you people in Bulgaria have an interest in this!
