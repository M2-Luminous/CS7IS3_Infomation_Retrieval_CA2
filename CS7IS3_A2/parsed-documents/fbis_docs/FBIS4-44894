The Center was to operate its business at two locations: Ube City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Tajimi City, Gifu Prefecture. The establishment of the Center was based on the philosophy that Japan must "aggressively promote creative technology development because technological progress is the moving force an economic society needs," although Japan continued to have a dismal economic environment after the bubble burst. Furthermore, the Ultra-High Materials Research Institute was also established at the same time, in the manner usually taken by the private sector, in order to effectively utilize the Center's facilities and efficiently promote material development. The Institute was to support the Center's business and carry out consigned tests, research projects, and various exchange projects through the use of the Center's facilities. It was July 1992, when all the facilities were completely installed and both Center and Institute began their operation. Thus, in January 1994, one year and seven months have passed since then. Core of Chubu R&D Circle The Gifu Center, located on a quiet hill on the east side of Tajimi City, occupies a section of Tono Research Academic New Cities Initiative that is being promoted by Gifu Prefectural and local governments. Thus, the Gifu Center is expected to become an active, central research facility along with the Nuclear Fusion Science Research Institute and the Microgravity Laboratory of Japan. In March 1993, the Tono Research Academic New Cities Initiative was approved by the government as a promotion center regional basic initiative based on the multi-polar land decentralization promotion law. Since then, the Initiative has been in the process of realizing its long-range plan to build a research/academic city that Japan will be proud to show the world. The city represents an excellent research environment ready for the 21st century with its world-level research facilities pursuing pressing environment-related topics, including ultra-high temperature, ultra-high pressure, superconductivity and microgravity. Under these circumstances, UHTMC is expected to produce epoch-making breakthroughs in advanced technology fields through the development and implementation of new materials, and the breakthroughs are expected to produce broad propagative effects. In particular, successful development is anticipated for advanced materials that can withstand an ultra-high temperature environment of approximately 2,000ï¿½C, i.e., ultra-high temperature materials. Specifically, considered quite promising are metal, ceramic and carbon-based materials, as well as their composites. When developed, these ultra-high temperature materials are expected to be applied in wide-ranging advanced technological fields such as aerospace, energy, transportation, material-development processes, and environment. Thus, the propagative effects of the materials will be felt by all industries. Equipped With Newest Test Facilities UHTMC is equipped with facilities for creating ultra-high temperature materials and evaluating the properties and functions of these materials at ultra-high temperatures. These facilities are so advanced, sophisticated, and high-tech that it would be difficult for a private corporation to install them. The facilities include research devices such as an ultra-high temperature material tester, an ultra-high temperature fatigue tester, and a creep tester. In the second half of FY91, the business section of UHTMC began operation, and in July 1992, the full center began operation. Also An International Exchange Center Three prefectures -- Aichi, Mie, and Gifu -- in Chubu District are creating Tono -- in Gifu, and Suzuka, in Mie Research Academic Cities -- whose basic concept is to carry out government, industrial, and academic joint national research projects; industrial and academic joint research projects; and private sector joint research projects. These cities also are to function as the centers for international exchange of knowledge among the most advanced scientists and engineers of the world and are the bases for disseminating technological information. Situated between the Tsukuba (on the east) and Kansai (on the west) Research New Cities, these Chubu District Research New Cities are also growing under an ambitious plan.
