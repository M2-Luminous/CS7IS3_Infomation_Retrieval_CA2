Velasquez from the Miraflores Palace Ayacucho Room in Caracas--live] [Text] Men and women of Venezuela: The year 1993, which is drawing to an end, can be seen in our history as the door to a new phase in the nation's life. This is so due to the importance of the situations that were resolved in the framework of democratic and institutional norms and due to the political, economic, and social changes that the transformation crisis made evident. These changes, which began building up along the initial phases of our democratic life, acquired dramatic urgency when national maladjustments resulting from, originally, the foreign debt pushed the people to protests in the streets and when new political and community organizations appeared; in addition, the people made demands due to the continued deterioration of the majority's social and economic situation. The ceaseless concentration of wealth and the state's inability to handle efficiently health, security, education, and housing conditions have also contributed to the situation I mentioned. These protests and the charges about corruption and the trafficking of influence made daily through the media have created in Venezuelans the awareness that they have to participate in and watch how the country is doing, an awareness the people did not have before. The events of 27 February 1989 are especially significant, because they took place before the promulgation and implementation of the measures that would modify the state's economic policies. The military events of 4 February and 27 November 1992; the new composition of regional and municipal governments as a result of the elections of governors and mayors in 1989 and 1992; the unprecedented and most important process that culminated with my election as president of the country; the new composition of the national and state legislative branch that was the result of this December's elections; and the election of the new president of the country as a product of an alliance of political forces that have broken the traditional process that for 35 years had assured two parties the control of the state; the government's growing fiscal weakness to promptly attend to national problems due to the obligations that the debt has created; and increasingly marked social unbalances are all undeniable signs of the historic conflict to which I have referred. To these factors we must add the growth of the population, the states' economic, political, and cultural growth, and the autonomy of their governments, as well as the importance of organized communities that are out of the control of the traditional parties. In Venezuela, the historical gap between the early 1960's and the present, which will reach the threshold of the new millennium, can be seen clearly now. No sector of the country has escaped this commotion. The established order in the political system, the military's demands and proposals, and the tension and struggle among economic sectors are expressions of this cyclical change, which is also present in the fields of science and arts, where the great progress that raises the country's cultural level makes itself evident. We have strived to look for a way out through elections. Although we know that elections are not the only solution, it is the most immediate instrument that the democratic system places in the hands of all Venezuelans to attain peace in this new world to where history is leading us. We advanced toward the elections amidst incredulity, threats, and rumors. In the end, all of the political currents, both traditional and those that represent the new participation scheme, were present in the elections. It was a multiple participation of the political sectors. From the beginning, my government announced its main objective: to create the national climate and conditions for the elections. We intended to turn the elections into the basis for a national rapport of the Venezuelan people. We intended for the winning candidate to become the standard bearer of national reconciliation, so that the hatred that has divided the country lately could be laid down, so that the retaliatory spirit that has been marking the struggle could be put down, and so that an understanding pact reaching every sector could be attained, because the scope of the existing social, economic, and fiscal problems underline the need for general support so the task of governing Venezuela can be performed. Venezuela has elected Dr. Rafael Caldera as the new leader of the country. He is a fundamental personality in the democratic process. To his experience as a statesman he adds the moral authority of his life and the broad-mindedness provided by the humanistic disciplines. The Supreme Electoral Council performed the difficult task of presiding over elections that introduced voting methods that proved difficult to understand due to their innovative nature, hasty application, and the legislative branch's tardiness in disseminating them. I am sure that these very difficulties will allay us of the urgent need to finally adopt the automatic methods used by the majority of countries at present. In this new electoral process, the Armed Forces did their duty as usual. This is a task they have been performing since 1958 as guarantors of the electoral process and respecters of the election results. The Armed Forces have reaffirmed their institutional role during these 35 years of democratic life. We will initiate a uniquely dramatic stage due to the urgent need to solve problems accumulated over decades. The state's present structure cannot bear the weight of these problems or the behavior of the country's fundamental sectors whose vision appears to have been anchored in a remote time in the past: a sparsely populated Venezuela, a debt-free government, and an oil revenue whose daily increase solved, or, even better, avoided every problem. This was a Venezuela living under a gold bell, but this time is over. The various sectors must agree on a truce for an understanding for the success of the leaders whom the country elected as its legitimate governors on 5 December. The governments' difficulties resulted from, among other causes, an economy in transition, dominated by our lacking capacity for continuing to produce riches based on the income distribution system and on petroleum income, which no longer covers our needs nor does it allow us to continue to finance an easy lifestyle. Difficulties have also been caused by dissatisfaction, as each one has a reason to feel frustrated by a deficient economic performance after years of discontinued economic policies, often incoherent, whose common denominator, until shortly ago, was attempting to perpetuate the system of living off of rent at the expense of huge economic distortions and visible inefficiencies. Difficulties were caused by pressures from groups, sectors, and institutions that aspire to continue to live off state funds. Difficulties were caused by the high fiscal deficit due to insufficient ordinary income, rigid spending with little productivity, and the weakening of petroleum income based on the traditional schemes. Difficulties were caused by the profound deterioration of the state's structure, of its internal control system, and, therefore, of its operational efficiency. Difficulties are becoming bigger each day and the effects are more harmful each day, as they generate defensive attitudes, mistrust, and instability because they harshly strike the sectors of lower income. The nation must provide the next government with active and permanent support throughout its term to allow it to eliminate conflicts by substituting them with agreements, stopping the deterioration in the distribution of income, and eliminating the dangers of social violence, in a word, so that it can, with national support, create a time of strategic consensus in which today there is only mixed-up words and confused intentions. The government over which I preside understood that its basic responsibility was to conclude a constitutional period and guide the country to elections, but it also understood its duty of guiding the economic transition with responsibility and not differing the solution of problems but confronting them to prevent the imbalances from growing. We have tried to ensure that the political and economic transition over which we are presiding would have the least possible impact on Venezuela. Part of this context was the government initiative for assuming the responsibility of the Special Powers Law; we did this to leave an important contribution in the areas of the greatest priority to contribute toward setting Venezuela on the path to a healthy economic growth. We undertook banking legislation reform, which is necessary for strengthening and modernizing the financial system and making it more efficient. We undertook reforms to the housing policy as well as to the system of the mortgage debtors to bolster housing construction for the disadvantaged social groups to obtain the most from the resources the state and depositors may allocate toward this goal. We took on the responsibility of creating new taxes during very difficult election times with the conviction that every Venezuelan must contribute to the state expenditures in order for us to become permanent fiscal overseers of how Treasury funds are used; these are essential for correcting the fiscal deficit, and we considered the fact that we will never get rid of that deficit by simply cutting the budget or asking for more contributions from the petroleum industry. We did it because a chronic fiscal deficit has been feeding inflation and will continue to interfere with and threaten national stability if proper corrective measures are not taken soon. This situation -- a situation stemming from a large foreign debt that was supposed to bring about the resources necessary for its own amortization -- in practice did not yield the expected results, and, instead, it grievously burdened public finances. Along with this, we must add the great changes that have taken place in the oil market over the past few years and the scant political willingness to check our increasing public expenditures. We have taken up this task as the first step in a new fiscal order because it is urgent to take simultaneous action in both public spending and fiscal revenues. A sizable portion of the fiscal deficit has been compensated for through devaluation, which has become a tax in disguise which affects all sectors but weighs more heavily on the lower income classes. In addition, this disguised tax has not resulted in substantial increases in nontraditional exports as originally intended. The government's administrative actions in the essential areas of local politics, international relations, economy, finances, and other areas will be discussed in detail in the speech we will present to Congress this coming January. During our government's tenure, we have witnessed a stronger national willingness to create the basis for a sincere understanding to overcome the difficulties impeding our progress. This certainty is the result of countless discussions, consultations, and proposals presented to those who represent the most diverse local sectors. This is the singular voice of all regions. The Catholic Church has been present at all times in the search for a way out. Political, entrepreneurial, and labor sectors, and universities and citizens agree that today, more than ever, there is a willingness to join forces and lay aside rivalries to resolve the crisis. Venezuela will indeed resolve its crisis, and 1994 will mark the beginning of a recovery by the hand of the new government aided by the national determination to cope with problems and resolve them positively, fully aware of the new country's demands. Venezuela will overcome its crisis because we are participants in an unprecedented political transition that has proven the validity of our allegiance to democracy. Venezuela will overcome the crisis because its main problems have been identified. Some problems are being resolved, while others remain in the hands of the government that a great many people elected for five years, thereby demonstrating their trust. Venezuela will overcome the crisis because it is increasingly understood that inflation is the worst evil which needs to be corrected. This understanding is necessary to take action to fight this evil, and this is always difficult. Venezuela will overcome the crisis because it has realized that the straightening out of finances is necessary and cannot be postponed, and this fact must be faced not only through a more efficient and honest administration, but also with income generated through taxes. It has been demonstrated that the framework established in 1992 -- reforms to the organic laws on public credits, the budget system, and the Central Bank Law -- is a useful tool that is changing the trends in events and is revealing the fact that there is a fiscal crisis, that this has harmful effects, that essential solutions must be found without a delay in facing problems, that requests made to the treasury must be rational, and that we must recognize that some demands cannot be met, as in the recent past, because the costs of not recognizing this would have to be covered by the rest of society by means of inflation and high interest rates resulting from fiscal deficits. The crisis will be overcome because the country's leaders know it is urgent and necessary to face this difficult social situation, because the poverty levels are increasingly high, because imbalances in income are becoming intolerable, and because of persisting deficiencies in the institutional capabilities of the social sector -- that is, the public and private organizations that provide essential social services. We are dedicated to making reforms that distribute the costs of the adjustments policy. The big differences that exist are the main cause of social discontent. The crisis will be overcome because the Venezuelan people reject and want to fight the degradation of moral values; because the Venezuelan people are prepared to face the challenge of modern times; and because the new generations have professional scientific, business, and management training and know that there have been global changes that demand that we understand and participate in the integration process. The crisis will be overcome in order that the Venezuelans, thanks to the work and creativeness of all, may again believe in the possibility of every new generation living better than the previous one and in building a society capable of generating enough well-being that will enable it to again be a country with hopes. On the threshold of 1994, I wish all the Venezuelan people and those who have decided to live in Venezuela the best of life. Have a good day. [applause]
