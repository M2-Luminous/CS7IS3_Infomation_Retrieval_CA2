This fact has been noted by various international quarters. The UN Special Commission has also confirmed that Iraq has respected its commitments and obligations despite the injustice done to it. This reminds us once again of the fact that reciprocal obligations of both Iraq and the UN Security Council, in accordance with the Council's own resolutions, require an immediate move to implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 which stipulates that the oil embargo should be lifted without any delay to enable Iraq to secure its immediate food and medical needs. Within the contexts of justice and logic, any fair observer must view with surprise any attempt to bypass this fact and delay the lifting of the embargo, or any attempt to use the suffering of the Iraqi people as a card for extortion and cheap bargaining to achieve certain political objectives that are rejected in part and parcel and infringe on the Iraqis' right to possess their free will. To be clearer, we refer to statements made by some people on "confidence building" and the suspect call for delaying a resolution to end the embargo until the conditions for that "building" are established. These statements are part of the maneuvers mastered by the United States, which seeks to involve others in these maneuvers, prevent them from seeing what is right, and place them in the whirlpool of the U.S. hostile objectives that run contrary to legitimacy and the principles of right and justice. Confidence building between Iraq, the Security Council, and the Special Commission with a view to ending the injustice and the wrongdoing done to the Iraqi people is an immediate, important, and a required thing to do. It can be achieved through understanding and the fair objective perspective that is free from ulterior motives and evil purposes. It requires all the parties concerned to recognize that Iraq has done all it can to sincerely fulfill its obligations and commitments. On the other hand, "confidence building" cannot be done through maneuvers; the attempt to dismiss facts; ignoring the suffering of the Iraqi children, women, and old people; or drifting behind the games of this or that international party that agreed to be a false witness in the greatest moral and human scandal seen by the world in the late 20th century. We know very well that the United States and its lackeys do not wish the truth to emerge or the embargo to end. However, we also know that the Security Council issued a specific resolution that included reciprocal obligations, which Iraq has fulfilled. The Security Council should now fulfill its own obligations and lift the embargo and put an end to this flagrant violation of everything legitimate, humane, and just.
