FR941027-0-00003 FR941027-0-00001 Currently, the California raisin industry is carrying a very large supply (approximately 4,000 tons) of 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 crop Zante Currants and projects a record production (approximately 6,500 tons) in 1994&hyph;95. The trade is aware of this supply problem and forward purchases from handlers have decreased. Sales are not expected to increase until corrective pricing action is taken by handlers. Before that can begin, however, handlers need assurance that the value of some of their free Zante Currant inventories from the 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 production years can be reduced to the recently established $980 per ton 1994&hyph;95 free tonnage Zante Currant field price, thus reducing their potential losses on existing free raisin inventory. Suspending the penultimate sentence in ยง989.67(j) can assure this protection, as it will allow the Committee to sell 1994 crop reserve tonnage to handlers for free use at a lower price than the established field price. The Committee plans to offer handlers one ton of 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currant reserve raisins at $100 per ton for every four tons of free Zante Currants held by them on July 31, 1994. Purchasing free tonnage 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currants at $980 per ton and reserve Zante Currants at $100 per ton in accordance with this formula will allow handlers' inventories to achieve an approximate net value of $980 per ton. In the absence of the suspension, these price adjustments could not be accomplished. In the absence of such adjustments, the industry could not compete effectively with foreign-produced currants without substantial losses on the part of packers and producers. Moreover, a significant loss in foreign markets could result. A loss of domestic markets to foreign imports could also result. In recommending its action, the Committee recognized that it would be selling a portion of the reserve raisins at a price well below the cost of producing raisins, and that the net proceeds to equity holders would be quite low. In the absence of this action, open price contracting between producers and handlers on 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currant deliveries was a possibility because of the excess supplies and inflated value of the inventory. On the basis of the Committee's recommendation, handlers did not use open price contracting but instead in negotiations with the Raisin Bargaining Association (Association) agreed to pay producers the aforementioned $980 per ton price for free tonnage Zante Currants. Without the inventory adjustment program, very low prices for all 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currants were likely. The Association is a cooperative which bargains sales terms with independent handlers on behalf of its producer members. It is recognized that the effects of this action on individual entities will vary depending on their financial conditions and their equities in the reserve pool. However, the impact is not expected to be significant. In the long term, the benefits of becoming more competitive under current marketing conditions should outweigh any adverse short-term impact and result in benefits to all industry entities. The domestic inventory price adjustment accomplished through this action will permit an overall price reduction for handlers' sales of Zante Currants, enabling the industry to compete more effectively with lower-priced foreign-produced currants, and to more aggressively market Zante Currants in the interest of maintaining and expanding existing domestic and foreign markets and in developing new markets. The net result of this action is likely to be positive as a result of increased marketings of Zante Currants at reduced prices. On the basis of all of the foregoing, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee, it is determined that: (1) There has been a change of economic or marketing conditions to warrant the sale of Zante Currant reserve raisins to handlers to provide them with raisins to sell as free tonnage, pursuant to section 989.67(j), and (2) under the conditions presently existing in the raisin industry, the penultimate sentence in section 989.67(j) does not now tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act and is hereby suspended with regard to Zante Currants pursuant to section 989.91(b). However, such suspension shall continue only through July 31, 1995, at which time it shall terminate and the suspended sentence will become operative again beginning August 1, 1995. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) Producers and handlers have been conducting their marketing operations on the premise that the value of the 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 Zante Currants carried into the 1994&hyph;95 season would be averaged down to the 1994&hyph;95 negotiated free tonnage price; (2) the Committee met on October 5, 1994, and computed and announced preliminary free and reserve tonnage percentages for Zante Currant raisins; (3) prompt implementation of this action is necessary to prevent disruption in the marketplace; and (4) the industry is aware of this action, which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting.
