Probably not as general as Mr Peter Sutherland would have wished, the agreement nevertheless has brought the world remarkably close to becoming a single market. Not all wrinkles have been ironed out. Entertainment still eludes a negotiated settlement. So do intellectual property rights. Resentment lingers over proposals to phase out subsidies on agriculture and civil aviation. Financial services have been grudgingly admitted into local markets. There is talk of a general agreement on trade in services to take up what the Uruguay Round has left unfinished. Yet there can be no denying the current round's achievement. GATT proposes to slash tariffs by an average of one third and reduce non-tariff barriers--quotas, subsidies, taxes--with the ultimate goal of fuelling global economic expansion. By some estimates to the tune of at least $200 billion annually by the year 2002. The European Union, China and Japan are slated to be the biggest gainers. The rest of Asia, which gets the smallest piece of the enlarged world trade pie, is expected to net an additional $10 billion annually by 2002. India, whose exports in 1992-93 accounted for 0.4 per cent of global exports, too is hoping for a $200 million gain annually. Which is what the third world, having watched the Airbus-Boeing battles from the sidelines, can hope to extract out of a comprehensive agreement on multilateral trade. GATT offers the third world between 15 and 20 per cent of the increased world trade. Far more than it can expect by way of loans, aid and capital transfers. But all of this is on paper. GATT has merely opened up the possibilities. Whether they are transformed into real gains is solely dependent on member nations. In the expanded world trade as the GATT envisages, there will be some winners and some losers. Apart from protection, members are left to their own to devise favourable trade balances. While India may be insignificant in the trading world, trade is by no means insignificant for India. Its $18.42 billion exports constituted 7.6 per cent of its gross domestic product in 1992-93, and its $21.73 billion imports, 9 per cent of the GDP. However, an increase in the volume of trade by $200 million annually does not mean much unless it goes towards improving India's trade balance. So when Mr Pranab Mukherjee assures a baying Opposition that India's share of the increased action would be in the region of $200 million, nothing is actually being said. There is no attempt to explain how India expects to climb out of its consistent trade deficit. Since 1950, the country has had trade surpluses in only two years. And trade models have very little to offer by way of optimism for Indian exports. The GATT edifice is built around Ricardian comparative advantage. The "I make gin you make rum and we trade" principle. Comparative advantage would imply that India exports labour intensive goods and services to buy capital intensive imports. But while India has an overabundant labour supply there is very little evidence that it is cheap. Low productivity, a narrow skill base and government induced wage distortions makes Indian labour a costly proposition. Since capital too is scarce, the Indian trade experience falls into that arcane extreme of theory--that of absolute advantage. India has an absolute disadvantage in labour, as well as capital intensive exports. Forty years of trade deficits bear this out. With absolute disadvantage, a country has little reason to trade. But this is without taking technology into consideration. As a theory, factor intensive comparative advantage is constrained by a set of extremely restrictive assumptions. Benefit to trading partners accrues if technologies are assumed identical and static, there are no economies of scale and products and factors are undifferentiated. The real world is not so rarefied. Expansions of Exxon and Mitsubishi contradict the economies of scale assumption. And growth rates of the Asian tigers shows how futile it would be to ignore technology in a trade model. Efforts have been made to incorporate technological dynamics into trade theory. The techno-economic models are based on the mushrooming of sunrise industries in the Pacific Rim. But Nehruvian isolation kept India blissfully unaware of last decade's information revolution. The share of new technology imports in India's total import bill is now around 64 per cent. This ratio is increasing. Only 19 per cent of Indian exports are in these areas, that too in the lower market segments such as software programming and computer peripherals. With economic restructuring exports may have picked up, but India still has a long way to go before trade begins to propel growth of the economy. It is a reflection on the general ignorance about the country's trade prospects that Indian opposition to GATT centres around emotive clauses where we have in fact extracted considerable mileage, in seed and drug patenting, for instance. Despite India's trade prospects, GATT offers more to India in terms of capital flows than it could expect through aid, loans or investment. As such, trade earnings are the least tied up source of foreign exchange. However, GATT imposes pressure on the reform process. Balance of payments considerations in a freer world trade regime are likely to hasten the government's move to free exchange and interest rates. And global competition will force the government's hand on the exit policy. This is another area where the Opposition has failed to make hay. To other countries, GATT has revolved around jobs, jobs and jobs. But employment ramifications of freer trade seem to have been lost on the Indian politician. Admittedly, GATT phases out trade barriers over 10 years, but at the end of it there is going to be an immense global displacement of labour. Freetrade is not only about free movement of products. Factors of production, labour and capital, must also be free to move across national borders. Through GATT, the North has, in a way, legalised the mobility of capital, but there is little in the Uruguay round's agreement to enhance labour mobility. The United States, to a certain extent, introduced the issue of labour mobility by bringing services into GATT's ambit in 1986. But an ideal free trade agreement should make it as easy for a Filipino to work in a Pittsburg Steel plant as it would be for a London lawyer to offer his services to an Egyptian bank. But the process is not easy. Labour is typically more encumbered than capital and labour mobility is not an issue for economists alone. Social, political, cultural and racial considerations have a large role to play in determining immigration levels. No infringement of these interests is likely to be tolerated for the sake of economic efficiency. In this respect, GATT still has a long way to go. Till then, 85 per cent of the world's population will have to be content with 15 per cent of the gains from multinational trade agreements. For the third world to increase its bargaining power in subsequent trade negotiations, their markets will have to become indispensable to developed nations. To the extent that GATT has initiated the opening up of markets, its achievement is salutary.
