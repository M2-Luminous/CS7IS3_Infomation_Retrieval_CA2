Statistics show that last year farmers engaged in breeding of aquatic products achieved a per capita net income of 1,100 yuan, 300 yuan more than the corresponding figure for those farmers not engaged in cultivation of such products. Hubei, known to have a thousand lakes and dubbed as a "land of fish and rice", has a water area of 1.33 million hectares, of which more than 400,000 hectares have been used for breeding of aquatic products of various kinds. According to Che Guangbiao, director of the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Aquatic Products, over the past 15 years output of aquatic products of the province has increased by 50,000 tons a year. The output of aquatic products for 1993 surpassed one million tons, and the per capita availability of fresh water fish reached 16 kg in the province, ranking second in the country. Local officials attributed the quick development of the breeding sector to reform in circulation of aquatic products and the application of scientific methods in their cultivation. Thanks to the reform in circulation of aquatic products, traders representing different ownerships have all moved in to engage in the aquatic products trade, effectively solving the difficulty for growers of aquatic products in selling their products. A dozen scientific research institutes in Wuhan City, the provincial capital, boast more than 2,000 senior experts of aquatic products. Besides giving technical guidance to local farmers, researchers with these institutes have developed bait for young salmon and the artificial propagation of river crabs, as well as introduced approximately 40 new varieties of fish from abroad. The efforts have brought about great economic returns.
