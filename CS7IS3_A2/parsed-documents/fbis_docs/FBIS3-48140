Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press meeting that it is the common view that the package would be in place before the summit, referring to early comments by Vice Trade Minister Hideaki Kumano calling for the launching by the summit. Saito brushed aside the income tax cut issue, saying, "it will be decided by the economic problem forum" of the government and coalition parties. Noting that the third extra budget for fiscal 1993 and the fiscal 1994 budget are to follow the package, Saito said he hopes the political turmoil would subside to allow "various measures as soon as possible." Saito said the plunge in stock prices "stems from political uncertainties and other factors." But he rejected any effects from a possible delay in the economic package and budget. "We have never mentioned a date to compile the budget," he said, adding the package was not slated for release on the day and the failure of the political reform bills to pass the upper house of the Diet came only last Friday. Economic Planning Agency head Manae Kubota also said the implementation of economic stimulus measures by the government may be delayed until next month due to political uncertainty. Kubota told a news conference that parties in the ruling coalition have already reached a broad agreement on the contents of the economic package, except income tax cuts. The income tax reduction, however, is an important pillar of the package and it should not be excluded from the program, she said. She said political reforms must be implemented at all costs because the issue will be a major driving force for economic recovery.
