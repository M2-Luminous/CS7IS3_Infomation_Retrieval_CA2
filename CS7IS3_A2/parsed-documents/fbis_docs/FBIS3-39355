Will we achieve an acceptable agreement or will our entry be delayed? [Vranitzky] Against the background of so many conflicting reports, people tend to ignore one thing, namely that this is a poker game. As in all poker-like negotiations, the parties start out with their maximum demands, for example the European Union's position contained in the agricultural paper is, of course, an extreme position that could never become reality. [KURIER] So you are sure that Brussels will make concessions on some of the tough positions it confronted us with in the spheres of agriculture and transit? [Vranitzky] Yes. And I know that from my experience. Four years ago, when we worked out the transit agreement, there were many people in the European Union and also in Austria who said that such an agreement is impossible -- while now we have such an agreement. A few days ago, we could hear that a duration of only three years could be conceded, while during the visit of the German transport minister yesterday, the position sounds different again. [KURIER] If the European Union were to commit itself to achieving a 60 percent reduction in exhausts, would we be ready to compromise and not insist on the full duration of the transit agreement? [Vranitzky] We want to bring to fruit efforts that improve the transport situation and the ecological situation. [KURIER] But there are serious voices that ask whether the transit agreement has really brought a significant reduction of exhausts in Austria? [Vranitzky] One effect is that trucks have been modernized. [KURIER] But the second effect is also that foreign trucks have increased their loads and forwarding agents are putting up with higher fines. [Vranitzky] We must not neglect the awareness that has also increased in our neighboring countries. We have received signals from Germany: Do not give up your position on the transit agreement, because it is a model for other European regions, too. After all, we must not forget East-West transit. [KURIER] According to all recent surveys, people are taking incredible interest in the European Union at the moment. The point now should be to convince the population of the European Union not only with facts, but also on the emotional level. What is your answer to a primitive argument such as that unemployment is much higher in the European Union than in Austria, and that if we join, unemployment will go up here, as well. [Vranitzky] First, the reason that unemployment is lower in Austria is that the quality of our products and the hard work of our economy enable us to sell our products to these 12 countries. Second, these countries are continuously moving closer together. So, if we remain outside, it is obvious that our exports to the EU will become more and more difficult and, thus, also the protection of our jobs. Third, even today we suffer from being outside. These disadvantages would increase. [KURIER] Industry has said it would leave the country unless we join the European Union. [Vranitzky] Not everybody will emigrate, but one has to take such threats very seriously. I have always warned against looking at the issue solely from the current point of view. Between February and July 1994, no spectacular changes will take place. Yet, what will we tell the workers and employees five years from now, when many investments in industry will not have taken place? [KURIER] You have been criticized for the statement that Austria is seeking EU membership without if's and but's. [Vranitzky] My point was to document that this is a vital issue for our country. Still, without if's and but's does not mean giving up one's positions in the negotiations. [KURIER] Another argument against is: The significant economic decline in 1993, unemployment, farmers' demonstrations, the job action in the German metal industry -- that is the European Union; should we really join it? [Vranitzky] Or even more strongly: The European Union cannot solve the Yugoslavia crisis. Then there are the monetary turbulences, the fall in stock exchange prices. Particularly because a second Yugoslavia must be prevented, one has to support the political network. Particularly because hundreds of millions [no currency specified] have been lost, one needs to coordinate monetary policy. [KURIER] What would you tell the Austrians in a single headline on the current situation in the EU discussion? A one-sentence message. [Vranitzky] That is not easy. What the opponents of the European Union are trying to convince the people of is the threatening loss of identity, the being mixed into an all-European mash. Yet, the exact opposite is true; particularly because we want to preserve our independence, particularly because we want to maintain our character as a small, efficient people at a sensible border line, we must not remain isolated when others embark on a joint course. Brussels headquarters has existed for 35 years. Yet, not a single citizen of Wuppertal has turned into a Belgian. [KURIER] Another argument brought forth by many is that Germany dominates the European Union, and that accession would be a second Anschluss. [Vranitzky] In reality, we would become more dependent on Germany if we remained outside. [KURIER] We have another month. Can we do it or not? [Vranitzky] You want an answer to be published in your newspaper or a private answer? [KURIER] First for the newspaper, and then a private one. [Vranitzky] I am giving you one answer for both, and it is: yes.
