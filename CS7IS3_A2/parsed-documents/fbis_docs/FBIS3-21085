Speaking at the launch of the UK Technology Foresight Programme, Mr Waldegrave said: "The Technology Foresight Programme provides us all with an opportunity to improve the way in which the UK's scientific and technological strengths are harnessed to wealth creation and improving the quality of life. The Programme can succeed only if industry, academia and Government work together to create the partnerships and networks which are essential for achieving these goals. I can assure you that Government will play its part. I look to industry and academia to do the same." At the launch the 15 sectors to be covered by the foresight process were announced. Panels of 15-20 people will be appointed for each sector to take forward the foresight process. Each panel will be led by a Chairman and Vice Chairman and where possible an industrialist will be appointed to one position and an academic to the other. Panel Chairmen are already being appointed and five were announced today. These were: -- Dr David Grant, Director of Technology, GEC [General Electric Company] plc will be Chairman of the Manufacturing, Production and Business Processes Panel -- Professor John Hillman FRSE, Director, Scottish Crop Research Institute will be Chairman of the Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Panel - Dr John Campbell, Chief Technology Officer, Cookson Group plc will be Chairman of the Materials Panel - Dr Alan Calder, General Manager R&D, Zeneca Specialities will be Chairman of the Chemicals Panel - Mr H Nahapiet, John Mowlem plc will be Chairman of the Construction Panel. Mr Waldegrave stressed the importance of existing networks, such as trade associations, which already conduct specialised foresight activities and for the Technology Foresight Programme to take advantage of these. Consultation and partnership lies at the heart of the foresight process, Mr Waldegrave said - "Technology foresight is a programme which needs to be driven by the vision of our industrialists and our scientists - a programme which they in turn need to own, since many if its key benefits - closer working partnerships, better information about future opportunities - will be for them to exploit. "For its part, the Government is determined to do all it can to involve all sectors involved in the foresight process. Not only companies which already have close links with the science base. We need to go wider and encourage other companies to benefit from our strengths in science and technology." The Technology Foresight Programme is due to report its results in early 1995. Notes To Editors 1. The White Paper, "Realising our Potential: A Strategy for Science, Engineering and Technology", announced the Government's intention to launch a Technology Foresight Programme. This is a means of building a consensus on those generic technologies where new developments are likely to yield the greatest economic and social benefits to the UK in the long term. The results will better inform government and industry in making decisions about funding research and development. 2. During spring 1994 the sectoral panels will carry out the initial foresight work, drawing together existing expertise. A preliminary report will then be produced setting out perceived market and technological developments in their sectors over the next 10-20 years. 3. The panels will then consult even wider before the Technology Foresight Steering Group will draw together sectoral views during the autumn. The Steering Group and panels will then assess priorities within and across sectors, taking account of the strengths and weaknesses in UK industry, science and technology.
