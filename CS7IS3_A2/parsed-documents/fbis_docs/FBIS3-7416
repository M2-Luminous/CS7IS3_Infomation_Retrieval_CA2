The draft, obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, says the panel's job will include examining links between trade and the environment, charges and taxes for environmental purposes, and ways of settling disputes. Negotiators are to meet in April in Marrakesh, Morocco, to sign the final accord on the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. The seven-year talks were concluded in December, when it was provisionally agreed to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under whose auspices they were held, with a World Trade Organization (WTO). Despite a proposal that panels to be set up by the WTO should include one on the environment, developing countries were concerned that industrial countries might use environmental concerns as an excuse to adopt protectionist measures. In an apparent bid to ease such concerns, the panel's remit will include looking at the effect of environmental measures on market access, sources close to the negotiators said. The committee will report to a ministerial meeting after two years, and that meeting will decide whether the panel should be kept or disbanded, the draft shows. The sources said the draft will be confirmed at the trade negotiation committee of GATT next Wednesday, and will be formally signed by ministers of the negotiating countries in Marrakesh.
