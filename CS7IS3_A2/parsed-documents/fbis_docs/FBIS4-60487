FBIS4-60487 "drnes101_l_94001" FBIS-NES-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 ISRAEL Reaction to 'Arafat Decree on Pre-1967 Laws Reaction to 'Arafat Decree on Pre-1967 Laws Correspondent Details Decree TA2405152694 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 1400 GMT 24 May 94 TA2405152694 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Text] Two East Jerusalem papers today carry a decree by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat which orders that the civilian and religious courts in the areas of the autonomy are to reinstate the laws that prevailed in the territories before June 1967. The PLO Executive Committee will announce the names of the 24 members of the autonomy's Administrative Council tomorrow. Our Arab affairs correspondent Oren Kohen reports: [Kohen] The decree cancels most of the military laws that pertain to civilian matters, and restores the situation to that which prevailed in the territories before the Israeli occupation. This was stated today by Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn from Gaza in reaction to a decree PLO head Yasir 'Arafat published today. According to the decree, as of 20 May, the courts in the area of autonomy again follow the laws that existed there before June 1967. 'Arafat published the decree in East Jerusalem newspapers today. He calls on the civilian and religious courts to again function in the manner they did before June 1967. Egypt has not changed the laws that prevailed in Gaza since the days of the British mandate and Israel added military regulations to them. At the same time, the Jordanian law is still valid in Jericho. The step 'Arafat has taken stands in contradiction to the agreements he signed with Israel, or at least this is the Foreign Ministry's view. The ministry claims that any change made in the laws in the autonomy areas require an a-priori Israeli agreement. The legal situation in the territories is not yet sufficiently clear because Israel has not yet transferred the administrative powers to the council that 'Arafat was supposed to be name three weeks ago. The PLO Executive Council is slated to announce the final composition of the council tomorrow, assuming that 'Arafat's attempts to nominate them do not fail once again. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 24 May adds: "Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer said today that if indeed 'Arafat announced the cancellation of the laws Israel had applied in the territories, it is a gross violation of the agreement Israel and the PLO signed. 'Arafat's declaration, Singer says, is tantamount to making the entire agreement null and void. The legal adviser told our correspondent Shlomo Raz that 'Arafat has no legislative authority in Gaza and Jericho. Only the Palestinian Authority has such powers, and it has not yet arrived and has not started operating; furthermore, this power as well is subject to an Israeli veto." A similar report by Shlomo Raz on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT on 24 May adds that "'Arafat's decree is legally meaningless."]
