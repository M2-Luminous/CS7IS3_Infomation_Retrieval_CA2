The protest coincided with Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh's arrival here Tuesday on a four-day visit. Anh is expected to discuss the plight of the 8,000 mostly Vietnamese refugees with President Suharto. Indonesia and Vietnam in October signed an agreement for the refugees' voluntary repatriation. A diplomat here, who requested anonymity, said he believed the protestors numbered around 1,000 but said he had no precise figure for those on hunger strike. He said 72 people had been treated for dehydratation by the local Red Cross. The SUARA PEMBARUAN daily said Monday that 500 refugees were on hunger strike and that 79 people had been hospitalized. A spokesman for police chief Major General Kusparmono Irsan was quoted by the paper as saying a police team from Riau province had been sent to calm the situation on the island, just south of Singapore. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) temporarily withdrew from Galang after the protest erupted. But the diplomat said the UNHCR might send an official back there Wednesday to help restore calm. Military authorities with jurisdiction over the island declined comment saying that they had not yet received full data about the incidents. The diplomat said the camp protest started Thursday. Only about 800 of the 8,000 Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees are due to be resettled in third countries, namely Australia, the United States and Canada. About 100,000 people have been transferred to third countries since the camp opened in 1975. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Monday that Indonesia intended to clear the island which has served as a transit centre for boat people into an industrial zone. The Batam Development Agency, which is responsible for the development of the bonded zone in Batam island, also south of Singapore, wants to expand the region's rapid economic and industrial growth to nearby Rempang and Galang islands.
