And he said that once the frame of reference of such mediation had been set, he would personally be willing to start campaigning for an election. The IFP Central Committee would decide on Friday whether the party should provisionally register before the Friday midnight deadline for the April election. Addressing journalists and businessmen in Cape Town, Mr Buthelezi said he had "come to the end" of the current constitutional road. "Only this international mediation might open a new chapter," he said in answer to a question at a press conference after he had addressed the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce. Mr Buthelezi revealed that the Freedom Alliance had, at a meeting in Cape Town earlier on Thursday, accepted international mediation in principle to resolve South Africa' constitutional deadlock. He told the business luncheon -- at which he had arrived about an hour late because of the Alliance meeting -- that he had "just been told" that the African National Congress [ANC] working committee had also decided in principle there should be international mediation. Mr Buthelezi and ANC President Nelson Mandela agreed in a joint statement after meeting in Durban on Tuesday that the possibility of international mediation should be explored to resolve outstanding constitutional deadlocks. Mr Buthelezi told the businessmen on Thursday that the interim constitution, as it stood, would give rise to the politics of violent recrimination when it was found that "it polarises South Africa and destroys the prospects of producing the national unity in which there will emerge the national will to establish a democracy and make it work".
