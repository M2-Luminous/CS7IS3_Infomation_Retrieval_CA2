Organo-metallic compounds of aluminum, gallium or indium having a purity (metal basis) better than 99.999 percent; b. Organo-arsenic, organo-antimony and organo-phosphorus compounds having a purity (inorganic element basis) better than 99.999 percent. Note: 3C03A controls only compounds whose metallic, partly metallic or non-metallic element is directly linked to carbon in the organic part of the molecule. 3C04A Hydrides of phosphorus, arsenic or antimony, having a purity better than 99.999 percent, even diluted in inert gases or hydrogen. Requirements Validated License Required: QSTVWYZ Unit: $ value Reason for Control: NS GLV: $3,000 GCT: Yes GFW: No Note: 3C04A does not control hydrides containing 20 percent molar or more of inert gases or hydrogen. 33. In Category 3, ECCN 3D94F is amended by revising the heading of the entry to read as follows: 3D94F ``Software'' specially designed for the ``development'', ``production'', or ``use'' of electronic devices or components controlled by 3A92, electronic test equipment controlled by 3A93, general purpose electronic equipment controlled by 3A94, or manufacturing and test equipment controlled by 3B91. * * * * * 34. In Category 3, ECCN 3E94F is amended by revising the heading of the entry to read as follows: 3E94F Technology for the ``development'', ``production'', or ``use'' of electronic devices or components controlled by 3A92, electronic test equipment controlled by 3A93, general purpose electronic equipment controlled by 3A94, or manufacturing and test equipment controlled by 3B91. * * * * * 35. In Category 3, under the heading ``Notes for Category 3'' following ECCN 3E96G, Advisory Note 4 is removed and reserved. 36. In Category 4 (Computers), ECCN 4A03A is revised to read as follows: 4A03A ``Digital computers'', ``assemblies'', and related equipment therefor, as described in this entry, and specially designed components therefor. Requirements Validated License Required: QSTVWYZ Unit: Computers and peripherals in number; parts and accessories in $ value Reason for Control: NS, MT, NP, FP (see Notes) GLV: $5,000 GCT: Yes, except MT and FP, and except supercomputers as defined in ยง776.11(a) (no supercomputer restriction for Japan); see Notes GFW: Yes, except MT and FP (see Notes), for computers with a CTP not exceeding 1,000 Mtops (500 Mtops for eligible countries listed in Supp. 4 to Part 778 of this subchapter) and specially designed components therefor, exported separately or as part of a system, and related equipment therefor when exported with these computers as part of a system. N.B. 1: General License GFW is not available for the export of commodities that the exporter knows will be used to: a. Enhance the performance capability (i.e., CTP) of a computer to the ``supercomputer'' level; or b. Enhance the performance capability of a ``supercomputer'' (see ยง776.11 for definition of ``supercomputer''). N.B. 2: To determine whether General License GFW may be used to export related equipment controlled under another entry in the CCL, consult the GFW paragraph under the Requirements heading of the appropriate entry. Notes: 1. MT controls apply to digital computers used as ancillary equipment for test facilities and equipment that are controlled by 9B05 or 9B06. 2. NP controls apply to computers with a CTP exceeding 500 Mtops to countries listed in Supplement No. 4 to Part 778 of this subchapter. 3. FP controls apply to computers for computerized fingerprint equipment to all destinations except Australia, Japan, New Zealand and members of NATO. 4. FP controls apply to all destinations, except Japan, for supercomputers (see ยง776.11 of this subchapter).
