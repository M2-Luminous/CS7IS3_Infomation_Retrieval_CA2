Stepan, who is currently chairman of the People's Union of National and Social Salvation (LUNSZ), told journalists he considered it absurd for a "person from a friendly Slav country to come here with the handicap of being followed." He said that as LUNSZ chairman and as a Czech citizen he would watch Zhirinovskiy's views with interest and would "read between the lines." Jan Vik, spokesman of the Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) which invited Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic, said today that no matter whether the visit took place in several days or later it would be very welcomed. Zhirinovskiy is a Russian ultra-nationalist and chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which emerged victorious in the Russian parliamentary elections recently. Stepan said that Zhirinovskiy had become a victim of an international information conspiracy. He said that a period of strengthening of pan-Slavic solidarity is approaching, so that "300 million Slavs not to find themselves in the position of nations subservient to overlord nations," the latter being the "advanced" states.
