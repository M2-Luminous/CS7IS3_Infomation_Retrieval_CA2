Although this did not make the Republic Party look like a one-man party, it nevertheless was based on your person. [Palotas] We probably need more time to analyze the campaign strategies, but I do not think this played a role in the election results. The citizens did not want to choose between people. No one was interested in what the programs of various political parties contained. [Kobli] But one could not know in advance that this would be the case. [Palotas] In that case, one cannot know for sure that the strategy would have failed either. The Republic Party deliberately placed the responsibility on one person, while it presented its professional programs with the help of its experts. I do not want to argue, but the Republic Party presented the largest number of experts to the public. It is impossible to tell whether this was a good campaign or a bad one according to the election results. Therefore, the concept did not fail; it is another matter whether our campaign could have focused on other things. It is possible that a simplified program would have received greater attention. This is where I see possibilities for analysis. [passage omitted] [Kobli] Irrespective of the fact that your party has not made it into parliament, in your view is there any justification for a nonideological party in Hungary? [Palotas] The present situation shows that there is no justification for such a party. We created a political formation that will be characteristic in Western Europe only in five or 10 years. I wanted not only to catch up with the Western processes but also to precede them. However, the present elections in Hungary were like the ones in the developed democracies 20 years ago. I do not want to lose my optimism, and I hope I will not have to come to the conclusion that there are no chances for such a political formation in Hungary. [Kobli] According to some views, the small parties should be gathered together. [Palotas] It was said at our National Committee meeting that the appearance of the Entrepreneurs' Party, the Agrarian Alliance, and the Republic Party as some kind of a common force would increase the voters' confidence in us. One should not be hasty, but perhaps we can talk about this after the elections. However, this requires the will of all the aforementioned parties, and we should also know better what we want. Therefore, although I do not want to make a positive result out of a negative election result, I must nevertheless say that several quite well-known political parties that have been present on the Hungarian political arena for four or five years fared considerably worse than the Republic Party.
