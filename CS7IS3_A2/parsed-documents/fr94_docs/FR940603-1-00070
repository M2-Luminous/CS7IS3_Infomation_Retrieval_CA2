FR940603-1-00070 FR940603-1-00009 (b) The time of Completion of Construction shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without fault of the Bidder, including Acts of God, fires, strikes, floods, inability to obtain materials, changes in the Specifications as herein provided and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible: Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Bidder unless within ten (10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension of time the Bidder shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner. (c) In the sequence of construction, the Owner, acting through the Engineer, shall have the right to direct the Bidder to perform any part or parts of the work which is to be performed at the site of the Project before any other part or parts, of such work and the Bidder agrees to comply with all such directions. The Bidder shall comply with all other reasonable directions of the Owner. (d) The Owner, acting through the Engineer, may from time to time during the progress of the construction of the Project make such changes, additions to or subtractions from the Plans and Specifications and sequence of construction provided for in the previous paragraph which are part of the Contractor's Proposal as conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if any change in the construction to be done shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be granted if the Bidder shall make a written request therefor to the Owner within ten (10) days after any such change is made. If the cost of the Project to the Bidder to make the change shall be increased or decreased, the contract price shall be amended by an amount equal to the reasonable cost hereof in accordance with a construction amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder and approved by the Administrator, 1 but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Bidder shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition. The reasonable cost of any increase or decrease in the contract price covered by contract amendment as outlined above, in the absence of other mutual agreement, shall be computed on the basis of the direct cost of materials, f.o.b. the site of the Project, plus the direct cost of labor necessary to incorporate such materials into the Project (including actual cost of payroll taxes and insurance, not to exceed ten percent of payroll cost of labor), plus XXX percent of the direct cost of materials and labor. Labor costs shall be limited to the direct costs for workmen and foremen. Costs for profit and overhead for subcontractors, if any, Bidder's main office overhead, job office overhead and superintendence shall not be included. 1 As long as the total price of this contract including all amendments is less than 120 percent of the original contract price as stated in the acceptance hereto, amendments executed on REA Form 238 are not subject to the approval of the Administrator. Whenever an amendment to this contract causes the total amended contract to exceed 120 percent of the original contract price, that amendment and all subsequent amendments to this contract shall be made subject to the approval of the Administrator. Section 4. The Bidder agrees that in the event this Proposal is accepted it will make available for use in connection with the proposed construction all necessary tools and equipment and qualified superintendents and foremen. Section 5. Supervision and Inspection. a. The Bidder will give sufficient supervision to the work, using its best skill and attention. The Bidder will carefully study and compare all drawings, specifications and other instructions and will at once report to the Owner any error, inconsistency or omission which it may discover. The Bidder shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where construction is being carried on. The Bidder shall also employ, in connection with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Bidder. b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor, if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the amount or kinds of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or Supervisor; but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal. c. The manner of construction of the Project, and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection, tests and approval of the Owner and the Administrator, and the Bidder shall furnish all information required by the Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials, and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the construction of the Project. The Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests and shall maintain an office at the site of the Project, with telephone service where obtainable and at least one office employee to whom directions and instructions of the Owner may be delivered.
