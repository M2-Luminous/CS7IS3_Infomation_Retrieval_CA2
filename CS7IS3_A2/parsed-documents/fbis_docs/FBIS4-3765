Yin Ching-feng and the arms-purchasing scandal surrounding his death. Military authorities discovered the activity of the underground society in the probe into the death of Yin, which began last December. Some suspected members of the organization are believed to have been deeply involved in the scandal, but the five unnamed admirals have not been charged with any crime. Vice Admiral Shih Tzuo-nhing, the convenor of the ad-hoc investigative group, told the Legislative Yuan Saturday [23 April] morning that the military prosecutor had interviewed 41 Navy sailors and officers who are suspected of being members of the "Ching Pang," or "Blue Gang," and 16 had admitted to the links. The Blue Gang reportedly had its start in the early Ching Dynasty, which ran from 1644 to 1911, and while little is known about the group's activities, it did play a prominent role in the establishment of central government powers over the warlords in the 1920's and 30's. Investigators said Yin was killed because he threatened to expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired military officers representing European companies paid active-duty officers for help in winning weapons contracts. Shih stressed he remains confident that the case will be cracked even though there is a lack of substantial evidence.
