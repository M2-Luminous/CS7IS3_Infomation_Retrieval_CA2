FR941128-2-00030 FR941128-2-00020 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Office of the Secretary Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS) for the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program agency: Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). action: Notice of availability. sumamry: The BMDO has finished and is now making available the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS). The purpose of the BMD Program is to develop the capabilities to protect both the United States, and those areas of vital interest to the United States (e.g., U.S. troops, allies, and friends) from ballistic missile attack. The BMD FPEIS analyzes the potential environmental impacts associated with the Preferred Action and three alternatives. The BMD Program consists of two segments, Theater Missile Defense (TMD) and National Missile Defense (NMD). TMD, though part of the BMD Program, has independent utility and is evaluated in its own PEIS. Under all alternatives in the BMD FPEIS, the acquisition of TMD system capabilities will continue as described in the TMD Record of Decision published in the Federal Register on August 11, 1994. Additional details about the TMD program may be found in the Final Theater Missile Defense Programmatic Life-Cycle Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command. The Preferred Action in the BMD FPEIS is to continue a focused approach to long-lead time technology development in the form of the NMD Technology Readiness Program. The Preferred Action is also the No Action Alternative as it is a continuation of current BMDO policy. The NMD Technology Readiness Program involves the development of existing and new technologies and test systems for ground- and space-based elements (excluding Space-Based interceptors). Research is to be focused to ensure the capability to deploy a limited NMD system in the next decade. Basic technology efforts will continue to infuse new advances as the program proceeds. Contingency planning and options development will also continue to be conducted to meet unexpected threats. The FPEIS also analyzes three System Acquisition Alternatives for the continued research and development of a BMD system capability by the Department of Defense (DoD). The environmental impacts of later life-cycle phases beyond research, development, and testing for these alternatives are discussed in the FPEIS to enhance future decision-making on whether and how the DoD could proceed with a BMD system. Alternatives to the Preferred Action analyzed in the FPEIS include: • Ground-and Space-Based Sensors and Ground and Space-Based Interceptors System Acquisition Alternative. Under this alternative, BMDO would proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to the Preferred Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would also allow for the acquisition of a Ground-and Space-Based NMD system to proceed to the development of a system capability. • All Ground-Based System Acquisition Alternative . Under this alternative, BMDO would also proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to the Preferred Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would allow for the acquisition of an All Ground-Based NMD system to proceed to the development of a system capability. • Ground-and Space-Based Sensors and Ground-Based Interceptors System Acquisition Alternative . Under this alternative, BMDO would proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to the Proposed Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would allow for the acquisition of a Ground-and Space-Based NMD system (without Space-Based Interceptors) to proceed to the development of a system capability. A Record of Decision on the BMD PEIS' alternatives will be made available no earlier than 30 days after this Notice of Availability (of the FPEIS) is published in the Federal Register . lead agency: Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. cooperating agencies: Department of Energy, National Aeronautical and Space Administration, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy. for further information contact: Major Thomas LaRock, OATSD/PA, Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;7100, (703) 697&hyph;5131.
