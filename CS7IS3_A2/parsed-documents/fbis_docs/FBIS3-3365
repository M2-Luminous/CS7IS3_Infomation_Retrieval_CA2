The session examined and approved the work report delivered by Vice Chairman Ye Xuanping on behalf of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee Standing Committee, as well as the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (Amendment)." It elected additional leading CPPCC National Committee members. CPPCC members attended the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress as non-voting delegates, and heard and discussed Premier Li Peng's government work report and other important reports. Displaying a highly responsible spirit, they offered many excellent opinions and suggestions regarding reform, opening up, modernization, and major issues that affect the vital interests of the broad masses of people. The session was democratic, realistic, united, and motivational. I. During the past year, people of all nationalities throughout the country seriously implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress; continued to advance along the course charted by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and scored new and tremendous achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization. During the past year, the CPPCC accommodated the new situation, carried forward its fine tradition, strengthened itself, and actively performed its various functions, thereby making new progress in all fields of work. CPPCC members earnestly studied Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; deepened their understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; further enhanced their awareness and initiative in fully implementing the basic line during the initial stage of socialism; conducted special investigations and studies on major issues regarding material and spiritual civilization; and scored a number of significantly valuable achievements. They also made great efforts to publicize and implement the principles of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems"; carried out a great deal of useful work in promoting the great cause of reunifying the motherland; actively fostered friendly contacts with other countries; enhanced friendship and cooperation between people in our country and in other parts of the world; strengthened CPPCC organs; and enlivened the work of various special committees under the CPPCC National Committee. Our work commanded widespread attention in all social sectors and generated extensive interest among people living abroad, demonstrating the CPPCC's important status and unique superiority in the country's political life. The work carried out by the current term of the CPPCC got off to a good start, laying the foundation for the work over the next four years. This year is of vital importance to our country's reform, opening up, and modernization. In his "government work report," Premier Li Peng explicitly expounded the principles and tasks regarding this year's economic construction and the drive for deepening reform. It should be noted that the completion of these tasks is of paramount importance to fully implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to establishing a socialist market economic structure; to solving deep contradictions in economic life; to maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national economy; to maintaining political stability; and to promoting overall social progress. It should be noted that there are bound to be many problems and difficulties in the course of accomplishing these tasks: during the transition from an old economic structure to a new one, new contradictions are frequently found intermingling with old ones, and new advantages often come with new disadvantages; the timing, intensity, and implementation of new reform measures are often subject to various restraints; and it is usually difficult to accurately anticipate what chain reaction readjustment of the pattern of interest sharing will trigger. It should also be noted that there are many favorable conditions for the accomplishment of these tasks: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics has been firmly established as our guidance; the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has provided us a powerful ideological weapon; thanks to reform, opening up, and the modernization drive in the past decade or more, China's economic structure has undergone profound changes and our overall economic strength and national strength are growing at an unprecedented rate; a broad-based consensus has taken shape among the people on the question of establishing a socialist market economic system and our ability to stand the impact of reform has improved markedly; leading cadres at all levels have constantly intensified their understanding of reform, development, and stability and their experience in solving complex issues is growing by the day; peace and development remain the two principal themes of the present-day world and the international situation is, on the whole, favorable to us. The overall task for the whole nation this year is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability. Work in all quarters and all sectors must be subordinated and serve this overall task. The CPPCC must find its proper place in this overall task, give full play to its strong points, and make even greater contributions. II. Developing socialist democracy is an important part of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is also a common task for the CPC and various democratic parties, and constitutes a prerequisite for stepping up China's economic construction and restructuring. Without democracy, it would be impossible to fully arouse people's initiative or realize broad-based unity; and without democracy, there would be neither socialism nor socialist modernization. It is provided in the PRC constitution, the CPC constitution, and the constitutions of the democratic parties that we must work hard to turn China into a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and modern socialist country. In his government work report, Premier Li Peng pointed out we must build socialist democracy and the legal system and called for making new progress in 1994 in this regard. The CPPCC represents a major organizational form giving play to China's socialist democracy. Over the years, it has accumulated useful experience in building democracy. Under the new historical conditions, we must continue our in-depth exploration, improve our work, and giving greater play to our role. As democracy is historical, specific and relative, it will certainly be subject to restraints involving social, economic, and political factors. Therefore, progress in democracy cannot deviate from the reality or transcend historical stages. Seeking democracy by neglecting specific conditions will not only make it impossible to achieve the objective of developing democracy, but also produce adverse effects on economic growth and social stability. Democracy will certainly develop along with the development of society. China is currently deepening reforms and establishing a socialist market economic structure, while the people are steadily improving their cultural standards and enhancing their awareness of becoming involved and concepts involving competition. Advancing socialist democracy in an active but steady manner is not only required by the objective, but is also realistically possible. To study the current construction of democratic politics in China, one must proceed from China's reality, based on the objective reality of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and persist in being guided by the basic principle of Marxism. There are two basic concepts in Marxist historical materialism. One is the concept of productive forces; another being the concept of the masses. The concept of productive forces perceptively demonstrates that productive forces are the ultimate and decisive factors in all social development. The fundamental task of socialism is to liberate and develop productive forces. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we have, based on this concept, conscientiously summed up historical experiences, corrected the "left" mistake of "taking class struggle as the key link," upheld the guiding principle of economic construction as the central task, and taken the path of reform and opening up, thus bringing about a fundamental change in our country's outlook. The mass concept profoundly shows that the masses are the creators of history, are the main bodies of practice and cognition, and are the impetus of propelling the progress of human society. This concept has not only decides on and influences many tasks in contemporary China, but also has an impact on our country's construction of democratic politics. The Communist Party of China has made serving the people wholeheartedly its ultimate purpose, the mass line of coming from the people and returning among the people its fundamental work line, and seeking interests for the masses in all activities as its starting point and goal; herein lies the actual operation of the mass concept in the party's activities. The essence and contents of socialist democracy lie in helping the masses become the masters of their country. The masses, through diverse forms and channels, understand the country's situation, take part in major state affairs, exercise the rights of managing the country and social affairs, supervise ruling party and government work personnel, and bring into play the enthusiasm and initiative of building socialism. These are the vivid reflections of the mass concept in the state's political life. The mass concept is closely related to our country's construction of democratic politics. Integrating the construction of democratic politics with a Marxist world view, with the ruling party's leadership method and work style, with the government's various functions and work, and with the masses' practical activities will endow a scientific and theoretical basis and build a profound social foundation for our country's construction of socialist democratic politics. Carrying out the construction of democratic politics under the guidance of the mass concept and embodying the mass concept in the construction of democratic politics are not only the marked characteristics and traditional advantages of our country's democratic politics, but also the inevitable route and basic method for developing our country's democratic politics. To positively and steadfastly promote the construction of socialist democratic politics, it is necessary to always persist in doing everything for the masses and relying on the masses for everything. We should try our best to detect the mood of the masses; understand the wishes of the masses in a timely manner; tirelessly do concrete work for the masses; be skillful at pooling the masses' wisdom; fully respect the innovative spirit of the masses; voluntarily accept the masses' supervision; and in the course of forging close ties with the masses, foster a democratic work style, enhance democratic consciousness, and create and accumulate experiences for the construction of democratic politics. It is necessary to integrate democratic building with the building of a legal system; to confirm in a systematic and legal manner the methods and experiences that are socially accepted, that are of universal significance, and that will help the masses become the masters of their country, so that their rule will become the norm for social and political life; to gradually establish a sound and relatively perfect legal system, to realize the systematization and legalization of democracy, so that this kind of system and law will not change with the replacement of leaders, and will not change with the change in leaders' views and focus; to help maintain the sanctity and authority of the law and the legal system; to enhance the awareness of the masses to protect their own rights and interests according to the law; to put to an end acts that infringe on the democratic rights of the masses; and to provide the masses with a reliable guarantee so that they will enjoy various democratic rights. The system of the people's congress, the system of multiparty cooperation, and the system of political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party are the major forms of our country's socialist democracy which need to be further upheld in future practice, so that they will be perfected and become more concrete and effective. At the same time, we need to constantly establish and improve various forms of democracy at grassroots levels along with the development of the situation, so as to enable the masses to better play their roles as the masters of their country in social and political life at grassroots level. All in all, we need to take the actual situation of our country into consideration, absorb and borrow the results of the civilization of human society, strive to build a kind of socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics that inherits an excellent tradition, that is enriched with the characteristics of the times, that reflects the basic system of socialism, and that is adapted to a socialist market economy. III. The just-adopted CPPCC constitutional amendment bill has included political participation and discussion as major functions of the CPPCC. It is the general summing up of the CPPCC work and the major achievement of the current session. Political participation and discussion are in line with political consultation and democratic supervision. The major contents and basic characteristics of the CPPCC's political participation and discussion are political consultation and democratic supervision. Political participation and discussion, however, should not be simply equated with political consultation and democratic supervision, for they are the expansion and extension of political consultation and democratic supervision. Generally speaking, political consultation and democratic supervision treat the state's and region's major policies, principles, and issues as major topics; make various levels of leading organs their specific objects of consideration; and adopt the holding of meetings as a major concern. Political consultation and democratic supervision proceed in accordance with certain procedures and rules. As for political participation and discussion, they are not completely restricted by the aforementioned conditions; they are more extensive as far as objects are concerned, are richer in content, more diverse in form, and more flexible in their methods. Incorporating political participation and discussion into the CPPCC's major functions will increase and widen the channels and spheres of CPPCC work, provide more opportunities for CPPCC members to come into contact with people from various circles and to give play to their special skills, and create excellent conditions for all levels of CPPCC organs to effectively organize political consultation and democratic supervision, to select topics for discussion, to collect of information, to accumulate materials, and to organize personnel. All levels of CPPCC organizations and CPPCC members are urged to rally closely around the central task of economic construction, and in the course of establishing a socialist market economic system and integrating their respective realities, carry out the work of political participation and discussion in a vivid and effective manner. It is necessary to establish and improve various systems of concrete work in line with relevant stipulations of CPPCC constitution, so as to make CPPCC's meeting system, inspection system, motion system, special committee activities system, and contacts committee better able to adapt to the demands of political participation and discussion. To enable political participation and discussion activities to proceed in an organized manner, topics which are of concern to the masses, which receive party and government departments' attention, and which CPPCC organizations are able to handle should be selected and plans should be worked out for discussion. Improvements should be made in existing forms of political participation and discussion, and new forms of political participation and discussion should be created so that political participation and discussion activities will become more flexible and diverse, and so that the enthusiasm of CPPCC members will be given better play. The formation of special committees should be strengthened. Closer contacts with relevant departments, democratic parties, and social groups should be promoted so as to further give play to their basic roles in political participation and discussion. It is necessary to fully bring into play the CPPCC's advantage in possessing a vast pool of talent; and to make good use of the CPPCC's advantageous conditions of both maintaining close ties with various social circles and with the CPC Central Committee to reflect the mood and will of the masses and to advance opinions and suggestions. Work styles and work efficiency at organs must be improved and raised so as to better serve CPPCC members and to foster political participation and discussion. It is my belief that with successful experience in CPPCC work in the past, with the common efforts of all members, and with great support from various social circles, we should and we can raise the work of the CPPCC's political participation and discussion to a new level. Members and comrades: A stable and harmonious social situation is the common goal of all people of all nationalities, and is also an important reason for seeking benefits for the people and the necessary conditions for doing a good job in all spheres of work. The CPPCC is the most extensive of all the patriotic united front organizations, which should and can give play to its unique role of consolidating and developing a stable and harmonious situation. The great spirit of unity and struggle is one of the excellent traditions of the Chinese people, which is a powerful impetus for the Chinese nation to score glorious achievements after having gone through all kinds of hardships and difficulties, and is our basic guarantee to accomplish the historical mission of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The CPPCC is the symbol of great unity, which should and can make outstanding contributions to maintaining and carrying forward the spirit of unity and struggle. Let us rally around the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core and raise high the banner of great unity. Let us be united and work in a down-to-earth manner. Let us be united to overcome difficulties. Let us be united to win new and greater victories! I hereby declare: The Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference closes in victory!
