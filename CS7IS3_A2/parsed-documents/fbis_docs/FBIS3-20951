Bert-Olof Svanholm, currently general director for Sweden of the Swedish-Swiss industrial group ABB Asea Brown Boveri, was elected chairman of the board, replacing Pehr G. Gyllenhammar. His first task will be to determine what he intends to retain from the partnership agreement signed with Renault in 1990. Mr. Svanholm, 58, was nominated in December by a group of large Volvo shareholders, representing together about 40 percent of the board of directors votes, to succeed Mr. Gyllenhammar who resigned on 2 December 1993 after the failure of the planned merger with Renault. In addition to Mr. Svanholm, six new directors were appointed at the meeting of shareholders; one of them is Louis Schweitzer, CEO [chief executive officer] of Renault, the largest Volvo shareholder with nearly 10 percent of its capital. However, Mr. Schweitzer did not attend the Goteborg meeting. The other directors are Per-Olof Ericsson (general director of the Sandvik group--special steels, tools), Haakan Frisinger (former general director of Volvo from 1983 to 1987), Tom Hedelius (president of the Handelsbanken [Commerce Bank]), Bjoern Svedberg (president of the S.E. Banken), and Soren Gyll, the current Volvo general director. Three union representatives also sit on the board. Speaking to some 700 shareholders, Mr. Gyll declined to give any material precision concerning Volvo's future strategy and the future of the Renault-Volvo partnership set up in 1990 by the two manufacturers. "The forms that the partnership or non-partnership with Renault should take are a priority for both Volvo and Renault," Mr. Svanholm merely stated. The next regular general meeting of the board, scheduled for 20 April, will consider this matter, as well as that of the Swedish group's industrial strategy.
