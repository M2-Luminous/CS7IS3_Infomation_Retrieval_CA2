The Duma's address to the president was prompted, above all, by concern over facts of discrepancy between this process and provisions of the Russian Constitution and the lack of adequate control over the observation of legality from federal bodies of power. Lawmakers were especially concerned over violations of voting rights of citizens in legal acts adopted by bodies of state power in member republics of the Russian Federation, infringing on the principles of equal suffrage and restricting the participation of citizens and their associations in the election campaign as well as over violations of the principle of openness. The Duma's address was also sent to parliament's upper chamber, the Russian Government, bodies of state authority in member republics of the Russian Federation, the Russian procurator-general and the Russian Central Electoral Commission. The address calls on them to take measures "to implement successfully new state construction in Russia by concerted efforts of all interested sides".
