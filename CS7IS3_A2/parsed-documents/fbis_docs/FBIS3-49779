Cooperation between Romania and France in the military area and in other areas of joint interest were the major issues of discussion. After the meeting, Mr. Jacques Lanxade told the journalists the following: Together with the president of the republic [as heard], who did me the honor of receiving me, we first discussed cooperation between France and Romania in the areas of security and defense, and then we surveyed the situation in Europe in general and in this region in particular. And finally, we discussed the evolution of security structures in Europe after the NATO summit in Brussels. The French guest also said: I can say that the relations between Romania and France in all spheres, and particularly in the area of defense, are very dynamic, very warm, and are based on history. We resumed these contacts more than two years ago and we are expecting to develop them. I am very optimistic that we will manage to accomplish durable things together. Answering the question of what his opinions about Romania are currently, Jacque Lanxade said: I believe that Romania is making efforts to restore a difficult economic situation, a situation with which other countries are also currently confronted, countries that have changed their situation in recent years. Romania is seeking to make its actions felt in the international community and is developing cooperation with several countries. I believe that Romania is a country in which much hope can be laid. Asked whether he has visited Romania before, he answered: I know Romania only a little, because I arrived only this morning and will start visiting it tomorrow. But I arrived here mainly to work. Previously, the French Military delegation was also received by Romania's national defense minister, Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu.
