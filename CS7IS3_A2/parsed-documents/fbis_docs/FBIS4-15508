The fundamental meaning of the concept of national accord consists in establishing specific rules of the game between the political leaders represented in the bodies of state authority. The short-term aim is to reach stabilisation of relations between the president and the two chambers of the parliament. The latest clash between the two branches of power occurred over the Federation Council's decision not to release Aleksey Kazannik of his duties as Russia's chief prosecutor, as decreed by Yeltsin earlier. The results of the vote on the decree revealed that for the first time since it was established, the Federation Council declared its independent role, dispelling the image of a pro-president chamber, the Itogi host said. Some people regarded the incident as another clash between the legislature and the executive. The president's representative in the chamber Aleksandr Yakovlev expressed the hope that the upper chamber would return to the question again, and Aleksey Ilyushenko will remain the acting chief prosecutor until then. Commenting on the situation, the presidential aide Grigoriy Satarov said in an interview with Itogi that many interpretations were prompted by political concerns. The vestiges of the old confrontation between the president and his extreme opponents were instrumental in this case, he said. A small part of the political forces is not interested in political and economic stabilisation which would be a poor background for them in the forthcoming elections. In appraising the chances of the parliament's approval of the presidential draft accord on civic peace in Russia, Grigoriy Satarov said the chances are fairly high and he did not see any serious obstacles to the approval of the document before the proposed deadline, April 28. [passage omitted] Itogi interviewed lower chamber speaker Ivan Rybkin, an ardent supporter of the national conciliation concept. As concerns the approval of the presidential call for peace and concord in society, Ivan Rybkin stressed that there are forces in the Duma which can rally in order to achieve peace, concord and success of reforms. About his own political future, Ivan Rybkin declared he had never thought about running in the presidential elections in 1996. "But when I see many of those who nominate themselves for presidency, I know firmly after many years here that it is a heavy burden to bear and I understand that many of them will be simply crushed by this burden, the presidential duties, in the very first days. They should be more circumspecting and abstain from such actions the burden is too heavy and it is not for every man to bear". The realisation of the idea of national concord presupposes a definite representation of all major political forces of Russia in the parliament, the host said. Paradoxically, the radical reformers, who controlled much of the power in Russia until recently are probably experiencing the most difficulties in the State Duma. Last week the Russia's Choice coalition lost one of its leading figures -- Gennadiy Burbulis left the ranks of the faction of which he was one of the founding fathers. Burbulis said in this connection that the country has radically changed lately and Russian society needs new political approaches, and added that he was planning to create a new political party for representatives of the private capital, who were not welcomed to Russia's Choice. Commenting on the promotion of the presidium leader Sergey Shakhray to vice-premiership, Itogi stressed that Shakhray's party, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, now has two vice-premiers in the government, more than any other political coalition.
