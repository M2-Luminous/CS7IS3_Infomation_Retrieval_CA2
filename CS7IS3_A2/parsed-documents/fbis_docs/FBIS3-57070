Linkevicius, who is a member of the LDLP faction himself, was appointed as defense minister last fall on the recommendation of his faction. On Thursday [20 January], the board of the LDLP faction invited Linkevicius for a discussion. MP Arvydas Ivaskevicus, member of the parliament's National Security Committee, called Linkevicius' attention to "machinations" of high-ranking Defense Ministry officials. The lawmaker said he obtained information that the ministry unlawfully rents military facilities to commercial structures. The meeting's participants said they are concerned about a high death and injury rate in the Armed Forces. "The Lithuanian Army is a smaller model of the Soviet Army," Ivaskevicius said. MP Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the National Security Committee, said he is completely unsatisfied with the national defense reorganization plan that was submitted to the president behind the committee's back.
