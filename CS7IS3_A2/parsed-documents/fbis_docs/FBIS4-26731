The project, scheduled for completion early next century, is the country's current biggest foreign cooperative item. "This is a new mode of cooperation between two governments, which has never been seen before," said Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing during a recent tour of the city. "It is a strategic step, rather than a commercial measure," he said. The establishment of special economic zones, open coastal cities, economic and technology development zones in the coastal areas and the opening up of border trade have greatly facilitated China's economic development and opening further to the outside world. But China is not resting on its laurels. In November last year, when Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, met with Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at Seattle, in the United States, Jiang said that the Chinese Government regarded Singapore's experience in developing its country as important, and valued Sino-Singapore cooperation. He highly commended the joint efforts to build and develop the Suzhou industrial park, which "will create a new mode in Sino- Singapore cooperation." Zhang Xinsheng, mayor of Suzhou, said the project is characterized by drawing a great deal of international capital and Singapore's experience in combining economic operation with public administration. "Construction of the Suzhou industrial park will be in line with Singapore's experience in urban planning, management and social insurance," Zhang said. So far, the two countries have set up a joint development company to take charge of the development of the project, open bidding and to raise funds. The two governments have set up the Suzhou Industrial Park Joint Coordinating Council, chaired by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The council, which has two working committees, is responsible for major issues regarding the park. According to the agreement concluded by the two governments, the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee will play an independent operational role in line with Chinese law and regulations and the requirements of the socialist market economy. These organizations are now operating smoothly.
