[Begin recording] [Montoya] Magistrate Colindres has denied the TSE wants to include the Armed Forces in an electoral organization on election day as denounced by the FMLN. According to Colindres, the Armed Forces will not be assigned to transport voting supplies or survey roads, but some of its units will provide assistance once the elections are over. [Colindres] We have told the FMLN we were only planning to use an Air Force helicopter to ship electoral certificates for the vote count. [Montoya] Colindres has said the Army's participation in the elections will be at a minimum, and, primarily, it will be supervised by other people. [Colindres] The helicopter will carry only the pilot, the copilot, a representative of the UN Observers to El Salvador, a member of each from the departmental and municipal electoral boards, and a TSE representative who will bring the certificates to the heliport that will be set up in front of the Presidente Hotel. [Montoya] Colindres believes the FMLN has played dirty by accepting a situation and later denouncing it as a violation of the laws; in this regard, Colindres has said the FMLN's dishonest behavior could be only the result of a propagandistic campaign.
