Protecting himself under the so-called Santa Maria Agreement [Pacto de Santa Maria] and a strategy designed by his advisers, "Toro" [Perez Balladares] has avoided all forums in which his performance as a government official could be scrutinized by people who know the inside of the mistakenly labelled "revolutionary process." Recently, the PRD candidate refused to accept an invitation from the daily LA PRENSA by arguing that media was not "impartial." Sources close to the candidate point out that "Toro" knows his role as a minister and a government official of the military will not stand up to serious analysis or questioning. Other sources who know the details of the vast fortune controlled by Perez Balladares appear surprised that the other candidates have not even bothered to question the origin of the PRD candidate's assets and riches. Former officials of the military regime indicate that the funds to install the television station controlled by Perez Balladares and his associates were supplied on direct orders from Omar Torrijos. Upon Torrijos' death, the balance of the funds required for the station to operate was handed over by Panama Defense Forces [PDF] staff members, according to the source. Meanwhile, Perez Balladares and his running mates have been effective in criticizing the current government's inefficiency and corruption. With Guillermo Endara in the Presidency surrounded by a number of individuals who profited under the umbrella of the military garrisons, the PRD campaign has been relatively easy. No one can deny that this government has been a complete failure. This fact, together with the Torrijist myth that "everything was better" in the past, facilitates "Toro" and his followers' election propaganda. We are certain that the Panamanian people have not forgotten the dictatorship's excesses. Nevertheless, it is also obvious that many lower income Panamanians long for the times of "cash favors and petty gains" [salve y rebuscas]. PRD members have been effective in presenting the military government as a period of economic bonanza where everyone had hopes of "meeting the family's basic needs." For a people battered by hunger, malnutrition, unemployment, insecurity, and poverty, this is a powerful message being successfully exploited by the PRD. The PRD has conveniently forgotten the $962-million loss at the National Bank; the world's largest per-capita foreign debt; and the embezzlements in the Social Security Fund, the National Savings Bank, and other state institutions. The PRD, its founders, and representatives were accomplices of robbery and theft. Mr. Perez Balladares, as well as many of his followers, cannot explain the origins of their fortunes. "Toro" and his running mates are all members of a "native aristocracy" that did not hesitate to surrender and sell out to the military. Perez Balladares and the other "hand picked" officials who worked for the military have no right to talk about or criticize the democratic government's inefficiency. They and the majority of their followers profited from and exploited the Panamanian people during 21 years of military dictatorship. With Noriega in jail and Torrijos in hell, it is easy for PRD members to sidestep the truth by not replying to awkward questions related to their political and business activities. These activities must be brought into the open during this political campaign. The thefts and arrogance that characterized the PRD administration will be repeated if they gain power again. It is then time to question in detail Mr. Perez Balladares on the origin of his vast fortune. The questioning should take place in public forums and through campaign propaganda to determine whether he can respond and convince the voters that he has made his fortune through honest work. It is said that the people choose the leaders they deserve. If we accept the results of the latest polls, it appears we are going downhill, repeating the errors of the past by electing pirates and privateers whose sole goal is "Everything for our own personal gain," ["Todo por la papa," play on words on the former PDF slogan "Todo por la patria" -- "Everything for the fatherland."]
