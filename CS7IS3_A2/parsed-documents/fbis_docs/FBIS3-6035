Nakamura, then deputy chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) panel on antimonopoly laws, opposed a plan by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in December 1991 to raise the maximum penalty on violators to several hundreds of million yen from 5 million yen. In the Structural Impediments Initiative talks with the United States, Japan was urged to raise penalties against corporations which violate the antimonopoly law. In February 1992, however, Nakamura reversed his initial reluctance to support the hike after he allegedly received a 10 million yen bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp. in January and moved to persuade colleagues in the LDP construction lobby to give in to the FTC plan, the sources said. Prosecutors arrested Nakamura Friday for allegedly accepting the 10 million yen bribe. He quit the LDP last Wednesday. The money was apparently intended as a reward for using his influence to help prevent the FTC from filing an accusation against a 66-member cartel, including Kajima, for its bid-rigging practices on public works projects in Saitama Prefecture. He met twice with then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa and pressured him not to file an accusation against the companies, sources said. The FTC submitted a revised plan on the antimonopoly law to raise the maximum penalty to 100 million yen in March of that year. It announced two months later that it would not file an accusation with prosecutors against the cartel. FTC Chairman Masami Kogayu said Friday the commission was never influenced by outside forces on decisions involving cases impinging the Fair Trade Law.
