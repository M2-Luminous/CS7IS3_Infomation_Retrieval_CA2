FR941219-2-00079 FR941219-2-00049 A marketing program that is illegal under the anti-kickback statute may pose a danger to patients because the offering or payment of remuneration may interfere with a physician's judgment in determining the most appropriate treatment for a patient. Further, where the patient is a Medicaid beneficiary, these drug marketing practices may increase the Federal government's costs of reimbursing suppliers for the products. The OIG is investigating various drug marketing schemes, and enforcing the anti-kickback laws where these practices affect the Federal health care programs. What To Look For Generally, a payment or gift may be considered improper under 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7b(b) if it is: •Made to a person in a position to generate business for the paying party; •Related to the volume of business generated; and •More than nominal in value and/or exceeds fair market value of any legitimate service rendered to the payer, or is unrelated to any service at all other than referral of patients. OIG investigation may be warranted where one or more of the following features is present in prescription drug marketing activities: •Any prize, gift or cash payment, coupon or bonus (e.g., airline discounts and related travel premiums), offered to physicians and/or suppliers (including pharmacies, mail order prescription drug companies and managed care organizations) in exchange for, or based on, prescribing or providing specific prescription products. These items are particularly suspect if based on value or volume of business generated for the drug company. •Materials which offer cash or other benefits to pharmacists (or others in a position to recommend prescription drug products) in exchange for performing marketing tasks in the course of pharmacy practice related to Medicare or Medicaid. The marketing tasks may include sales-oriented ``educational'' or ``counseling'' contacts, or physician and/or patient outreach, etc. •Grants to physicians and clinicians for studies of prescription products when the studies are of questionable scientific value and require little or no actual scientific pursuit. The grants may nonetheless offer substantial benefits based on, or related to, use of the product. •Any payment, including cash or other benefit, given to a patient, provider or supplier for changing a prescription, or recommending or requesting such a change, from one product to another, unless the payment is made fully consistent with a ``safe harbor'' regulation, 42 CFR 1001.952, or other Federal provision governing the reporting of prescription drug prices.
