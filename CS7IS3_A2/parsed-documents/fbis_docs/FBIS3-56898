Kravchuk temporarily transferred the duties of his representative in Sevastopol to Nikolay Glushko, first deputy head of the city administration. ITAR-TASS learnt at the press centre of the Black Sea Fleet later in the day that the Union of Afghan Veterans, the Sevastopol Russian community, the Crimean Movement of Voters, the union in support of the Crimean Republic and the leadership of city social services voiced support for Yermakov. It is expected that the Sevastopol city council will call a special session in the near future to discuss Yermakov's resignation. Local analysts believe that the resignation of the presidential representative in Sevastopol was caused by his participation in the election campaign as a candidate for the post of Crimean president. Yermakov made repeated statements during the campaign that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet should be resolved in favour of Russia. According to analysts, Kiev was also evidently riled by the fact that Yermakov did not support the candidacy of Crimean Parliament Speaker Nikolay Bahrov during the election campaign.
