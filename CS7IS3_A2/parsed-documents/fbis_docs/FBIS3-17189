[Chernomyrdin] I must tell you that we are not supporters of holding the ruble exchange rate, it -- I mean the dollar rate -- it must be realistic so that we do not crush our exporters. This we will not do. So, with regard to the budget, we have just submitted it. [Melkonyan] But this year... [Chernomyrdin, interrupting] We have submitted it to the Duma. We agreed it and worked on it before this. The talks today and yesterday were, I think my sixth set of talks with the president during which we stipulated everything: what is in the budget, what should be given the main emphasis, what we should not omit, where our main priorities lie. And so we finished such a budget today, submitted it, and I think that we will work with this Duma, with this Federation Assembly. We will work and not just wait for someone to do something or other. We will work.
