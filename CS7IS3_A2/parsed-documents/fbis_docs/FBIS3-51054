Will It Bear Fruit?"] [Text] Hanoi, 3 Jan (PL) -- It began as a rumor in the media, growing in intensity as Washington officials were cited. There is a lot of rumbling this time about the eventual lifting of the economic embargo against Vietnam. But the question remains: Will it really bear fruit? Three influential U.S. publications -- TIME, THE WASHINGTON POST, and THE NEW YORK TIMES -- have revealed that William Clinton's administration is going to lift the U.S. economic blockade of Hanoi in effect for almost 20 years. Here in Vietnam there has been no official reaction. A Foreign Ministry source consulted by PRENSA LATINA reiterated today that they are following the matter with attention but without too many expectations. A "secret document" might suddenly surface reporting on U.S. prisoners of war being held in dark, underground cells and then the screw would be tightened again, added the official, who preferred to remain anonynmous. But the truth is that this time there are auspicious indications in the air. Gary Ackerman, president of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, has said that there is no doubt that the embargo is about to end. Ackerman added that it is only a matter of time and asserted that in the coming weeks his government will study several alternatives to further ease economic restrictions or to eliminate them completely. Everything revolves around a document submitted by Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, who, after visiting Vietnam last December, recommended "that something be done urgently to reciprocate for Hanoi's cooperation in searching for missing soldiers (MIA-POW)." In the last report issued in Hanoi by the Pentagon group in charge of the 2,200 MIA-POW (servicemen missing in action-prisoners of war) [preceding seven words in English] files, Colonel John Gray highlighted Vietnam's extensive cooperation and observed that the normalization of bilateral relations would help expedite these investigations. Nevertheless, the syndrome of defeat in the Indochina conflagration and the manipulation of the sensitive MIA-POW issue has divided U.S. public opinion. A poll by THE NEW YORK TIMES indicated that only 41 percent of the U.S. population believes now is an opportune time to end economic restrictions and renew diplomatic ties. According to NEWSWEEK, the White House's tenant is facing another important decision that will be as difficult as the ratification of the Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Clinton, who promised to revitalize the country's economy, has set his sights on the flourishing Asia-Pacific region, precisely because the southeastern area of this region has exhibited one of the world's most dynamic growth patterns. Vietnam is on the verge of entering the powerful ASEAN. It currently enjoys observer status in this organization and has been strengthening its ties with forum members: Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and Brunei. While just the hint of a possible end to the economic blockade of Hanoi conjured up a storm in Washington, in the Asian country itself U.S. companies are trying to gain a foothold in the already complex competition in a market that which was until recently untouched. Meanwhile, the lobbying continues at the White House. Clinton is once again being pressured from all sides. Here in Hanoi people ask themselves if the old adage -- much ado about nothing -- will again prevail.
