The official text of the agreement has been closely guarded, but what has been made public is arousing profound concerns about the agreement's impact on the Jordanian and Palestinian economies. Jordan has reacted cautiously to the agreement. Jordanian officials insist there is no contradiction between the PLO-Israel economic agreement and the economic accord between Jordan and the PLO signed in January. Nonetheless, Jordan has requested "clarifications" on certain points in the PLO-Israeli agreement and a senior PLO negotiator is expected to meet Jordanian officials in Amman to discuss the agreement. Opinion of independent observers and analysts, however, is generally against the PLO-Israel economic accord, "This agreement is very bad as far as Jordan is concerned," a political analyst told THE STAR. The analyst, who requested anonymity, noted that the "number one issue" for Jordan is the future of the Jordanian dinar in the West Bank and Gaza. He warned that the PLO-Israel economic agreement will undermine the use of the dinar, leading to a fall in the dinar's value and a sharp depletion of Jordan's hard currency reserves. He also warned that this will further exacerbate Jordan's debt burden. At the same time, he warned, new investment opportunities in the West Bank and Gaza will attract Palestinian capital at Jordan's expense. The short term prospects for the Jordanian economy, he concluded, are not encouraging. As'ad 'Abd al-Rahman, director of the Shuman Foundation and a self-described "PLO man," expressed hope that the dinar would continue to be the currency of choice in the Occupied Territories, "I hope that the [Palestinian] entity's orientation will be westward, not eastward," he said. Commenting on the agreement, economist Fahd al-Fanik said the agreement "proves once again that the current negotiations are not between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but rather between the Israelis and themselves. It was Israel which wrote the text [of the agreement], and the Palestinian delegation succeeded at introducing a few simple reservations and limited exceptions." The agreement, according to al-Fanik, "serves Israel's interests and sacrifices the joint interests of the Jordanians and the Palestinians." It places economic barriers between Palestinians and Jordan, and "prevents them from exchanging goods and services except via Israeli customs" on the bridges linking the West Bank and Jordan. Critics of the PLO-Israel economic agreement worry the accord has done nothing but win PLO approval for Israeli economic control of the Occupied Territories, at the expense of future Palestinian economic relations with the Arab world in general and Jordan in particular. "The economic agreement in its entirety puts Israel's economic interests in the forefront," Taysir Khalid of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) told THE STAR. Khalid, who resigned from the PLO Executive committee in protest over the Gaza-Jericho accords, said the economic agreement "subordinates everything to Israeli interests and to the protection of the Israeli market. Khalid believes the agreement legalizes Israeli exploitation of the Occupied Territories, and thus represents no significant change in itself. "What is new is that the Israeli policy of annexation and integration has been legalized with Palestinian approval," said Khalid. The Palestinian negotiators in Paris, "rather than defending the need to break the two economies apart and to enable the Palestinian economy to develop independently, have accepted Israel's conditions and dictates." Not all reaction has been negative. While acknowledging the negative impact the agreement will have on Jordan, one analyst told THE STAR Palestinians in the West Bank will benefit from integration into the Israeli economy. "The investment climate in the West Bank, which was near zero, will improve dramatically," he said. He predicted a surge of investment from Palestinians living abroad, and didn't discount the possibility of Israeli investment in the area taking advantage of lower production costs. The more than one billion dollars earmarked by the World Bank for the Palestinian autonomous authority will also help create a positive investment climate. According to banking expert Yusuf 'Abd al-Haq, the agreement represents the first step in the implementation of the report published by Harvard University earlier this year, entitled "Security Peace in the Middle East; Project on Economic Transition". "This is a clear implementation of the Harvard Unviersity report, which calls for the establishment of open Palestinian-Israeli economic relations, followed by the establishment of relations between the Palestine-Israel market and Jordan, and finally by their integration into Arab markets."
