At that age, every youth usually has his idol. As party members, our idols were not the typical musicians, pop singers, or movie stars. There were 10 of us, and we all thought our first idol was Saddam Husayn from the way he dressed, spoke, walked, and dealt with people, and even by his life style. Having agreed on our first idol, we then split into two groups. The first group of six or seven viewed [late Iraqi Defense Minister] 'Adnan Khayrallah as its second idol from his behavior, conduct, and gentle nature. The second group of three or four viewed comrade Barzan Ibrahim [Saddam Husayn's brother and Iraqi envoy to UN European headquarters] as its second idol, because in his youthful years in the eighties Barzan was in charge of a most sensitive state organ [Iraqi Intelligence Service] and had a background similar to that of comrade 'Adnan, although the latter was more experienced since he took part in the Ramadan Revolution and its ramifications. But comrade Barzan was also with the comrade leader during the 17-30 July 1968 Revolution. The story goes that comrade Barzan, who carried a pistol, had tripped a soldier, who held a machinegun, with his foot to protect his brother the leader, because he thought the pistol would not serve the purpose. The group that considered comrade 'Adnan Khayrallah as its second idol was also charmed by Barzan's unusual character. On the other hand, the group that considered comrade Barzan as its second idol also admired comrade 'Adnan Khayrallah's personality. At any rate, this is not the subject of our story. When Barzan's first press article appeared, only three of the original group of ten remained, the others had pursued their own courses in life. We thought the article was interesting. Then came the second, third, and fourth articles. Again, we thought they were fine and that there was no reason why he should not express his opinion. But as the articles continued to appear, we noticed that they contained a set of ideas that were different from our way of thinking in Iraq. The articles continued to move away from us and to get closer to the inclinations of persons who live abroad. When we observed that these viewpoints began to develop into courses and were followed by more articles, which deepened these courses and developed them into a program and a firm line, we thought it would be proper to reply to them in view of the fact that we are a group of young men in Iraq who lived the Mother of Battles, fought in Kuwait and Basra, and experienced all the stages of the blockade. Our attention was drawn to an article comrade Barzan wrote about the relationship between Iraq and Iran. He spoke about this relationship as though nothing had happened between Iraq and Iran. He spoke about the sons of our people from the Shiites in Iraq, forgetting that Iraqi Shiites are an Arab faction that is separated by a river of blood from the Persian faction, which claims to be Shiite, and that a big difference in concepts and beliefs exists between the two factions, even though the the Shu'ubists [Persians] always consider them as one. Moreover, many of the Iraqis who fought and fell as martyrs in al-Qadisiyah [Iraq-Iran War] were from our Shiite sons, especially from the south. This is not a new thing, since it has been dealt with in several articles. The theme of comrade Barzan's article revolves around the possibility of coexistence between Iraq and Iran. In fact, we cannot coexist with Iran. But we should apply the Arab proverb that says: "Beware of your friend, but do not betray him." But again, this is not the topic of our discussion. The topic is an article written by Barzan al-Tikriti in AL-JUMHURIYAH under the headline "A Viewpoint on Yemeni Events." Let us review some of its paragraphs. The author said: "What is taking place in Yemen is the outcome of a relationship between two conflicting regimes that have entered into a unity that was received with caution and skepticism by everyone concerned, both the sincere and the not-so-sincere ones." The author added: "The situation has reached the point of merciless fighting between brothers in which aircraft and heavy weapons are being used and battles are taking place as if between two foreign armies. Airports and power installations are being destroyed." Actually, the current events Yemen are related to an ideological analysis of the phases that preceded and followed the Mother of Battles. After 2 August [1990] to be precise, the curtain was pulled and the Arab regimes were exposed. Nobody believed us when we said that at the time. It is only now that we are beginning to discover that many Arab regimes, whether in the Arab Maghreb or the Arab East, have had ties with "Israel" for decades. This frightful relationship has been under cover all that time, and it is only now that it is being announced publicly. Indeed, Arab regimes were exposed after 2 August and the Arab homeland was split into two ranks; the rank of faith and the rank of infidelity, to borrow the words of the leader president. The split was so clear cut that the vote that tipped the balance in the Arab League meeting on the blockade and the armed aggression was that of Djibouti. The Mother of Battles took place and was followed by a new phase. So what happened? Following the armed aggression and the period of treachery and treason [reference to the Shiite rebellion in the south], and due to Iraq's preoccupation with its domestic situation and the lack of an active Iraqi diplomacy and of professionals in foreign policy, the supporting Arab ranks collapsed and the number of supporters decreased. Let us see what happened. Morocco remained neutral, but also maintained a clandestine courtship with the other side. Tunisia maintained a position that was very different from the one it held before the aggression on Iraq. As for Jordan's stand, it is clearly known to the Iraqis. Why do we say there are two conflicting regimes in Yemen? On the contrary, when Iraq was strong and had an army that extended from Zakho to al-Faw; and when it enjoyed a well-known political weight and was not under siege, Yemeni unity was a model that inspired Arab poets and unionists, and Yemeni relations were at their peak. But the fact is, Yemen began to be subjected to Saudi intrigues. In an article published on the front page of an earlier issue of BABIL, comrade Abu-Sarhan [suspected to be 'Udayy Saddam Husayn] referred to Yemen's courtship with Saudi Arabia after the armed aggression against Iraq. He said, verbatim: "If Yemen continues to play with fire the way it is doing now it will burn its fingers." When Yemen began compromising its principled stands, it backfired on the Yemeni body itself. If we look now, we will find that the current events in Yemen were preceded by one Yemeni side clearly moving in the direction of the sides that were hostile to Iraq, while in the past the Yemenis maintained a unified stand. Thus, Yemeni events are indirectly linked to what took place in the Mother of Battles and the subsequent developments. What happened makes us understand the importance of strengthening the support for Iraq that is now receding. At any rate, let us continue discussing the subject of Yemen. Looking at the Yemeni fighting, which comrade Barzan said is taking place between two armies and where airports and power installations are being destroyed, we will observe that it is similar to the military plan the foreign enemies used against Iraq, which also targeted power and water installations, factories, and so forth. Therefore, the plan being carried out in Yemen today is not just an outcome of the conflict between Yemenis, but also a plan drawn up and studied abroad in order to achieve the objective of dividing Yemen. The existence of a strong Yemen south of Saudi Arabia and a strong Iraq north of it constitutes a strategic danger to the ruling family in the Arabian Peninsula. Iraq and Yemen cherish pan-Arab aspirations. Yemenis have always been known for their Arab nationalist sentiments and are true Arabs. Proof of this is that Judaism had existed in Yemen, but it has not had any effect on Arabs there. When Imam al-Husayn [grandson of Prophet Muhammad and first Imam of the Shiites who was assassinated in al-Kufah, Iraq], may peace be upon him, decided to leave for al-Kufah, 'Abdallah Ibn- 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab, may God rest his soul in peace, asked him: "Where are you heading, Abu-'Abdallah?" He replied: "I am heading for al-Kufah." He told him: "Why do you not go to Yemen, where your father's Shiites [referring to Yemeni Zaydi sect, an off-shoot of Shiism] live and where you will have the protection of the mountains." As politicians, we know that mountainous areas are ideal for rebel armed movements. When our lord al-Husayn insisted on going to al-Kufah, 'Abdallah Ibn-'Umar told him: "Come, let me bid you farewell." As we said, what is taking place in Yemen was planned and studied abroad ever since the declaration of Yemeni unity, and it was intensified after the Mother of Battles. Let us continue with comrade Barzan's article. He said: "What led to the general war was the view held by some people that say: Either we have full unity, or a general destructive war will be the only alternative." It was a full unity. And, a general war is not an alternative to unity. A general war is a means to destroy unity. The author also said: "The world was not created in one day so as to be united in one day. Unity between states takes time." The creation of the world was a heavenly will. When God Almighty created the world in seven days, He wanted to teach patience to mankind. Regarding Arab unity, we have to be clear on this score. The author, who is posted in the West, will understand us when we say: One of the great historical unity experiments was the unification of Germany under Bismarck. Germany was then unified by force of arms. A second great experiment was the American federation between the southern and northern states, which was also achieved by force of arms, and by a method similar to the one taking place now in Yemen. Let us consider the Arab reality. What do we see? We see an egotistical Arab individual who loves shaykhdoms and being a shaykh. At a time when suzerainties have vanished from the world, shaykhdoms are still deeply-rooted in the Arab homeland. No Arab unity has been achieved without the use of armed force. Armed force has always been the means to Arab unity. As for the rulers, they have always tried to entrench regionalism. We thank God that Yemenis understand the meaning of this war. They rejected mediation, because if they had accepted them Yemen would have been divided, as is now happening in Yugoslavia. But the war has now become a war to unify the country by armed force; in other words, a full liberation war. This situation is similar to what they wanted to happen in Iraq during the period of treachery and treason. They wanted to strengthen the secessionist trend and then declare the division of Iraq into three states according to the well-known scenario. Barzan said: "What is happening in Yemen is a repetition of past Arab unity attempts; the usual relationship which begins with hugs and kisses and ends up in disputes and war." Previous attempts at Arab unity have not been a unity of one Arab people in two countries, but a unity sought for political purposes and ideological ends. Every Arab ruler sought to take whatever he could from the other in order to increase his assets and improve his image before his people. Therefore, there was no real Arab unity. The real unity is the one known to the Iraqis and is unity in the real sense of the word. Barzan continued in his article, saying: "The dream of unity has developed into fear, terror, and panic. In fact, it has become a nightmare, and not just in Yemen." No. Never. All Arab strugglers and all Arabs know full well that their real dream is the unification of the nation. They understand that their aspirations will not be achieved, their identity will not be asserted, and their prestige will not be maintained except through unity. Therefore, the enemies of the Arabs represented by Zionism and the Americans always try to make the Arabs understand that poverty, hunger, injustice, panic, and fear result from unity. At the same time, and as is now happening with the Iraqis, these enemies are trying, through their punishment of Iraq, to create a reaction against unity and to scare the Arabs away from future unity. But unity is a firm conviction. A person cannot live with one lung, or live a full and real life with half a body or a disability. Unity is the basic aim of all strugglers and honorable men. Despite all the enmity, we still hear hostile forces represented by the United States and Britain saying: "The opposition has failed to establish roots inside Iraq." We thank God that the opponents of the Iraqi regime are no more than a bunch of agents whose morality and affiliation to true Arab Iraq are suspect. They were known to the Iraqi people even before they became known to the persons who rule Iraq by their history, conduct, and behavior. I repeat and say that unity is the resort and hope of the nation. it is also the paradise and hope of the faithful on earth. Therefore, we totally disagree with the author of the article when he said: "There should either be a unity that respects everyone and guarantees their common rights, or a return to the separatist states that existed before." In another part of the article, the author set an example by saying: "There are 20 other separate Arab states, but they have managed to coexist with one another without bickering and fighting." This is what we hope, but how can it be without fighting?! The situation reached the point where half of the regimes of the nation turned their armies against one people [Iraq] of this nation. They provided them with funds and arms. The present state of the nation does not augur well. In fact, the nation has never been in such a miserable state in its entire history. The Arab rulers have not been so daring as to enlist the help of the enemy or to deal with Zionism so publicly. We thank God that it has finally surfaced, because we will see more such developments, God willing, in 1995 when the situation will become very clear to everyone. The author of the article cites another example by saying: "The other example, although somewhat different, was Syria. [Former Egyptian President] 'Abd-al-Nasir decided not to reinforce the Egyptian forces in Syria, especially in Latakia, in order to strike at the secessionist movement there. 'Abd-al-Nasir believed that saving unity by bloodshed and opening fire on Syrian secessionists would bar all doors to rapprochement and unity between the two peoples and countries in the future." God bless 'Abd-al-Nasir who was one of the symbols of the Arab revolutionary movement, but not the first or only symbol of this movement. He was also not a model for nationalists and pan-Arabists on the Arab national level. 'Abd-al-Nasir took steps during certain historical phases that are questionable to this day. One such step was his approval of the presence of the Egyptian forces alongside the British forces when 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim demanded the restoration of Kuwait. The other was his decision to open the Suez Canal to foreign forces proceeding to Kuwait. These steps continue to be questioned and queried by all nationalists in Iraq. What Barzan's article said about Latakia is another point against 'Abd-al-Nasir, because the position taken by 'Abd-al-Nasir then led to the presence of Hafiz al-Asad today. Hafiz al-Asad is from the Latakia area. 'Abd-al-Nasir contributed to the emergence of the al-Nusayriyah Movement in Latakia when he failed to deal his blow then. This movement developed and formed the basis for the party's setback in Syria and the assumption of power by Hafiz al-Asad, who has adopted hostile trends toward pan- Arabism and Iraq. Syria is known for this up to this moment. The brothers in Yemen have done well. There is no alternative. And, as the poet says: Honor can only be redeemed by bloodshed. Therefore, Yemen -- land and people -- will not be redeemed except by sacrifices. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. "There was for Saba, aforetime, a Sign in their homeland -- two gardens to the right and to the left. Eat of the sustenance provided by your Lord, and be grateful to Him; a territory fair and happy. And, a Lord oft-forgiving." [Koranic verse]
