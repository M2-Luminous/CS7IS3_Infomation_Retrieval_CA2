A new multiparty Krajina parliament is supposed to meet in 10 days. Milan Martic, newly elected RSK president, held his first news conference today at which, among economic measures and moves, he also announced the introduction of the super dinar, because he assessed that a unified monetary policy in the FRY, the republic of Srpska, and the RSK is the first step toward the creation of a joint state: [Correspondent Petko Koprivica] Newly elected RSK President Milan Martic held his first news conference in Knin today when he, among other things, repeated that he will remain resolute in his intention to realize six key points of his electoral program, which are defense, legal order, the reanimation and promotion of the economy, the strengthening of diplomatic activities, and the unification of the Serbian lands into one state: [Martic] "I continue to be a common man with a new burden on my back and with a desire that the program that I have drawn up succeeds, because if the program succeeds the people have also succeeded. I think that the program can and must succeed, as nobody has the right to oppose what constitutes the interest and the will of this people." [Koprivica] Let us listen how the RSK President commented on the beginning of the establishment of relations between Belgrade and Zagreb, that is to say, how he sees the borders of his country in the light of the Geneva negotiations: [Martic] "People can interpret this agreement in Geneva the way they like. However, it does not significantly change anything. Not even the signature that Tudjman and President Milosevic have placed on it brings anything significant. What it means is only the establishment of peace. However, this under no circumstances means that Krajina has been returned to Croatia, as the Croatian politicians have presented this. I am not surprised that Tudjman is constantly repeating that, by this, Croatia has in a way been acknowledged within its borders. This is absolutely not true. The only thing that was signed was signature for peace, to seek political solutions in peace. "In any case, we all strive that this actually be the case. However, we do not renounce anything, and nobody is contemplating returning the RSK to Croatia. We will negotiate with Croatia on an equal footing, we will be proportionally represented in all talks and will negotiate in peace how to live further as two neighboring countries, but in no way together." [Koprivica] The RSK President also told journalists that he would favor that capable and entrepreneurial people, who will be able to work successfully for the benefit of the Serbian nation, regardless of their party membership, enter the future government of this most western Serbian land. Namely, Martic concluded, nobody, never, under no circumstances can and will get a mandate to place his personal interests above the national goals of the Serbian nation.
