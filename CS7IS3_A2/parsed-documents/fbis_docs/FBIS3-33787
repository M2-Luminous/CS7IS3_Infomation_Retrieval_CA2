FBIS3-33787 "drnes021ee_94001" FBIS-NES-94-021 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Feb 1994 OPEC Affairs Kuwaiti Minister: OPEC May Cut Oil Output NC3001141994 Paris AFP in English 1348 GMT 30 Jan 94 NC3001141994 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Kuwait City, Jan 30 (AFP) -- OPEC may decide to reduce oil production to prop up falling crude prices, at its next ministerial meeting scheduled for March 25, Kuwaiti Oil Minister 'Ali al-Baghli said in remarks published Sunday [30 January]. The minister, quoted by the Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba', said a cut in output "would be agreed on if OPEC was sure it would lead to a bolstering of crude prices." In December the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council -- Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain -- said it was ready to lower production to stabilise prices if other producers worldwide pledged to do the same. Omani Oil Minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari recently toured producers outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to seek their support for the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] offer, but his initiative has not affected the oil markets. OPEC members fear a resumption of oil exports by Iraq, suspended under the embargo imposed on Baghdad after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, may push oil prices to new lows. Last month they fell to their lowest level in five years, deepening a trend that began in the second half of 1993 due to excess supply, recession in industrial states and the spectre of Iraq's return to the oil market. "OPEC will hold an extraordinary meeting immediately the embargo on Iraqi oil is lifted," al-Baghli said. Iraq hopes the oil embargo will be lifted this year, following its acceptance in November of long-term weapons monitoring -- one of the Gulf war ceasefire conditions laid down by the United Nations.
