FR940512-1-00002 FR940512-1-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 185 RIN 3206&hyph;AF77 Implementation of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing to issue regulations to implement the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA) which Congress enacted on October 21, 1986. The PFCRA provides a statutory right for the Federal Government to take administrative action against fraud. The PFCRA also outlines the procedures that must be followed in administrative actions brought in accordance with the act. These regulations will implement these procedural requirements. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before July 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments to Lorraine Lewis, General Counsel, Office of Personnel Management, Room 7355, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Murray M. Meeker, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, (202) 606&hyph;1980. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law 99&hyph;509 provides a means by which Federal agencies may institute administrative proceedings against persons who have presented false claims or statements and provides further that Federal agencies who institute such administrative proceedings may recover double damages as well as penalties of up to $5,000 per violation. The Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act requires agencies to issue regulations. This rule establishes the procedures that OPM will follow under this Act. The moneys collected as a result of these procedures are deposited as miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury of the United States. E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation OPM has determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because their effects are limited primarily to federal employees and other entities who do business with OPM.
