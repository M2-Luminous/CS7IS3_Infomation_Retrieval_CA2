In the Beli Manastir electoral unit, as of 1300, approximately 40 percent of the voters have turned out. This percentage had already been achieved in Vukovar at 1200. The response will definitely be even greater since the sun is melting the ice and snow on the paths. The low temperatures and ice have forced many people to wait until this afternoon to vote. However, some just could not be dissuaded by the bad weather to fulfill their civic right and vote for one of the two presidential candidates in the republic of Serbian Krajina. [passage omitted] The polling stations will remain open until 1900. The first unofficial results as to who has won the second round of elections, Milan Babic or Milan Martic, will be announced tomorrow evening after 1900. Vukovar has forwarded us the data for some other localities in the republic of Serbian Krajina. In Vojnic, 17 percent voted by noon; Vrgin Most 35 percent; Drnis 20 percent; Okucani 32 percent, Pakrac 50 percent; and Petrinja 30 percent.
