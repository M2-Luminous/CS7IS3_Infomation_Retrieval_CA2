Although the U.S. side was concerned about the transparency of our country's formula for calculating profits generated by the monopoly, as well as a restructuring of the monopoly system, it did not demand specific readjustments. The two sides will continue discussions in future rounds of talks. Vice Economic Minister Hsu Ko-sheng indicated: The U.S. side believes that the lack of transparency regarding our country's formula for calculating profits generated by the monopoly has resulted in unfair competition for U.S. manufacturers. We stressed, however, that the calculation of profits generated by the monopoly is not opaque because it is subject to supervision. Also, our side revealed that the plan for readjusting the monopoly system would be finalized by the end of June 1995. In principle, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau's management rights will revert to the central government, and the collection of profits generated by the monopoly also will come under the taxation system. Also, we will introduce adjustments in accordance with GATT-specified principles. Vice Minister Hsu said: [Begin Hsu recording] Our future restructuring means that we will no longer adopt the so-called monopoly profit calculating method but rather will bring the collection of profits generated by the monopoly under the taxation system. This means we will collect import and excise taxes and take other measures as necessary. Under our future reversion to the taxation system, we will definitely comply with GATT's so-called principle governing the transparency of national income. [end recording]
