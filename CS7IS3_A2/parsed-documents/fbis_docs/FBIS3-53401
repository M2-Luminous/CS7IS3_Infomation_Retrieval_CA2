In Cairo, the Arab League confirmed that it intends to send an envoy to Yemen as part of its efforts to contain the deteriorating situation there. In Amman, the source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Jordan will not refrain from continuing its mediation efforts between the Yemeni leaders despite the failure of the Jordanian efforts to promote a reconciliation so far. He added that consultations are under way between al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, Jordanian chief of the Royal Court, and members of the Yemeni leadership to make arrangements for a visit King Husayn of Jordan intends to make early next month to Sanaa and Aden to eliminate existing differences between the Yemeni president and his deputy and to bridge their views to ensure survival of the unity of the two parts of Yemen. He stressed that the Jordanian leadership was saddened by the failure of the efforts to bring about a reconciliation meeting between the Yemeni president and his deputy in Ta'izz last Sunday. He confirmed that Bin-Shakir's visit to Sanaa and Aden on Monday was made in the context of the Jordanian mediation, sponsored by King Husayn, for the reconciliation of the officials of the two parts of Yemen. During that visit, the source said, Bin-Shakir met with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and conveyed to him a message from King Husayn expressing Jordan's willingness to provide every possible assistance requested by the Yemeni leaders to ensure continuation of Yemeni unity. The meeting was attended by Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah. Bin-Shakir also visited Aden and met with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in the presence of a number of Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders in south Yemen. The source added that the meeting between Bin-Shakir and al-Bid dealt with ways of easing the tension between the Yemeni leaders and then working for a reconciliation meeting between the Yemeni president and vice president, but al-Bid has so far not given a full answer as to whether or not he would attend a reconciliation meeting with Salih in the presence of King Husayn in an area halfway between Sanaa and Aden early next month. The same Jordanian source denied reports of the dispatch of Jordanian forces to Yemen, describing them as inaccurate. He said that the Yemeni leadership had asked the Jordanian Army General Command to help it in providing expertise and advice regarding a plan the Yemeni leadership intends to implement with the aim of reorganizing the Yemeni Army units. He said that, on Monday's visit to Yemen, the Jordanian chief of the Royal Court was accompanied by Staff Major General 'Id Kamil al-Rawdan, Jordanian Army assistant chief of staff for operations and training. He added that during the visit Maj. Gen. al-Rawdan met with senior Yemeni Army officers and discussed with them the possibility of the Jordanian Army command contributing to the preparation and implementation of future plans for the reorganization of the Yemeni Army, and it was agreed to send a limited number of Jordanian officers to participate in the preparation of a new plan for that purpose. In conclusion and in reply to a question, the Jordanian source said that Jordan is primarily interested in the continuation of security and stability in fraternal Yemen and in finding a solution to the current Yemeni crisis through dialogue and positive understanding between the Yemeni leaders. In Cairo, informed sources at the Arab League Secretariat have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Arab League is holding consultations with the Arab states on the situation in Yemen, prevention of its partition, and preservation of its people's unity. They added that the Arab League secretary general has sent messages on this matter to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in the context of the endeavors to contain events there. They also said that the Arab League is considering several options regarding the situation in Yemen with a view to putting an end to conflict and to the disputes between Salih and al-Bid, the two leaders in power. The Arab League had issued a statement expressing concern about the deteriorating situation in fraternal Yemen.
