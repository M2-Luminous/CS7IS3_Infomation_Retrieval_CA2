This was disclosed on 10 March by a source in the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications [MPT]. Negotiations between the IDO and Motorola have almost been settled, but the MPT, which sees the U.S. demand as unreasonable, is concerned that if the United States sticks to its demand, the results of the negotiations will be nil. The same source said the U.S. Government has also asked the Japanese Government through informal channels to have the IDO cancel the transfer of its mobile phone business rights and licenses to third parties. On 10 March the IDO and Motorola agreed: 1) the IDO would increase the number of ground radio stations for its Motorola-type mobile phone service to 159, and 2) of the NTT-type mobile phone service frequencies, 1.5 MHz would be allotted to the Motorola-type mobile phone service. Now they are meeting to finalize details of the agreement. It is said the U.S. Government has been pressing the Japanese Government to promise that if the IDO fails to fulfill its contract with Motorola, Tokyo will impose sanctions on the IDO. So far the MPT has not negotiated directly with the U.S. Government, but a top MPT official states: "Our ministry may need to make a commitment in some form to the U.S. Government." Specifically, the ministry has thought of giving the United States a guarantee that it will simplify and quicken the current procedures for licenses. The MPT is reacting against the U.S. demand for fulfillment of the contract between the IDO and Motorola, claiming the contract cannot be fulfilled by administrative punishment, and any commitment to the fulfillment of the contract could be turned into numerical targets. The ministry intends to sound out the real intentions of the U.S. trade representative.
