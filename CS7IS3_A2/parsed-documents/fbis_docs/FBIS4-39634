Feliks Myasnikov, general director of the "Aviaeksport" Foreign Economic Association, has reported that a new aircaft was supplied to China under contract in 1986. Since then the airliner, in full accordance with the recommended norms, has undergone one planned overhaul, which was carried out at the repair plant at Vnukovo in 1992. According to Feliks Myasnikov, the Chinese side has not submitted data on the aircraft's operation, but there can be no question of its operating life having been exceeded with regard to any of the parameters. The Main Aviation Industry Administration of the Russian Federation State Committee for Defense Sectors of Industry has reported that at the time of the aircraft's handover to the PRC it had flown for 32 hours within the framework of control tests.
