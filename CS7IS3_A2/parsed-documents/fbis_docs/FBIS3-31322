"We have already taken military and other measures to protect the population, vital installations, and the infrastructure so that there will be the least possible damage if the threats do materialize," Kovacevic told Radio Jagodina in Serbia and added: "We do not wish the attacks to occur, but if they do we will use every means at our disposal to defend ourselves." "We do not have a choice. We are not attacking anyone; we are defending ourselves, our homes, and our people," Kovacevic specified and added: "We have no reason for concern; we will effectively defend our positions and our territory with our own resources." Asked what had tipped the scales in favor of halting the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb artillery, Kovacevic replied: "We were ready to withdraw the artillery as prescribed by the ultimatum on condition that the Muslim infantry be placed under supervision at the same time." "Since UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] representatives replied they were not in the position to do this, we decided--and they (UNPROFOR) agreed--not to withdraw the artillery from existing positions but to group it at certain points and place it under UNPROFOR supervision, and this solution was generally accepted." "America can interpret this as it wishes, but we must make sure we do not put ourselves in an inferior position to the Muslims either through negotiations or wrong moves," Kovacevic said and stressed that possible NATO aggression against the Srpska republic would result in the escalation of the war that will not be extinguished easily. "The world knows this; it also knows that NATO's attacks on our positions cannot be as effective as they would like," Kovacevic said.
