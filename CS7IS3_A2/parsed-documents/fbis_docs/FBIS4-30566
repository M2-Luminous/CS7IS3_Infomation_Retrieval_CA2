Attending today's contact are Yi Hong-ku, head delegate from our side, and delegates Chong Chong-uk and Yun Yo-chun; and Kim Yong- sun, head delegate from the North's side, and delegates An Pyong-su and Paek Nam-chun. At today's contact, head delegates from both sides will exchange greetings; delegates will exchange greetings; and Yi Hong-ku, our side's head delegate, will be the first to deliver a speech, followed by a speech by Kim Yong-sun, the North side's head delegate. They will begin the discussion on the time and venue of the summit talks. Through his speech, our side's head delegate Yi Hong-ku will attach importance to the South-North summit talks and will present, in advance, a draft of an agreement proposing a concrete time, venue, protocol procedure, and itinerary for the summit talks. It has been learned the draft proposes that the date of the summit talks be mid-July and that President Kim Il-song visit Seoul first. This notwithstanding, as for the date of the summit talks, if the North side makes concessions to our side by not presenting the date of 15 August--when the pannational rally will be convened--our side will push for the dialogue by making concessions on the venue for the summit talks. At the Secretariat for the South-North Dialogue this morning, our side's delegates gave a final study of our side's position and the North side's expected proposals. Prior to departure, head delegate Yi Hong-ku said: I view the prospects for today's preliminary contact as somewhat affirmative in view of the North side's attitude up until now.
