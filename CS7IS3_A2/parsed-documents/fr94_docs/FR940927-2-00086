FR940927-2-00086 FR940927-2-00063 Current Usage We have recently been faced with two novel situations in which U.S. direct air carriers and their contractors are attempting to avail themselves of this exemption. In the first, the contractor uses the exemption to sell scheduled service in conjunction with an existing U.S. direct air carrier pending Department action on the contractor's own application for certificate or commuter authority. Indeed, the relationship between the contractor-applicant and the direct air carrier, while portrayed as a contract bulk fare arrangement, in fact can be substantially more. The contractor-applicant may provide the ground handling, may be involved in hiring personnel to staff the operation, and may even arrange for the aircraft to be used in the service. The contract operations may also be in markets that are geographically distinct from the ``regular'' scheduled operations of the direct air carrier. The situation is compounded by the fact that the direct air carrier may also register with the Department to use the trade name of the contractor-applicant for these services. 6 Typically, all of these arrangements are scheduled to terminate upon the contractor-applicant's receipt of its own operating authority. 6 Part 215 of the Department's Regulations (14 CFR part 215) establishes a regulatory system of registration and notification by air carriers who propose to use a trade name. Upon compliance with these requirements, use of the trade name is typically allowed. However, the Department will not register a trade name when it is certain that use of such name would constitute an unlawful holding out under 49 U.S.C. 41101(a) ( see former section 401(a) of the Act) or there is a significant potential for, or actual, public confusion or other unfair or deceptive practices prohibited by 49 U.S.C. 41712 ( see former section 411 of the Act). If the registration of an air carrier trade name will help effectuate an arrangement that will unlawfully circumvent our fitness standards, we have the authority to reject the name registration. In the second situation, the U.S. direct air carrier and contractor seek to convert an existing Public Charter program in which they are parties to scheduled service through use of the contract bulk fare exemption. Often, the direct air carrier holds charter-only authority and files an application with the Department seeking scheduled authority in order to operate under a contract bulk fare arrangement. In some cases, the operations represented by the contract bulk fare arrangement constitute most, if not all, of the scheduled operations proposed by the direct air carrier. In general, these operations are indistinguishable from charter flights, except that the contractor and direct air carrier are not subject to the consumer protection requirements applicable to Public Charter flights contained in 14 CFR part 380. Those rules require, among other things, the establishment of escrow accounts and surety arrangements for the protection of passenger funds, and the signing of operator-participant contracts that detail the rights and obligations of the passenger, charter operator, and direct air carrier. Common to both situations is the fact that, in markets covered by the bulk fare contract, the contractor has agreed to buy the entire, or virtually the entire, capacity of the aircraft and is responsible for all of the marketing of that capacity. Normally, the direct air carrier does not perform any marketing function and does not sell air transportation on its own behalf in the markets covered by the contract. Rather, its sole function is to operate the aircraft for which it is paid a set price. Discussion The statute establishes a regulatory framework for conducting air transportation operations that balances a liberal entry policy for new air carriers, both direct and indirect, with Congress' concern for operational safety and consumer protection. Under the statute, a person who wants to engage in air transportation of passengers has two choices; either be found fit as an airline ( i.e., direct air carrier) or qualify as an indirect air carrier. In the case of the person who seeks to operate as a U.S. direct air carrier, that person has to meet a three-part test of demonstrating that it has the managerial competence, financial capability, and compliance disposition to operate the proposed airline safely and without imposing an undue risk on the public. 7 Until the Department finds that the applicant is fit to operate and it is issued appropriate direct air carrier authority, it is prohibited from advertising or otherwise holding out its services to the public ( see 14 CFR 201.5). The intent of this rule is to prevent companies who have not or cannot meet the Department's rigorous fitness test from collecting money from potential passengers, thus exposing them to financial risks. While ultimately many applicants may be found fit and given U.S. direct air carrier authority, often this is not before a number of substantive changes have been made in the management team, ownership structure, or financial arrangements undertaken by the applicant. To allow such applicants to commence operations under the guise of a contract bulk fare arrangement prior to being found fit poses a potentially serious risk to consumers that we believe is not in the public interest. 7 The applicant must also demonstrate that it is a U.S. citizen as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(15) ( see former section 101(16) of the Act). In the case where an entity does not want to operate as a direct air carrier or its agent, but still wants to market air transportation on its own behalf, it is not subject to a fitness review, but must comply with the requirements that the Department has established to ensure that consumer funds and expectations are protected. This means complying with the consumer protection provisions of the Public Charter rules (14 CFR part 380) or, in limited circumstances, the conditions of the contract bulk fare exemption. In our view, the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes the typical contract bulk fare marketing arrangement contemplated in the exemption from the two situations described above lies in who is the true ``operator'' of the services in an economic sense_who has control. In the typical contract bulk fare arrangement, that control rests with the direct air carrier. Although the contractor assumes the risk for those seats that it has purchased from the direct air carrier, the direct air carrier has control over the scheduling of the flights involved, allocation of seat inventory, and ultimate responsibility for safeguarding the passengers' money. Moreover, since a contract bulk fare arrangement is merely one of a number of marketing tools used by a direct air carrier, that arrangement would be incidental to the overall scheduled operations of the direct air carrier. The risk of exposure to the direct air carrier from one contractor would therefore also be limited.
