Following President Caldera's announcement, the reporters asked if this resolution would negatively affect individual and economic rights. In the end, they were clearly informed that the following articles of the Constitution had been suspended: -- Paragraph 1 of Article 60 on individual freedom of prisoners and people who have been arrested. -- Article 62 on the inviolability of residences. -- Article 96 regarding economic rights. -- Article 99 that guarantees the right to own property. -- Article 101 that controls how assets are confiscated. The government spokesmen clarified: "The economic and financial crisis has compelled us to make this decision, because it could trigger chaos or social violence. [no closing quotation marks as published] According to sources at the Presidential Palace, the government learned that a coup d'etat was being planned and managed to contain the plot through its intelligence services. It is also rumored that several generals are now under surveillance. Perhaps this is why we noticed that during his television announcement yesterday, the president was accompanied by military officers representing the four branches of the military instead of members of his cabinet. As far as can be ascertained, the measures that went into effect last night will last as long as the government considers them necessary. Hours before the Executive Cabinet met to give final approval to the measures, the president summoned the leaders of the various political parties to inform them of the strong measures the government would take. Although initially all parties agreed, some political leaders criticized the measures and announced they would define their positions at a later date. For Radical Cause leaders, the problem lies in the fact that even though the emergency measures were announced to them, they were not told how these measures would be implemented. The president spoke to them in "very general terms" about a compensation bonus that would be based on a wage scale, and he also "hinted" that social programs, such as the Pami [box of food given to school children] and school milk programs, would be bolstered. The problem is that he did not say where the funds would come from. The measures adopted yesterday certainly clarify some things, but not others. According to Deputy Melo, it is necessary to modify the banking system through intervention. He said that until the financial sector complies with its intermediary role, high interest rates and inflation will not be controlled. He said: "Structural measures need to be taken in this area." In fact, National Convergence party leader Jose Miguel Uzcategui proposed to the president that the banking system should be nationalized. AD [Democratic Action] party leader Lewis Perez listened to the proposals, after which his only comment was that the CEN [National Executive Committee] will meet to draw up a policy. "My initial impression is that these are momentous measures that need to be analyzed together in order to see what they mean to the country and to the stability of Venezuela's monetary system." The AD Directorate is expected to issue a communique. According to Freddy Munoz [senator and secretary general of the Movement Toward Socialism--MAS], these measures should have been implemented a week ago, because they are intended to stem the dollar outflow: "This is the only way to stop the skyrocketing price of the dollar and rising inflation, not to mention the contemptuous speculation. MAS will meet to discuss exchange, financial, and pricing policies."
