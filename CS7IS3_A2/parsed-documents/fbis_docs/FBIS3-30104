The U.S. economy "remains in a steady growth trend" since it posted a six-year high growth of 5.9 percent in its real gross domestic product (GDP) in the final quarter of 1993, the Japanese central bank said in its monthly overseas economic report. But with the strong growth increasing inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve Board recently announced a "preemptive" monetary policy change, sending short- and long-term market rates higher, the report said. The best scenario the U.S. appears confident to attain is to slow down real GDP growth to the 3 percent level in 1994 with stable prices, a BOJ economist said. But that "scenario could fail if long-term rates continue to rise firmly," he said. Turning to European nations, the central bank said in the report that the British economy is maintaining a "moderate recovery led by personal consumption." Germany and France "have yet to grasp clear clues for an economic recovery with domestic demand again turning stagnant since early autumn amid continued tough labor adjustments," the report said. The BOJ official said both nations could see some bright signs again in summer, particularly in Germany, where the Bundesbank is expected to maintain its "cautious" credit easing to support the economy while preventing inflation, he said. Asian nations are continuing to grow strongly led by China, the report said. China is maintaining "high growth driven by capital investment," posting a hectic 13 percent expansion in 1993. But inflation also remains over 20 percent. This was despite Beijing's efforts to stem overheating to stop inflation. South Korea is posting a "clearer recovery, bolstered by increased exports and construction spending," the report said. Other newly industrializing economies (NIEs) and countries of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are maintaining "relatively high growth on the whole, supported by expansion of intra-regional trading and of infrastructure-related investment."
