FR941007-0-00004 FR941007-0-00002 Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of the provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the NSLP, the administrative procedures are set forth under the following regulations: (1) school food authority appeals of State agency findings as a result of a Coordinated Review must follow State agency hearing procedures as established pursuant to 7 CFR 210.18(q); (2) school food authority appeals of FNS findings as a result of a Coordinated Review must follow FNS hearing procedures as established pursuant to 7 CFR 210.30(d)(3); AND (3) State agency appeals of State Administrative Expense fund sanctions (7 CFR 235.11(b)) must follow the FNS Administrative Review Process as established pursuant to 7 CFR 235.11(f). The NSLP is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.555 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V and final rule-related notice at 48 FR 29114, June 24, 1983). No new data collection or recordkeeping requiring Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3502) are included in this rule. Background: On March 27, 1974, the Department published final regulations (39 FR 11248) which defined enriched macaroni products with fortified protein as a food item meeting the NSLP meal pattern requirements specified in 7 CFR 210.10 under specified terms and conditions. At that time, the PER was the only recognized test for determining the biological quality of protein in foods. At present, there is another recognized method for determining the biological quality of protein in foods, the PDCAAS method. Several international bodies, including a Joint Expert Consultation on Protein Evaluation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) (1989), have concluded that PDCAAS, in which a score of 1.0 equals 100 percent of the 1985 WHO essential amino acid requirement patterns for 2 to 5 year olds, is an appropriate method for evaluating food protein quality. The 2 to 5 year old requirement is the most inclusive of those recommended and thus may be used for all age groups, except infants. PER is based on the assumption that proteins which are equivalent to casein meet the amino acid and protein requirements for the various age groups consuming a particular food. The specification of this methodology, which is based upon rodent nutrition requirements, was assumed to correlate to human requirements when PER was adopted as the sole regulatory method for determining protein quality. Extensive studies have since been conducted on human amino acid requirements which demonstrate that the essential amino acid requirements of humans are significantly different from those of rodents. This was recognized as early as 1980 by a conference of protein scientists and nutritionists held to assess protein quality in humans. A report of this working conference indicated a dissatisfaction with the PER method. The report further recognized that an amino acid scoring system, corrected for digestibility, is an appropriate alternative for measuring protein value.
