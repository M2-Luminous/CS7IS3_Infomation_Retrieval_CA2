Strak was speaking at a news conference in Gdansk. Earlier, Minister Strak held a meeting with students--members of the Political Ideas Club [Klub Mysli Politycznej]. During this meeting, he said, among other things, that his favorite hero was General Kutuzov, who, he said, slept during political and wartime debates but always woke up at the right moment.
