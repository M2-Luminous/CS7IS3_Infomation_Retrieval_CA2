"The recovery of the automobile market in Italy is nonexistent." "The improvement of the economy in Europe is not itself capable of resolving the problems of unemployment and public finance, which is causing an extremely critical situation in Italy." Fiat Chairman Gianni Agnelli came to Lake Como to take part in the seminar organized by the Council for Italian-U.S. Relations, and took the opportunity, both in his speech and when talking with journalists, to express his opinion about the political and economic issues of the moment. From the Berlusconi government's first moves to the failure of the Corfu summit, and from the recovery to the restlessness of the financial markets. [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Agnelli, how do you judge Mr. Berlusconi's first moves? [Agnelli] He certainly has not done much yet, but the first measures are in the right direction... [LA REPUBBLICA] Including in the direction of a reform of public finance? Is there not a danger that the necessary corrective moves will be postponed too long? [Agnelli] The sooner they implement the reform, the better for everyone. Of course, it must be said that this government has only existed for 45 days; it has been distracted by the European elections and has not been able to do much. [LA REPUBBLICA] So would you still express a vote of confidence in it? [Agnelli] Definitely, yes, just as I would grant it to other governments, from an institutional viewpoint. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is Fiat experiencing a recovery? [Agnelli] A distinction must be drawn: The recovery of the automobile market is weak in Europe, but it is nonexistent in Italy, on which, as is well known, Fiat depends to a large extent. [LA REPUBBLICA] So should there be incentives to facilitate sales? [Agnelli] It is not up to me to discuss such matters. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that the recovery that is emerging in Europe could spread and grow stronger? [Agnelli] The overall climate seems calmer, but we must consider how to strengthen the recovery, how to set in motion a strong and lasting recovery. The spontaneous improvement envisaged for the second half of 1994 and for 1995 does not itself seem capable of resolving the two structural problems assailing Europe -- the worrying level of unemployment and the public finance situation. [LA REPUBBLICA] Are there any solutions in the short term? [Agnelli] There are no miracle solutions to unemployment, and there is now widespread agreement that Europe's inability to curb the loss of jobs stems from structural factors such as the great rigidity of the labor market and the excessive extent of the welfare state. If Europe wants to create new job opportunities it must have the courage and the determination to tackle these problems, to impart flexibility to the economic system and to carry out a proper and incisive reform of the welfare state. [LA REPUBBLICA] From an industrial viewpoint, what is the way to support the recovery? [Agnelli] Europe must continue along the path of pay restraint; it must support investments, especially in the major infrastructure networks; it must take action against rigidities and bottlenecks that present sufficient mobility of production factors and especially of labor, so as not to create obstacles to the prompt adaptation of production to the variability of demand. [LA REPUBBLICA] The sudden declines in the international markets indicate great alarm about economic prospects, about trends in inflation and interest rates. [Agnelli] It is essential to issue strong and clear signals to the markets. Negative expectations threaten to influence Europe's recovery, precisely through an increase in the cost of money. Although it can be said that the worst period of the crisis is now behind us, the recovery is not only modest, but still seems very unsteady and based on policies that enjoy little confidence on the part of the markets. [LA REPUBBLICA] The Corfu summit ended without an agreement on the next president of the Commission. Is that a worrying sign? [Agnelli] They will meet and discuss it again. For us Italians, it does not seem to me to be a major problem whether the candidate is Dutch or Belgian. Personally, I would choose GATT Secretary General Peter Sutherland for his professional qualities. [LA REPUBBLICA] So is there not another split within the European Union? [Agnelli] British Prime Minister Major has suffered so many blows at home that he wanted to gain some satisfaction abroad by blocking the choice of the new president.
