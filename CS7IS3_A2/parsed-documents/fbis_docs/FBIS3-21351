They emphasized that the new budget confirms that the Saudi economy is capable of facing up to the realities of the present and of adapting to new developments. They say that the budget allows the private sector an opportunity to contribute effectively to the process of development. Following are the views they expressed to 'UKAZ AL-IQTISADI. Facing Reality 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Juraysi, chairman of the Council of Saudi Chambers [of Commerce] and chairman of the board of the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, began by emphasizing that the budget for the new 1414/15H fiscal year confirms that the Saudi economy is capable of facing up to the realities of the present and of adapting to new developments. The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, may God save him, has enunciated, concisely and with great clarity, the economy's current state of affairs and its correlation to world developments leading to softening oil prices, especially the increase in oil supply and the depressed value of the dollar, which is the major currency in which oil transactions are denominated. Al-Juraysi added that the new budget entails important economic indicators, such as: - The acumen of the Kingdom's economic policy, which focuses on the diversification of the sources of national income as the main thrust of all past, present, and future development plans. This policy has been a complete success. Thanks to rising GDP in all oil and non-oil economic sectors, the rate of GDP growth in non-oil sectors has been five times higher than its rate of growth in the oil sector over the past 20 years. The rate of GDP growth was 377 percent in non-oil sectors compared with only about 75 percent in the oil sector. - The solidity and strength of the Saudi economy and its continued growth, despite adverse world economic conditions that have impacted most countries of the world, including the advanced nations. For instance, the rate of economic growth declined in the 24 OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] states from 1.5 percent in 1992 to 1.1 percent in 1993; in the United States from 2.4 percent to 1.5 percent; and in Japan from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent. - Confirm, at the highest official level, the stable value of the national currency, the Saudi riyal, which the state has not devalued as several other nations have. That Royal Majestic confirmation by the King will play a fundamental role in strengthening the national economy and in maintaining the confidence it has earned over the year. - Underscore confidence in the private sector and its growing role in attaining development plan objectives. By casting it into the leading role to carry out projects, the private sector will be inspired to attain more objectives, especially as the state's appreciation of and confidence in businessmen begets more giving and loyalty to the motherland. - Continued state support of development projects. In contrast with other budgetary appropriations, allocations for development funds were only very imperceptibly lowered this year by no more than 2.5 percent. They stand at 7.8 billion riyals [R] compared with R8 billion in last year's budget. This is a fundamental factor and a strong incentive for the continued blossoming of the private sector and for encouraging citizens to invest in development projects with soft loans they secure from those funds. - The stability of prices in the Kingdom, despite the increase in world prices, means that the standard of living will continue at its high level. The cost of living in the final month of 1993 was only 1.8 percent higher than the same month a year earlier--a very small increase. The chairman of the Council of Saudi Chambers and of the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry emphasized that the Saudi economy, with all its sectors and segments, is capable of persevering; nay, of taking off to achieve more growth. There is no better proof of that than its success in competently and efficiently handling the crises it has encountered, especially the oil price crisis in the early eighties and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait crisis and its aftermath in the early nineties. Less Dependence on Oil Dr. 'Abdallah al-Hamad, managing-director of the Arab Institute for City Development, said that the three royal decrees, the remarks of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and the Ministry of Finance statement that detailed state budget revenues and expenses for FY 1414/15H (1994), confirm existing confidence in the Saudi national economy and bring all the facts to the fore amidst changing world and regional developments, especially the decline in oil prices and budget shrinkage to R160 billion. This is 30 percent below the previous budget, but it also means that the deficit gap has been bridged. It is proof positive that the state, represented by the Ministry of Finance and Economy and all other relevant agencies, under the leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, constantly monitors the course of the national economy. He pointed out that the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques emphasized two points in his brief remarks on that historic occasion: the importance of safeguarding the strength of the national economy within the limitations of available financial resources, and commitment to preserve the current value of the riyal without revaluation. He added that those who examine the budget will find that it has taken all oil market swings and price fluctuations into consideration. The Ministry of Finance statement made it clear that there was some tangible decline in dependence on oil, which now accounts for 75 percent of revenues. This will be the focus of the sixth development plan. It also made it clear that the private sector has realized tangible growth of 5.1 percent. The budget set aside R43 billion for expenditure on management contracts and previously authorized construction projects. The lending funds, be they agricultural, industrial, or real estate, and the Lending Bank, were allotted 7.8 billion [as published]. All of that would bolster confidence in the national economy. The great significance of issuing this year's budget on time will be apparent once we realize that several countries have actually taken to monthly or extended budgets. He emphasized that the timely announcement of the detailed state budget underscores the Kingdom's ability to adapt to developments, despite the extraordinary difficulties encountered by the world and by the region, of which the Kingdom is a part. The Kingdom has confronted the greatest crisis in history during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and has shouldered the greatest of burdens as a result. Difficult times continued with the substantial softening of oil prices as they set record lows, in addition to fluctuations in the world economy, the outcome of the GATT agreement, etc. And yet, the Kingdom was able to overcome those obstacles and to support the price of the riyal without revaluation. The Kingdom will continue on its course of security, safety, and stability and will persevere in adopting a market economy, economic diversification, and in expanding the private sector and boosting its effectiveness. Balanced Revenues and Expenditures Dr. Faysal Bin 'Abdallah, vice chancellor of King Sa'ud University's College of Engineering in Riyadh, believes that the Kingdom's budget, at R160 billion, is of substantial size, considering that the Kingdom has already completed big chunks of the country's infrastructure. The budget this year is differentiated by balanced revenues and expenditures, which means that the state has no need to borrow. This is an important indicator of the Saudi economy's strength and solidity. He added that, despite the state's financial burdens resulting from the Gulf war and from oil prices at record lows, budgets in previous years, and the new budget as well, have pledged continued effective and rational expenditures on building, development, and modernization. They have also been keen on maintaining subsidies to development funds, which remain the effective player in that respect. Indications of Riyal Stability Dr. Ibrahim Muhammad al-Qahti, professor of economics at King Fahd's University of Petroleum and Metallurgy in Dhahran, believes that emphasis by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques on guaranteeing the stability of the Saudi riyal dinar [as published] as it now stands without revaluation is a positive indicator of our economy's stability in all domestic and international respects and is a most eloquent response to the skepticism raised by some doubters. That, he added, gives strong impetus to both domestic and foreign investors. On how the private sector can contribute to GDP growth, lessen dependence on oil revenues, and diversify sources of national income, he said that now is the best time to enter into foreign partnerships, especially with Europeans. Private Sector Growth Salih Bin 'Ali al-Humaydan, deputy secretary general of Sharqiyyah Chamber [of Commerce], believes that the most outstanding characteristic of the new budget is the substantial growth achieved by the private sector at the rate of 5.1 percent last year. That rate of growth is expected to go even higher, indicating that the state pays great attention to the private sector in order that it may perform its targeted role. Al-Humaydan anticipates higher private sector contribution to the enrichment of our great country. We might perhaps notice that the state has lessened dependence on a single source of revenues. Oil is only 75 percent; other sources account for the remaining 25 percent. The state, as a service to citizens, will carry some R4.5 billion in subsidies to municipalities and water utilities. The state diligently avoids [reducing] projects that would contribute to the citizenry's quality of life. The Deficit Disappears Yusif 'Abd-al-Sattar Maymani, councilman of the al-Madinah region; businessman Muhammad As'ad Sharbini, managing director of al-Madinah Company for Investment; engineer Mustafa Muhammad Balul, managing director of Agriculture and Water in the al-Madinah region, businessman Sharif Nayif Bin Jaddum, and Tarif Husayn Hashim, secretary general of al-Madinah Chamber--all agree that the absence of a budget deficit this year is a positive factor that embodies our economy's ability to meet all developments and difficult challenges.
