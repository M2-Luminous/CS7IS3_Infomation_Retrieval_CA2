FR940406-0-00141 FR940406-0-00011 (a)(7) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into evaporative/refueling emission families based on the criteria listed above (such as non-canister control system approaches), the Administrator will establish families for those vehicles based upon the features most related to their evaporative and/or refueling emission characteristics. (a)(8) through (b)(1)(vi) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;24. (b)(1)(vii)(A) Vehicles of each evaporative/refueling emission family will be divided into evaporative/refueling emission control systems. (B) The Administrator will select the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest evaporative and/or refueling emissions, from within each evaporative/refueling family to be certified, from among the vehicles represented by the exhaust emission-data selections for the engine family, unless evaporative and/or refueling testing has already been completed on the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest evaporative and/or refueling emissions for the evaporative/refueling family as part of another engine family's testing. (C) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(B) of this section do not represent each evaporative/refueling emission control system then the Administrator will select the highest expected evaporative/refueling emission vehicle from within the unrepresented evaporative/refueling system. (viii) For high-altitude evaporative and/or refueling emission compliance for each evaporative/refueling emission family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the following procedures: (A) The manufacturer will select for testing under high-altitude conditions the one nonexempt vehicle previously selected under paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(B) or (b)(1)(vii)(C) of this section which is expected to have the highest level of evaporative and/or refueling emissions when operated at high altitude; or (B) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;24. (b)(ix) through (e)(2) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;24. (f) Carryover and carryacross of durability and emission data. In lieu of testing an emission-data or durability vehicle (or engine) selected under paragraph (b)(1) (vii) through (viii) of this section and §86.096&hyph;24 (b)(1) (i) through (vii) and (b)(2) through (c), and submitting data therefor, a manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the Administrator, submit exhaust emission data, evaporative emission data and/or refueling emission data, as applicable on a similar vehicle (or engine) for which certification has been obtained or for which all applicable data required under §86.098&hyph;23 has previously been submitted. (g) through (h) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;24.
