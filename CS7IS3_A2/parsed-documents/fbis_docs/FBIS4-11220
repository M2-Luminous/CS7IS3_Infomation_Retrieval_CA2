This is not considered enough by the labor unions that have reacted with massive hunger strikes. The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB), the only labor union in the country, has organized another voluntary hunger strike to protest the aborted attempt by members of the Attorney General's Office to dislodge three teachers who have been fasting for the past 19 days at the COB headquarters to demand better salaries. La Paz District Attorney Javier Dips tried to dislodge the strikers and transfer them to medical centers because, according to medical reports, they are about to go into comma due to lack of food. The aborted attempt was criticized by COB leaders and workers, as well as by Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters who denied any government involvement in the case, and by Interior Minister German Quiroga who asserted that those on hunger strike at the labor union headquarters will be respected. COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas, today stated that more workers have joined the 768 people fasting throughout the country "to make the government aware of their salary demands." A group of 180 teachers who began a march to La Paz on 18 April from Tiquina, on Lake Titicaca, will arrive in La Paz today and immediately join the hunger strike, according to their leaders. The teachers have been marching along the highway to La Paz for the past three days. One of them said: "We want to make the government aware that we cannot live in misery for ever. We demand a fair salary that will be in keeping with the cost of the family basket." The government-COB dialogue was suspended after President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at dawn today promulgated the National Budget Law, which provides for an 8-percent salary increase. The COB has summoned a nationwide meeting of leaders to decide on future actions following the imminent rupture with the government, as well as the possibility of requesting the intervention of the church.
