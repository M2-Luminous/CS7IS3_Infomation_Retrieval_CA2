Speaking at a [name indistinct] interview program aired by the British (?ITV) network today, the prime minister said Malaysia's decision to ban British companies from getting new business contracts may be reviewed but such a decision is not within his authority. Malaysia imposed the ban following British media reports saying Malaysian Government leaders received kickbacks from British companies. The ban, which also annulled all business agreements, caused British companies to lose billions of ringgit. Speaking at a news conference at the end of his visit to Sabah, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the federal government had no intention of pressuring the Sabah state government when it made its decision to rotate the chief minister's post among the three main ethnic groups. The move is purely designed to prevent undesirable actions by some people. [Mahathir's recording indistinct] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir also talked about tourism in Sabah.
