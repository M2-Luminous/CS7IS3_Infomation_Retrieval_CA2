Mr Henning Christophersen, Commission vice president, said that after leading Europe in 1994 Britain was likely to underperform its main Continental rivals in 1995. The commission has raised its expectations for Europe and is now looking for overall growth of 16 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent in 1995. The new forecasts came as the German Bundesbank announced an unexpected half point cut -- to 4 per cent -- in its key discount rate, thereby underpinning the optimism about European growth. The forecast for the British economy is being cut to 2.3 per cent next year, down from an original 2.7 per cent and below Government projection for this year of 2.5 per cent growth. However, the commission's pessimism is not shared by the majority of independent economists in Britain. They believe that as consumer spending slows, the momentum of the economy will be maintained through higher exports and rising levels of investment. This view is supported by a Confederation of British Industry survey which yesterday revealed that exports have become a key factor in the revival of industry. All eleven regions of the country are now benefiting from higher order levels, the first time this has happened for five years, the survey reveals. A slowdown in consumption would not be unwelcome to the authorities. Mr Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, said last night that steady and sustained growth would be preferable to the kind of booms of the past which would lead to an inevitable bust. Speaking in the City, Mr George said: "If we are patient, we now have the best opportunity that I can recall to achieve continuing, steady expansion that can be sustained through much of the rest of the decade. Now I know that some people say, `That's all very well, but it still doesn't feel much like a recovery. Demand is not like it was in the boom; house prices are not going up much; and I still don't feel much better off.' "But that is precisely the point -- we have to avoid the excesses of the late 1980s, which felt wonderfully good in the short-term, but which were the root cause of the misery that followed." A survey from the Institute of Directors, due out today, will also report the most significant increase in orders, business volume and profits since the start of the recovery. The picture of an economy which is still gathering momentum was underlined yesterday by figures showing an increase in manufacturing output of 14 per cent in the first quarter of the year -- the fastest quarterly growth rate since 1989. Recovery in Europe would be welcomed by British businesses which have been struggling to increase sales on the Continent despite a competitive pound. Surveys suggest that the improvement in the European economy has already had a beneficial impact on export orders in Britain. The commission's forecasts are not all negative. Britain's borrowing requirement is expected to go on falling, to well below the EC average next year, as will its unemployment rate. It calculates that unemployment in Britain will fall to 9.3 per cent in 1995, compared to 9.5 per cent in Germany, 11.4 per cent in France and 11.7 per cent in Italy. Mr Christophersen said: "The recovery in all EC countries is stronger than we had thought... the only exception is the UK."
