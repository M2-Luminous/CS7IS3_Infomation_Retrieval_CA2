The 60 bills in the list are regarded by the government to be essential for continuation of the reforms in 1994, Vladimir Kvasov, the government chief of staff, told Interfax in an exclusive interview. The list includes amendments of the Criminal and Criminal Processing Codes and pension and value added tax legislations. The government will ask the law makers to start working on payment for land, land utilization, privatization and technological policy legislation. Even this incomplete list confirms the government resolve to stay on the reform course and to have a legal basis for this, Kvasov said. He described the argument advanced by numerous political scientists and columnists that departure of Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fyodorov reflected a change of the government course as "not serious." He explained: "Did only these two carry the reforms out while the other nearly 30 members of the government were standing by? Because nearly all other ministers have retained their jobs, it would be wrong to say that this is a new government." He confirmed that the government was "actively engaged" in preparation for a meeting which would discuss the country's economic situation and the prospects for its development in 1994. The national budget and ways to put it on a sound basis are also under discussion. "The Russian government did not ask scientists Abalkin, Shatalin, Petrakov and their teams to work out any programs but it will not reject considering any model of economic development which might do Russia good," Kvasov said. He described the government headquarters as a working body one of whose functions was to concentrate the government's attention on priority fields such as the socioeconomic policty, fuel and energy, transportation, communication, conversion of defense industries to peaceful uses and the investment policy. A machinery structured function-wise rather than sector-wise is capable, Kvasov thinks, of helping the government to stay on this selective course, thus reducing the dangers of sectoral lobbying. Kvasov believes that this is especially important now that the country was short of finances and material resources. He dismissed media reports of differences inside the government. "A machinery where about 750 senior officials are engaged does not duplicate the functions of ministries or departments. Its enables the government to have things done. This is the formulation of the Russian Council of Ministers Act, signed by the president on December 22, 1992, or 20 days before I became head of this echelon," Kvasov emphasized. He said that there was no truth in the press reports to the effect that his office was capable of tackling political matters such as laying the groundwork for the next presidential elections. "The headquarters was designed as a purely economic, not political, office. Over 100 doctors and candidates of economic sciences make the core of its personnel. We draft about ten government ordinances daily. Nearly 4500 such documents were processed in the headquarters and its personnel carried out over 46,000 orders of top authorities last year. With this amount of work the headquarters simply cannot share in political tugs-of-war and we never wanted it," Kvasov said. In his view, the government has "a sufficient safety margin" and is strong enough to withstand political attacks. Certain people are trying, however, to make life hard for the government by provoking strikes and adding to social tensions. The opponents of reforms are trying, he said, to play "the miners card."
