The drop, however, would not greatly affect food supply. But there is concern about the further damage it would do to farmers income levels, which have increasingly fallen behind those of their urban counterparts. The disparity between rural and urban incomes will last at least another 10 years. And experts at an economic Green Paper launched last Saturday urged authorities to increase investment in agriculture, improve the government-controlled marketing of farm products and abandon the existing household registration system that prevents labour flow. The Green Paper, co-authored by the Institute of Rural Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Division of Rural Society of State Statistics Bureau, reviews the country's agricultural performance over the past year and outlines a plan for this year. Two dozen officials and experts from various government departments and research bodies exchanged views on agricultural conditions. Although they differed on specific issues, a general consensus was that the sector is confronting tougher challenges than ever before. Luo Yousheng, head of the Policy and Law Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, said the summer grain harvest would probably be less than last year. The acreage of winter wheat, which makes up one quarter of the year's grain harvest, is 600,000 hectares less than it was last year. Worse, 27 percent of the sown area, or more than 6.7 million hectares, was damaged by the freezing winter. Rainy weather in the South, drought in the North and inadequate investment by farmers have all resulted in weak seedlings, Luo said. Miao Jianping, director of the Research Centre of Rural Economy of the Agricultural Ministry, said 109 million hectares of cereals have been sown, 1.3 million hectares less than the ministry-set minimum. Alarm bells are starting to ring. Farmers have planted 5.4 million hectares of cotton, a mild increase over last year but still substantially less than the government-planned 6 million hectares, Miao said. And the country produced only 3.76 million tons of cotton last year, down 17 percent from the previous year, causing nationwide concern. To ensure enough grain and cotton planting, local administrators have adopted a carrot-and-stick approach -- harsh administrative measures combined with economic incentives. But, even so, Miao suspects output will still fall short of target. Worries Wang Xiyu, vice-director of the Agricultural Division of the State Council Development and Research Centre, shared Miao's worries. He said administrative measures ran contrary to the demands of a market economy and went against the will of central government. But at least the fall in grain yield will not prove too serious, according to most of the experts at the launch. It should not affect food supply much. Although, they anticipated food price hikes because of entrepreneurial speculation and the inflationary pressures. Rural industry, one of the country's most dynamic sectors, will continue its rapid growth, Miao said. Latest figures show enterprises at the township and village levels manufactured 474 billion yuan ($54 billion) worth of products in the first quarter. An increase of 47 percent over the same period last year. Miao said rural enterprises growth would slow to 20 percent from 30 percent by the end of the year due to reduced monetary supply. Luo said rural firms had been burdened with heavy taxes since central government introduced its tax reforms at the beginning of the year. The State coffers now take 33 percent of profits, which is more than was previously taken. The taxes are likely to block investment in farming and rural infrastructure . Luo reckoned the reforms will cost rural businesses an extra 45 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) and will send more and more firms into the red. Last year, rural firms paid 95 billion yuan ($11 billion) in taxes. The output of vegetables, domestic animals and aquatic products would continue to increase Luo said. The experts said the income gaps between rural and urban residents, and between the more affluent coast and the hinterland, would further widen. And no effective way of reversing the trend had so far been found. Chinese farmers, who make up 70 percent of the population, earned an average of 921 yuan ($106) last year, an increase of 3.2 percent after inflation. By contrast, city dwellers made an average 2,337 yuan ($269) each, a rise of 10.2 percent over the previous year. Urbanites now earn almost two and a half times as much as their country cousins. A meagre 3 percent growth in farmers incomes is forecast for this year, which is half that prescribed in the official Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-95). Deng Yingtao, vice-director of the Rural Development Institute, blamed the slow increase of farmers' incomes on falling farm profits and lack of new labour opportunities among rural enterprises. Declining consumer demand for farm products has hit the agricultural sector hard, said Deng, chief editor of the Green Paper. And the rising price of agricultural materials and equipment has virtually ruled out the cutting production costs as a way of increasing profits. And the government is financially incapable of subsidizing cereal production, Deng said. A logical way out was to cut the number of farmers and transfer them to non-agricultural businesses, he said. Orientation Unfortunately, an increasing number of rural industrial firms have ended their labour-intensive strategies and gone for capital-intensive policies instead. So job opportunities have been reduced. And China's relative dearth of cities has blocked the development of the service industry, a major job market in any country. The service sector made up only 14 percent of rural output last year, half the national average. Building and expanding cities to create efficient industry and services could be the only solution. Although this would take a long time considering the huge population base. The experts concluded that Chinese farmers were unlikely to see their income grow significantly for a long time. Deng advocated the developing environmentally friendly agriculture, accelerating urbanization, expanding the service sector and boosting value-added farm product processing. Other experts said that the government should immediately reform the household registration system, which is a planned-economy practice, and open the cities to farmers. Most government departments now agree that the old system must be abolished, it's just a question of how fast. And the Ministry of Public Security is drafting a decree on changing the registration system in counties and towns, which will be publicized soon.
