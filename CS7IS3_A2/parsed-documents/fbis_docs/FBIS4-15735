A delegation from the lower chamber of the Yugoslav parliament has just been to Moscow and left taking with them the most optimistic impressions. "The main Duma factions promised us support on what is the main issue for us -- the lifting of sanctions," Radoman Bozovic, chairman of the Yugoslav parliament's lower chamber, told IZVESTIYA. "Russian deputies realize that sanctions were introduced simply to punish the Serbs." The Belgrade politician also thinks that Russian diplomats have changed their approach to Yugoslavia's problems: "Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin told us that they consider the lifting of sanctions an inalienable part of the peacemaking process. Following the December elections, Russian diplomacy has taken a more realistic stance on Yugoslavia." Radoman Bozovic gave IZVESTIYA an interview in the half-empty Yugoslav Embassy building in Moscow, where there are just a few diplomats left owing to the sanctions and where Kozyrev, the Vatican, and the Americans are cursed and tales told about the genocide of Serbs. Politicians and professional propaganda personnel speak significantly and only too often about Slav unity, which people in Belgrade only recalled after sanctions were introduced against Serbia. The main task facing Belgrade's diplomacy is to pit Russia against the West. The representatives of Yugoslavia against which the UN sanctions have been imposed are not very well received worldwide. The 41-year old Radoman Bozovic, who used to teach the theory of economic development, was elected chairman of the parliament's lower chamber a year ago and this is his first official visit abroad. "We told Kozyrev and Churkin that the Bosnian Serbs and Serb Krajina (an enclave on Croatia's territory) must have the same right to self-determination as the other peoples of the former Yugoslavia," Radoman Bozovic said. "If the Bosnian Muslims or the Croats can have their own state, then why should the Bosnian Serbs be denied that?"
