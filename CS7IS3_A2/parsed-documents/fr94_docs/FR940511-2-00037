ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive financial assistance. SUMMARY: DOE announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1), it intends to award a noncompetitive financial assistance grant to the state of Nevada, Division of Emergency Management (NDEM), for providing emergency management initiatives which will ensure the DOE Nevada Operations Office compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental requirements. This grant will implement an agreement with the NDEM to improve the accountability of the DOE in the areas of environmental protection, public health and safety, and emergency management. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The state of Nevada, NDEM, will provide emergency management initiatives to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations at DOE locations in the state of Nevada. The state of Nevada will assume a more substantive role in overseeing DOE's compliance with state environmental laws, and to help assure the citizens of Nevada that DOE operations do not constitute a health hazard. Eligibility for the award of this grant is being limited to the state of Nevada because the applicant is a unit of government, and the activity to be supported is related to performance of a governmental function within the subject's jurisdiction, thereby precluding DOE provisions of support to another entity. The term of this grant is for five years and will commence July 1, 1994, and end June 30, 1999. The total estimated cost of this award is $1.4 million.
