Represented at the TCDC meeting were 26 countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America. A Chinese delegation also attended the meeting. This is the first international conference held in Nigeria since the Abacha administration took over power in mid-November last year. Initiated under the United Nations Development Program, the TCDC is aimed at promoting cooperation among developing countries. At the opening ceremony, Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha said TCDC "is a means of promoting cultural and tech-nological exchanges among developing countries". Abacha said the TCDC emerged as a new dimension in international cooperation for development which allowed developing countries to achieve national and collective self-reliance. At the closing ceremony, Nigerian minister of national planning S.B. Daniyan described the TCDC as a means of national and regional growth and such cooperation is needed to address resource limitations in developing countries. Reached by XINHUA on the phone, Huang Zhaohong, who headed the Chinese delegation to the meeting, said in Abuja that a total of 280 cooperation agreements were concluded by the end of the meeting. China has reached 64 cooperation agreements with Benin, Cuba, Gambia, Nigeria and Thailand, said Huang, who is also economic and commercial counsellor in the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria. With the Nigerian delegation alone, the Chinese delegation has signed 57 such agreements in agriculture, industry and technology. "This is the first time for China to have TCDC agreements with Nigeria," he said. "The Chinese delegation ranks first in reaching cooperation agreements with other nations," he said. In a speech delivered at the closing ceremony Li Wanming, a woman member of the Chinese delegation, said the Chinese Government attaches a great importance to cooperation among developing countries. Meanwhile, she also spoke highly of the role of the United Nations Development Program [UNDP] in accelerating social and economic development in developing countries. China began to take part in the UNDP activities in October 1972. In September 1979, the UNDP set up a permanent representative office in China.
