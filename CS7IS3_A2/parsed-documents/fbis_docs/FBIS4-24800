For some time, some civic aviation departments or ticket offices have insisted that passengers buy various insurances in violation of the principle of voluntary participation. The passengers complained bitterly about this. The CAAC circular pointed out that it is strictly forbidden to refuse to sell tickets or handle passenger check-in or cargo shipping procedures for passengers or shippers who have not bought personal, luggage, or cargo insurance. Ticketing departments (including agents) must, on principle, have separate windows for handling regular ticket sales and for insurance sales. If they are sold at the same window, the words "passenger insurance voluntary" and the insurance premium should be written on the window in plain sight. Violation of the aforementioned stipulations is punishable by a fine of 20,000 yuan in pursuance with relevant regulations and the violator will be criticized in the form of a circular.
