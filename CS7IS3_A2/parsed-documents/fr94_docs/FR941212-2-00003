FR941212-2-00003 FR941212-2-00001 Under the Proposal, Member Firms could solicit customers to open Member Firm Managed Futures Accounts (``MFMFAs''). Each MFMFA would be a discretionary account owned by, and carried in the name of, an individual customer, managed by either the Member Firm, an associated person (``AP'') thereof, or an unaffiliated trading manager such as a registered commodity trading advisor (``CTA''). The CBOT contemplates that MFMFAs would trade contracts to which the average pricing system (``APS'') 3 and average quantity order system (``AQOS'') 4 are applicable. The Proposal contemplates that, except as provided therein, each MFMFA would be subject to all applicable requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission regulations and CBOT rules. Among other exceptions, however, Member Firms would not be required to provide the Disclosure Document of a commodity trading advisor (``CTA'') retained to direct a MFMFA, as otherwise required by Commission Regulation 4.31, nor would they be required to provide daily purchase and sale confirmations to MFMFA customers, as required by Commission Regulation 1.33(b). CTA Disclosure Documents would be available upon request, and daily confirmations would be available at the office of the Member Firm. 5 Each MFMFA customer would be provided with, and acknowledge receipt of, a MFMFA Risk Disclosure Statement disclosing, among other things, the risks of investing in a MFMFA and the provisions regarding daily confirmations and delivery of the Disclosure Document of a CTA managing a MFMFA. 6 The Risk Disclosure Statement also would disclose that no individual customer could invest more than ten percent of his or her liquid net worth, exclusive of home, furnishings and automobile, in a single MFMFA or more than twenty percent of liquid worth in all his or her MFMFAs at all Member Firms combined. As submitted, the Proposal also includes a provision for mandatory arbitration of disputes relating to MFMFAs. 3 The APS set forth in CBOT Rule 421.03 was permitted to be made effective in June of 1992. It enables Member Firms to confirm to customers an average price when portions of an order or series of orders for the same accounts are executed at different prices. Other exchanges also have average pricing systems. 4 The AQOS set forth in CBOT Rule 421.04 was permitted to be made effective in October of 1993. It permits the confirmation to customers of average contract quantities. To date, no other exchange has adopted an average quantity order system. 5 Monthly statements showing each transaction would be provided to each account customer, as required by Commission Regulation 1.33(a). 6 The CBOT further represents that ``[e]ach Member Firm will have representatives reasonably available during normal business hours to answer any inquiries or provide consultation to customers'' regarding MFMFAs. Member Firms sponsoring a MFMFA would be required to submit, upon request, a separate ledger recording all day trades to the CBOT's Office of Investigations and Audits and to adopt and enforce written procedures enabling them to supervise the solicitation of investments in MFMFAs and the handling of complaints related to such accounts. No person participating in MFMFA trading decisions could receive monthly commissions in an amount greater than 2.083 percent of net equity in any particular MFMFA as of the beginning of the month. II. Request for Comments Comment is requested on any aspect of the Proposal that members of the public believe may raise issues under the Act or Commission regulations. In this regard, the Commission notes that, naturally, Section 4 o of the Act would apply to the proposed provisions. The Commission further notes that the Proposal, as submitted, could not be approved unless certain existing Commission regulations were amended. For example, as noted above, the Proposal would: (1) Require account owners to consent to the submission of all disputes relating to MFMFAs to binding arbitration, which appears to conflict with Commission Regulation 180.3(b) pursuant to which a customer's consent to arbitration prior to the time a claim or grievance arises may not be a condition to the customer's ability to utilize the services of the futures commission merchant; (2) permit Member Firms to not provide MFMFA customers with daily purchase and sale confirmations as now is required by Commission Regulation 1.33(b); and (3) require delivery of the Disclosure Document of a CTA retained to direct a MFMFA to the account owner solely where requested by the customer, whereas Commission Regulation 4.31 requires delivery of the Disclosure Document to prospective CTA clients at or before the time of their solicitation or opening a discretionary account with the CTA. Accordingly, commenters may wish to address the questions of whether the proposed arbitration, disclosure and trade confirmation provisions provide adequate customer protection. Further, commenters should discuss what are the compelling reasons, if any, from a fairness, business, increase of access, flexibility, or other perspective, why the Commission should revise the above-cited rules to provide for the exceptions necessary to implement the Proposal and what conditions, if any, should limit the use of such exceptions. In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether Member Firms or their APs participating in the proposed program may come within the Commission's regulatory framework for commodity trading advisors and should be required to register as such, on whether the Proposal presents issues related to the oversight of such Member Firms and APs and on any other aspect of the Proposal. Copies of the Submission are available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies also may be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat at the above address or by telephoning (202) 254&hyph;6314. Some materials may be subject to confidential treatment pursuant to 17 CFR 145.5 or 145.9. Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the Proposal should send such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, by the specified date. Issued in Washington, DC, on December 6, 1994. Alan L. Seifert, Deputy Director.
