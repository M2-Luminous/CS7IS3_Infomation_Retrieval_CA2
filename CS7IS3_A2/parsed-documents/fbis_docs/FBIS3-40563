S. Congress has asked Foreign Secretary Warren Christopher to play an effective role in finding a peaceful resolution to the Kashmir crisis. A letter this group sent to the secretary of state stated that there was great concern about human rights violations by the Indian armed forces and militant groups. They have concluded that the Indian Army is committing atrocities against the Kashmiri people according to an organized plan. Therefore, the Indian government should be asked to explain the situation, and should take to task the people involved in violating human rights. The situation surrounding the Indian government's violations of human rights has become so serious that even the United States has been forced to take notice. However, in order to be "fair," the U. S. Congress has also accused Pakistan of supplying weapons to the "terrorists." The fact is that Kashmiri freedom fighters are not terrorists, and Pakistan is not supplying them with any weapons. Pakistan is giving moral support to these freedom fighters; however, talks about providing them with weapons are totally wrong. This accusation is coming from India. If the members of the U. S. Congress pay attention to India's violations of human rights, they would not spoil the issue by declaring the freedom fighters terrorists. Nor should they recognize the Indian accusation of Pakistan supplying the weapons in order to try to lighten India's weight of crime. The Kashmiri freedom fighters are struggling to free their country from the Indian tyrants, and they have the support of the whole free world including Pakistan. Since Pakistan is an important partner in the Kashmir issue, it has a moral responsibility to help the Kashmiris. It seems that the United States does not want a just solution to the Kashmir issue. Instead, it has some secret plans about Kashmir. Under this plan it is trying to involve China in this matter. An important State Department official has announced that the area given to China under the Pakistan-China border agreement was part of Jammu-Kashmir. The United States is making this issue even more complicated, and it could even hurt Indian interests. Therefore, India should start meaningful talks with Pakistan over Kashmir in order to keep international powers out of the subcontinent. If an American military base is established in Kashmir, it will prove a headache to India also.
