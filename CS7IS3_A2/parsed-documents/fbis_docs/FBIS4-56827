To attach utmost importance to their position is to reduce the negotiation "to a simple laying down of weapons by the URNG, without having resolved any of the causes that generated and perpetuates the armed conflict," the guerrillas said. The Coordinating Committee of Farming, Commercial, Industrial, and Financial Associations and Guatemalan Defense Minister Mario Enriquez said last week that there must be a cease-fire before the peace dialogue resumes. In a communique broadcast in Mexico City, the URNG General Command insisted that "a cease-fire declaration at this time will not resolve this problem," referring to the situation in the Central American country. The Guatemalan guerrillas also reiterated that the creation of a Truth Commission "is not only essential but unpostponable in view that it is a substantial component of eradicating impunity." The government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and the URNG are scheduled to meet in Oslo, Norway, at the end of May. In March, they agreed that in the meeting they will discuss the establishment and operation of this commission. The release of the rebel document coincided with remarks by De Leon Carpio, who in San Jose, Costa Rica, viewed as inadvisable the creation of the commission because it might deepen wounds and hinder the peace negotiations. For the URNG, the president has "only one choice" and that "is to fulfill and enforce the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and give concrete signs of wanting to achieve progress in the negotiation." The government and the URNG have been engaged in a process of talks aimed at ending an armed conflict that, according to humanitarian organizations, has left about 175,000 dead in 34 years.
