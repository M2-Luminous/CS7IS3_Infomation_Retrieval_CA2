This comes at the time when discontent over the high benefits given to political appointees is a matter of heated debate. NEW NATION's attempts this week to confirm the high grants and car allowances that ministers enjoy -- said to amount to R276,000 [rand] a year -- were met with deafening silence from government offices. A reputable source in government told NEW NATION that cabinet ministers were offered various payments beyond their R30,000 monthly salaries that included in addition to car allowances, R10,000 a month and extra cash to cover their telephone and fax bills -- and even their groceries. The allowances have reportedly been accepted by three ministers, while others are said to be still unsure whether to accept the perks or refuse them. [passage omitted] A clerk in the Ministry of Finance confirmed that ministers got a monthly allowance of R10,000, but when questioned further she said the matter was "classified information". She referred NEW NATION to the Public Service Commission (PSC), where attempts to speak to chairperson Dr Roe Venter proved fruitless. A spokesman for the PSC, Corrie Smith, denied that ministers' allowances were dealt with by the department and said the PSC only "handled salaries of public servants and not political appointees (ministers)". Efforts to get a response from President Nelson Mandela's spokesperson, Joe Netshitenzhe, also proved fruitless -- he was said to be out of the office. An official at the President's Office, Sakkie Olivier, told NEW NATION through a secretary that all inquiries about information on salaries should be referred to Netshitenzhe. This week, the South African Communist Party (SACP) called for the reduction of salaries for members of Parliament as proposed by the Melamet Commission. The SACP's opposition to MP's salaries comes weeks after an ANC parliamentary caucus supported minimum salaries of R161,000 a year -- as proposed by the Melamet Commission. The SACP said it believed that "in a country beset with enormous poverty, excessive salaries for elected public officials are simply unjustifiable. The gap between the lowest paid state employees and the highest paid is staggering".
