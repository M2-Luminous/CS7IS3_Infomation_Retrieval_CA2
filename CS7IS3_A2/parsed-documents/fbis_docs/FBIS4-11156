Contrary to what happened over the previous three years, several effects of the siege have landed simultaneous blows on the Cuban people, particularly hurting their food supply and some areas of the public health system. It is important to recall that since 6 July 1960, almost 34 years ago, the U.S. Government has stopped buying sugar from the island. One of the main objectives of the blockade was to try to curb as much as possible the inflow of foreign financial resources essential to Havana in its efforts to keep its economy afloat and meet the basic needs of Cubans. Last year, because of limited exchange opportunities; because of the lack of imports required by the sugar harvest -- oil, for instance; and because of bad whether, Cuban sugar production, still a key component in the national economy, fell to just more than 4 million tons, which is much lower than the 7 million tons produced during the previous harvest. This drastic drop in production not only caused the country to stop receiving more than $400 million a year amid an already difficult situation, but it also created difficulties in distributing sugar among the people, who were already facing many other difficulties in the January-March period in terms of delivery dates, although, ultimately, distribution was achieved as planned. The lack of raw materials affected not only the sugar industry, but also the agriculture sector in which tuber and vegetable production declined. The shortage of agricultural produce was highly visible in terms of the supply of these products in this period. If these examples, among others, are combined with the trade transactions with other countries which Washington's embassies and special services have tried to wreck -- for example, the purchase of Asian cooking oil to meet first-quarter needs -- then we get a sad idea of what is going on in this Caribbean country. Should we want to expand on this a bit more, we would have to remember the painful path travelled by Cuba in Latin America to buy powdered milk for newborn babies, because suppliers feared White House retaliation or because some ships dropped their loads in ports of other Caribbean nations. If those ships had docked in Cuban ports with the powdered milk on board, they could be severely penalized upon their arrival in U.S. ports because of provisions in the Torricelli Law. Some day, when details of how Cuban life was affected by the U.S. blockade, and when the information blockade and distortions no longer cloud the island's achievements, reality will easily win out over fantasy. Meanwhile, Cuba shows no signs of surrendering; although life goes on very much affected by difficulties primarily caused by the blockade, we are maintaining the ironhanded notion of not sacrificing our national freedom.
