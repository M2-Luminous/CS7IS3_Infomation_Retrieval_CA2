The Salvadoran economy has been growing at a rate of 5 percent for the last two years, which denotes a strong economic growth in all areas, according to Central Reserve Bank (BCR) spokesmen. Economic growth was reported mainly in the areas of construction, services, the manufacturing industry, and commerce. "The country is no longer dependent on foreign aid. The U.S. reduction in aid should not have a major impact on the economy," the BCR spokesmen have said.

According to investigations conducted by the Consumer Protection Center (CDC), the poor in El Salvador do not benefit from the country's economic growth. Purchasing power has dropped by 18 percent in rural areas due to the inflation rate in the past few years. There has been a 16-percent drop in urban areas, and there is a concentration of wealth in a few hands, the CDC states.
