The PLO Executive Committee is the party to which this authority reports. However, according to a Palestinian official, it is not expected that the Executive Committee will be consulted on every small and significant affair as long as operations go on according to the program that was endorsed. A new name was added today to the 14 ministerial portfolios announced at a late hour yesterday evening. The new figure is Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad, who was assigned the portfolio of transportation and communications. The final decision of Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, who was offered the portfolio of information, is not known yet. Dr. Samir Ghawshah, member of the Executive Committee and the National Authority, said the final reply of Mrs. 'Ashrawi may be given after her return to Jerusalem. Abu-Nidal Musallami, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who is currently in Tunisia, denied categorically to us that it is possible for him to join the National Authority, as was rumored here in the past two days. He said this news was baseless. This evening's session of the National Authority is expected to be the last. This session is expected to distribute the rest of the ministerial portfolios, which are 22, and to form the Authority, in which 20 out of 24 members, under 'Arafat's leadership, have been appointed so far.
