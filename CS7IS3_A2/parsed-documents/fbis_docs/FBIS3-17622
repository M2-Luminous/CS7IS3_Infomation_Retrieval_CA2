The president stressed he does not want confrontation with the Crimean leadership, but there is a limit he will never overstep -- the integrity of the state. Kravchuk said he understands the Crimea's inclination for Russia and Russian never-to-be-abandoned interests in the Crimea. At the same time, President Kravchuk reminded of the Ukrainian strategy: "There will be no negotiations on borders, territorial integrity and sovereignty. The whole world is for us and the reaction of the United Nations Security Council to the Russian decision on Sevastopol is a vivid example of this support. The more so, we have signed a corresponding agreement with Boris Yeltsin. "Europeans cannot understand what is happening; don't we understand we cannot break borders today, they are holy of holies and pillars of European security. That is why we say we cannot!" Leonid Kravchuk thinks that an idea of possible co-existence of two currency zones in one state is "incompetent." He means the idea of the ruble zone declared by the Crimean president. Kravchuk called for the creation of a well-considered program of the Crimean economic revival with due account of its peculiarities and said he and Yevgeniy Saburov are ready to achieve assistance of international fiscal organizations. The Ukrainian president praised the Russian economist and politician nominated Crimean vice-premier by Yuriy Meshkov and said Ukrainian citizenship of Saburov is "not a problem." Asked where Ukraine may unite with Russia in some form, Kravchuk said "I think that Ukraine must be together with Russia but not subordinated to Russia -- that is all. I have a realistic view on facts, there is no other way for Ukraine but be together with Russia. We have been together for 300 years and it is in our genes. We have had quarrels, weddings and unifications amongst our peoples and these relations cannot be broken".
