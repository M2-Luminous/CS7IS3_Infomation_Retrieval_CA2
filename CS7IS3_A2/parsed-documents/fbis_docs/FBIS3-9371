DUMA has learned from a well-informed Rakovski Legion source that the Defense Ministry and the General Staff are behind these cuts. The massive cuts were expected to take place on the eve of the Rakovski Legion Second Congress, which will take place at the beginning of June. The Legion's officers assume that Minister Valentin Aleksandrov and highranking officers from the General Staff, among them, P. Petkov, Z. Iliev, P. Shushkov, and others, were behind the attack against the legion. The first announcements of the cuts are expected any day now. Major General Denev, commander of the 2d Army, has personally banned the distribution of Rakovski Legion documents. It is assumed that the settling of accounts between the chiefs of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff began after the meeting of the dismissed Rakovski Legion spokesman, Captain Second Rank Vasil Danov, and President Zhelev, at which Danov reportedly expressed the Legion's indignation with the fact that the General Staff payroll was inflated, viewed against the background of the meager Armed Forces' budget. According to Rakovski Legion sources, the General Staff is trying to split their organization through persons the General Staff planted in the Legion's leadership. It is expected that in the next few days the Legion will convene an extraordinary confederative council, at which it will formulate its tactics regarding behavior in contacts with the ministry and General Staff. The Legion will also inform EUROMIL, of which it is a member, about developments. High-ranking active service and reserve officers assume that persecution of the Legion will exacerbate relations between junior officers and high-ranking commanders, and between the various army branches. Major General Mikho Mikhov, Air Force and Air Defense commander, has already said he objects to the envisaged cuts. Despite the announcement of the Defense Ministry Press Center that there will be no cuts as an end in itself, the officers complain that Ground Forces Commander General Totomirov has not intervened in favor of any Rakovski Legion officer who has been cut. In response to a National Assembly member's question on 11 March Minister Aleksandrov said that the Legion members who had been dismissed had violated the regulations and the principle of one-man command, and therefore their penalties were totally justified. He pointed out that he will preserve the spirit of partnership between the ministry and the Legion. After his return from Brussels, Army General Lyuben Petrov, commander of the General Staff, expressed almost the same position to DUMA. According to him the dismissals were a correct sanction, and that personally, he has nothing against the Rakovski Legion officers, as long as they observe the regulations. The officers have the right to present their social claims, but they must do so through established procedures and not through petitions, the General Staff commander said.
