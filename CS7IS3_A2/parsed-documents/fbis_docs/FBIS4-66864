The United States, however, does not accuse Yeltsin personally. The Clinton administration believes that he is ``not in the loop.'' According to an anonymous source from Clinton's inner circles, the White House allegedly has ``irrefutable proof that Russia has a biological warfare program.'' Specifically, according to the newspaper, the point is the existence in Russia of some ``biological infrastructure of noncommercial purpose.'' According to the same anonymous source, information on the existence in Russia of a program to develop and produce biological weapons had been received from sources in the United States in Great Britain, including from a Russian scientist who immigrated to the United States last year. However, another anonymous source from the American White House, whose opinion THE WASHINGTON POST also quotes, believes that there is no proof to support such a sensational accusation. In his opinion, what may be meant here is the existence in Russia of ``specialized equipment of nonmilitary purpose,'' which nevertheless ought to be dismantled along with the military one. So far there is no reaction from Russia. It is interesting, however, that the scandalous newspaper item in the United States coincided with the resignation of Anatoliy Kuntsevich, the chairman of the Committee on Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons under the president of Russia. Lately he had been Russia's ``chief chemist,'' and many varieties of second-generation toxic agents had been developed with his direct participation. His functions included the development of a chemical weapons destruction program and monitoring its implementation (Moscow had always denied that it had biological weapons but nevertheless had a committee on its ``convention'' on the grounds of ensuring compliance with the 1972 Convention). The reason for Kuntsevich's resignation, given yesterday at a briefing by Vyacheslav Kostikov--``giving consent to transportation and storage of a serious consignment of toxic agents within the limits of a large city''--is questioned by everyone who is even minimally familiar with the chemical weapons problem. It is laughable to remove from the job a person, who in the past had sanctioned transportation and destruction of entire arsenals of toxic agents in densely population areas of the Volga region, just for giving consent to carry out only part of this program. An interesting suggestion came from one of KOMMERSANT's competent sources, according to whom there is a connection between Russia being accused of continuing work on biological weapons and Mr. Kuntsevich's resignation (the assumption is that there has been a leak of certain information, which was the true reason for resignation). This assumption is indirectly supported by the fact that at the hearings in the former Supreme Soviet and in the State Duma Kuntsevich persistently understated the true size of Russia's combat toxic agents arsenal by a factor of seven or eight at a minimum (according to estimates by independent observers). There is only one way, however, to counter Washington's accusations: The Yeltsin-Clinton joint statement, issued in Moscow in January, allows for the ``possibility of mutual visits to facilities and holding meetings of experts in order to monitor compliance with the Convention on Banning Biological and Toxic Weapons.''
