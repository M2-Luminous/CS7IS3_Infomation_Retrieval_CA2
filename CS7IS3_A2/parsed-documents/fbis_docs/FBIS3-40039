Total production was therefore actually 13 percent lower than in the best year, 1990, and on the same level as in 1986. This is shown in the preliminary figures published by the Central Statistical Office yesterday. However, the drop in GDP was clearly slower at the end than in early part of the year. The figures only show a halt in a long downhill trend in overall production rather than a decent recovery, Heikki Salmi, deputy manager of the Central Statistical Office, said: "I would still wait two to three months before interpreting this as the beginning of a recovery." Salmi points out that all December figures, except for those on unemployment, have yet to be confirmed. Production figures arrive next week, but the December figures on trade and construction are still about a month away. Salmi thinks that a consolidated upward trend can only be confirmed when the figures for January become available. Signs of Upturn Salmi points out that expectations of an upturn are now unusually high. Business-cycle expectations within the industry are approaching an all-time high and similarly positive expectations can also be seen at consumer level. Conditions for recovery have improved at domestic as well as international level. The debt volume has shrunk considerably at both consumer and enterprise levels. Consumer household debt has dropped over 10 percent from its peak figure at the of the 1980's. This indicates that, on the basis of current interest rates, consumers should be able to afford new loans for housing and consumption. But last year's all-time high in savings indicates that people were not tending to borrow money. Courage may grow when there is a halt in the unemployment trend. The financing surplus in the enterprise sector was 7 billion Finnish markkas last year. "The enterprises should be able to afford investments, but whether they have the will is another question," Salmi added. But interest in investments is spurred by continuing growth in the export industry and last year's positive upturn in other industrial sectors. There was also an upturn in the transport and communication sectors at the end of the year. Salmi thinks that the "taxi index," i.e., the rate of taxi drivers' actual service time, is another recovery indicator. Statisticians believe that GDP must be positive for at least three months before an upturn can be confirmed. Energy, Financing, and Communications Begin To Grow The forest and metal industries, which continued to grow vigorously last year, have been joined by the sectors of energy production, financing, and communications. The decline in construction was, on the other hand, even greater than the year before. An upward turn in construction used to be one of the clearest indicators of a recovery. Statistics Manager Markku Suur-Kujala believes that the recovery pattern in construction may now be different: Residential building picks up, but the construction of such things as shopping centers will hardly increase for a while. Exports Already at Record Level The export of goods and services grew by 17 percent last year. Exports as a proportion of GDP rose to almost 34 percent, higher than ever before. Imports during the same period stayed at 1992 level. Domestic demand decreased last year by more than 7 percent. Investments dropped by more than 18 percent to keep the investment level down to a record low of 15 percent. Private consumption fell by just below 5 percent and public consumption a little less than 6 percent. The wage volume of the national economy dropped 7 percent due to growing unemployment. Capital and entrepreneurial income rose by 9 percent. The real buying power of private households dropped 4.5 percent. The deficit of the total public sector was 8 percent of GDP. The municipalities managed more or less to balance their revenues and expenditures, which means that the deficit originated at state level. The tax rate -- taxes and social security costs as a proportion of GDP -- was 46.7 percent, the same as in 1992.
