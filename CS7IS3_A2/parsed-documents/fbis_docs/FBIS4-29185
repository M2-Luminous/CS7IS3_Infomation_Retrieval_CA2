FBIS4-29185 "dreas116__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-116-A Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Diet Members Interviewed on Political Condition Diet Members Interviewed on Political Condition OW1606032094 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1606032094 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] While ruling and opposition parties waged their political battle -- over such issues as a possible no-confidence motion against the Hata Cabinet -- with the current Diet session set to close 29 June, ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a survey by interview of all House of Representatives members to hear their views on questions like the dissolution of the House for a general election and the no-confidence motion against the cabinet. On the focal issue of a no-confidence motion against the cabinet, the survey results that reflected the current chaotic political situation. While almost equal numbers of Diet members supported and opposed the motion, over 20 percent said they still cannot decide their position on it. Asked what the Hata Cabinet should do after the 1994 budget is approved, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito members insisted that a next general election should be held only under the new electoral district system. But nearly 60 percent of Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] members said that either the House of Representative should be dissolved for an election under the current medium electoral district system or the Hata Cabinet should resign en masse. The interview results showed that the members' opinions were also divided over the question of future political realignment. For example, while a majority of SDPJ members favored a tripolar political system, nearly 90 percent of Shinseito and Komeito members were in favor of a two-party system. When asked what the Hata Cabinet should do after the passage of the budget, which is expected to take place around 24 June, 15 percent of the Diet members said: "The House of Representatives must be immediately dissolved. We have no choice but to hold an election under the current system." Twenty-three percent said: "The election should be conducted under the new system." Moreover, 21 percent of Diet members, mostly from Shinseito and Komeito, said that while the next election should be conducted under the new system, "the house should not be dissolved before the end of this year," in view of the fact that the government faces so many tasks at home and abroad and that the "non-LDP" camp is not prepared for the next election. In addition, 29 percent of respondents, mostly from the LDP and SDPJ, gave "other opinions," most of which were those seeking the cabinet's resignation. Broken down by the political parties, in the LDP, 40 percent -- the largest proportion -- gave "other opinions"; 19 percent favored "an election under the current system"; while 23 percent, mostly the advocates of the new system within the party, favored "an election under the new system." In the SDPJ, 26 percent supported "an election under the current system," 24 percent favored "an election under the new system," and 30 percent gave "other opinions." The results show views in these two parties are diverse. Asked "what will you do if a no-confidence motion on the cabinet is presented," the number who said they would support or oppose it was almost the same. Among those who gave "other opinions," most were of the view that they will have to wait and see. For example, former SDPJ Chairman Sadao Yamahana said: "Our stand on the motion will be decided depending on who will submit the motion and for what reason." As such, it appears likely that whether the no-confidence motion will pass or not will come to depend on how this group of people will move. Asked about the way the next coalition government should be formed in case the Hata Cabinet resigns, Diet members responded in diverse manners. A little less than 20 percent said it should be "a coalition with the SDPJ back," "a government led by the current coalition with part of the LDP and the SDPJ participating," or "a caretaker government." Almost 10 percent said it should be "an LDP-led government" or "a coalition comprised of the LDP, the SDPJ, and Sakigake." About 60 percent of the Diet members of Shinseito and Komeito wanted it to be "a continuation of the current coalition with part of the LDP and SDPJ added to it," indicating their strong desire to only "reorganize" the current coalition. Nearly half of the SDPJ members said they wanted the SDPJ to return to the coalition. The LDP members naturally wanted to control the new government. Some of them also replied in favor of "a conservative and moderate government led by the LDP" and "an alliance of conservatives led by the LDP and Shinseito."
