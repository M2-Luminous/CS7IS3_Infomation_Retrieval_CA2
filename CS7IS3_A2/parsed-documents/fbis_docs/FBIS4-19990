According to Mr. Steichen, such cooperation -- to be established on bases of reciprocal confidence and not antagonism -- should enable setting into motion two parallel processes by better using existing instruments and improving them if necessary: One in the long term which will have to "logically lead to the adherence of countries of Central and East Europe to the Union" and the other, in the immediate term, which would enable establishing "now an atmosphere of trust." He regretted with regard to this some of the criticism from the countries of Central and East Europe which attribute the difficulties of their farmers to the so-called protectionism of the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy]. This criticism underestimates in his opinion the extent of the difficulties of an internal nature that many of the Central and East European producers will encounter in the delicate phase of transition from the old system to the new. Regarding the terms of cooperation sought, the Commissioner suggested exploring in Central and East Europe two major complementary directions: 1. A system ensuring the stabilization of agricultural prices (namely through a mechanism of support of certain primary products). Nevertheless, in order to avoid repeating the pitfalls of the former CAP, this system will also have to encourage producers to sell on the market by calculating the support, keeping in mind the interactions between internal support and trade. 2. Reform of the credit system in order to help farming concerns cope with their current financial difficulties, to modernize their production apparatus and to improve their international competitiveness. In this context, agricultural banks should be created (as is already the case in Poland where an agri-industrial bank was established) that are able to settle the problem of the lack of liquid assets and the nonexistence of a land market. For this purpose, the initial financial contribution from private investors, local governments, the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], the World Bank and the European Union could be combined. According to Mr. Steichen, the Commission would be prepared to make a more general contribution to guidance, education, training and assistance, to the establishment of these banks and even to examine more direct collaboration. Observing nevertheless that "the Community will never be able to absorb by itself all the exports from its East European neighbours," the Commissioner suggested that the countries of Central and East Europe seek in parallel to develop new trading links between themselves, including if necessary on the financial level, and to restore traditional export currents towards the States of the former USSR. Mr. Steichen spoke of certain current concerns in the EU's agricultural relations with Central and East European countries, suggesting that these be remedied by: (i) Improving the mechanisms in force in the Union for the import of red fruit (minimum prices) and cherries (safeguard mechanisms), that is to say by rapidly inserting an early alert mechanism in the different systems; (ii) encouraging the harmonization of veterinary legislation in order to implement as soon as possible common norms and by establishing equivalencies (an agreement for this purpose should be concluded by the end of the year) which would considerably reduce controls.
