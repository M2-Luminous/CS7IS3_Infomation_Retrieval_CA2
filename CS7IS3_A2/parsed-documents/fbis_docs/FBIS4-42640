Usually, in such cases party congress delegates are looking for a valve in an unexpected place, through which the steam can escape from the kettle of ordered harmony. The leadership is to feel that it cannot decide everything. This time a majority demanded the future separation of office and mandate. The surprised ministers were told that they will soon have to choose between Bundestag mandate and government office. It remains their choice whether they will fulfill the wish of the congress. If, as it is to be expected, they do not care or make use of certain ways of interpretation to justify this, they will, however, become targets of attacks. What the Greens have just abolished after the experience of years of chaos, the FDP now wants to introduce. A part of the ambivalence of not absolutely binding wishes by a party congress, which the ministers can make use of, consists of the justified assumption that, if worse comes to worst, the FDP will hardly give up its accustomed exercise of being, if possible, in the government. For this it needs tested deputies with their parliamentary support. The victorious motion was made by Kinkel's land association for other reasons: Deputy Bundestag Group Chairman Weng, who supports Kinkel, was so angry about secret agreements and dubious maneuvers, for instance in determining Genscher's successor as foreign minister, that he wanted to promote clarity via a roundabout route. Now, however, straightforward Kinkel is facing the problem of being consistent. After the Bundestag elections -- if the FDP should be able to participate in government again -- he will probably confront his party with the choice of accepting him as minister and as deputy or losing him as chairman. It is not he who intends to decide -- it is the party that should do it when the time comes. He runs for the Bundestag, of which he is currently not a member, and he seems to rely on being able to untie the knots once again at the end. Kinkel may derive one reason for hoping that he will be able to get what he wants, also in the future, from the experience of the party congress in Rostock. The purpose of the event was fulfilled: The Bonn coalition with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] will be continued if the FDP has its say. Kinkel was moving toward this vote at the party congress in several steps. He ignored Genscher and Moellemann's ideas about a schedule with a blow of liberation. Now, since Kinkel, who is still an apprentice as a tactician, has brought about this vote, he proudly and with satisfaction insists on having stepped out of the shadow of cleverer people without having suffered any harm. However, here, too, there is ambivalence in the clarity. Kinkel was able to do without a condition for the coalition statement, because the condition is self-evident: the election result. If it is different from what Kohl and Kinkel expect with increasing self-confidence, the declaration of intent made in Rostock is moot. Then the never-contested principle that, basically, all democratic parties are able to form a coalition will be valid again. It will be shown what figures can bring about if they become more compelling than preferences. Whether Scharping's Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will then, however, still have a glance to spare for the FDP has become uncertain, to the sorrow of some renowned leading members, who now feel forced to gather around Kinkel. In Rostock the party, and particularly its chairman, sharply outlined the frontline between the CDU/CSU and the FDP on the one side and the SPD and the Greens on the other. Kinkel managed to convince his party that making a clear stand is more of an advantage than a disadvantage. Probably, the calculation that the FDP will win votes with this in October is correct, perhaps it will also win -- as in the past -- second votes from the voters of the CDU/CSU. They might save the FDP from a fall, but they would not increase the total number of votes for the coalition. The FDP wants to attract new voters with its program. But from where? The Rostock fireworks will vanish or will hardly be noticed. If they so choose, medium-sized entrepreneurs can feel as supported as unmarried couples and homosexuals. With its domestic and legal policy along the old progressive pattern, the FDP wants to prove independence, but without irritating the CDU/CSU too much. Solms continues to rely on the compromise course of the Bundestag group, on practical reason and solidity. Almost in the same way as the CDU must rely on Kohl, the FDP will have to rely on Kinkel; Genscher is paling, Lambsdorff only occasionally lets rhetorical sparks fly, which did not glint anywhere in the hall in Rostock. Kinkel has become more authoritarian and self-confident. This may be a benefit for him if he does not let himself be deceived: The obedience is forced by the pressure of the election year and the lack of persons. The valve of displeasure will probably not have consequences this time. After the elections -- regardless of the result -- one need not have so much consideration for the chairman. However, first it is important what will happen in October: Kinkel is acting with almost so much determination, attacking the SPD so harshly, that it seems he has burnt a few bridges behind him because he believes he does not need them anymore. The FDP may gain impetus from that.
