If so, it points to two fairly clear conclusions. One, that the device of Pressler Amendment, intended by the US to arm-twist Pakistan into accepting the US diktat on nuclear development, had failed to achieve its goals. And two, that Pakistan's perception of a threat to its security was leading it into an arms race with India. The realisation that two important countries of South Asia were sinking their vital economic resources into highly unproductive channels because of a dangerous dispute over Kashmir, may have obliged the US recently into pressurising Pakistan and India to find a diplomatic solution. The failure of the Secretary-level talks between the two countries must have convinced the US that India though willing to go through the motions of a dialogue, was not really serious in solving the Kashmir issue. And so long as the core of the conflict remained unresolved, no progress on the nuclear option, that Pakistan was unwilling to give up, was possible. And hence the visit of the US team. The reasoning in the State Department could be that India remaining adamant on Kashmir and rattling its sword for a so-called `limited war', Pakistan would be driven to the wall and could unfreeze its nuclear programme. Working on this hypotheses the US team could have brought in a `package' to basically address two problems of an immediate nature. First, to persuade Pakistan not to unfreeze its nuclear programme and secondly, to remedy to some extent the danger that the Pressler Amendment had done to Pakistan's defence capability. That both objectives are interlinked is obvious, but while the first objective can be presumed to be certain, the second is not. The US negotiators, for example, could threaten Pakistan with further damage to its security as a penalty for unfreezing of its nuclear programme. That would obviously be totally counterproductive but it would not be the first time the US did something that achieved the opposite of what was intended. Having said that, it also needs to be said that unless two parallel lines of action are adopted, the US team's mission is doomed. In the short term, the incentive for an attack on Pakistan will have to be removed from the minds of the Indian leadership. The Indians could be thinking that deprived of conventional arms by the US, Pakistan is now weak enough to be taken out in a short surgical strike. India will have to be disabused of such a notion on the one hand and Pakistan's defence shored up on the other. In the longer term, India will have to be persuaded to give Kashmir to Kashmiris or suffer harsh UN-supported sanctions.
