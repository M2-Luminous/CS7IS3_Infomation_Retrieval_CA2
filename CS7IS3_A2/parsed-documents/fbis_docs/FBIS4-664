The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is now fighting groups of Presidential Guards and a few government soldiers who support the groups. They will soon be defeated. Most of the government troops do not want to fight, nor do they want to support the small group of killers. Meanwhile, in Kigali, the 600-man battalion which went there on (?28) December last year is not alone. Their colleagues have relieved them. They left the former RPF positions in the north to go to Kigali and they have now linked up with those in Kigali and are fighting together. That alone is a sign of the impending victory.
