Burlyay arrived in our country during the afternoon of 22 March, and will present his credentials at a ceremony to be held 24 March at Government House. The ambassador will also officially submit to the government a list of products that Russia wishes to offer Paraguay. Regarding cotton, he indicated that the textile could produce interesting results in his country, especially for Russia's foreign trade enterprises that work with large quantities. Burlyay also indicated that Russia wants to cooperate with our country in the implementation of a trolley bus transportation system, and in the oil area. He also highlighted the fact that he had brought a list of Russian products with him that could be offered on the Paraguayan market, such as metallurgical equipment, machinery, tools, presses, electric motors, industrial electrical equipment, generators, freight elevators, highway construction equipment (road levelers, bulldozers up to 50 hp), tractors, agricultural machinery, automobiles, airplanes, airport equipment, sport airplanes, watches and clocks, photographic equipment, ammonia sulphate, and potassium chloride, among others. Regarding the operation for the exchange of goods, he stated that Russia is offering fertilizer in exchange for our country's agricultural and livestock products. Upon presenting his credentials to the government, Burlyay will be the first concurrent ambassador to Paraguay with his seat in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Our fellow countryman Igor Fleisher has been honorary Russian consul since 1993. "I am sure that thanks to the formalization of our relations, cooperation between the two countries will be given an additional push to the benefit of the peoples of the two countries," the diplomat said. He indicated that his naming as concurrent ambassador to Paraguay will be the first step toward installing a resident ambassador in our country, as is the case with Germany, France, or Great Britain, just to cite a few European countries. The new ambassadors from Thailand, India, and Iran, who arrived in our country on 22 March, will also present their credentials together with the concurrent Russian ambassador.
