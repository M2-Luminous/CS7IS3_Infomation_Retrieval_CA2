The arrests were announced by Zdravko Vucetic, the miners' union leader in the region 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of the capital, who told journalists that plans to resume strike action Tuesday had been shelved. "We have suspended the strike until January 15, but... none of our demands have been met," he said. Vucetic named the five detainees as Milan Rankovic and Jelenko Micic -- both members of the Serbian Electricians' Union -- and strike committee members Ivan Zdravkovic, Dragan Vesic and Milisav Mihajlovic. Meanwhile the Belgrade prosecutor opened an inquiry into alleged sabotage in connection with the strike, and called on police to "identify the employees at the Kolubara coal mine whose work stoppage caused enormous difficulties in electricity distribution," the TANJUG agency reported. Under Serbian law, anyone found guilty under the inquiry could be liable for a minimum sentence of three years in prison. Vucetic said he was "indignant" at the sabotage accusations, which he rejected. The miners suspended their action on Friday for the New Year break as the stoppage triggered sharp power cuts throughout Serbia. The strikers had demanded a monthly salary of 35.9 [German] marks (around 20 dollars) and goods to the value of 50 marks by December 31, plus 10 kilogrammes (22 pounds) of meat at "affordable" prices by the end of January. In a separate development here Tuesday the medical staff at a suburban hospital resumed a strike they suspended for the New Year's holiday, Belgrade radio said. The director at the hospital in Zemun said doctors and nurses were handling only minimal emergency services. They launched their action over a salary dispute Thursday, amid a spate of strikes that paralysed several sectors, including mines, railroads, and public transport and health services during the last two days of December. Two leaders of the railroad strike were detained by police over the weekend. Although authorities have granted several recent demands for higher wages, any increases have been quickly cancelled out by the effects of the hyper-inflation hitting Serbia.
