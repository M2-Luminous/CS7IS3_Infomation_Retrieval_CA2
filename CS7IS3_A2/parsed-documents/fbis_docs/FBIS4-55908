How would you assess the balance of these four years of change in Bulgaria? [Zhelev] However discontented we may be, however disappointed with our original expectations, nevertheless major changes have occurred in Bulgaria that give grounds for believing that there can be no going back. Among the comparatively new developments, I should mention that the war in former Yugoslavia is exerting an increasingly strong effect on our country. Bulgaria is being seriously affected by this war. We are playing no part in it, except for observing the embargo and the sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council. Militarily speaking, we are playing no part whatsoever, because we know that any form of intervention, even of the most noble kind, even if we were to send "blue helmets," would be regarded as some kind of revanchism, as political self-seeking, or as part of far-reaching plans. However, we are really affected by the war, most heavily by our losses from the embargo. Our door to the West is simply closed to us. According to our calculations, so far we have lost over $3 billion in unrealized contracts, share values, and so on. The second thing that is affecting us is the appearance of a petroleum mafia in Bulgaria. Smuggling gasoline and naphtha across our western border brings the criminals huge profits, because over there every liter is worth 10 times more. We are also affected by the absence of foreign investment. The investors are scared because a war is in progress on the other side of the border. They simply try to circumvent the Balkans. Thus, we are becoming a high-risk country through no fault of our own. [Michnik] The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] brought you to power. What is happening at the moment inside the SDS coalition? [Zhelev] In my view the SDS has made a number of very serious mistakes. After winning the 1991 elections, it had a parliamentary majority and ruled the country together with the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms]. However, later they retreated and lost position after position. After the resignation of Filip Dimitrov's government and after the resignation of the vice president [Blaga Dimitrova], the SDS was without power, although the electors had voted for it. [Michnik] Why did the SDS "give up" power? [Zhelev] Personal and group interests played a part, but to this one should add the lack of breadth in their political thinking. [Michnik] One can observe the process of disintegration of the anti-communist coalitions in all the countries of the former socialist camp. Do you think, Mr. President, that this cannot be attributed only to personal conflicts? [Zhelev] Among other things, more profound reasons lie behind the different interests of the various participants in the process of the reforms. To sum up in the most general terms, in the beginning we had ideals. Our banner consisted of democracy, the market economy, and a rule-of-law state. The people accepted all of this and voted for it. We we came to start the economic reforms, economic interests then came to the forefront, and they in turn are interwoven with the personal ambitions of activists and functionaries in various institutions. Subsequently, alliances were formed that no one could have foreseen. In parliament, for example, there are deputies in opposing groups that are linked to certain business groups, and they sometimes vote together, for example on taxation issues. This is the reason why we still have no laws on fiscal police or an audit office. The common platform with which the parties, movements, trade unions, and associations forming the SDS fought the elections was a compromise. Compromises always have to be brought up to date. I think that the SDS leaders forgot this principle at a certain moment. Even worse, the SDS failed to convince the public of the need for the reforms. It failed to convince the public that the SDS is a national force that identifies itself with national interests. The coalition left this very important area in the hands of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], which talks all the time about Bulgaria, the national cause, and so on. [Michnik] Do the SDS leaders realize this today? [Zhelev] Some of them claim that in the next elections the SDS will win over 50 percent of the votes. This is absolute utopia. [Michnik] People tell me that the Communists brought people like Zhelyu Zhelev to power. They claim that you do not understand reality, that you are a utopian humanist or even a cryptocommunist. In Poland people are saying the same things about the people who opposed the decommunizing laws. [Zhelev] The Communists in Bulgaria are restoring their strength, but the opponents of decommunization are not to blame for this. They are exploiting the fact that they are the main force that supports the present government, which is formally a nonparty one. In exchange for their support, they demand various concessions that stall the reforms. For example, they want to recall diplomats who obtained their posts in the Foreign Ministry after 1989. They are trying to reinstall in the Foreign Ministry the so-called professional staff, but you know what kind of professionals these are! The BSP is regaining its lost positions. The SDS is most to blame for this, because it disowned its allies and relinquished its changes of its own accord. When the other side retreats, you are stupid if you fail to exploit the situation. [Michnik] Do the Communists want the return of communism? [Zhelev] Some of them do, such as the authors of the concepts for forming farming cooperatives before the land is returned to its owners. However, there are others who are evolving in a social democratic direction; they believe that the ideas of the first group are stupid. They know there is no alternative to the transition to the market economy, but want their party to govern this process independently. For them, the main question is where the capitalists are to come from, from the BSP or the SDS? Who will receive the property? Who will get the money? They do not think of ideals, only of property and money. From the viewpoint of the national interest, it would be better if the SDS carried out the reforms. The SDS will complete them more quickly and in a more radical manner. Because of its nomenklatura, the BSP will try to preserve the remnants of the old regime as long as possible, but in the final event they will collapse. [Michnik] I have heard a hypothesis that the chaos in Bulgaria is being made worse by those who support the idea that dictatorship is the only solution to the chaos. [Zhelev] Groups do indeed exist in Bulgaria that are interested in chaos. Chaos benefits certain circles in the BSP that want to prove that the present version of the reforms is against the country's interest. Business groups that have links with the mafia feel very comfortable in the present chaos, because they gain from this situation. They can carry out illicit privatization and they can ship fuel illegally to former Yugoslavia. A further group that is striving to destabilize the state consists of people from the former State Security, who have found their true place and calling in the mafia and in business. [Michnik] How did it come about that the people who previously fought for democracy are now thirsting for power and are open to corruption? This is happening everywhere, not only in Bulgaria. [Zhelev] In Bulgaria only a handful of people openly ventured to oppose the violation of human rights by the communist authorities. Even in June 1989, I managed to collect only 56-60 signatures for a statement in defense of the Bulgarian Turks. Two months later, about 100 people signed a second declaration that criticized the atmosphere of chauvinism in even stronger terms. Most people joined the SDS in early 1990, at the time of the roundtable talks, when they realized with amazement that communism would never return. It was then that the great anticommunists appeared. Like you, even I had become a "communist" or, at the very least, a "defender of communism." [Michnik] Why does no political center exist in Bulgaria? [Zhelev] It is true that the bipolar BSP-SDS model is managing to survive. The reforms have been greatly delayed in Bulgaria. The communism-anticommunism confrontation continues to operate. The situation would be different if the land had been returned, if privatization had advanced further. As long as the main economic reforms are hardly beginning, the geometry of the political space is distorted. This is not Euclidean geometry, where right is right and left is left, and the center is in the middle. This only exists in the stable democracies. [Michnik] In your view, Mr. President, what is a stable scenario for Bulgaria? [Zhelev] The unification of the democratic forces in the name of the reforms, the return of the land to its owners, the advance of privatization -- these can guarantee the irreversibility of the transition. For this one needs a strong government with enough energy and willpower to act. [Michnik] Do you not think that one has to cross the horizon of the future and build a reformist camp, not worrying whether its members were once communists or anticommunists? [Zhelev] When we founded the SDS, I said that it should strive to form a coalition that unites people with democratic views. In my view, this is the only possible and reasonable formula for action -- continuously to expand the circle of those who support the reform. The tragedy of the SDS is that at the last elections it won 34 percent of the vote, but instead of expanding the circle of its supporters, relied on the so-called hardline electorate and even started -- as a result of internal conflicts -- to "shed" members. [Michnik] Since we are speaking about intolerance.... [Zhelev] All its forms are dangerous: national chauvinism, ideological fanaticism, religious fanaticism.... [Michnik] Today a great wave of Islamic fundamentalism is washing through the world. Could it appear in your country as well? How are Bulgarian-Turkish relations? [Zhelev] May God preserve us from both Islamic and Christian fundamentalism! Bulgaria is now threatened with a different form of fundamentalism -- political. As far as Turkey is concerned, I regard it not as a bridge, but rather as a barrier that separates us from the religious fundamentalism of the Arab countries, and especially Iran. [Michnik] What about relations with the Bulgarian Turks? [Zhelev] First, I should remind you that after 1989 the Bulgarian Turks received back the rights of which they were deprived by the communist authorities, which in 1984-85 almost brought our country face to face with a "Bosnian" alternative, long before the collapse of [East] Germany. I consider that no fundamentalism exists in this part of our population at present. The danger comes when people or groups try to exploit religion for political purposes. Such attempts are made from time to time, but they have no lasting effects. [Michnik] What is the political scenario as regards the Bulgarian Turks? What do they want? [Zhelev] They have great material problems. They are mainly farmers, but have never owned their land. Now, when the land is being reprivatized, it is mainly returning into the hands of the Bulgarians, which is arousing tensions. However, the law provides for all those who cultivate the land to receive ownership titles, but they come second in line. [Michnik] Some Bulgarians claim Zhelev is blind, because he cannot see the danger. For example, he cannot see that there are regions in Bulgaria where no one speaks Bulgarian. [Zhelev] These are nationalist provocations. Everywhere, our nationalists are like a horse with blinkers. Because of their limited views, because of their fanaticism, they are very dangerous. They manage to raise slogans like "Bulgaria above everything!" However, when I ask them what they have done for Bulgaria, for its prestige in Europe, and for democracy, they have nothing to say. [Michnik] Is it true that in Bulgaria, like Germany, there exists a kind of solidarity with Milosevic and Serbia, based on Orthodoxy? [Zhelev] Such a tendency does exist within part of the BSP; pan-Slavist groups also exist, but they do not have much influence. They were the ones who tried to exploit Zhirinovskiy's visit to Bulgaria. [Michnik] Where did Milosevic and Tudjman come from? [Zhelev] Both of them came from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, but I do not think it matters where they came from, as it is more important to know what they are committing themselves to now. For example, Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov, who at one time was president of the Yugoslav Assembly, is now following a very sensible policy. Milan Kucan is doing the same in Slovenia. [Michnik] What lies behind Milosevic's actions? [Zhelev] One cannot talk about him without remembering the situation of Serbia and the Serbs following the collapse of the SFRY, nor can we ignore certain special features of the Serbian people. The neocommunists are playing the chief role in fanning nationalist attitudes.... [Michnik] The neocommunists form a big faction in Milosevic's party. [Zhelev] We are talking about the postcommunist period. Some think that this merely means the period following communism. It is like a mutated gene, and these mutations can be very dangerous. [Michnik] Let us talk about Macedonia. [Zhelev] Bulgaria was the first country in the world to recognize the statehood of this former Yugoslav republic. [Michnik] This was a strange act. It is the first time I have heard of recognizing a country without recognizing the existence of its people. Both Greece and Serbia find the statehood of Macedonia and its name a major obstacle. Bulgaria has always considered that the Macedonians are its close relatives, and does so now. [Zhelev] There is nothing strange in this. A state is always recognized. Under international law the recognition of a state means that a nation exists in that state that itself determines its own sovereignty and identity. It also implies that the country that recognizes this state has no territorial claims against it. However, international law says nothing about a special declaration that recognizes the existence -- or not -- of any nation. The nation either exists or it does not. Does the existence of the Poles as a nation have to be recognized? [Michnik] I think Bulgaria is the only country in the Balkans in which the virus of hatred has failed to spread. What will the situation be in the future? [Zhelev] The Bulgarian people are very tolerant.... [Michnik] Have you ever heard a nation that describes itself as intolerant? [Zhelev] This is proven by the facts; for example, by the fate of the Bulgarian Jews during World War II. [Michnik] Anti-Semitism has never existed in Serbia either. It existed in Croatia, but not in Serbia.... However, today, how can the war end if the Serbs do not want to end it until a united Serbian state appears? [Zhelev] I consider that a confederal model is the best one. The idea of a confederation is acceptable in Bosnia -- at least in the beginning. The Serbs will have great economic problems after this war. The legacy of the sanctions is even now arousing public discontent in Serbia. I believe in the victory of the forces of democracy, but the introduction of an overt military dictatorship is also possible. It is essential to improve the relations between the Balkan peoples. This is very important. I mean we should develop an extended network of information links and transportation and other communications. In the Balkans the situation has always been poor in this respect. The peoples are distanced from one another not only by the mountains.
