FR940414-2-00137 FR940414-2-00084 The current guidelines note that ordinarily, mitigation granted under Option 2 shall not be in an amount less than that determined in accordance with Option 1 unless extraordinary mitigating factors are present. It has been Customs experience that those extraordinary circumstances generally relate to contributory Customs error or inaccurate detection of the violation. Accordingly, the guidelines are being amended to reflect this fact. The guidelines do not indicate whether applicable merchandise processing fees, harbor maintenance fees and internal revenue taxes are included in the term ``withheld duty'' for purposes of mitigation of late filing cases. Questions have arisen as to the propriety of inclusion of these fees and taxes in the withheld duties upon which mitigation is based. In our view, the Government is deprived of not only duties but also these fees when an entry summary is filed and payment of duties and fees is tendered late. Accordingly, the guidelines are amended to provide a definition of ``withheld duties'' to include any fees and charges that are due and owing at the time of filing of the entry summary. With the streamlining of the entry process and the onset of automation, multiple entry summaries are often filed by Customs brokers either in a combined single statement with a single duty check attached or a single electronic fund transfer occurring to satisfy the appropriate duties, fees and taxes. (This electronic fund transfer is known as the Automated Clearing House, or ACH.) On occasion, an entry statement check or an electronic fund transfer will be filed untimely. Because each individual entry summary on the statement is covered by its own importation bond, when an untimely filing occurs separate claims for liquidated damages are generated for each entry summary. Multiple assessments arise stemming from the same incident. Bond cancellation standards call for mitigation of each claim separately. This could involve mitigation of $100 or $200 per entry summary (depending upon whether Customs must bill for duties or the duties are paid voluntarily prior to billing) plus the concomitant interest charges. Multiple liquidated damages assessments arise against numerous bonded parties because of a single error made with regard to the filing of the statement. An electronic fund transfer that is deficient a small amount of money on a large payment of duties will result in rejection of an entire statement. In these instances, mitigation based on each individual bond breach could provide an anomalous result and prove counterproductive to Customs desire to encourage the filing of statement entries. Accordingly, the bond cancellation guidelines are being amended to permit the district director, in his or her discretion, to grant extraordinary relief from multiple claims for liquidated damages when a statement is filed untimely. If it appears from the facts available at the time of the breach that a Customs broker is responsible for the untimely filing of the statement, the district director is afforded the discretion to mitigate all claims arising from the breach in the same manner as an Option 1 calculation, except that rather than take a $100 base charge for each entry in the statement or batch (as the traditional guidelines dictate), one $500 base amount may be taken in settlement of all claims from the statement or batch. The appropriate interest calculation shall be added to the $500 base amount to arrive at the final Option 1 figure. If the responsible broker fails to pay such Option 1 mitigation within the time period prescribed or fails to petition for relief, the mitigation will be withdrawn and liquidated damages will be issued against all bond principals who have entries included in the statement. Those cases will then be treated individually within appropriate guidelines. District directors are encouraged to use the $500 guideline for first-time violators. Use of these guidelines on subsequent violations is at the district directors' discretion. In Treasury Decision 93&hyph;37, published in the Federal Register on May 28, 1993, (58 FR 30979), Customs amended the provisions of the basic importation and entry bond to provide for liquidated damages when estimated duties, fees and taxes are paid in an untimely manner, when an estimated duty check is returned unpaid by a financial institution or when an electronic fund transfer is made without sufficient funds in the debited account. This claim for liquidated damages is assessed only when the entry documents are filed or electronically submitted timely, but the estimated duty payment is not timely. A claim for liquidated damages of double the unpaid estimated duties, fees and taxes is assessed. The new bond cancellation standards are amended to include these violations in the Option 1 late filing of entry summary guidelines. Treasury Decision 93&hyph;37 also amended the provisions of the international carrier bond to provide for liquidated damages against international carriers who collect passenger processing fees as required by law, but who fail to remit those fees to Customs in a timely manner. Under the provisions of ยง24.22(g) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 24.22(g)), carriers are required to pay passenger processing fees over to Customs no later than 31 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which they were collected. The failure to remit the collected fees as required by regulation results in assessment of liquidated damages equal to two times the collected but unremitted fees. The guidelines for cancellation of claims for late filing of estimated duty payments are amended to include guidelines for those claims established for late remission of collected passenger processing fees.
