Boris Yeltsin Has Not Yet Received an Invitation"] [Text] Paris -- At the present time there is a lack of unity among EU member states regarding partnership agreements with Russia and Ukraine, plans for which were examined at a foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. The majority, led by Willy Claes, head of the Belgian foreign policy department, want Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk to sign a partnership agreement at the EU summit meeting scheduled for 12-13 June on the Greek island of Corfu. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has stated that Paris will oppose the pact unless Moscow agrees to restrict its export of nuclear materials. France, Alain Juppe stressed, considers the draft partnership agreement drawn up last week in Moscow by experts of the EU and Russia to be unacceptable. France is worried that cheaper Russian exports will hit its supplies of nuclear materials to the EU. In 1993, according to Western data, CIS countries sold the EU a total of 3,000 cubic tonnes of uranium worth $1 billion -- approximately 25 percent of Western Europe's requirements. Signing a simultaneous partnership agreement with Russia and Ukraine, the EU believes, will on the one hand help these two countries' economies, and on the other hand will lead to a reduction in the tension in relations between Moscow and Kiev. Among other things, the partnership agreement envisages the elimination of restrictions on Russian exports of steel, textiles, automobiles, television sets, radio sets, and vodka, and at the same time strengthens guarantees for Western investments. In 1992 Russian supplies to the EU (mainly energy sources and certain metals) totaled $17 billion, or almost one-half of all Russia's exports. This is 20 times more than Russia supplies to the United States, and almost 10 times what it supplies to Japan. Special attention at the ministers' meeting was devoted to the situation in Ukraine. The ministers agreed to help Ukraine resolve the problems connected with closing down Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Station. However, Kiev will not receive the $6-8 billion it has demanded as compensation for closing down Chernobyl.
