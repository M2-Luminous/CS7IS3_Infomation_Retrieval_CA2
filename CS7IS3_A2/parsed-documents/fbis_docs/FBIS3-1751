It means to build five optical fiber cable lines, four micro-wave lines, 300,000-channel program-controlled telephone network, two postal projects and ten ground telecommunication satellite stations. Last year, the total capacity of the province's telephone exchanges was doubled, and 96 percent of its villages had telephone communications. Rural telecommunications in Yunnan rank now fourth in the country, after Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai. In the past, the backward telecommunications system had affected economic development of Yunnan, which has many mountains and changeable weather. In some mountainous areas, telecommunications would be cut for over a month during the rainy season. Last year, the province invested 530 million yuan to build a micro-wave line, and three optical fiber lines between Dali and Ruili, Kunming and Yuxi, and Panzhihua, as well as a number of telecommunications satellite ground stations. Two of the stations -- in Kunming, capital of the province, and Nujiang Prefecture -- have been completed and will go into operation soon. In 1993, the province increased telephone exchange lines by 140,000. Eighty-six of the province's 127 counties have joined the national long-distance automatic telephone network, and 48 cities have installed the IDD [international direct dialing] system. Telephone lines were installed in 1993 in an additional 854 townships and villages.
