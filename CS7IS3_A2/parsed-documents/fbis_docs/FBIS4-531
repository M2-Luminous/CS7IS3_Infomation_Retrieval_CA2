Speaking in Johannesburg on Tuesday [12 April] ahead of a meeting with Bophuthatswana traditional leaders, Mr Mandela said he would meet later in the day with the group of international mediators who arrive in South Africa on Tuesday. The ANC leader said he would make "detailed recommendations" to the mediators "so that their efforts can as far as possible be successful". Former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington arrived at Jan Smuts Airport on Tuesday morning and ex-US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was due later in the day. Lord Carrington and Mr Kissinger are among seven foreign mediators who will try to narrow differences between the ANC and the IFP.
