The Kuomintang lawmaker made the call after a military intelligence bureau publication revealed that Mainland China imported two Mirage fighters from France last year and has removed electronic equipment from one of the fighters for research. Ting, convener of the Legislative Yuan's national defense committee, said France apparently has adopted a two-pronged strategy of simultaneously selling mirage fighters to both Taiwan and Mainland China. Against this background, Ting said, the military should consider improving the performance of the fighters, particularly their electronic systems and equipment. France agreed to sell Taiwan 60 Mirage 2000-5s for about U.S.$6 billion in 1993. The first batch is expected to be delivered in 1996. Taiwan has also ordered six Lafayette-class frigates from France. Under pressure from Beijing, France announced earlier this year that it would discontinue sales of offensive weapons to Taiwan. However, the French Government reaffirmed that it would honor its Mirage and frigate deals with Taiwan.
