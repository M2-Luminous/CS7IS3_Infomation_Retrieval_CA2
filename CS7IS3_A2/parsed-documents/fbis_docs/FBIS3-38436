During a meeting of the party's national council yesterday, La Malfa called on the party to steer the moderate path, by joining Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, and said that it could only take into consideration an alliance with the Democratic Alliance if it dropped from its forces the orthodox Communist Renaissance [Renewal] and Network [Rete] of Palermo Mayor Leoluca Orlando. A resolution outlining his position, however, was passed by a margin of only 6 votes, 65 to 59. Speaking to the press after his meeting here today with Democratic Alliance, a meeting he described last night as a "last ditch" effort to steer them away from the far Left, La Malfa said his conditions had not been accepted. At this point, he added, Republicans who feel they must stay with the progressive alliance were free to do so, but if they joined its election slate then they would not longer be considered party members. Earlier in the day, La Malfa had argued how the decision adopted at yesterday's national council was binding for all Republicans. He added how he knew the decision would have been a difficult one and that it risked causing deep divisions. In related developments, Valero Zanone, on behalf of the Liberal Democratic Union, welcomed the move by La Malfa's Republicans and the Socialists of Giuliano Amato to join the Pact for Italy. "Around the Pact proposed by Segni" he said, "there can finally be achieved the goal of these past months to unite Catholics and the lay parties based on common liberal democratic principals. The Pact is the only initiative which has taken shape as an alternative to the unified Left without striking compromises with the right of [League Secretary] Bossi, [National Alliance leader] Fini and their like". La Malfa said that the "parting of the ways" had been "very friendly" and expressed doubt that prominent members of his party would leave to form part of a progressive line-up in which the presence of Communist Renaissance [Renewal] was "contradictory" and liable to "favour the victory of moderate forces". A leading Republican member of Democratic Alliance, Giorgio Bogi, told reporters that he would continue working in the centre-left group despite the threat of expulsion, which is "a matter for party organs and not the secretary to decide." Giuseppe Ayala, a former anti-Mafia judge who was close to the Republican party before joining Democratic Alliance, said the threat did not concern him since he had never taken out Republican party membership. "I continue to believe in Democratic Alliance, and I am sorry the entirety of the Republican Party is not with us," he said. Ferdinando Adornato, one of the founders of Democratic Alliance, issued a brief statement saying that "we started off a project for overcoming the old logic of political affiliation; it is inevitable that certain members of the old nomenklatura are resisting this project." La Malfa -- who, like former Liberal and Socialist chiefs, has admitted accepting illegal electoral funding from the Ferruzzi group in 1992 -- confirmed to journalists that he will not be standing in the coming elections.
