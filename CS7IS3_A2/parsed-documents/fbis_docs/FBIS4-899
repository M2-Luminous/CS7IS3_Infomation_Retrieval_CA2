Manuel Tome is responsible for Frelimo's electoral campaign. Speaking in that capacity, Tome said that Frelimo's posture after the elections will follow internationally acceptable standards. He added that the winning party should not be forced to form a government of national unity, even after elections have been held. Lately, many Mozambican opposition parties -- including the Mozambique National Resistance -- have defended the formation of a government of national unity, but the Mozambican Government has rejected those views.
