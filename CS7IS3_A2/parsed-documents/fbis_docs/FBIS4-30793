As tacit laws, that is, good traditions require, I have taken the floor to thank you for your trust, and to express -- as is usual in such circumstances -- a few thoughts on our current situation and the assignments that are before us. We, Croats and Bosniak-Muslims, as constituent nations -- including other citizens -- have decided to reconstruct Bosnia-Herzegovina into a state entity -- the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- based on the absolute equality of our peoples, and have given the third, the Serbian people, the chance to join us, so that we can build it [the Federation] -- observing the highest standard of human rights and liberties -- into a democratic community with the highest standards known to civilization. Before establishing this, I would venture to say ideal, community, as our mutual political goal, we have today taken a significant step forward. Many [such steps] shall follow, which, due to the still fresh wounds inflicted by our sensless conflicts, will always put to the test our will and readiness to attain the goal that we have set ourselves. Owing to this, we need to remind ourselves constantly that, due to our inability to recognize in our differences our mutual interests and goals, we have used the language of arms instead of using the language of mutual deference and tolerance in an attempt to accommodate these differences. The most tragic thing is that, even though we are all victims, irresponsible individuals and groups -- [words indistinct] means and methods -- that could have easily led to our identification with the aggressor [who attacked] our peoples. We have, thank God, transcended this situation. I have stressed this because I am convinced that we have matured through this painful experince, and that the second sentence of our Constitution -- the rejection of the violence of war -- will be a lasting element in our mutual relations. All our problems, all conflicts of interest, have to be solved through political means in the institutions of the Federation in accordance with the procedures and ways established by the Constitution and the regulations that we shall adopt. Our peoples are political partners that need to coordinate their rights, interests, and needs, at the same time fully respecting the right [passage indistinct]. [Words indistinct] established our mutual goal and determined the way to achieving it, we must in advance be aware that we shall sometimes meet with deadlocks on this way. This is normal and commonplace in all democratic countries and we must be prepared for such situations. Once this happens to us, we should not give in to doubts about one another. Instead of riding a wave of enthusiasm, we must be sober and patient in building our relations, taking into acount [word indistinct], and we need to see the community in which we have lived together for centuries and in which we must continue living, as a state entity in which our differences will be established. [sentence as heard] The fervor of brotherhood and unity has unfortunately led us to violence. Therefore, in place of fervor, which is the mother of both [word indistinct] and imporovizations, I am more inclined toward a gradual and patient building of the foundations and the framework of our community, because the transitional period is -- at least, this is the way I see it -- a period during which we need to lay the foundations of our state community. Immediately and from this moment on, we must think about mutual forgiveness. Ladies and gentlemen, you have electd as president of the Federation a man who has never had aspirations to do any work involving politics. By (?following) my conscience, I have, from the beginning, joined the just, defensive war of my people, at the same time attempting to contribute to the affirmation of its rights and [word indistinct]. At the same time, I have never believed that any rights and interests could or should be greater than the rights and interests of the other peoples with whom we live in our mutual homeland of Bosnia-Herzegovina. During this transitional period -- owing more to circumstances than my wish -- I have to perform the duties that are of a higher political (?nature). I do not know how good a solution this is, that a political amateur should be assuming such significant duties, particularly since I am trying to coordinate my thoughts, words, and deeds, which people claim is not a desirable quality in political spheres. To many this may sound stereotypical, cordial, and therefore not entirely convincing, but I do not know any other way of saying this; you can rest assured that I will carry out the duties of president of the Federation in the transitional period in accordance with the adopted Constitution -- conscientiously and responsibly -- and in the interest of our peoples and citizens. Thank you.
