The message said that the fugitive terrorists had not left the country but were still hiding in Thailand. It has also been found that the group has shifted their objective from the targeted embassy to assasination attempts against high-level officials of that same embassy. "Major targets are high-level officials of the U.S. and Israeli Embassies, as well as those at the Pakistani and some other embassies," the source said. The source also revealed that U.S. and Thai intelligence authorities found that, on the day the terrorist abandoned the truck, he left a black James Bond briefcase on the truck. It is believed the briefcase contained some important documents. But the case disappeared during the time the truck was parked near the Lumphini police station. The Police Department and the Metropolitan Police Division have already set up a committee to investigate how the briefcase disappeared. However, police officials at the Metropolitan Police Office declined to discuss this with reporters. They said they were not authorized to give information to newsmen, and that reporters should ask the police director or the metropolitan police commissioner if they want information. Meanwhile, Police Colonel Suraphon Thongprasoet of the Special Branch Police called an urgent meeting of Special Branch police officials in charge of security for important persons, especially those from diplomatic missions. The non-stop meeting on 21 March began at 0900 and ended at 1430. A police inspector reported that there was an instruction at the meeting that security be stepped up for 24-hour protection of officials and important persons at foreign embassies. There will be an increase in the number of security officials guarding residences of ambassadors as well as embassies, especially the Israeli and U.S. Embassies. The Thai police will maintain around-the-clock coordination with the U.S. intelligence service. An officer of the Metropolitan Police in charge of security protection for important persons told newsmen that police officials had been assigned to guard important premises and residences of important persons, particularly foreign embassies. The Metropolitan Police will guard the outside areas of the compound whereas the Special Branch Police will provide security at the residences of ambassadors and foreign embassies.
