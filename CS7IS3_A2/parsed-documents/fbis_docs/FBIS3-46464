Governor Chris Patten, to use his present -- and more familiar -- title, was characteristically forthright in dismissing claims there was a 1991 deal over airport-related debt. "It's extraordinary that this allegation has come out after 2 1/2 years," he said. "If Chinese officials are actually saying that there is a secret deal, they should come out and say that for themselves. But, of course there wasn't." But these are the sort of comments he will be unlikely to be saying by the end of next year, as the Governor attempts to fade away into the background, and adopt a role more like that of a municipal leader. "It is right and proper that, the closer we get to 1997, the more I should take a back seat, the less I should take a prominent political role, and the more I should try to ensure that public servants locally, and politicians locally, are making, running and setting the agenda," he said. Although it is strange to hear such an upfront leader contemplate taking a low-profile role, Mr Patten insists he knew this would be his fate ever since he arrived, and dismisses suggestions it may make him a touch irrelevant. "I shall very much enjoy being mayor of Hong Kong and look forward to seeing through the agenda which I first sketched in the autumn of 1992," he said. "I've always assumed that, as would have happened with governors in other situations, where it wasn't a question of the transfer of sovereignty but a granting of independence, that the closer you get, as it were, to D-day, the more time you spend in the back seat of the car." Whether Mr Patten will get his low-profile wish, given the probability agreement will not be reached on political reform, and the likelihood of continued Sino-British hostilities, is another matter. The Governor insisted none of the bad sentiment had influenced his plans to step back from the political arena after the 1995 polls. But he agreed recent Chinese comments had badly affected morale in the civil service, which is expected to take up the responsibility Mr Patten intends to relinquish. "There have been quite a lot of things said by Chinese officials which I don't think have helped civil service morale and I sometimes wonder whether some Chinese officials actually understand what the traditions of our public service amount to," he said. But the Governor reiterated the British belief that, despite the public dispute, senior mainland officials, such as Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office chief Lu Ping, fully realised the need to safeguard the stability of the civil service. Mr Patten's plan to step back may also be one solution to having a governor who is unable to talk to China, by allowing others -- such as Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang, who last week dined privately with local XINHUA (the New China News Agency) chief Zhou Nan -- to fill the vacuum. Indeed the Governor now seems relatively relaxed at the prospect of being unable to reach Mr Lu by phone or have any direct contact with the Chinese in the final years of the transition. While saying he still hoped such contacts would eventually prove possible, Mr Patten noted many of his predecessors had faced the same situation, and there were plenty of contacts at lower levels. "For years, Hong Kong governors weren't able to deal directly and there was a lot less contact than there is today. There's a huge amount of contact between our officials and Chinese officials...a great deal of business is transacted and even more will be transacted between now and 1997," he said. Mr Patten was equally relaxed about the practical problems of organising the 1994-95 polls in the face of Chinese opposition. It is possible, with Beijing likely to declare their results null and void, some candidates may decide not to stand, and there may be an even lower voter turnout than usual. But, even if that produced a turnout rate still worse than the disappointing 39 per cent recorded during the hotly-contested 1991 polls, Mr Patten did not think it would cast a shadow over the elections -- noting how turnout was even lower in the US and some British polls. They are hypothetical considerations that very soon may become reality, with the Governor dropping strong hints that the tabling of a further -- third stage -- bill on political reform, which will mean finally giving up trying to restart negotiations, is now close to a certainty. Mr Patten stressed that, while he still wanted further talks, the ball was effectively in China's court. Britain would not take any sort of initiative -- such as further letters at prime ministerial level -- to try to lure them back to the negotiating table, beyond the routine diplomatic contacts that have so far failed to yield any results. "The Chinese have walked away from the table. We'd like them to walk back, but I don't know of any special initiative or special deal we could offer them in order to trigger talks," he said. Even if talks did restart, they could not last for long. "We have to try for a much more express version of negotiation," the Governor said. "Everybody realises that if talks were to resume, which, I repeat, I would like to see, they couldn't drag on for round after round, for month after month." And -- answering a question he has evaded in the past -- Mr Patten said the agenda for further negotiations could not include the contents of the first-stage bill, on so-called issues such as the voting age: "The partial bill...is on its way now and is not going to be delayed or taken off the track." Even the content, and rough timing, of a third-stage bill seems pretty much decided. Although a formal and final decision has yet to be taken, the Governor added to the growing body of opinion that he will plump for his original October 1992 package, by noting the support it had attracted in the Legislative Council [Legco], while expressing some sympathy for the criticisms of the July 1993 compromise proposals. "When Legco has expressed a view on the 1992 package in the past, it has done so positively and enthusiastically on all three occasions, but I think you have to take the temperature on the day," he said. On the July 1993 conditional concessions, Mr Patten said he "can see the strength of the argument" of those who say they should now be put aside since "you didn't get a through train, you didn't get an agreement on anything, apart from the voting age. You made all these substantial concessions and there's no deal." Even on the timing of any new bill, options are clearly limited, with the Governor noting that time is running short, if the Government is to meet its July deadline for having all electoral arrangements in place. Indeed it is further constrained by the budget, which eats up three otherwise available dates for introducing a political reform bill to the Legislative Council before the Easter recess. "The Budget is a factor in deciding when to bring in the third bill," he said. "It takes up a good deal of time because we need some time for the council to debate the good news about Hong Kong's economy...it affects the amount of time you've got before Easter if you want to do it (introduce the bill) before Easter." The Governor's reluctance to take any new initiative to try to resume negotiations on the political front is in stark contrast to the situation with the airport, where he is dangling concessions in front of the Chinese in an effort to bring them back to the negotiating table. "To demonstrate our flexibility we can put constructive proposals on the table," he said. "We've been in a difficulty since last summer because there have been questions about land premium which we would have liked to have resolved in the land commission. But, as a demonstration of our constructiveness, we will, I think, be able to develop our proposals in the Airport Committee straight away." But, even here, there is a baseline beyond which Mr Patten will not go. "I'm not going to make decisions about funding which would be unwise and unreasonable to the Hong Kong taxpayer in order to try to bring things forward by a week or two," he said. "People sometimes say `pour in all the money's that necessary, to make sure there's an airport before you go'. I don't think the people of Hong Kong would regard that as very sound public administration. We should proceed as sensibly and carefully as we can." There is more than a hint of weariness too: "The documents on the airport make, I would guess, the documents which went into setting up the United Nations look like a short story."
