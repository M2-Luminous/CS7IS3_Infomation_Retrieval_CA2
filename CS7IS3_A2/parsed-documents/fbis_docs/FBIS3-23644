Sayyid Abdullo Nuri, council leader, warns that the intrigues involving the statement are a prelude to a new air raid on the camps of Tajik refugees in Afghanistan. At the same time the Russian military are taking new steps to build up their contingent in Tajikistan. According to reports from a highly placed officer in the Russian Ministry of Defense, Colonel-General Boris Pyankov plans to conduct exercises by "peacekeeping forces" on the territory of the "Tiger Gully" reserve, the only place on the planet where rare kinds of plants and animals have been protected through the efforts of Soviet scientists. The exercises are presently being worked out in Moscow at the headquarters for the coordination of military operations of the CIS countries. According to another version, an echelon of armored equipment has already been sent to Tajikistan. In the meantime a blockade of rail lines leading into Tajikistan from Uzbekistan continues. More than 1,000 cars of freight had built up at border stations by mid-February, the delay of which is costing Tajikistan around four billion rubles a day. The trains are being plundered, and freight is being pilfered from the broken cars. Uzbek authorities are simultaneously hampering the removal of freight from Tajikistan. According to that same highly-placed officer, Tajikistan's Uzbek population is increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with Tashkent's policy, which is leading to inter-ethnic reprisals. Central Asia's geopolitical structure is now increasingly subjected to the influence of Uzbekistan, which is laying claim to a leading role in the region by blockading Tajikistan. The officer feels that Russia's role here is actually under threat. In 1993 alone it costs the taxpayers 59 billion rubles to maintain the Russian Army in Tajikistan. The number of casualties is constantly growing, which could lead to dissatisfaction on the part of the Russians, as occurred during the Soviet-Afghan war. While there is a crisis of authority in Afghanistan, neither Moscow nor Tashkent will strive for rapid talks between Dushanbe and the opposition. Furthermore, the officer states, the buildup of the Russian Army's military presence in Tajikistan is absolutely deliberate. As reported from the mountain regions of Karategin (Garm), military aircraft have carried out raids in the valley each day for the second week in a row. There is forced recruitment into the army in Dushanbe, and confrontations among government groups continue in Kurgan-Tyube.
