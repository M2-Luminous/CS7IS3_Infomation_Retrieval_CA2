Qian made the remarks when holding talks with Faruq Qaddumi, foreign minister of the State of Palestine, who arrived in Beijing on Thursday [7 April] for a six-day visit to China. Qian said that disputes between countries can only be settled through peaceful negotiations, which he said was well demonstrated by the signing of an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on implementing a declaration of principles for Palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza. The Mideast issue is a regional conflict which has lasted longest, ever since the end of the Second World War, Qian said, and the road to peace is still long and difficult. He said that the Hebron massacre which occurred this February shows it an urgent issue to settle Palestinian question. Qian said that China firmly supports the Mideast peace process and will, as always, support the just cause of the Palestinians. Qaddumi, also director of the Political Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization, offered a detailed account of negotiations between Palestine and Israel as well as between other Arabian countries and Israel, and the situation in the occupied territory. Qaddumi stressed that the security of the Palestinians in the occupied territory should be guaranteed according to the resolutions adopted by the United Nations, and his organization will continue to make efforts for a political settlement of the Palestinian issue. He also called for an early military pull-out by Israel so as to ensure a smooth implementation of the agreement on Palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza. The Palestinian foreign minister extended his thanks for the support from the Chinese Government and the Chinese people for the just cause of the Palestinian people. Following the talks, the two ministers signed an agreement on economic and technical cooperation between the two countries, according to which China will provide an interest-free loan of 75 million yuan renminbi. This is the second loan China has granted to Palestine. Last year, it offered a loan of 30 million yuan renminbi to Palestine, which is also free of interest. According to an exchange of letters which was also signed today, China gave half a million U.S. dollars in cash as a gift to Palestine.
