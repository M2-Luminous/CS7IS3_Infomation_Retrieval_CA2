Although the text that you see is a 16-page text, 16 pages that prove the successes of the Greek Presidency as against what we have read here and there and which I did not like at all because they are contrary to the truth. It is enough to remember that the Greek Presidency quickly managed to conclude negotiations with four new countries in the European Union's expansion. It also held negotiations that resulted in the signing of a partnership relationship with Russia and Ukraine, although in December 1993 we also established that there were great difficulties in concluding the agreement with Russia. The Greek Presidency also successfully entered the second phase of the economic and monetary union, and on a number of other issues many great and successful steps were made. For this, I would like to thank European Council President Mr. Papandreou, as well as [Greek Deputy Foreign Minister] Mr. Theodhoros Pangalos, [Greek National Economy Minister] Mr. Ioannis Papandoniou, and all the Greek Government ministers who contributed to this great success. I say all this because if this council is marked by the fact that no new president of the European Community Commission has been named, the blame certainly does not lie with the Greek Presidency which made every possible effort to find a solution. All this because one country exercised its right of veto, which every member state has, against the candidate who was preferred by the other 11 member states. First, with regard to assessing the future of Europe, the Greek Presidency made every possible effort, and, I will add, that we can say the Brussels message [words indistinct] that the white paper remains a framework for the development and future of the member states, it constitutes a live and dynamic framework. During the course of my work, I have recorded the progress made at the national and Community level in strengthening the European competitiveness, to find a model for development, something richer with regard to employment, a framework of thought in order to change the manner of development so that there will be more employment without changing the philosophy of our European communities. Second, in the conclusions of the European Council you will find all those elements that will allow us to continue this work at both national and European levels. On a European level I particularly note the pledge concerning the list of priorities for the big infrastructure projects, and continuation of the works regarding the big networks of energy and other big infrastructure networks. Also the general ideas and orientations concerning the society of information and establishment of the decisionmaking procedures--with one minister in charge of coordinating these in every member state. These will express a joint decision and will allow us to continue a social, developing, and functional task because the appearance of these information networks will also change the organization of work and the organization of our societies. Third, we attach a high a priority to the small- and medium-size businesses. Here we have the jurisdiction of the national, regional, and local authorities, but at a Community-level we have a program of social initiatives supplementing those orientations that would facilitate the strengthening of all these businessmen, of all these small and medium businesses that create employment. Concerning the employment systems, the Commission's orientations have been accepted, [words indistinct] for equal opportunities and to give everyone the chance to adjust technological changes. We need a change of employment systems so we can facilitate finding people employment or vocational training, giving priority to the youths; every youth who graduates from school should not be unemployed, instead we should give him a job, we should offer either training or work. We should also formulate the working time so as to exploit the technological development, we should attach particular importance to options for the use of time, and finally to formulate a means of development that would include the protection of environment, options for the use of time, development of the countryside, and formulation of [words indistinct] in such a manner that we may respond in the best way possible to both the new needs of society and the creation of new employment positions as well as to the distribution of the fruits of development by assigning every priority to employment. This is the new concept of solidarity in Europe between those who have and those who do not have a job. This is best for the future because if by the end of the century we have the same current unemployment levels, then the repercussions on a political and social level in Europe will be terrible. The white paper lives and the European Council, I believe, will devote to the white paper many six-month periods and many presidencies. Those works will allow us to reach the means to formulate this new world at its birth. We have also determined a series of text with regard to foreign policy. We have prepared the summit conference of the industrialized countries so that there may be a strengthening of the efforts by the industrialized countries with regard to nuclear safety in order to appease public opinion. We do not have to face the negative consequences from the bad operation of certain nuclear units. This program also includes closing down the Chernobyl unit by giving to Ukraine the necessary means to cope with its energy needs. Ladies and Gentlemen this is all I can say today about the European Council. I repeat my thanks to President Mr. Papandreou.
