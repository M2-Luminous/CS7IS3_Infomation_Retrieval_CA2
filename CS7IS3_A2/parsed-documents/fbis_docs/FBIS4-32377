"The development in this sphere has made us rather sad. You know that the whole problem of the bureaucratic troubles, the whole problem of certificates (on May 1, Slovakia introduced quality certificates on imported foods, thus making Czech exports more difficult) is quite unpleasant, unwelcome for the Czech Republic," he adds. Klaus says the Czech Republic was rather disillusioned when it found that during a visit by Rene Steichen, the commissioner for agriculture and rural development in the European Commission, "Slovakia agreed it would not demand certain certificates from European Union countries, while it would still demand them from the Czech Republic," Klaus says. The abolishment of the old clearing bloc in Czech-Slovak accounting is not a fundamental question, Klaus states. "I am not opposed at all to its abolition," says Klaus, noting that the Czech Republic did not invent the old bloc. "It is a technical matter which will be settled by finance ministers and governors of the national banks. It is not a task for premiers. This simply demands an instruction 'yes or not' from the top," he says. The solution to the property relations (regarding the division of the former Czechoslovak property) is the most painful problem of the two countries' relations, Klaus says. "I fully respect that the Slovak Government does not have necessary mandate to resolve it before the elections," he adds. In addition to this, there are some "extremely complicated border issues," which require "certain generosity, a detached view and a positive approach; the question is whether the government has it or not in view of its mandate," Klaus concludes.
