FBIS4-51063 "drchi101_l_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-101 Daily Report 1 May 1994 Science & Technology `Inside Story' of Apr Satellite Explosion `Inside Story' of Apr Satellite Explosion HK2505064494 Hong Kong CHENG MING in Chinese No 199, 1 May 94 pp 22-24 HK2505064494 Hong Kong CHENG MING Chinese BFN [By Ling Yun (0407 0061): "The Inside Story of the Explosion of the `Fengyun-2' Satellite"] [Text] The Senior Central Hierarchy Shocked by 46 Casualties On the afternoon of 7 April, the State Council General Office issued a circular on the first geostationary satellite--Fengyun-2--scheduled to be launched by Long March-3 carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the middle of April. According to the circular, since an accident had occurred in the course of technological testing and the satellite and the workshop had been damaged, the launch plan would be rescheduled. The circular did not disclose details of the accident or whether or not there were casualties, but viewed from the wording, that is, the "satellite and the workshop were damaged," the accident was quite serious. As the workshop at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center for installing satellites is very big and its ceiling is very high, it would be very difficult for an ordinary and light explosion to damage the workshop. Moreover, people feel that this accident was very unusual because the Chinese authorities concerned did not mention the timing for the rescheduled launch. This was how things were. The news that this writer got from the State Council Science and Technology Commission and the State Science and Technology Commission [as published] was very astonishing: The Fengyun-2 exploded during a satellite test and caused a fire at 1010 on 27 March. It was learned that the accident had caused heavy casualties, that is, 46 scientists and functionaries were either injured or dead, and some of the injured were sent to Beijing by special plane for treatment. Among the dead was a CPC senior satellite expert and deputy chief engineer of the Xichang Satellite Headquarters surnamed Su, who headed the leading group for launching the Fengyun-2 geostationary meteorological satellite as well as the satellite test. The CPC's senior hierarchy was immediately called into action following the satellite explosion. Ding Henggao, Song Jian, and Luo Gan rushed to the scene by special plane that very night. On 29 March, Zou Jiahua and Zhang Wannian also went to Xichang to carry out an inspection on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Military Commission. The explosion was so strong that equipment worth 600 million yuan was destroyed in an instant and the launch center could not function. After discussions, in early April, the State Council appropriated 350 million yuan in emergency funds for the Xichang Satellite Center for reconstruction. As the site had been severely burned, it is still uncertain when the center will be able to launch satellites again. Different Versions of the Cause of the Accident Different versions of this extraordinarily large satellite accident spread. A relatively "orthodox" version said that the test on that day was the final assessment test and that leaders and experts concerned went there to carry out an inspection. When the test had just began, a power source short-circuited, causing sparks. The head of the test immediately ordered that the operation be stopped and that all personnel retreat to the safety room. But when the order had just been issued, the satellite exploded and started burning. Fire fighters standing by on the spot instantly threw themselves into the rescue operation and put out the fire two hours later and brought the injured out of danger. In another version, the accident was even described as intentional sabotage. It was alleged that the Satellite Launch Headquarters and the chief satellite installation engineer had carried out an assessment and considered everything to be ready before allowing the test to be conducted on schedule. However, three power sources short-circuited simultaneously, which was unimaginable. That day, the person who should have been on duty at the power supply department had suddenly been replaced by somebody else. Following the accident, the person in charge of the power supply room who was on duty shot himself. Some people said that he committed suicide because he felt frustrated, while others said that he did so to escape punishment. Ding Henggao, Song Jian's Instructions Other versions tended to ascribe the cause of the accident to negligence and carelessness. It was alleged that at the time of the test, a certain part of the satellite made an unusual sound soon after it started operating and the person in charge ordered a halt to the operation for an examination, but the operator mistook this for accelerating the speed, and consequently the satellite exploded. Some people said that the head and the chief engineer had suggested that the test be conducted after obtaining one or two additional verifications and making further checks, but the leaders concerned held that since time was pressing, they could secure proofs while conducting the test. Consequently, the accident occurred. Other people said that something wrong had been found at the testing ground, but that the authorities did not watch out for it and still ordered that the test be conducted on schedule. Consequently, the satellite exploded less than three minutes after it started operating. Apart from the above-mentioned versions, the accident was also analyzed in the following way: Recently, many accidents have occurred in the process of launching and producing satellites, and this is related to the fact that scientists and technicians are emotionally unstable because their pay is too low and they have worked in a remote environment for a long time. In addition, major accidents have occurred because the system is so slack. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but the versions spread and remarks made by Ding Henggao and Song Jian after their inspection deserve to be pondered. At that time, Ding and Song said in unison that the key to the problem still lay in rigorous enforcement of rules and regulations and a strict scientific attitude and in paying close attention to the requests and feelings of scientists and technicians. Deplorable Remuneration of Personnel of the Astronautics Sector Xichang, called Gongdu in ancient times, is situated in the southwestern part of Sichuan Province, a zone of Central Asian tropical plateau monsoon weather hemmed in by mountains with an elevation of 1,590 meters, and it is painstakingly portrayed by the official media as the "beautiful and fascinating moon city." But in reality, the water quality of the mountain valley in which the Xichang Satellite Launch Center is located is poor. People are particularly fond of eating meat after drinking the water, but they feel bloated after eating. [sentence as published] Some people call it the "Xichang disease." Also, it is common to have the reactions to high-plateau weather, such as diarrhea, headaches, and fever. Intellectuals of the Xichang Satellite Launch Center are even more distressed spiritually. There is no fashion or pop music, but only the popular saying: "Devoting one's youth, life, and offspring to the cause." Vigorously played up by the CPC media, this jingle has become the portrayal of scientists' and technicians' unselfishness. The satellite town in Xichang is different from the nuclear test base. The two are located in equally remote areas, but the former officially started opening up to the outside world from 1 September 1988 and has been visited by people from over 50 countries and regions and, owing to the atmosphere of liberation outside, the CPC's grand but empty and unreal propaganda of "devoting oneself to the cause" can no longer be effective. In particular, they know that in order to have a share in the highly competitive global satellite-launching market, China has to win launch contracts at a low price. For example, the price for launching two satellites with a U.S. Titan-3 rocket is from $100 million to $125 million; the General Dynamics Corporation's price is from $40 million to $90 million; and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation's price for launching a medium-sized commercial communications satellite is from $45 million to $50 million. In order to compete with the "three U.S. moguls," China sets the satellite-launching price at $25 million only. Such a "bargain price" is really effective and has lured representatives of over 20 countries and regions to Xichang to hold talks on cooperation. The monthly pay of an intellectual of the Chinese astronautics sector is a mere several hundred yuan, and the saying that "one who deals with missiles is even inferior to those selling tea" is the best portrayal of their situation. The meager pay of satellite installation workers, who bear a great responsibility, is really astonishing. In the Xichang Satellite General Installation Plant, workers at grade 2 are paid only around 50 yuan, and those at grade 8 are paid 100 yuan for a long time without any increment. Workers worked hard round the clock for over a year to produce the Long March 2 cluster carrier rocket, and each of them was paid merely a little more than 200 yuan bonus, with the monthly average less than 20 yuan. It was learned that those installing satellites in Xichang are experienced workers with unique skills. They thought that once commercial rockets were launched, their living conditions would be improved, but, to their disappointment, it was only their own wishful thinking! There were generally grievances in the hearts of most scientists and technicians. At the launch center monitoring station, some young college students could no longer bear the lifestyle of "seeing soldiers in the daytime and counting stars at night." Some of them cried secretly, some asked for transfers, and others simply sneaked away. However, the authorities concerned did not pay attention to their growing feelings of insecurity, and were stunned only by the explosion of the Fengyun-2 satellite. More and More Serious Satellite Accidents Over the past four years, four satellite accidents have occurred in China, each more serious than the last, which will certainly affect China's "commercial credit" in the global satellite-launching market. Apart from the one reported in this article, the other three accidents were as follows: On 22 March 1992, due to a breakdown in the ignition system, the launch of Australia's Aussat-B1 communications satellite at the Xichang base failed. On 21 December 1992, Australia's Optus-B2 communications satellite exploded 48 seconds after being launched into orbit from the Xichang base. On 16 October 1993, China's recoverable satellite for scientific exploration and technological experimentation broke down and could not be recovered eight days after being launched into orbit. The United States said it had fallen into the Pacific, but China said it was still wandering through space. In addition, China's "commercial image" is also called into question by many overseas clients. For example, when the satellite accidentally exploded on 21 December 1992, the personnel of the Xichang Center still opened bottles of champagne to celebrate the launch and the scene was really bustling. In fact, the satellite exploded less than a minute after being launched into orbit. However, China "only cared about the launch," whereas the explosion was caused by the satellite's internal problems, so the case should be handled by the client! Moreover, last year's grand launch of the satellite for scientific and technological experimentation was even a farce. A Mao Zedong gold badge numbered "8341," which was cast in 18-karat gold and inlaid with 44 South African diamonds (some people revealed that the diamonds were fake), was put inside the satellite and the company concerned had the unique idea of selling the badge by auction after it had "travelled through the universe" because they thought that by so doing, the badge would certainly be sold at a much higher price. It allegedly cost 80,000 yuan to send the Mao Zedong badge into space by satellite and a 100,000-yuan insurance premium was also paid; but a Hong Kong company had offered to buy it for 2 million yuan, therefore over 1 million yuan net profit would be reaped in this deal. However, all these calculations were not realized. China has successfully retrieved 14 recoverable satellites, but it was such a coincidence that the satellite with the Mao Zedong badge met with an accident and became a heap of garbage in space....
