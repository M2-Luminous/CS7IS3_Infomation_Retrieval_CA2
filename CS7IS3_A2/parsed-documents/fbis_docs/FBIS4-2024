FBIS4-2024 "drchi065_n_94013" FBIS-CHI-94-065 Daily Report 23 Mar 1994 Economic & Agricultural Circular Reveals Serious Exaggeration of Output Value Circular Reveals Serious Exaggeration of Output Value HK0504083694 Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese 0853 GMT 23 Mar 94 HK0504083694 Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE Chinese BFN [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Since the beginning of this year, people have been reporting problems of exaggerating industrial output value which have emerged in some localities. Consequently, the State Statistical Bureau and the Ministry of Supervision dispatched investigative teams to various localities to investigate. The findings show that such situations indeed exist and are even quite widespread. In some localities, the problem is quite serious. As a result, the State Statistical Bureau and the Ministry of Supervision have issued a circular on the problem of exaggerating industrial output value in some localities. Party and government leaders in some localities have exaggerated their achievements by falsely reporting their output value, but under pressure from the leadership, the local statistical departments, instead of upholding principle, have resorted to deception in violating the provisions of the "Statistical Law." The idea of blindly competing for growth rate among party and government leaders in some localities also has resulted in some towns, townships, and enterprises exaggerating their industrial output value. For example, the Taicang City petrochemical plant consistently exaggerated its output value between June 1992 and March this year, and it was not until the investigation team had arrived in that city to investigate that the practice was rectified. The plant's actual industrial output value was 115 million yuan last year, but it was reported to the city statistical bureau as 173 million yuan. This represents an exaggeration of 58.34 million yuan, accounting for 33.7 percent of the reported figure. In the city's Shaxi Township, the nine village-run industrial enterprises, which have comparatively large output values, exaggerated their output value by as much as 25.8 percent of the total output value of village-run enterprises in the whole township. Moreover, some localities have changed the national unified method of calculation without authorization, causing a false increase in output value growth rate. The circular points out: The practice of fraud in statistical work, in violation of the "Statistical Law," has deprived the state macroeconomic regulation and control of reliable, scientific figures. An erroneous policy decision made on the basis of erroneous information will cause major losses to the national economy.
