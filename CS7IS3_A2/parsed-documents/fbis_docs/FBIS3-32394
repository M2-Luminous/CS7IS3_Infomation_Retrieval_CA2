When referring to the presence of U.S. troops in Juan Chaco, Ernesto Samper Pizano said President Cesar Gaviria allowed the U.S. Government to pull a fast one on him. During a visit to Buenaventura in Valle del Cauca Department, Samper said the gringos are better tourists than builders of schools, and he added that, if elected president of Colombia, he would not allow the nation's sovereignty to be violated in this way. [Begin Samper recording] We do not need foreign soldiers to build schools or roads, much less in this region where we have twice as much unemployment as the rest of the country. What we need are public works projects that put our own people to work. I believe the U.S. Government or the Defense Ministry has pulled a fast one on President Gaviria. [end recording] Samper also said there is a need to integrate the Pacific region into the nation's development plans.
