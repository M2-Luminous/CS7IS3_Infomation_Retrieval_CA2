FR940318-0-00159 FR940318-0-00023 Production of HCFCs is controlled by the Clean Air Act and under section 605 is scheduled for phase-out by 2030. However, due to new data concerning greater risks of ozone depletion, EPA promulgated an accelerated phase-out schedule (58 FR 65018, 12/10/93). Given the technical and safety concerns associated with many non-HCFC alternatives, however, disallowing the interim use of HCFCs in insulating foam end-uses, including the use of HCFC&hyph;141b and HCFC&hyph;22, would have adverse effects on human health and the environment. Effective January 1, 1994, plastic foam products which contain or are manufactured with HCFCs are banned from sale or distribution into interstate commerce under section 610 of the CAA. Under section 610, thermal insulation foam products are, however, exempted from this ban. Foam insulation product means a product containing or consisting of the following types of foam: (1) Closed cell rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foam; (2) closed cell rigid polystyrene boardstock foam; (3) closed cell rigid phenolic foam; and (4) closed cell rigid polyethylene foam when such foam is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that provides thermal insulation around pipes used in heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or industrial process systems. Any use of acceptable HCFC substitutes listed under SNAP must comply with restrictions under the section 610 Non-Essential Ban. b. Hydrofluorocarbons. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) represent a zero-ODP alternative to CFC blowing agents in many sectors. From the standpoint of stratospheric ozone depletion alone, HFCs are preferable to HCFCs as alternative blowing agents. The relatively higher thermal conductivity of HFCs, however, is likely to hamper the insulating capabilities of HFC-blown foams unless significant changes in the foam formulation or process modifications are adopted. The HFCs hold more promise as near- or intermediate-term alternatives for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene foams, particularly in extruded polystyrene sheet foams. However, issues such as flammability, global warming potential, cost, and the solubility of HFCs in polystyrene polymer remain of concern for the industry. Conversion to HFC&hyph;152a may entail significant capital investment in order to ensure worker safety against fire hazards. Moreover, in the case of insulating foams, manufacturers will need to guarantee that foams blown with HFC&hyph;152a meet the building code requirements that apply to the flammability of building materials. c. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6, most of which are readily available as bulk chemicals, have the advantage of being low cost. These chemicals are also halogen free, thus they are both zero-ODP and zero-GWP. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 are currently being used in extruded polystyrene, polyurethane, and polyolefin non-insulating foam end-uses. Hydrocarbons have significantly higher thermal conductivities than do any of the CFCs. Conversion to hydrocarbons could thus lead to the production of foams with lower insulating efficiency and, possibly, to a reduction in the energy efficiency of insulated items. Formulation changes and process modifications have been introduced to increase the thermal insulating efficiency of hydrocarbon-blown foams. Cyclopentane is a leading alternative blowing-agent candidate for insulating foams because of its high boiling point and other physical properties similar to CFC&hyph;11. Conversion to hydrocarbons may entail significant capital investment in order to ensure worker safety against fire hazards. Moreover, in the case of insulating foams, manufacturers will need to guarantee that foams blown with hydrocarbons meet the building code requirements that apply to the flammability of building materials. Hydrocarbons are VOCs and may contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog, in the lower atmosphere. Any use of hydrocarbon blowing agents is subject to the federal, state and local restrictions that apply to VOCs, and conversion to hydrocarbons could therefore involve further capital investment to comply with these restrictions. d. Other blowing agents. Two other blowing agents, methylene chloride and acetone, have been identified as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11 in flexible polyurethane foams. Methylene chloride, which already serves as an auxiliary blowing agent for most grades of flexible polyurethane foam, is commercially available, and is relatively low cost. Because of its toxicity, it poses a potential risk to workers and residents in nearby communities. However, the Agency's analysis of use of this chemical as a blowing agent indicates risks can be controlled by adhering to existing regulatory standards. Methylene chloride use is further restricted in several states and localities, and is listed as a hazardous waste under RCRA and, thus, users must comply with applicable RCRA waste disposal requirements. The Agency is also in the process of addressing residual risks to the general population through emissions to air under title III section 112 of the CAA. The Agency expects to issue maximum achievable control technology (MACT) rules governing methylene chloride use in the foams sector by 1997. Methylene chloride is not a VOC, and thus, does not contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone. When used as a blowing agent, acetone is capable of yielding all grades of flexible polyurethane foam. It can serve as an alternative blowing agent where methylene chloride use is infeasible. Acetone is a VOC, and must be controlled as such. In addition, plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate acetone's flammability. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is an acceptable substitute for all foam end-uses. Any CO 2 blend is acceptable as long as the other constituents of the blend are acceptable under SNAP. CO 2 does contribute to global warming. In addition, CO 2 has the highest thermal conductivity of the SNAP-listed chemical alternatives, and will lower the thermal capacity of insulating foams unless significant foam formulation or process modifications are adopted. e. Alternative manufacturing processes. The AB Technology is a commercially available and technically feasible process for replacing CFCs or other auxiliary blowing agents for most conventional flexible foam grades. AB Technology employs formic acid in conjunction with water as the blowing agent for producing flexible polyurethane foam. The process is based on using the reaction of formic acid with an isocyanate to produce carbon monoxide in addition to the water/isocyanate reaction normally used to generate carbon dioxide gas for the expansion of foam. OSHA has set a permissible exposure level (PEL) for carbon monoxide of 35 ppm of a time weighted average with a ceiling not to exceed 200 ppm. 3. Comment Response
