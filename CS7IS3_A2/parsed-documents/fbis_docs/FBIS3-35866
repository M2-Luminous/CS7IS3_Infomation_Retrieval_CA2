The speaker begins the broadcast by defining the State Independence of Ukraine as an association of ethnic Ukrainians fighting "to build a Ukrainian Ukraine." He then sets out the association's election platform, which is as follows: The association works to "stop immediately the uncontrollable export to Russia, Israel, Poland, and other countries of food and consumer goods," and "to close the Ukrainian borders and thus stop the filthy wave of Russian and Western pseudo-culture, pornography," drug addiction and immigration from Russia, the Caucasus, and Third World countries. The association is against "the democratic and communist clique of Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy," which sold Ukraine down the river, and expresses non-confidence in "the so-called democratic opposition zealously following orders from the West" and "the communists whose hearts are with Moscow, the capital of the Russian empire of evil." It is in favor of a crushing blow to the Mafia, state monopoly in foreign trade and currency operations, state regulation of prices, "expropriation of the new bourgeois of non-Ukrainian decent that enriched itself by violating the law and exploiting the Ukrainians." It is in favor of the retention of industry in state ownership and a new citizenship law that will only make loyal Ukrainian citizens eligible to vote and prevent "privatization of Ukraine by aliens." The speaker then proclaims that in order for Ukraine "to survive as a nation, preference in our state must be given to anything Ukrainian. Ukrainians must be given precedence in employment, social security, provision of cheap housing, and privatization." He maintains that the peasantry should be given land that can be bequeathed to their children but not sold, stating that "politicians must encourage the Ukrainian peasant to the full." He goes on to say that the association will "stop the conversion of the military industrial complex and unilateral disarmament," put an end to "democratic chaos and communist rule," and promote strong nationalistically minded authorities and "a powerful Ukrainian Army armed with nuclear weapons." All this goes to show, he continues, that there is every precondition in Ukraine for a military dictatorship to be established, to rid Ukraine of such phenomena as chaos, the Crimean crisis, separatism, and crime. He adds that "Ukrainian servicemen must come to power," which will be followed by decreeing censorship, banning democratization, "resolutely restoring order in Ukraine," introducing an economic state of emergency, disbanding anti- Ukrainian organizations, and "deporting the disloyal." He continues: "A national dictatorship alone will lead Ukraine out of chaos and see it through until it becomes a state. The DSU calls on the Supreme Council to draw up a Ukraine law on the impeachment of the president, and immediately remove Leonid Kravchuk from power as a traitor to the national interests of the Ukrainian people who broke his promise," given to Ukraine when he took up this post "so important to Ukraine." He concludes his speech by appealing to the Ukrainian people to rise, and proclaiming: "Ukraine will win! There will be the Ukrainian state."
