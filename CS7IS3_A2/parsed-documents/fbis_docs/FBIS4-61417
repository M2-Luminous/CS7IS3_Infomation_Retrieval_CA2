According to Vladimir Meshcheryakov, the Federation Council plans to hold hearings on the preparation for ratification of this package of documents on May 16. The signing of the agreement on the establishment of free trade zones, the deputy chairman of the state customs committee noted, is the first stage in the process of economic drawing together of the Commonwealth countries. The second stage will mark the transition to a customs union. In both cases, Vladimir Meshcheryakov explained, there will be no quantitative and tariff restrictions in mutual trade but the existence of free trade zones does not prevent the state from the independent determination of its foreign economic policy. After all, a customs union is first of all common customs tariffs. Vladimir Meshcheryakov paid attention to the fact that a concept of free trade in the Commonwealth is not applied in a pure form now. In practice the so-called exceptions from the free trade regime are employed which were legalized by bilateral agreements between Russia and other Commonwealth countries signed in 1992-1993. These exceptions concern export tariffs, quotas and licenses. For this reason the agreement signed by leaders of the Commonwealth countries on April 15 is considerably advancing the Commonwealth towards the establishment of a customs union, Vladimir Meshcheryakov pointed out.
