FBIS3-47656 "dreas011_a_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-011 Document Type:Daily Report 18 January 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Construction Reform Plan Set, Support Noted Draft Formulated OW1401135194 Tokyo KYODO in English 1343 GMT 14 Jan 94 OW1401135194 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The government on Friday [14 January] formulated a final draft for the planned action program aimed at boosting foreign access to Japan's construction market, government sources said. The action plan, worked out at a meeting of senior officials of concerned ministries, calls for introducing an open bidding system on public works projects ordered by both the central and local governments. Currently, only designated contractors are allowed to participate in bidding for most public works projects. According to the final draft, the open bidding system will be introduced for state-sponsored works projects worth 4.5 million special drawing rights [SDR's], or 700 million yen, or more. One SDR is currently valued at 190 yen, but the Finance Ministry plans to change the rate to 160 yen from April. The plan is based on the new exchange rate. If the works are ordered by the country's 47 prefectures, or 12 designated cities, and 85 public corporations like the Japan Highway Public Corp., the threshold is 15 million SDRs, or 2.4 billion yen. The plan will come into force in April. The action plan will be approved at a cabinet meeting scheduled for next Tuesday, in time for the January 20 deadline for threatened U.S. sanctions. The United States originally threatened to retaliate if Japan failed to come up with effective measures for opening the construction market by October 31. It extended the deadline to January 20 in October, responding to a Japanese pledge to draft an action program on the matter early this year. The sources said the draft plan has already received basic approval from U.S. negotiators in bilateral construction-market talks. Open bidding will also start for design consulting services for public works projects. Such services for state projects are put to open bidding if they are worth 450,000 SDRs or more and those for local governments 1.5 million SDRs. As for a 1988 Japan-U.S. pact on preferential treatment for foreign contractors in 40 major projects, the government has decided not to immediately abolish it and agreed rather to phase it out by applying open bidding on those projects.
