And while it has been indicated that Operation-BAT and the Aerostat would not be affected, it will take great ingenuity to ensure that the loss of $500,000 does not significantly impair the effectiveness of the Bahamas/U.S. cooperative efforts, Mr. Turnquest said. "It will be most unfortunate that the successes which we have achieved today over the last seven years, should be reversed in any way by a reduction of this kind in our financial resources. We state on other occasions the Bahamas is unable to increase its resources which are allocated to drug control activities. A budgetary allotment into this area is now 15 per cent of our total national budget," he said. Mr. John Ford, U.S. Charge d'Affaires to the Bahamas said that the cut in the INM budget for Nassau is also regretted. But U.S. officials are commitment to OPBAT in terms of money, resources and personnel. Mr. Ford said that the corporation between the Bahamas and the United States, continues to shine as an example for other bilateral and multi-lateral efforts. Mr. Orville Turnquest said that the Bahamas joint task force exercise has become a singularly successful and unique continuing enterprise against the scourge of drug trafficking. He said he was delighted that the results to date seem to indicate that while "we may not yet have won the war," the battle has been continuing. Mr. Turnquest said good news stem from the statistics indicating the successful results of the joint enterprise between the Bahamas and the United States. "The amount of cocaine seized in Bahamian waters during the first three quarters of 1993, has returned downwards to 1980 level. We are told that a mere 520 pounds of cocaine or 240 kilos, were seized in Bahamian territory in the first three quarters of 1993," said Mr. Turnquest. "Of those totals the largest seizure in Bahamian territory for 1993, was an air drop retrieved by OPBAT in July. This, I believe, is proof of the success of this cooperative effort between our two countries. OPBAT was also successful in seizing 2,546 pounds of cocaine in international waters. This reflects in my mind the reduction in the trend of drug trafficking activities in 1992, when the bulk of cocaine seizures occurred in Bahamian waters."
