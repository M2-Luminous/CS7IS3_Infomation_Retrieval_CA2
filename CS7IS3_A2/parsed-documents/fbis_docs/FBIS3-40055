In a written statement issued today, Karayalcin noted that he finds the massacre at Tuzla train station in which five officer cadets were martyred, the bombing of the Democracy Party headquarters, and the killing of the Motherland Party mayor of Adalar, as very worrying from the viewpoint of their timing as well as their nature. Stressing that it does not matter much if these incidents were planned or coincidental, Karayalcin said: I described my concern on the subject as the preparations of centers wanting to interrupt or eliminate democracy and I called on all political party leaders to display unity against such moves. Asked by reporters who these centers are, I retorted: I wish I knew and I could make it public. These attacks are directed against democracy. I do not believe that anyone could interpret these intensifying incidents of terror and bombing in any other way. I continue to hold these views. In voicing my concern, however, I never used the word coup. I never linked the incidents to the army. Moreover, if I had any information on the subject, I would not have hesitated to make it public in line with my understanding of democracy. Karayalcin remarked that democracy is the only foundation for the solution of all problems and called on all parties to embrace one another and democracy.
