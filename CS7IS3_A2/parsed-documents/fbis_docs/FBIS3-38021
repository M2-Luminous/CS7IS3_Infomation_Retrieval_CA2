Barkashov's men took an active part in the hard-line revolt last October. ITAR-TASS learned of Barkoshov's intentions on Thursday through his lawyer, Larisa Dementyeva. Dementyeva also announced that, according to Article Five of the criminal procedural code of the Russian Federation, "The application of an amnesty should not depend on whether or not the accused has confessed to the charges filed against him". The lawyers of other participants in the October 3-4 events refused, when asked by ITAR-TASS, to make any statements until they receive the official text of the anmesty from the State Duma. Procurator-General of Russia Aleksey Kazannik has promised to distribute the text to the concerned defenders as soon as it is forwarded to his office.
