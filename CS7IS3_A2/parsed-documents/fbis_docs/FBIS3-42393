Makarov and Lt Col Ye. Velichko] [Text] An article published earlier in our journal[.sup]1[/] examined the state and prospects of development of China's Air Force, the composition of which includes national air defense units and subunits. Below we use foreign press data to shed light on questions concerning the organization, force composition, training, and employment of air defense forces and assets. The basis of the national air defense system is Air Force forces and assets and also air defense formations of the Ground Forces, Navy, and the so-called "people's air defense," performing civil defense functions. In the opinion of representatives of the PRC Ministry of Defense, creation of a unified air defense concept for the long-term future should be determined by its increased role as a component of the "national deterrence forces," which will require deployment of warning forces (primarily space- and air-based) as part of air defense and centralization of command and control of air defense forces and assets of the armed forces and "people's air defense" based on creation of integrated command bodies. All of China's territory is divided into seven large military districts in which air defense forces and assets are stationed. The commander of the district air forces is responsible for organizing air defense within each district, and his deputy is charged with direct supervision. Command and control of forces and assets is accomplished from the main air defense command post (Beijing) and also from the air defense command posts of the military districts, aviation formations and large units, and units of surface-to-air missile [SAM] troops and antiaircraft artillery. Fighter aviation is an active air defense asset and numbers up to 4,000 aircraft: 400 J-5 (Xian-5 in national terminology), 3,000 J-6 (Xian-6), 500 J-7 (Xian-7), and about 100 J-8 (Xian-8) aircraft. Of these, the J-5, J-6, and J-7 are obsolete fighters made based on the Soviet MiG-17, MiG-19, and MiG-21 aircraft, respectively. The main efforts in the development of fighter aviation are concentrated on optimizing its quantitative composition and speeding up modernization of the aircraft fleet. Chinese military experts believe that the structure of the Air Force should develop in the direction of a more proportional representation of such branches of aviation as fighter-bomber, reconnaissance, and auxiliary aviation, which in conditions of reducing the armed forces can be accomplished with a consistent decrease in fighter aviation's percentage. It is planned to decrease the number of fighters by quickly removing from service obsolete equipment and gradually refitting with new types of aircraft. The J-7 and J-8 aircraft (Figure 1 [not reproduced]) will remain the country's main air defense fighters until the year 2000. Their service will be extended by upgrading them (the latest modifications are the J-7-3 and J-8-2). The J-7-3 air defense fighter, unlike the J-7 base model, is equipped with a more powerful WK-13 engine with 6,500 kgf of thrust in the afterburner mode. It is equipped with additional fuel tanks, a JL-7 radar, and a radar warning system. It has a 23-mm under-fuselage cannon, two additional weapon hardpoints, and improved fire control instruments. The J-8-2 aircraft has been made since the mid-1980's and is a multipurpose fighter ensuring the intercept of air targets at high altitudes and destruction of ground targets. It is equipped with a nose fairing and auxiliary inlets, two WK-13A turbojet engines with 6,700 kgf of thrust each on afterburner, and seven hardpoints for missiles and other weapons. It is planned to upgrade the aircraft with participation of American firms, which are to equip 55 aircraft with modern electronics. Specifications and performance characteristics of China's modern fighters are shown below. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |J-7-3 |J-8-2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Wingspan, meters |7.154 |9.344 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Length, meters |14.885 |21.59 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Height, meters |4.103 |5.41 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Wing area, square meters |23.00 |41.20 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Takeoff weight, kg: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |of empty aircraft |5,275 |9,820 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |normal |7,531 |14,300 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Speed (Mach) |2.05 |2.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Service ceiling, meters |18,200 |20,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flight range (with exter-|700-950 |700 | |nal fuel tanks), km | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Length of landing roll, |600-900 |1000 | |meters | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A shortage of financial resources in the country does not make it possible to conduct an accelerated aircraft modernization; therefore, re-equipping the Air Force with J-7-3 and J-8-2 fighters is being accomplished at a slow pace. In addition, the Chinese leadership possibly does not want to continue series production of fighter aircraft lagging 1-2 generations behind those of western countries, especially since they have begun purchasing modern aircraft abroad (in particular, Russian Su-27 fighters). Surface-to-Air Missile Forces and Antiaircraft Artillery. About 100 battalions of Hunqi-2 medium-range SAM's (600 launchers) with a maximum height of 28 km are deployed on China's territory. Development of the surface-to-air missile forces and antiaircraft artillery is proceeding along the path of refitting and re-equipping them with new types of SAM's and antiaircraft artillery and improving the tactics of their employment and training facilities. In connection with this, the decision has been made to accelerate the pace of developing the surface-to-air missile forces and antiaircraft artillery, especially in connection with the planned reduction of fighter aviation and the need to redistribute missions between fighter aviation and ground air defense components. Since the first half of the 1980's, China has been actively developing several new types of SAM's. The basis of their creation is the requirement to increase mobility, the number of channels, and protection against jamming, and also to reduce the time of the firing cycle. As a result, a number of experimental models of SAM systems of various types have been created. Individual ones have been put into service. The basis of China's surface-to-air missile defense is the HQ-2 (Hunqi-2) medium-range SAM, developed on the base of the Soviet-made SA-75 SAM. It has been produced since the mid-1960's. Foreign experts estimate that the air defense force composition today includes as many as 600 launchers for the modernized HQ-2A/2J (Hunqi-2A/2J) SAM. In the late 1980's, the mobile HQ-2B (Hunqi-2B) SAM system was created on its base. It has a modernized missile which uses a new type of radar proximity fuze (the point of initiation of the warhead detonation is adjusted depending on the missile's position relative to the target). It uses an improved warhead that creates a large number of flechettes upon detonation and has a rocket motor with increased thrust. The acquisition and control radar is equipped with an optical and television target-tracking system. The KS-1 mobile medium-range SAM system is currently going through field testing. Definite progress was achieved in developing a short-range SAM system. Thus, by the early 1990's China had introduced models of four new systems: HQ-61 (Hunqi-61), FM-80, PL-9, and HN-5C. It is planned to use them to reinforce protection of individual small installations and to build up air defenses of major administrative-political and military-industrial centers and also in the interests of battlefield air defenses. Active formation of battlefield air defense and assigning it from the composition of field artillery to an independent arm of the Ground Forces will be accomplished in the next decade. Development of the HQ-61 SAM system was conduced in China from the early 1980's, and today has been completed. The system includes a launcher with two single-stage solid-propellant SAM's, a Type 571 target acquisition radar (similar to the Soviet P-15), a missile guidance radar, a control element, and supporting ground equipment. The FM-80 SAM system is based on the French Crotale system. Today, the Chinese press has reported the formation of the first battalion equipped with this type of SAM system. The system may be produced both in the mobile and fixed version. The PL-9 SAM launcher is mounted on an armored personnel carrier base and resembles the American Chaparral system in appearance (Figure 2 [not reproduced]). It uses a SAM similar to PL-9 air-to-air missile made based on the American AIM-9L Sidewinder. Development of the HN-5C SAM system began in the early 1980's. It was first presented in 1986. In the original variant, the launcher was mounted on a light truck chassis. During the course of subsequent modification it is planned to put the launcher on the base of a wheeled armored personnel carrier. The SAM system includes eight missiles in canisters and eight reserve missiles. The system is service by two people. It uses the missile from the HN-5A portable SAM system with an infrared homing head. It is planned to upgrade it and equip it with a new homing head to support firing at air targets from the forward hemisphere. The specifications and performance characteristics of Chinese-made SAM systems are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

Antiaircraft artillery from SAM and artillery brigades and separate antiaircraft artillery regiments is used to combat the air enemy at low altitudes and in the immediate proximity of installations being covered. Its inventory includes more than 16,000 100-, 85-, 57-, 37-, and 23-mm antiaircraft pieces. Development of antiaircraft artillery is proceeding along the path of creating antiaircraft artillery and missile-artillery systems. An artillery system usually includes 35- and 37-mm guns, a command and control facility, and a Type 702 fire control radar, which can be used with the improved antiaircraft fire control instrument. In addition, a missile-artillery system includes a launcher with four PL-9 missiles. Radar Monitoring of the Airspace. A military district is divided into sectors, each of which has 8-12 radar posts. A total of more than 550 radars, more than 60 percent of which perform air defense missions, and the rest perform air traffic control missions. Air defense radar posts are located mainly along the state border and seacoast, providing a 60-80 percent overlap of the zones of responsibility of adjacent posts. The posts have the most modern radars, which create a solid radar field at altitudes of over 2,000 meters. In the opinion of western military experts, a solid radar field does not exist at altitudes below 2,000 meters. Improvement of monitoring equipment in the near future is tied to the next generation of radars entering service, which possess better jamming protection and can be linked to automated control systems. Development of phased-array, over-the-horizon, and multi-position radars is regarded as the promising priority directions. In examining foreign experience in improving radar monitoring systems, Chinese specialists believe it is necessary to create a single radar field by combining the efforts of the different armed services and civilian agencies. This will make it possible to substantially reduce the number of Air Force radar posts and economize on forces and assets. Today, the troops are beginning to receive new types of radars: 408C and HN-503 (first-line radar posts are equipped with them); multifunctional three-coordinate JY-8 (Figure 3 [not reproduced]), JY-14, 146-1A (they are part of command and control and warning centers); JY-8A and JY-9 low-altitude target acquisition radars; and REL air traffic control radars. Specifications and performance characteristics of Chinese-made radars are shown in Table 2. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

It is being accomplished during the course of a dual process of shifting to new types and means of communications. The main one among them will be space-based communications and equipping command and control bodies and elements with computer equipment and combining them into automated complexes and systems. An example of such a system is the TADS-2 (Tactical Air Defense System), on the basis of which an air defense sector or zone command post can be deployed. It includes five container-type cabins (two control cabins, each equipped with six to eight control panels, and three technical support and communications cabins) and also an electric power generating unit. The system makes it possible to distribute information on 120 air targets with a discreteness of 10 seconds, simultaneously track up to eight targets in the automatic mode, and accomplish up to eight guidance vectorings. The main directions of the military-technical policy in the area of improving air defense are being implemented simultaneously with working out the fundamentals of combat employment of air defense forces and assets. Chinese military experts believe that development of a basic form of using air defense forces and assets, which is what an air defense operation is, must take place within the framework of forming a system of views on combat employment of the armed forces. This will make it possible to coordinate efforts in developing weapons systems and military equipment and determining the overall need for them, state more precisely the composition of the force dispositions in a theater of military operations, and also optimize their defensive and offensive capabilities. At the same time, it is recognized that the existing level of the air defense system, the weak capabilities of automating the command and control processes, and the incomplete development of theories of operational art of the armed forces make the task of organizing and conducting an air defense operation in existing conditions difficult. In this connection, it is considered advisable to concentrate efforts on the study and practical working out of questions of employment of air defense forces and assets during combined-arms operations and also when repelling enemy air strikes. Considerable attention in the future must be given to working out questions of organizing and conducting air battles and engagements, which is dictated by the place and role of fighter aviation in the country's overall air defense system. Chinese military experts emphasize that air defense capabilities can be increased by stepping up scientific research and experimental design work, expanding production of modern operational systems and arms, increasing the level of automation, improving engineer and logistic support, camouflage, concealment, and deception, and also by stepping up reconnaissance and electronic warfare. On the whole, close attention is being given to the development of air defense forces and assets in China, which is associated with the proclamation of the defensive military doctrine as the basis for organizational development of the armed forces. The increase in the importance of air defense is determined by its future role as one of the important components of national "deterrence forces." It is planned to further improve China's air defense within the framework of a coordinated military-technical policy, in which the development and deployment of new weapons systems and military equipment are closely linked to studying the operational-strategic forms of their employment and other aspects of organizational development of the armed forces.
