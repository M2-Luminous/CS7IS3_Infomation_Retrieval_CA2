The Ukrainian president was interviewed on current political issues. He said, in particular, that the Black Sea Fleet problem must be resolved as soon as possible. "We need to settle it as soon as possible, so that instead of a Russian fleet with Russia's laws, Ukraine will have its own fleet. I do not see any other option than leasing the Sevastopol base to the Russian fleet. Leaving the Ukrainian Navy there would be dangerous. There will be no peace as long as the Ukrainian and Russian naval forces are together." Asked about his nomination in the next presidential election by a group of electors in Vinnitsa oblast, Leonid Kravchuk replied: "I am grateful to the voters. I have very close ties with Vinnitsa oblast; I was nominated and elected to parliament in Yampolskiy constituency there, and when I was nominated for presidency they also supported me, so I am sincerely grateful."
