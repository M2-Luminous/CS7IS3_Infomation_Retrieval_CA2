This is the last country in Southeast Asia that our Prime Minister has visited. Would you please elaborate on the significance of the visit? [Nguyen Manh Cam] We are continuing to implement our foreign policy of diversified diplomatic activities in various forms. In implementing this policy, we have attached importance to developing relations with regional countries. Myanmar is a country in Southeast Asia that has many similar features, historically and culturally, to Vietnam. People of the two countries have supported and assisted each other during the struggle for their national independence. I would like to recall that 36 years ago, Uncle Ho visited this country. During the past several decades, due to changes in the region that include the war in Vietnam and upheaval in Myanmar, relations in various fields between the two nations did not develop well. Now, the trend of cooperation and development is prevailing in our region, and we are striving to strengthen relations with all Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar. Our prime minister's visit to Myanmar this time is aimed at consolidating the existing relations between the two nations while asserting our wish to develop the bilateral relations in the new stage to truly serve the trend of development in the region. [Correspondent] Dear Foreign Minister, you just stressed the significance of the visit. Would you please elaborate on the concrete results of the visit? [Nguyen Manh Cam] Our ancestors are correct in saying that we will see things precisely on the spot. Reading books on realities of a nation, we can see but a general view; when we visit the country, see its realities, and get in touch with its people, we understand more about that country. Through the visit to Myanmar, the Vietnamese delegation could see its realities and exchanged views with our Myanmar friends to correctly assess the trend of development and cooperation between the two countries. First, I would like to say that this visit has helped in strengthening the mutual understanding, thereby creating a profound mutual trust. Through the visit, we clearly see the Myanmar people's sentiment toward Vietnam. The Myanmar government and people extended a very warm welcome to the Vietnamese delegation. Tens of thousands of people lined up the streets, waving Vietnamese and Myanmar flags to welcome the Vietnamese guests from the airport to the guest house and along streets leading to various production establishments and localities. Generally speaking, the Myanmar people went to the streets to express their sentiment toward the Vietnamese delegation and people. During our meetings with the Myanmar leaders and people, they have expressed their respect for Vietnam by saying that the Vietnamese people have a very strong determination in the struggle for national independence and national construction and defense. The Myanmar people also have such a quality, thereby they highly respect the Vietnamese people and admire the latter for their creativity and the spirit of self-reliance in building the Vietnamese nation. They also hope that Myanmar will develop successfully in the same spirit. This has strengthened the ties and mutual trust between the two nations. I should say that this is very important especially when our two countries are in the process of developing their respective nations. While Vietnam and Myanmar are facing numerous difficulties and their capabilities in developing their nations are low, they are striving to find ways and means to help each other. Through various meetings and talks, both sides have agreed to cooperate with each other in various fields. Myanmar has a very vast forest area. The country has an area of more than 770,000 square km or two times larger than Vietnam, 58 percent of which are forests, mostly the precious timber trees. As a result, Myanmar has extensive experience in protecting, managing, and exploiting forests, thus we can learn this from our Myanmar friends. Myanmar also has ample experience in exploiting and producing precious stones. Myanmar has great potential in producing these stones, thus it has vast experience in exploiting, fixing prices, and selling these precious stones and in making them into valuable ornamental items. Myanmar has expressed a willingness to share its experiences with Vietnam in this regard. In addition, it must be said that though Myanmar's economy is still developing and facing financial difficulties, the government and people attach great importance to cultural heritage and make due efforts to preserve national traits. Therefore, they spend money to restore ancient cultural relics, including the ancient imperial city in Mandalay and the Shwe Dagon Pagoda, which is both a cultural and religious relic that has existed for more than 2,500 years now. Apart from their great cultural value, these relics are of practical important significance because they serve as very important tourist attractions. We can cooperate with Myanmar in another field. By this, I mean Myanmar's due concern for environmental protection. This can be seen through the government's efforts to keep urban areas and other parts of the country green. Well-defined plans and long-term projects have been worked out to meet this goal to serve future development. On this occasion, we agreed to cooperate with Myanmar in tourism. At the same time, we also agreed to exchange experiences in the preservation and restoration of cultural and historic relics. As far as the Myanmar side is concerned, it also showed keen interest in our country. The Myanmar government fully realizes that our country used to be a major rice importer but has now become an important rice exporter. Therefore, the Myanmar side wished to cooperate with us in agriculture and wanted us to exchange seedlings, first of all rice varieties and silkworm breeders, that we have great development potential. At the same time, it wanted to learn from our water conservancy experiences, including our hydroelectricity-generating experiences. Thus, the two sides realized that they could cooperate not only in the economic field but also in cultural and artistic activities. [Correspondent] Based on your above-mentioned remarks, is it correct to say that in the immediate and far future, the friendly and cooperative ties between Vietnam and Myanmar will develop well? [Nguyen Manh Cam] I am positive about that. Though the results I have just mentioned are only initial ones, they serve as the groundwork for both sides to further broaden bilateral relations and take practical steps to ensure effective results for the two countries. It must be said that this visit has laid the groundwork for a new developmental step in the relations between Myanmar and Vietnam. It must be said that in addition to those traditional relations, both sides need more conditions to create a new development step in bilateral relations. This is a very important move. It is certain that thanks to the aforementioned practical results, the trends of cooperation and development in the region, and particularly, the mutual understanding between the two countries, mutual trust will be further strengthened. This will serve as the basis for broadening bilateral relations in all fields. It is also certain that this factor will benefit not only the development of Vietnam and Myanmar but will also contribute greatly to the task of turning Southeast Asian into a region of peace, stability, and development. [Correspondent] I would like to ask you one last question, Mr. Minister. You have visited many countries. As far as your recent visit to Myanmar is concerned, what are your personal impressions of the capital city of Rangoon in particular and the Union of Myanmar in general? [Nguyen Manh Cam] This is my first visit to Myanmar, and it has left profound impressions on me. In my opinion, Myanmar is not a poor country but a nation with great potential. To me, what is more important here is the fact that the people of Myanmar display a high spirit of independence, sovereignty, and self-sufficiency. Based on such time-honored relics like the Shwe Dagon Pagoda that has lasted for more than 2,500 years now and on such modern facilities like the Parliament Building where every architectual pattern reflects national traits, I can say that even though many difficulties still lie ahead, the development potential of Myanmar and the creativeness of its people are by no means limited. Therefore, in the framework of world development, it is certain that Myanmar will develop at a very fast-breaking pace. I was also impressed by the fact that the government of Myanmar has succeeded in linking ancient national character with modern development. There is every reason to believe that thanks to their cretiveness and spirit of independence and self-sufficiency, the people of Myanmar will achieve a fast-breaking national development pace. [Correspondent] Thank you, Minister.
