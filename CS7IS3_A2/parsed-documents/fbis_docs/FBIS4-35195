[Abu-Middayn] The appointments that have taken place over the past 48 hours were aimed at meeting the requirements of establishing ministries capable of serving the people in the West Bank in general and in Gaza in particular. There are many outstanding issues, and there is also an administrative, legal, and constitutional vacuum in the occupied territories. Therefore, the government was formed quickly. Even the oath-taking ceremony was postponed so that it can be held on part of the Palestinian land. I believe it will take place in Jericho next month. These appointments, as you know, occurred before the arrival of financial aid. The European countries, as well as other countries, should begin to pump money. Therefore, there should be a ministerial apparatus capable of acting immediately to run daily affairs. As you know, there are crises in the areas of unemployment, financing, and supply. So, what took place was an attempt to fill the vacuum that has resulted from the withdrawal and then to keep the old administrative apparatus. But there should be officials with political weight who refer to the PLO in everything. In brief this is what took place. [Zaydani] When will the members of the Palestinian National Authority arrive in Gaza and Jericho? [Abu-Middayn] Most probably they will arrive within a week. Their return was approved, and I believe they will arrive within a week. There are many problems, and people are allowed to go to the inside [self-rule area]. I believe there is a logistical problem in Jericho, and offices are not ready. As for Gaza, there are places and offices, and it can absorb all the brothers coming from outside. [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, why has Yasir 'Arafat not so far succeeded in appointing all the members of the Palestinian National Authority? [Abu-Middayn] Consultations with some political sides are underway. Although the issue is not a geographical one, there are three or four people from the Gaza Strip to be named. Intensive consultations are underway, and I believe that the most important ministries have been named. We will give ourselves time to appoint the remaining five or six ministers from the [occupied territories]. It is more of a technical than political problem. [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, there is much criticism in Israel. You are talking about ministries and the formation of a government. There is an agreement on a self-rule in Gaza-Jericho First, but you are adopting a political program or a constitution indicating the establishment of almost an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital. [Abu-Middayn] These are future ambitions. We are talking and acting in accordance with the Cairo and Oslo accords. Every one knows this reality. But the Palestinian people have ambitions for which they have offered great sacrifices. These things that annoy Israel are merely abstract and future things. However, we are committed to every detail in these accords. The Palestinian people's future thoughts, however, should not be confiscated. There is an intention to establish a state, and there is an intention to establish a confederation with Jordan. There are many things we should think about from now on. We want to straighten matters out. The State of Israel itself has no constitution and does not recognize fixed borders. Why is Israel not criticized? The absence of a constitution in Israel is a source of fear for the Palestinian side because borders are not defined. These matters should not upset Israel, and I do not believe that Israel has fears more than necessary. [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, you are now in Tunis. Israel has warned the PLO against establishing institutions for the self-rule in East Jerusalem and conducting activities from Orient House, the Economic Planning Council, and the Palestinian Statistics Center. Is the PLO trying to create a fait accompli in East Jerusalem? [Abu-Middayn] It is Israel which is trying to impose a fait accompli. If Israel had frozen settlement in East Jerusalem, there would have been no problem with the Palestinian side. Jerusalem is a very sensitive issue, and Israel is not committed to accords on freezing settlements. There has been a pledge since President Bush's era that settlement activity would be frozen. At that time, Israel obtained a loan guarantee of $10 billion as support for Israel's economy. It is Israel which makes changes on the ground. There are 150,000 Palestinian citizens in East Jerusalem. These people have rights and the PLO has the right to think seriously about them and to keep them in the political and geographical map. Meanwhile, Israel expands. It extends Jerusalem northward, eastward, and southward. Israel should commit itself. If Israel had announced halting or freezing settlements, there would not have been all this trouble. Rather, this is self-defense than provoking the Israeli side. [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, justice minister in the Palestinian National Authority. Thank you very much. [Abu-Middayn] You are welcome.
