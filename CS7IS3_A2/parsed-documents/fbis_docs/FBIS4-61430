After a band had played marches and welcoming speeches had been delivered the first diesel ship, the Dobrynya Nikitich, set off for Astrakhan with fleet veterans on board. Specialists predict that this year's navigation will be difficult: Inflation is growing and the number of those who want to sail along the Volga is declining. To make ends meet the sailors intend as before to rent out some of the ships as floating hotels. Will this affect livestock raising? Most probably not. If only because the livestock population in Russia has been reduced by approximately 25 percent and in some places by even 30 percent. This year there is no need to be worried about seed. There is plenty, and in some places there is even a surplus. This is largely explained by the high cost of seed -- many farms and private farmers simply cannot afford them which, of course, will also entail a reduction in sown areas. As a whole there is no problem with fuel and lubricants either, although in individual oblasts, for instance Novosibirsk Oblast, drivers are refueling direct from the tanker trucks. And that is impermissible. It cannot be said that the farms and private farmers have money to carry out the spring field work. Although credits for April were issued in full, in the opinion of the Ministry of Agriculture they are blatantly inadequate. So the question of the issue of May credits is on the agenda.
