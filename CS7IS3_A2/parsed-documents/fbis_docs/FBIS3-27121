Xinjiang's 1993 GNP is expected to increase about 10 percent over that of 1992, and revenue income from various localities will rise 33.1 percent over that of 1992. Relatively sizable increases have been registered in total industrial and agricultural output, total foreign trade value, influx of foreign funds, and total investment in fixed assets. Rural reform has enormously raised the productivity in agricultural and pastoral areas. Xinjiang has registered another bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry for the 16th consecutive year in 1993. Total grain and cotton output are expected to reach 7 million and 700,000 tonnes respectively. The agricultural sector has begun to rapidly gear toward the market economy. Farming endeavors and the industrial sector have undergone relatively extensive restructuring. Productive and efficient agricultural projects yielding high-quality products have begun to appear in Xinjiang. The continued implementation of Xinjiang's policy on opening up its border areas has enabled Xinjiang to open wider to the outside world. In 1993, Xinjiang's total foreign trade value was $910 million, increase 30.6 percent over that of 1992. The value of foreign trade transacted by Xinjiang's border areas amounted to $580 million or 63.6 percent of Xinjiang's total foreign trade value, up 82 percent over that of 1992. Xinjiang's most outstanding achievement has been the development of its natural resources. Surveying and exploration for oil and gas in Junggar, Tarim, and Turpan-Hami Basin have reported a series of major breakthroughs. Xinjiang's crude oil output has surpassed 10 million tonnes for the first time in 1993, and its capacity to process crude oil has reached 7.65 million tonnes. The results of exploring for nonferrous metals have been remarkable, and exploration for natural resources has also yielded a series of encouraging accomplishments. Exploration and development of underground resources have reached large-scale and advanced levels. Xinjiang's comprehensive economic progress has brought more and more benefits to the people of various nationalities. In 1993, Xinjiang's peasants and herdsmen per capita annual income was 780 yuan, increase 5.4 percent over that of 1992. Urban residents' income also rose relatively noticeably.
