(No. 40 decided by the standing committee of the Supreme People's Assembly) North Korea seemed to use China as a model in making laws for international economic openness, for example, by adopting in 1984 the `joint management law.' This is patterned after the Chinese `sino-foreign joint management law'. They also enacted a `land lease law' by copying the Chinese `temporary ordinance on the conveyance and reconveyance of the right to use government-owned land in cities.' (19 May 1990) That North Korea highly praised this land lease law, announced through the government-owned Korean Central News Agency on 4 November as an `epochal' event, is seen as promoting foreign investment by advertising economic openness. This allows foreign businessmen to lease land even though North Korea (government) does not allow its people to do so and by advertising the alignment of statutes to support the law. This intention can be also seen in that this law was announced just before the second workshop on the industrial natural resource field for the Tumen River Area Development Project to be held in Seoul. (November 8-10) This law prescribes the scope of application (Article 2), to corporations and individuals of `foreign countries' and also includes fellow Koreans who reside `outside the territory of the Republic' in a separate section. This prescription that may cause disputes on how to interpret the law in relation to South Korean corporations and businessmen, and it attracts attention on how North Korea would interpret the laws. The Conveyance and Collateral of Land Utilization Right Land use rights obtained by lease contracts are prescribed as `property rights' and could be conveyed (by sale, sublease, gift, or inheritance) or could be collateral as long as the lease is effective. (Articles 15-27) The law appears to be decided from consideration for fast turnover and transactions of property rights, but the `sale' of use rights is an unfamiliar concept under a democratic legal system. In the sale of use rights, it seems to be difficult to convey them because the law recognizes the preferential purchasing rights (Article 19) of the `leasing institute, disallowing the lessee to transfer freely the utilization right, and makes the change of the business type impossible by requiring that the right be used under the same initial purpose. In the meantime, two different opinions were proposed on the possibility of applying this law to South Korean corporations (and businessmen). One suggests the fact that this law prescribed `fellow Koreans who reside outside the Republic territory' as within the scope of application means that North Korea intends to include South Korean corporations. This opinion is based on the fact that this law has a different scope of application from the `Joint Management Law' (1984). `The Joint Management Law' is limited to `fellow Koreans who reside outside the Korean peninsula' including businessmen in Japan, and clearly excludes South Korean industries. This interpretation is also based upon the theory that South Korean businessmen are included in `fellow Koreans who reside outside the Republic territory' by pointing out that North Korea recognized the range of its sovereignty to the north of the truce line in the seventh Japanese-North Korea amity meeting. (December 1991) The other opinion stems from the fact that `the territory of the Republic' means the entire Korean peninsula because North Korea has insisted on the `One Korea' policy until now. Accordingly, South Korean industries (and businessmen) are excluded from the scope of `fellow Koreans who reside outside the territory.' China had enacted `a regulation that promotes fellow Taiwanese investment (in China)' and had made clear that fellow Taiwanese can be partners in joint management. Some North Korean officials, including Vice Premier Kim Tal-hyon, hoped several times that South Korean industries would invest in North Korea, and it was reported that Hwang Chong-nam (chief of the External Economic Cooperation Promotion Committee), who participated in the UNDP Industry workshop, said that he hoped South Korean industries would participate in the construction of industrial complexes and direct investment in the free economic and trade zone. It seems to be desperate countermeasure tactics that North Korea has prescribed `the fellow Koreans who reside out of the Republic territory' in the law to leave open the possibility that the law's applicability could be extended to South Korean economic corporations while it takes the `one Korea' policy in politics. In the Japanese-North Korea amity meeting, the representative from North Korea still kept the `one Korea' policy not only by suggesting the assumption of the `one Korea' theory, even though he recognized the territory of North Korea to the `north of the truce line,' but also by separating the South Korean government authority from businessmen. North Korea needs to make a prompt decision to withdraw the `one Korea' policy as soon as possible in that the advance of South Korean businessmen to North Korea can not be accomplished smoothly in relation to the legal investment environment--such as the `land lease law'--if North Korea keeps this kind of dual stand.
