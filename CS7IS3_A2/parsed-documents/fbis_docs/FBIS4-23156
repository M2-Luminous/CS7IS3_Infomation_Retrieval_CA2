But SA [South African] Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo says membership is part of South Africa's strategy to end its international isolation. Speaking in Cairo on the eve of a four-day NAM conference, Mr Nzo said international networking was critical for the success of his government's internal development policy: "The contact we have trade-wise and economic-wise with various countries of the world is bound to assist our process (of restructuring)." According to Mr Nzo, South Africa is expecting to be accepted as an NAM member on Tuesday. He said that joining the 108-member organisation was also a "natural development", since the movement had supported the anti-apartheid struggle and had given SA "liberation movements" observer status. Mr Nzo is attending the summit in Cairo at a critical moment in the movement's history. The NAM was created in the 1960's to help developing nations assert their independence from the United states and Soviet superpowers. Now that the Cold War is over it is trying to recast itself as a pressure group fighting for third world interests. The future of the movement is one of the items members are scheduled to discuss this week. They are expected to advocate focussing on "more of an economic role". South Africa has also just been accepted into the Organisation of African Unity and Mr Nzo said it hoped to join the United Nations in the coming months. The end of isolation means South Africa will be expected to get involved in efforts to contain regional conflicts, like that in Rwanda. Mr Nzo said that for now however his government would stick to humanitarian aid while it got its own military house in order. "We are engaged in the process of rebuilding a new army in our country...and we can't therefore be expected before that process is completed, to let our soldiers march (in peacekeeping operations)." The Cold War superpowers, particularly the US, have traditionally barred NAM countries from developing nuclear weapons. Mr Nzo said South Africa would not use its nuclear capacity to equalise the imbalance in the nuclear equation but would "certainly participate in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy".
