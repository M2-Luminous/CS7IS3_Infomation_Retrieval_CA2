FBIS4-54292 "dreas103__a94025" FBIS-EAS-94-103-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Japan NEC Hikes Semiconductor Sales in Southeast Asia NEC Hikes Semiconductor Sales in Southeast Asia 942A0226A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 May 94 p 8--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0226A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] NEC will boost the sales amount of semiconductors for fiscal 1994 in Southeast Asia to 110 billion yen, a 22 percent increase over the previous year. It is to deal aggressively with rapidly increasing demand due to the production shift by home electronics manufacturers and others, and in addition to expanding the production volume of their Singapore and Malaysian subsidiaries, they will also increase exports from Japan. With the high yen in the background, semiconductor costs are ballooning in the Southeast Asian market, but it seems that domestic manufacturers are intensifying a battle for market share, with the same area as the stage, due to the largest manufacturer NEC working out measures to strengthen sales. Along with this sales plan, the company will boost monthly production in Singapore for 4-megabyte DRAM [dynamic random-access memory] (dynamic read and write memory necessary for memory storage operations) and microcomputer ASIC (application-specific integrated circuits) from 78 million in the previous fiscal year to 80 million units. Moreover, they also will expand monthly production for transistors that are being produced in Malaysia from 2.52 billion in the previous fiscal year to 2.82 billion units in fiscal year 1994. In either case, they anticipate use for equipment for the general public produced by home electronics manufacturers, etc., in Southeast Asia. However, they will handle it by improving the yield rate at both plants, and the policy is not to carry out new facilities investment. NEC is undertaking provision of a semiconductor business system in Southeast Asia such as establishment of a sales company in Singapore.
