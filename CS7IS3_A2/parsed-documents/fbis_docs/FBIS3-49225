Are you going to vote against the bill that has been submitted in the Sejm? If you are, why? [Bugaj] We have not discussed this yet; however, I believe that we really could not support such a budget. After the prime minister's statement, I said that we would try to work on the budget, to look for a formula that would be acceptable. The version that we received includes some insignificant changes, but they do not correspond to the possibilities offered by the state's finances. If we believe these estimates, then, for the first time, the drop in the budget's revenues is supposed to be curbed; it is a certain effort to increase those revenues. The only thing is, it is a pity that it is supposed to be done at the cost of middle-class taxpayers. This could have been done differently. We have three kinds of urgent needs: social expenditures (Minister Leszek Miller speaks about minimum amounts of money that he needs--for example, for social care, which is quite a lot); considerable aid for the restructuring of industry (the budget earmarks proverbial peanuts for that), and the Army because the international situation is quite complex. If we realize what a dramatic situation is caused by these shortages, we should look for the money, even if we were to take controversial measures. [Lipszyc] If I understood you correctly, you believe that we need several dozen trillion zlotys [Z] more. [Bugaj] I suppose that it is a sum in the area of Z30-50 trillion. [Lipszyc] How can the budget receive additional money, and why did neither this government nor its predecessors take advantage of such a possibility? [Bugaj] I cannot really answer the second part of that question. I think we could have greater revenues from excise taxes; they could yield even more than a dozen trillion zlotys. [Lipszyc] Some people are surprised that the government predicts fuel price raises that are supposed to be lower than the inflation level. I gather that you are equally surprised. [Bugaj] I certainly am. The excise also comprises some luxury goods; however, what we must bear in mind is the demand barrier. Nevertheless, in my opinion, we are separated from this barrier by a few trillion zlotys that could be collected. There will be no revolution because of higher vodka and cigarette prices. Another issue is the maximum VAT [value-added tax] rate. It is quite high, but not the highest. The previous government proposed that VAT rates on energy carriers be raised.... [Lipszyc] And it was rejected by the opposition, including UP. [Bugaj] And rightly so. What we could consider, however, is the idea of raising the average rate by one point, or even a little less. This would not threaten to fuel inflation; it would charge everyone just a little in this difficult situation. Now, the third issue: We could take some money from well-off citizens for future privatization. It would be some kind of a privatization loan. As a result of this, people would buy fewer imported luxury goods because such an operation would take some of their money away from them. Another thing that could be done is introducing a small Treasury fee for crossing the border. It would have to be small enough--for example, Z100,000. It could not greatly affect the costs of those who cross the border once a year; however, it would have to be quite a sum for those who cross the border many times, doing things that are not really favorable to Poland. [Lipszyc] Why, then, did neither the previous authorities nor the present ones reach for those revenues, even though they differ from each other so much? [Bugaj] I think I am close to the banal conclusion that all of the budgets of the past four years were prepared by Minister Misiag; therefore, what is confined by his imagination also determines the imagination of the government. I have said enough about revenues. Now let us talk about the size of the deficit. There is one argument of the opponents of a big deficit, and it cannot be underestimated: the problem of the increasing domestic debt. However, to an insignificant extent, we could afford to do what Leszek Balcerowicz did in 1991--that is, to monetize the deficit, certainly on a much smaller scale. [Lipszyc] This means the Central Bank printing money. What about the danger of increasing inflation? [Bugaj] In 1991, the budget deficit increased, whereas inflation decreased. Those who speak about a close correlation between inflation and the deficit in the Polish circumstances must be hard pressed to explain it when they compare these data. This is not such a simple interdependence. We can afford to slacken financial policy a little bit, keeping our foot on the brake pedal. This is the last moment because there is still a chance to start a simple production increase. It is the last moment because the wealth of enterprises is undergoing decapitalization, and, in two or three years' time, money will have to be invested to increase production. [Lipszyc] Can the budget, as proposed by the government, be implemented at all? [Bugaj] I do not feel up to answering this question right now. I warned that last year's budget was underestimated as far as revenues were concerned, and I was right. However, I said that after I checked various data and after some things were explained to me by the finance minister. Now I have some doubts. However, I must find out more about it. For example, what is the chance that investment facilitations will result in a considerable increase in investments, which quasi-popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] measures the government wants to introduce. The materials we received take up more than 500 pages; however, the key issues are described only in general terms. For example, what is the government's concept, what is the calculation of the global demand for domestic products? [Lipszyc] What is this budget like, then? Is it once again the result of compromises and pulling a small blanket in all directions? [Bugaj] It was prepared not as a result of adopting some kind of an economic policy; it is the result of the demands of the various ministries, which have their needs and fixed expenditures, as well as the result of the efforts of the finance minister, who warded off any attempt to increase expenditures. The most horrible addition to the budget is the annex on privatization. I have not seen such a nuisance for quite a long time. There is nothing there that can serve as a good argument. Thus, the budget bill is the result of the lack of a broader concept; it is the effect of looking only at tomorrow, without trying to show what may happen until the end of the year. [Lipszyc] UP would like to make solid changes in the bill in the Sejm. Is this possible? [Bugaj] We will propose that individual problems be discussed. If the government agrees, we will be able to do some real work. If it turns out that there is no chance to make any substantial corrections, we should vote against the budget. Let it be the budget of the government and that is that. [Lipszyc] Can the coalition fall apart because of the budget? [Bugaj] I do not think so. The coalition realizes that the self-government elections will be held in the spring. Now, the tactics of the deputies of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement lies in the following: Make a lot of noise, but back out at the most important moment. I would like the coalition to crack: If it gets rid of the liberal wing, it will offer a possibility of carrying out a little different policy and of introducing more radical changes. Then we could support the coalition more strongly, which we cannot do now. However, the time for that has not yet come. It must turn out first that the optimism concerning the economic prospects within the policy of continuation is not really justified.
