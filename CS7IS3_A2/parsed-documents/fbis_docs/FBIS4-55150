Surjan could imagine voters either becoming discouraged by the second round or realising they still have some political leverage. For this reason, the KDNP gives priority to mobilising voters and making them aware of their responsibility, he said. KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga told MTI that the Christian Democrats have not yet coordinated second-round cooperation with any party. On Tuesday, they held an informal consultation with Hungarian Democratic Forum leaders. Varga added that the KDNP Executive Committee would decide tomorrow under which terms the party would be prepared to make an electoral deal for the second round.
