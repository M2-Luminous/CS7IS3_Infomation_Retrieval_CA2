We asked Agrarian Federation Chairman Tamas Nagy about his party's image, its relations with the liberal parties, and how this party would treat the crisis of the Hungarian villages and agriculture if it became a force in government. [Nagy] The past three or four years have been characterized by an unpredictable and often ill-considered amount of economic ideas. Only 18 percent of the world's land can be used for agricultural production, and good results can only be achieved on 9 percent of that. About 72 percent of Hungary's land belongs to this 9 percent. We have trained professionals. It is important to have a five-year agricultural-orientation plan and to make sure that government activity is a service activity. The accelerated compensation process should mean that the lands have been allocated and their transcription into the land registry is carried out. This is one of the major messages of the Agrarian Federation. [Csuhaj] You have been calling yourself a bourgeois agrarian party lately. What does this mean? [Nagy] It is important not to mystify the concept of burgher. We do not say that if one wants to be a burgher, one should leave his village and his profession; instead, we say that the village should participate in everyday life at a higher level. The middle-peasant class was already building bathrooms in their houses before the war, although there was not yet water in them; they were preparing, however, a more comfortable life for the next generation. In Germany, the word "peasant" means builder. In Hungary, this word has a different meaning, and we should break with this meaning! The first step is to have a political interest representation. In 1947, the Smallholders' Party received a historic opportunity, and this opportunity is here again today. Therefore, the Agrarian Federation does not want to represent a village elite. Our goal is to build a party between 1994-1998, a party that represents this concept, because a greater percentage of Hungarian citizens are connected to this concept. [Csuhaj] Your party succeeded in presenting 20 territorial lists and 134 candidates. Have your support and position in the liberal bloc changed as a result? [Nagy] The Agrarian Federation has increased in value. According to the opinion polls, 40 percent of our supporters voted for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] in 1990, and almost 17 percent voted for the Smallholders' Party. We have a good chance of making it into Parliament. We are working now on making sure that the program of the liberal parties becomes known to the public during the campaign. [Csuhaj] In addition to the well-known liberal parties, can you also think of other parties as potential partners? Such signals have emerged, partly about the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], and partly about the MDF. [Nagy] The MSZP alone can muster considerable power, but the liberal bloc together is stronger than the MSZP, and is stronger than the MDF and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] together. Until the second round of the elections, the question is not who will ally with whom if we separate. We are still far from coalition talks. Four parties have agreed to work together to succeed in the elections. [Csuhaj] Your party also calls itself a pragmatic program party and an ideology-free party within the liberal bloc, although the village people whom it mainly represents are mostly conservative. [Nagy] It is quite easy to understand the image of the Agrarian Federation. We think that our effort for a change in the economic system is the main guideline of our program. We stress that the Agrarian Federation is a fresh force in politics; it was created by experts engaged in politics. There are five [number as published] issues to which we pay particular attention: villages, backward areas, agriculture, tourism, environmental protection, and intellectual resources. These are five breakthrough points that give our party a clear image. Ours is a party that does not argue and does not make a clamor; instead, it is engaged in real things.
