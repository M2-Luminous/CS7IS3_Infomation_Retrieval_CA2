You have found your submissive Army too small for us. Americans, you fear that someday we could be furious, that we could defeat your Army, and then (?take another direction). You are afraid, are you not? You have seen what we can do when we are furious. But let me tell you, Americans: Neither your shitty Army nor your farting FRAPH will be able to catch us and they will not (?try to) catch us because our roots are deeply embedded in the soil. (?Our misery has reached its limit; we have reached the deadline). If nothing is done, we will act as did Dessalines, we will act as did Dessalines, we will act as did Dessalines.
