This is the proposal made by PRI [Italian Republican Party] Secretary Giorgio La Malfa to AD [Democratic Alliance], PSI [Italian Socialist Party], and Marco Segni's Pact for Italy yesterday. In a letter addressed to Ferdinando Adornato (AD), Ottaviano Del Turco (PSI), Guiliano Amato, Segni, and Vsalerio Zanone (Pact), La Malfa maintains that these forces "already have widely common program positions on foreign policy and Europe in particular" and that in the economic area "there is a similarity of positions that could be called the third road between unrestrained free enterprise and the nostalgia of state intervention in every part of national life." La Malfa is requesting a decision by the end of the week, given the very limited time available ("the symbols must be presented on 24 April and the lists the first week of May") and is therefore proposing a committee of representatives from each group to define the lists of candidates and to draw up a program. Del Turco responded that, although he considers the issue presented by La Malfa as being "of great political importance" referring to "the role that the center intends to play," he refuses any possibility of "electoral short cuts of a third-force type." Del Turco affirms that the building of a third "team" will not impede the new majority in the country. The opposition, the PSI leader maintains, should be "formed around a strong center-left alliance."
