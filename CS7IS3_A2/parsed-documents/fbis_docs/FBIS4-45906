The National Health Inspection Agency yesterday halted all further use of a particular production run of hemophilia medication from the Austrian producer after having confirmed that a young hemophiliac had become infected by hepatitis C. The health authorities fear that the source originates in a blood product from that producer. Norwegian hemophiliacs have been asked to submit to testing in order to reveal any possible further source of the viral infection. "The pharmaceutical company Octopharma's faulty virus cleansing method exposes Norwegian hemophiliacs to the risk of contracting serious viral infections," Jacobsen says to AFTENPOSTEN. He criticizes Norwegian health authorities for protesting EU demands for stricter rules concerning viral cleansing of blood plasma. The case is particularly serious because Octopharma has been approved by Norwegian health authorities to produce blood products from all the Norwegian plasma extracted from the blood banks, altogether 40 tons a year. The plasma is brought to Octopharma's laboratories in Vienna to be further processed into, among other things, medication for hemophiliacs. After processing, the finished products are shipped back to the users in Norway. Director Jacobsen of No-Re-Farm, which is the representative for the foreign pharmaceutical industry in Norway, maintains that Octopharma's virus cleansing method is far from satisfactory. He points out that most other competitors employ a double cleansing method that kills all types of viruses. Jacobsen refers to a report from the EU Commission, in which it was revealed that as many as 84 cases of hepatitis A have been found among hemophiliacs in Italy, Germany, Ireland, and Belgium in connection with the use of hemophilia medication from the same Austrian pharmaceutical producer in 1992 and 1993. The drug manufacturer was criticized in the report for having weak procedures for the so-called virus inactivation process. The drug that the EU Commission has brought into focus is the same one that the National Health Inspection Agency has now halted in Norway. Erik Juel, the leader of the Health Director's advisory council for transfusion matters, takes the news of the hepatitis C infection very seriously, thinking this might be a reason to reevaluate Octopharma's virus cleansing method if it turns out that the hemophilia medication is the source of the infection. Juel, however, stresses the fact that this has not yet been established. "Tests of this particular hemophilia medication will not be ready for another week," departmental director Anne Marie Horn of the National Health Inspection Agency informs us. The report that Jacobsen refers to about the 84 cases of hepatitis A infection, is, among other things, the reason why an internal council for transfusion matters in the EU has proposed ordering double virus cleansing of plasma that will be marketed in the EU. Norwegian health authorities have categorically rejected the proposal and have asked for an exception for plasma products produced from Norwegian blood. The National Health Inspection Agency maintains that Norwegian blood is so clean and subjected to such strict control procedures that double virus cleansing is unnecessary and will drive up prices. The health director's advisory council for transfusion matters says that the extra cleansing step will result in a 25-percent loss of plasma volume and that Norwegian self-sufficiency of plasma products might be endangered.
