Qiao made these remarks when he met with Flavio Cotti, Federal Councillor and head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. Both sides exchanged their views on international and regional issues. Qiao said Switzerland was one of the first Western countries to establish diplomatic ties with China. Since then, the two countries have enjoyed a good relationship. He also said Switzerland pursues a policy of neutrality and non- interference in other countries' internal affairs which he said is similar to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that China pursues. Bilateral ties have been based on a solid foundation, he added. Qiao noted that since China implemented reform and opening to the outside world, the relations between the two countries have been further boosted. "China has a big potential market, so it's possible for the two countries to further their economic and technological cooperation, which is beneficial to both sides," he said. Extending his warm welcome to Qiao who is paying his first visit to Switzerland as the NPC chairman, Cotti said Qiao's visit will help promote the frequent and close dialogues between the two countries. Cotti said he was satisfied with the growth of bilateral ties, adding that in the economic field, the two countries have made achievements which attracted wide attention. "Switzerland is deeply impressed by China's rapid economic growth and the progress of its economic construction," he said. Cotti also noted that many Swiss enterprises have invested in China and said that they will surely play a useful role in China's economic construction. He expressed his hope for increasing the number of such enterprises while continuing to maintain the quality of cooperative projects. He said Switzerland and China also share a very good relationship in culture. China's time-honored culture, in particular, has been a great influence on Switzerland. Besides, cooperation between the two countries in the United Nations, the UNESCO and other international organizations has been strengthening all the time, he said. Qiao arrived here from Zurich on Sunday [23 January] afternoon.
