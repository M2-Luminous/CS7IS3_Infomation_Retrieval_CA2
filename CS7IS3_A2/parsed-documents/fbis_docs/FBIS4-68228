Listed on the agenda are a draft of the Agreement on the Status, Conditions, and Procedure for the Withdrawal of the 14th Army, a number of other important issues governing the activity of troops, and social and pension coverage for military personnel. The interests of Moldova, the Dniester area, and Russia are focused on the 14th Army. Moldova, acting with the republic's integrity in mind, is calling for the withdrawal of the 14th Army by the middle of this year. The reasoning here, according to Moldovan Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Ion Butnaru, is that the army's withdrawal may "accelerate the resolution of the conflict between Moldova and the Dniester area." Completely different is the view held by the leadership of the unrecognized Pridniestr Moldovan Republic, in that it expects the new leadership of the Moldovan parliament to provide not statements promising a resolution to the Dniester area conflict (something which have been given in abundance), but rather solid, document-based guarantees for reliable protection of interests of the PMR [Pridnester Moldovan Republic]. However, there are as yet no guarantees; the sole guarantee of peace and security on the left bank of the Dniester, in the opinion of the Dniester area residents, continues to be the 14th Army. And this in spite of the fact that relations between the PMR's leadership and the military authorities of the Russian Army have, for a number of reasons, suffered a noticeable decline. In all likelihood, the PMR's recent decision to appropriate and render as republic property all the weapons and property of the 14th Army is a reflection of this situation and an attempt to force Russia to play a more active role in resolving the conflict between Kishinev and Tiraspol. In response, the 14th Army's military council demanded that the "provocative" decision be rescinded, and Commander Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebed issued the order "to employ weapons, firing for effect" to repel any attacks on Russian service personnel and military installations. The RF [Russian Federation] Minister of Foreign Affairs also made a strong statement on this subject. Nonetheless, Russia still faces holding difficult talks with Kishinev, even after condemning the acts perpetrated by the Tiraspol authorities, since we are interested in extending the mandate of the 14th Army's presence on Moldovan soil, possibly as a basis of the Russian Army. This is where Kishinev must be realistic. Withdrawing the Army by the end of August and beginning of September 1994 is absolutely impossible. In addition, redeploying weapons and equipment, which are manned by local draftees and contract servicemen in the amount of 85 percent, is something which even the people of the PMR will not permit. And these realities must be deal with whether one wishes or not.
