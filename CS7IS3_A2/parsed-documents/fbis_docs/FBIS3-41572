He announced that standards for level one motorcycles with MOK [registered weight in kg] 1105 to 2535 had taken effect as of 10 August. Preparations were being made to announce the pollution standards for gasoline-powered, level two automobiles with MOK 1120 to 2535 soon. The ISI was preparing to control pollutants from diesel vehicles more strictly. The pollution standards for small, level one diesel vehicles had been set already. Mr. Chen said that these safety standards covered amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen allowed for diesel vehicles with not more than nine seats, diesel trucks with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3,500 kg, and passenger vehicles made from trucks with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3,500 kg with no limit set on the number of seats. In any case before this was given the stamp of an official decree so that it could be announced as the standard of the ISI, an opportunity would be given for manufacturers and others involved who wished to object to present objections together with the reasons to the ISI on or before 7 October. The following table shows the quantity of carbon monoxide, the quantity of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, and the quantity of oxides of nitrogen from the engine of a vehicle with six seats or less and with a gross vehicle weight of 2,500 kg or less. This is for the certification test. Units are in grams per test.
