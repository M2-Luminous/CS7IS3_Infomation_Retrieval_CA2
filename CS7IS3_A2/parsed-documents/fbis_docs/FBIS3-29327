Even if Japanese corporate policies place greater emphasis on the shareholder, substantial leeway will still exist to utilize main bank systems which represent long-term stakeholders in concurrently preserving heteronomous management and growth potential. Control by Owners and Control by Managers Management styles of Japanese corporations that embrace management from a "long-term perspective" are often compared with U.S. corporate management which reflects management from a "short-term perspective." Management based on the "long-term perspective" may sacrifice short-term profits, but assumes a posture whereby it strives to secure greater future profits with a tendency to place emphasis on market share and revenues. In contrast, management based on the "short-term perspective" embraces as its foremost objective revenues, profits, and appreciation of stock prices and has a tendency to emphasize clear-cut numerical values reflected in investments versus their effects through such actions as capital investments and product development, rather than on the education and training of personnel or organizations and systems. A basic principle of the stock company system is that it is managed by the owners; i.e., "the corporation is owned by the shareholders." Needless to say, as the economy progresses in sophistication and complexity and the stock company grows in scale, it becomes difficult for the shareholders to actually engage in the direct management of operations and a division between ownership and management evolves, but as long as shareholders retain the final authority to hire and fire managers, control by the owners can be considered as being maintained. U.S. corporations can be considered as reflecting classical corporate formats which strongly characterize owner management of this style. Generally speaking, chief operating officers of U.S. corporations themselves seldom own stock in the firm they represent and serve as pure agents, but because the stock price serves as a basis of determining their performance bonus, there is a strong tendency for them to pursue the interests (stock prices) of shareholders. This is why U.S. corporations tend to opt for management from a "short-term perspective." By contrast, in Japan, a manager-controlled format has evolved in which managers have taken control of corporations. In other words, major shareholders representing cross-shareholding among corporations do not concern themselves directly with management or operating results and managers entrusted with decisionmaking authority have in effect established substantive autonomy from owners. Banks Which Regulate Corporations The question arises how did Japanese corporations maintain management effectiveness under the manager-controlled format. Stated in another way, shareholders maintained surveillance to ensure that U.S. corporate management did not become inefficient, but the question is what heteronomous factors other than the managers' self-regulating factors functioned in the case of Japanese corporations? In Japan, a major role has been played in regulating corporate management by "creditors" instead of "owners" of corporations, especially financial institutions or main banks. This condition is rooted in the fact that the economy in postwar Japan was basically faced with a capital deficit and corporations were heavily dependent on external debt. Capital deficits meant that corporate investment plans were subject to severe budgetary restrictions and credit examinations of financial institutions serving as main sources of capital or their representative main banks functioned to preserve corporate management efficiency. However, as economy shifted from high-growth to stabilized-growth stages, Japanese corporations were emancipated from severe budgetary restrictions and, additionally, the proportion of indirect financing for capital procurement declined. A survey of major corporations with capitalization in excess of 1 billion yen covering the composition of capital raised in five-year segments beginning in fiscal year 1970 shows that in the fiscal year 1970-1975 period, 79.6 percent of capital raised consisted of loans from financial institutions; but that in fiscal years 1985 to 1990, capital raised directly from financial markets consisted of 55.9 percent of capital procured; and that loans from financial institutions had dropped to 44.1 percent. Changes in financial transactions of this nature have led to a potential decline in the heteronomous function of main banks over corporate management. Recently, significant operating difficulties and incidence of scandals have directed attention to corporate policies in terms of the lack of a surveillance function over management control and protection of shareholder rights, but it is believed such problems are rooted in a major way in changes in corporate financing. Environmental changes have rendered it difficult to seek heteronomous effects on corporate management solely from the main bank sector. Abuses Emanating From Short-Term Ownership If consideration is given to the trend toward greater reliance on a shift from indirect to direct financing known accompanied by excessive emphasis of market value of common stock and reinforcement of shareholder rights as seen in the revision of shareholder class action procedures, it can be said that the potential has risen for Japanese corporations to change to the classic U.S. corporate format of control by owners. However, on the other hand, the classic U.S. corporate format is plagued with a major problem amidst excessive emphasis of market value of common stock. Because operations of U.S. financial institutions traditionally place major emphasis on commercial financing, they have a strong tendency to raise funds primarily for large corporations directly from capital markets. As an example, a look at the procurement method for long-term capital of major corporations with capitalization in excess of $1 billion shows that 86.9 percent of such funds are obtained through the issuance of corporate bonds and additional stock, while loans from financial institutions are a mere 13.1 percent. Further, even in the area of short-term capital, commercial paper balances grew rapidly since the 1980's and as of the end of May 1993, commercial paper market balances stood at $541.7 billion, a figure that almost equalled the $592.5 billion balance for commercial and industrial loans. Because major corporations in the United States raise most of their capital needs directly from financial markets in this manner, heteronomous corporate management influences have been exercised by the shareholder. Shareholders investing capital are logical, important stakeholders exercising an interest in corporations and are unmistakable candidates to serve as corporate managers. However, in recent years, investment trusts and annuity funds have grown in stature and we must focus on the gains in prominence of institutions in securities markets. Institutional investors are short-term stakeholders who trade in stocks based on movements in stock prices. If complete reliance is placed on such short-term stakeholders for management of corporations, managers cannot help but devote themselves to very short-term aspects such as stock price trends and run the risk of jeopardizing corporate growth potential. It is well known that U.S. corporations are giving increasing consideration to management from a "long-term perspective" as practiced by Japanese firms. Heteronomous Function of Main Banks In contrast to the foregoing, employees and main banks can be considered as representatives of long-term stakeholders. Employees develop their careers with corporations or enhance their skills in response to the special needs of corporations, and as they increase their ties with the destiny of the corporation, they hold a major interest in the future of the corporation. Since main banks enhance the "productivity" of credit information through continuing long-term transactions with corporations and possess the incentive to accrue transaction benefits, they exercise an interest in applicable corporations from a long-term perspective. Moreover, since employees and main banks possess knowledge of corporate management and the information or know-how to render appraisals, it can be said that they are well qualified to serve as members of corporate management. I believe it is possible from the foregoing perspective to say that while Japan adopted modern capital stock company legislation, it has built a management format which in substance avoided the abuses inherent in classic corporate formats. In the case of Japanese corporations, managers are often selected from among employees, thus making it possible to position managers in consideration of employee interests, while such an approach combined with the heteronomous function of the main banks served to create a management system based on the "long-term perspective." As stated previously, excessive emphasis on the market value of common stock in the United States has given birth to distortions based on overemphasis of management from the short-term perspective and the simultaneous forfeiture of the mechanism whereby they could use bank loans as a shock absorber during shifts in management environment and corporate operations. If flexibility is diminished in corporate management systems of this nature, there is the risk that the condition will adversely affect corporate growth. The approach of establishing corporate management based on the reinforcement of shareholder rights in the management of our nation's corporations is an appropriate course in view of changes taking place in the financial environment. However, in order to enhance the growth potential of corporations, I believe it is important to exercise caution against excessive emphasis on market value of common stock, while nurturing a system which provides for the appropriate merging of heteronomous functions of owners in the form of shareholders and creditors in the form of main banks. Transaction Trends Since Collapse of Bubble However, some quarters appear to have arrived at the viewpoint that the main-bank functions of financial institutions have been paralyzed in connection with the creation of nonperforming debt accompanying the collapse of the bubble. In this respect, in this final section of this article, I would like to review recent transactions between corporations and main banks. We will first examine the shock absorber function of the main bank in relation to changes in the financial environment. We will examine changes in the share of loans issued by main banks before and after the collapse of the bubble to a total of 29 firms, including 24 firms with the highest loan balances from banks, and real estate firms with loans outstanding in excess of 300 billion yen, based on their relatively high dependence on bank loans among firms listed on stock exchanges. The 24 firms exclude three firms currently undergoing reorganization and three firms which were not listed on the stock exchanges at the end of fiscal year 1986. An industry breakdown indicates the group includes nine trading companies, seven nonbanking financial institutions, six real estate firms, six electric power companies, and one other firm. During the bubble expansion period of 1986-1989, main bank loan share rose for seven firms, 24 percent of the firms covered in the survey, while the main bank share loans declined at an overwhelming number of 20 firms, 69 percent of the firms. It is believed this situation arose from the fact that firms increased the number of marginal funding sources during the so-called excess money supply period. Subsequently, a look at the situation after the collapse of the bubble in fiscal years 1989-1991 shows that the share of loans handled by main banks rose at 12 firms, 41 percent, while the number of firms where loans dropped totaled 15, 52 percent, indicating an increase in the number of firms where main bank share of loans rose. Of special significance is that among nonbank financial institutions and real estate firms the number of firms with rising main bank loans numbered four while those with decreasing main bank loans numbered nine during the bubble expansion period, in major contrast to nine firms rising and three firms dropping after the collapse of the bubble. It is in this manner that the main banks' role has expanded during the monetary deflationary stage and has served to function as a shock absorber for corporations in a changing financial environment. Economically Logical Bank Actions Next, we will examine the shock absorber function of the main banks as it relates to corporate operating results. We will take a look at 35 firms recording deficits for the two most recent fiscal years and listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and examine how loans from main banks fluctuated during the five-year period of 1986-1991. Of those firms, the share of loans from main banks rose at 22 firms or 63 percent and the share of loans from main banks dropped at 13 firms or 37 percent, indicating that the share of main bank loans rose at two-thirds of the firms recording deficits. However, it can be said that main banks are not necessarily functioning as shock absorbers at one-third of the firms, thus indicating that certain aspects of main bank functions are difficult to judge. But, main banks extend aid to firms when they suffer from operating difficulties, because if such firms fail completely, all the data accumulated in the past on a long-term, continuous basis lose their entire value. In other words, extension of such aid is the result of judgments based on economic logic that short-term aid liabilities are outweighed by the investment value of past data collection and productivity. On the contrary, if such logic cannot be recognized, there is no guarantee that the main bank function will take effect. Actions based on the economic logic of such main banks are also important from the standpoint of corporate management. If a firm should lapse into operating difficulties and main bank aid were available on an unqualified basis, it would mean that no budgetary restrictions exist in connection with corporate investment actions and result in main banks functioning in a way to exacerbate inefficient corporate operations. It is fact that nonperforming loans have been created at financial institutions as a result of the bursting bubble and that countermeasures to be taken are a major issue for the time being, but we do not believe it is appropriate to assume the view that those conditions have caused a paralysis in main bank functions. We believe that even if Japanese corporate management concepts lean toward placing more emphasis on shareholders, there will be the potential for continuing use of main bank systems in coordinating the diversity of interests, seeking corporate growth and providing for heteronomous controls over management.
