What was it, a tribute to those who founded Russian parliamentarism at the beginning of the century? Or a reminder to yourself that the country now has the chance to storm the heights of parliamentary democracy "at the fifth attempt"?... [Rybkin] There is much argument today about parliamentarism -- what form it should take. Yet the foundations of parliamentarism existed in Russia much earlier than in many Western countries. There was Novgorod the Great, with its veche [general meeting of the townspeople]. There was the Assembly of the Land, where representatives of all estates of trouble-torn Rus elected the 16-year-old Mikhail Romanov czar. (Why the original organs of representative authority in Russia were subsequently transformed is another matter.) Finally, at the beginning of our era, a rather unwilling emperor was forced to build the institution of the Duma into the state mechanism. The empire's first State Duma lasted for two months and 10 days. The second lasted three months and 10 days. Ours -- the Russian Federation State Duma -- started work 11 January. So we have outlived the two first Russian parliaments. Although you know yourself what a wide spectrum of views is represented in the first State Duma in the history of the Russian Federation: eight factions with variously opposing views. The election of the Duma chairman was a typical example. I was elected to the post by a majority of only one vote. In the days of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet this fact would no doubt have sparked off a long debate. But the majority of deputies in the present State Duma decided not to focus attention on this, but to seek consensus. [Dorofeyev] I remember as soon as the election results were known political scientists were predicting a prolonged argy-bargy among the factions in the State Duma. But this apparently did not occur.... [Rybkin] Of course, there was a reluctance to repeat the fate of the Khasbulatov Supreme Soviet. But the main reason why the State Duma rapidly established itself lies elsewhere, in my view. In the first place, most of the people elected to it, despite all the flaws in the embryonic multiparty system, are sincere and passionate about the country's future. Second, the professional standard of most of the deputies is high. Many have experience of practical work in senior posts in the regions and in central departments in postcommunist Russia. Finally, a part was played by the recognition by the majority of deputies of an apparently simple truth: The country is tired of confrontation between the authorities, of the constant talk. Look what an interesting situation has developed. International affairs committees were the most "popular" among deputies in all supreme soviets. But the most authoritative committee in the present State Duma is the Committee on the Budget, Finance, Banking, and Taxes, headed by M. Zadornov, from the "Yabloko" bloc. Well, in all civilized countries it is the budget that is the focus of parliamentarians' attention, the foundation of their activities. The second example is the Committee on the Economy, headed by Sergey Glazyev. It, in conjunction with government experts, has the job of devising a program to extricate the country from the crisis.... [Dorofeyev] But society is up to here with anticrisis programs, just as it is with advertisements for Snickers. Academician Abalkin's program, the "500 Days" program, Gaydar's monetarist program. They were all adopted as a "basis" for work, but for political reasons they resembled a very powerful truck with an empty tank. No legislative base was created for any of the programs. [Rybkin] That is why the State Duma's priority program today is the urgent elaboration of a large package of laws. I would divide them into two groups. The first is based on the Civil and Land Codes. It is essentially with their help that the law will consolidate the radical changes currently taking place in our country with regard to property. The second group of laws bears directly on the economy. But here the task is more complex. Because, in my view, this group of laws should not merely reinforce the current progress of economic reform, albeit slow -- but work to accelerate it. This will take more time and closer collaboration with the presidential and government structures. Not confrontation, as in the recent past, but very close collaboration. I foresee a question concerning the events of last October in Moscow and my attitude toward them, since I was a member of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and was in the "White House" during what were tragic days for Russia. Seven months on, now that emotions have abated, giving way to a ruthless analysis of the situation and of oneself, I believe that what happened in Moscow on 3-4 October was a general defeat for the authorities, both executive and representative. So I take a dim view of those who have not calmed down, who are trying to exploit human tragedies, crisis phenomena in the economy, the inability of the authorities.... I want to stress once again that the president and government are pretty happy at the moment with the State Duma's work on the blocks of laws. And the first part of Petr Stolypin's celebrated utterance, addressed, incidentally, to the deputies of the second State Duma: "You need great upheavals..." I believe is now part of the past, God willing, as far as Russian reality is concerned. [Dorofeyev] And the second part: "...We need a Great Russia"? How realistic is it in the foreseeable future? [Rybkin] Stolypin's words about Great Russia came back to me on several occasions during the State Duma delegation's visit to the United States. Particularly after a frank discussion with Vice President A. Gore. He told me: "I am surprised when I hear people in your country say that America is preventing Russia from advancing along the path to a democratic society, to economic reform. On the contrary, we want Russia to become a rich and, most of all, stable country. To be frank, most of your people are better educated than Americans. There is no need to mention the raw material potential. It is just that you need to understand yourselves first and foremost. Your people have talent".... [Dorofeyev] But what Mr. Gore says is an outsider's view. What about the people living in Russia and trying to overcome the problems of the transitional period. For example, those "nonpayments"? [Rybkin] In my view, this is one of the most disgraceful phenomena of the economic reform. Recently I put it to Yegor Timurovich Gaydar: If he had gone to the market in Moscow with a sack and filled it with goods from the stalls, without paying, what would people have thought of his behavior? Not paying the farmers for delivering the harvest from July through the December snows is a comparable phenomenon. I agree there should be market arrangements, but all those involved in the market, whoever they are, must be paid in accordance with their labor. This is the foundation of all the reforms. Therefore one of the State Duma's first steps was a decree on ensuring the functioning of the agro-industrial complex in 1994. We will seek to ensure its implementation at all costs, including a separate entry in the budget. [Dorofeyev] But doesn't this decree smack of outright lobbying, since the chairman himself was a prominent member of the agrarian faction before being elected to this high office? Indeed, your entire life has been connected with the countryside: Volgograd Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, mechanical engineer on a major kolkhoz in the oblast, then postgraduate work at the institute and teaching work.... [Rybkin] I have also reflected on the fact that an institution of authority like the State Duma is headed by an agrarian. Perhaps in what is a crucial period for the country, it should finally address the farmer in a real, statesmanlike way. After all, it is my firm belief that Russia is a self-sufficient country. You say "lobbying." But before the Duma adopted this decree I visited Yaroslavl, Tambov, and Voronezh Oblasts. The land is different in these regions, but the situation in the countryside is similar. Only recently many politicians were pinning great hopes on private farming. Let us give peasants land, they would say, and we will solve the country's most nagging problem -- the food problem -- at a stroke. Some 280,000 private farms were set up in Russia. Some 10 million hectares of land were distributed. But the return from private farming in terms of the aggregate social product is 1 percent so far. I would not want to blame anyone. There was no systematic, deliberate support for this on the part of the state. Why did it happen? I have repeatedly tried to give an answer to people in the government, citing the experience of the developed countries. There, whatever they were developing, whether it be "socialism with a human face" or "people's capitalism," state support for the agrarian sector was assured. Look at the experience of the 26 most developed countries of Europe. There the cost component of state support for agricultural production is up to 40 percent. In Japan it is up to 80 percent,. Why do the capitalist countries, where they know how to husband resources, do this? Well because they realize there is nothing worse than strategic food dependence. I profoundly believe this is something we must learn from them, and learn well. [Dorofeyev] But the state simply does not have the substantial funds to provide specific support for the countryside in order to avoid strategic food dependence in the immediate future, as the "budget furor" in the State Duma demonstrated. The treasury is in debt.... [Rybkin] First, the Duma "budget furor." Essentially the country has been living without a budget for three years. No budget has been presented to parliament, foreign economic activity has not been dealt with at all, and hard currency has not featured. For the first time, on 23 March, the Duma insisted that it be informed of all the budget items for this year. The budget was adopted on first reading on the old legislative basis, on the basis of the old tax normatives. But what concerns me more is the 1995 budget. By law it has to be submitted to the lower chamber eight months before the start of the fiscal year. Since the Russian economy is going through a transitional period, we are insisting that the government submit the draft budget for next year to us in September. This is essential: Through the budget we will get a sense of the government's economic program, if there is one. It is my profound belief that we will not get anywhere without making the economy controllable again. Now we come to debts and loans. We owe $90 billion. We are owed $160 billion. A number of countries is prepared to repay debts to us, large ones at that. One $1-2 billion, another $3 billion, a third $1.5 billion. They must be grabbed as quickly as possible. And the debts that will not be repaid, sell them on. At 0.6 to 0.8 of the face value. Let people collect them if they can. I can foresee your objections -- but what about political aims.... But politics is politics and economics is economics. If it is "inconvenient" for the state to press debtors, then let our private entrepreneurs deal with the problem. In two words -- no charity. This applies also to technical credits to CIS countries. It is time they and we started to live within our means. I totally agree here with the Germans: "Good accounting does not spoil friendships." [Dorofeyev] At the meetings in Volgograd you were repeatedly asked, and in a rather peremptory manner: "What are we building, then?" and "Where are we going?" You are a member of the Russian Federation Communist Party, elected to the State Duma to represent the Agrarian Party, ideologically the closest, some of my colleagues believe, to the Russian Federation Communist Party. At the same time, your career and your position in the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, and indeed your present position, indicate certain beliefs that are different from those derived from [Stalin's] "Short Course of the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." [Rybkin] Well, you were probably in the CPSU, like many current radical democrats, but you did not live in accordance with the "Short Course." All of us who are nearly 50 or more are children of the same era. A contradictory era, stained with blood, it is true, unfortunately. But I would not renounce what I have lived through as easily as many tried to do in the romantic fervor of perestroyka. Incidentally, neither would I blame Mikhail Gorbachev alone for all our ills. He did a great deal for Russia. He essentially gave impetus to the reforms. And I do not intend to renounce the military endeavors of my father and the old men of my village. The paths they trod, the enthusiasm with which they led their lives -- a difficult life, without rights, but an honest life -- are part of my life as well. I regard the decade from 1975 through 1985 as a lost decade for the country. But that is the past. And we must think about the future. What kind of national consciousness will eventually emerge from the remnants of the current morbid, wounded imperial arrogance? No state can exist without this consciousness. It is arguable what is harder: To reform the economy or to form a national consciousness. As for the answer to the question: "What are we building?" -- in this case I would prefer the Swedish model of socialism. But the "infantile disorder of leftism" will continue to be part and parcel of our mass consciousness for a very long time to come, no matter what political movement a Russian citizen relates to. Airmen have a very precise term: "the point of no return." When an aircraft has already expended a large part of its fuel it cannot return to the airfield where it took off, so all it can do is continue on its way. In my view, Russia has now passed the "point of no return" with regard to its 70-year totalitarian past. At a cost and with losses, but it is now past. There is only one way to go now -- into a civilized future worthy of its people.
