However, in addition to the positive effect of industrialization, there are also negative factors, and one of the main ones is pollution of the atmosphere and planetary climate change, evoked by disturbance of the atmosphere's gas composition and the radiant heat balance as a result of accumulation of the combustion products of fossil fuels in the atmosphere. The principal components of atmospheric pollution are oxides of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon. The toxic effects of some substances released by enterprises and forming as a result of human economic activity are described in Table 1. Power generating facilities are among the principal polluters of the atmosphere (approximately 30 percent) [2]. Power supply sources of the Belarusian Republic currently consume around 65 million tonnes of equivalent fuel per year, with around 90 percent of the fuel and energy resources being supplied from Russia. Extraction of fuel and energy resources locally in Belarus in 1985 totaled: petroleum--2.0 million tonnes, gas--0.2 billion nm[.sup]3[/], peat--4.5 million tonnes. On the other hand consumption just by power generating facilities, without regard for municipal heat supply sources not within the structure of the Belglavenergo TEO [not further identified], is shown in Table 2 [3]. As follows from Table 2, the principal fuel of power generating facilities is fuel oil--48.7 percent. Consequently components released into the atmosphere as a result of its combustion, namely ash, soot, nitric oxides, sulfur dioxides and carbon monoxide, will be the environmental pollutants associated with generation of electric power in the Belarusian Republic.

Most important are the maximum one-time and the mean daily maximum permissible concentrations (PDKs) of toxins in the atmosphere. Table 3 gives the PDKs for several atmospheric pollutants adopted in the Belarusian Republic (PDK[.sup]max o[/]--one-time, PDK[.sub]m[/]--mean daily). In order to meet the PDKs indicated in Table 3, we need to organize the fuel combustion process or provide the technology of purifying the fuel or the smoke gases. As a rule, for practical purposes the problems of purifying exhaust gases at power supply sources planned in countries of the former USSR were not addressed, and all of the attention was devoted to the fuel combustion process. However, while we can reduce toxic releases of N0[.sup]x[/] by improving the combustion process, SO[.sup]2[/] practically remains at its initial concentrations. Therefore to reduce toxic releases of SO[.sup]2[/], we need to furnish power supply sources using fossil fuel with purification systems. This of course makes the supplied electric power more expensive, but it improves the ecological situation at the locations of the power supply sources, and consequently reduces the risk of illness in the population. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

Some characteristics of these methods are given in Table 4. As follows from Table 4, the SO[.sup]2[/] removing systems considered here are approximately identical in terms of their relative indicators. However, the cathode-ray methods do not require expendable materials, and moreover, they provide for comprehensive removal of NO[.sup]x[/] and SO[.sub]2[/] [5,6]. Furnishing power supply sources using fossil fuel with systems for removing toxic gaseous exhausts makes the supplied power 40-50 percent more expensive. It should be considered, however, that in this case the amount of the fines for toxic releases decreases. Because many industrial enterprises, including those generating electric and thermal power, are unable to reduce releases below the PDV [maximum permissible release], on 11 May 1990 the Council of Ministers of the Belarusian Republic adopted Decree No 119 ``On Standards of Charges for Releases (Discharges) of Pollutants Into the Natural Environment.'' The charges were introduced with the purpose of compensating for releases at the level of the PDV, with a coefficient of 0.1 for thermal power facilities, and a charge five times greater for surpassing them, depending on the danger class of the toxic substances. Table 5 gives the danger classes for toxic substances released together with smoke gases by power supply sources using high-sulfur fuel oil as fuel, and the cost per tonne of released substance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 5.

The damages caused by toxic releases from power supply sources burning high-sulfur fuel (around 20,000) [sic] were evaluated using procedures presented in [6-8]. The calculation results are shown in Table 6. Considering that a tendency for land prices to increase is being observed, the amount of the damages will also grow. Consequently when planning and building power supply sources, we need to consider the damages inflicted both on the environment and on human health. For practical purposes the latter factor is not yet reflected in the procedural recommendations for calculating damages. Bibliography 1. Redzhinald E. Nyuell, Genri Dzh.
