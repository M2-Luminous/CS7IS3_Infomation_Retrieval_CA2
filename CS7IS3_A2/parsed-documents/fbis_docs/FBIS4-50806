First of all, China will improve the legislation for intellectual property rights as well as a legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights, said Justice Minister Xiao Yang here today. Xiao Yang made the remarks when he addressed the opening ceremony of an international symposium on intellectual property rights held in Beijing. The symposium was sponsored by the China Intellectual Property Rights Research Society, the China Copyright Research Society, and the Zhongcheng Intellectual Property Rights Protection Service Co. Ltd. National People's Congress Vice Chairman Cheng Siyuan, Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin, and others attended the meeting. Over 130 people, including relevant experts, scholars, lawyers, and representatives of prestigious companies from China, Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, the United States, and Hong Kong and Taiwan regions, attended the symposium. European and German patent bureaus, the UN Development Program, and some foreign embassies in China also sent their representatives to participate. Xiao Yang said: China is prepared to formulate laws and provisions on punishment for infringement of copyright to more effectively punish and put an end to violations of intellectual property rights. To comply with the relevant provisions contained in the "Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial Intellectual Property" and in the "Berne Convention on Protection of Literary and Artistic Works" to which China has acceded, and to improve the protection of intellectual property rights related to foreign economic relations, foreign technology, and foreign trade, China will pay close attention to formulating laws and regulations on border control over products that infringe on intellectual property rights, and will improve the customs' functions of protecting intellectual property rights and of stopping the entrance and exit of products that infringe on intellectual property rights. He said: With regard to the improvement of law enforcement, the focal point is to beef up the organs responsible for enforcing copyright law at all levels to guarantee the effective enforcement of copyright law. As regards some important cases that produce relatively great influence on the public, administrative organs responsible for enforcing laws on intellectual property rights may make joint efforts with the departments in charge of science and technology, the economy, culture, public security, and industry and commerce to investigate and deal with them. To effectively crack down on such criminal activities as infringing on intellectual property rights, people's courts in many areas have already established or are about to establish special courts for trial of intellectual property rights violations. Meanwhile, they are beefing up the organs responsible for such judicial work to ensure that various cases of intellectual property rights are justly and timely handled. As regards serious violations that constitute crimes, relevant personnel shall be investigated for their criminal responsibility to enforce law and discipline, to practically protect the legitimate rights and interests of owners of intellectual property rights, and to uphold the unity and dignity of our socialist laws and regulations. Xiao Yang said: In addition, China will vigorously strengthen supervision over and inspection of the enforcement of laws on intellectual property rights. The state will organize relevant departments to conduct joint, general inspection of the enforcement of laws on intellectual property rights by all areas and departments at irregular intervals, to focus attention on investigating some important cases of intellectual property rights infringement that produce influence on the public, and to supervise the solution of such problems as lax law enforcement or ineffective punishment for infringement of intellectual property rights that exist in some areas. Xiao Yang said: While taking the measures mentioned above, China will draw support from nongovernment sectors to improve its system of protection for intellectual property rights. Various professional associations in the spheres of science and technology, the economy, and culture; social groups specializing in intellectual property rights; and organizations offering socialized services constitute an important force for promoting the enforcement of laws on intellectual property rights and for improving the work of intellectual property rights protection. The state will encourage and support the development of these organizations, and guide them to take advantage of their own flexible mechanisms to conduct various intellectual property rights-related legal consultations and services, and to match their efforts to the needs of the society. The state will set up a number of organs that provide intellectual property rights-related legal services to assist litigants in conducting investigation of intellectual property rights violations, in collecting evidence, and in handling disputes over such violations through legal channels. Xiao Yang said: China attaches great importance to the work of protecting intellectual property rights, and is stepping up efforts to enact laws in this regard. In recent years we have adopted a series of laws on trademarks, patents, technical contracts, copyright, and unfair competition, as well as related rules for the implementation of such laws, and formulated the "Regulations on Protecting Computer Software" and "Provisions for Implementing the International Copyright Treaty." Last 2 July, the Second Meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee adopted a "Decision of the NPC Standing Committee on Punishing Offenses in Producing and Marketing Shoddy Goods" to supplement certain provisions in China's "Criminal Law." The facts show that Chinese legislation on intellectual property protection has been improved with each passing day. In addition, China has acceded to a number of international conventions on intellectual property protection. China's efforts to establish an intellectual property system and to adapt it to the international trend show that Chinese protection of intellectual property rights has initially converged with world standards. Moreover, law enforcement, on the whole, is good. Meanwhile, the minister pointed out: As the system of intellectual property protection was established in China not long ago, people's awareness of intellectual property is relatively weak. Due to the lack of sufficient understanding of the importance of rights protection, rights violations have occurred from time to time in some localities and departments. This has not only damaged the lawful rights and interests of intellectual property holders but also undermined the authority of the laws. He said: Intellectual property protection is an important part of China's policy of reform and opening up to the outside world, as well as the socialist legal system. To establish a legal system for protecting intellectual property rights is crucial for promoting the thriving of science, technology, and cultural undertakings, and for ensuring normal operation of the socialist market economy. China will continue to make unremitting efforts in this regard.
