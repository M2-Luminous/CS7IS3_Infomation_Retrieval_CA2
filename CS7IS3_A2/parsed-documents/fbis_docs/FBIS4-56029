The Sejm's National Defense Committee issued a statement yesterday, expressing its "concern over the prolonged work on the document on the fundamental problems for the defense system." It was a few months ago that Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy promised the leadership of the National Defense Ministry [MON] to hold a debate on the defense system, the first in four years. MON Head Piotr Kolodziejczyk hoped that during the debate the deputies would say exactly how much money it would be possible to earmark for the Army in the next few years. There are many indications, however, that the deputies will not hold this discussion before the summer holiday break. Tbe reason for this is the delay of a document, which the government is supposed to submit to the Sejm for discussion -- "On the Fundamental Problems of the Defense System." The government is supposed to decide in this document who should steer the Army and what the scope of his powers should be. Originally the document contained two proposals: the president, as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, steers the Army through the chief of the General Staff who is subordinate to him; the president controls the Army through the defense minister, to whom, in turn, as it is today, the chief of the General Staff is subordinate. Even though everything seems to indicate that the government will accept the second option, at the last moment the president proposed that the National Defense Committee [KOK] should be consulted on this issue. The president supports the first solution, and the composition of KOK (most of them are supporters of Lech Walesa) guarantees that he will gain definite support there. However, decisions of KOK are not final for the government. Thus, they will not influence its final choice and the session of KOK will only delay the submission of the document "On the Fundamental Problems of the Defense System" in the Sejm. This will probably defer the entire debate. It is not very likely that the president will manage to win the support of the Sejm by stalling for time. All the major parties in the Sejm are in favor of the solution that is in force today and they declare that nothing will make them change their opinions. "We really do care about democracy," says Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], asked about the possibility of backing the president's option. According to him, SLD will not change its mind, even if it counts on Aleksander Kwasniewski to be elected president soon. If the debate is eventually held, the deputies would like to define in a special resolution what issues are most important for the Army. Janusz Onyszkiewicz of the Union of Liberty suggested yesterday that the resolution include the necessity of maintaining the apolitical character of the Army and leaving the responsibility for defense affairs with the government, especially with the defense minister.
