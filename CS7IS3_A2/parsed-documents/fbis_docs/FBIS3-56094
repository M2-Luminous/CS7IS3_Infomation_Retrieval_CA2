Kalmykian President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov [Kaverin] How do you assess the parliament's lineup? [Ilyumzhinov] I think that the Russian president has gotten a mirror reflection of our society, which is actually entirely natural... after the October shooting of Russians. [Kaverin] Your attitude to the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader? [Ilyumzhinov] It is normal, despite the press' hysteria about an onslaught of the browns. I do not see that. [Kaverin] That is, you agree with his concept of a unitary and indivisible Russia, where all entities will be territorial? [Ilyumzhinov] No, we are not going to be part of anything. Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev [Kaverin] Is Tatarstan planning to take part in the next elections for the Russian parliament? [Shaymiyev] Everything will depend on whether we will be able finally to straighten out our relations with the Russian Federation. If these relations are straightened out and a treaty is signed, the elections will undoubtedly take place in Tatarstan. [Kaverin] Are you sure that this treaty will be signed? [Shaymiyev] I think that both sides are presently interested in it. [Kaverin] What is your status at this forum? [Shaymiyev] I am a guest. Ramazan Abdulatipov, Chairman of the Council of the Nationalities of the Former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet [Kaverin] According to what principle do you think factions will be formed in parliament? [Abdulatipov] According to their interests. For example, those who call for the Federation Treaty to be observed. In other words, we should join forces on substance, not according to formal characteristics. [Kaverin] What problems do you think the upper chamber may encounter in the near future? [Abdulatipov] I think these are primarily relations between the Federation components and the federal authorities. As for the substance of the federal structure, I think that the form of Federation components' joining the Federation should be retained and the rules of the game should be the same for all. So that regardless of the status of a Federation component people who live there will feel as equals. [Kaverin] Are there "hidden snags" in the parliament's work? [Abdulatipov] Control over the budget, in the first place. The current state authorities are out of control from top to bottom. [Kaverin] What are your impressions from the president's address? [Abdulatipov] He returned for yet another time to the principle of the separation of the powers of the Center and the Federation components. I think that this effectively amounts to Boris Nikolayevich's return to the Federation Treaty. I can give you an absurd example where half the seats in the Duma are held by parties that operate only in Moscow. Peasants' Party Leader Yuriy Chernichenko [Kaverin] What is the main area of the Federation Council's activity? [Chernichenko] It must discuss bills coming from the State Duma. This is why the Council itself will not be much of a problem. The most important thing for it now is to create a democratic staff, approximately 10 committees, that would make it effective. We also need to do it so as to put a deputy above the staff, not the other way around. Former Moscow City Soviet Chairman Nikolay Gonchar [Kaverin] What is your reaction to Yeltsin's speech? [Gonchar] A positive one. I liked the idea that there is no alternative to searching for accord.
