Calculated on the basis of current market prices and on the expected level of inflation, purchase prices will amount to: about 220,000 rubles [R] per one tonne of wheat; R350,000 per one tonne of sunflower; R70,000 per one tonne of sugar beet; and R200,000 per one tonne of potatoes. According to the experts' count, these prices will ensure profitability of wheat and sunflower (121 and 125 percent correspondingly). Potatoes (with profitability at 24 percent) and sugar beet (at 8 percent) are proving to be unprofitable. The document underlines that prices of agricultural produce will be determined by those who sell and buy it, and their regulation by state organs is not permitted.
