The law requires the U.S. Administration to annually identify countries maintaining trade barriers against its exports and to impose punitive tariffs if bilateral negotiations fail to remove such barriers. Juppe, calling on Kumagai at the ministry, expressed hope that retaliatory rules such as the Super 301 will be abolished in global trade after member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) sign a final accord this month on the seven-year-old Uruguay Round of talks held under its auspices. GATT has called a ministerial conference in Marrakech, Morocco, from April 12 to 15 to sign the accord. Juppe also told Kumagai that the Marrakech conference should focus on trade and the environment, the officials said.
