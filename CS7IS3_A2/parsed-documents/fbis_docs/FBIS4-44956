This can be done by exploiting the resources of each individual governorate to establish such projects without the government's contributing any funding to them. Governors should play the main role in establishing these projects because of their broad powers, moral authority in their governorates, and good relations with citizens and businessmen. One can exploit the relative advantage that each governorate has over the others. Projects can be based on utilizing the citizens of each individual governorate in addition to whatever Arab or foreign capital is obtained. The performance and success of governors should be evaluated through the number of productive and service projects each has established in his governorate, the extent to which each has realized the policy of self-sufficiency in production, service, and food security, and the elimination of unemployment for the citizens of the governorate. I would point out that the best form for these projects is that of joint stock companies that perform productive activities in the manufacturing, agricultural, and service fields. Stress should fall on small industries that need only small capital--small workshops employing a limited number of university or middle technical school graduates. To that end I formulate in the following points my concept of self-reliance in investment and development and of how governors can contribute thereby to eliminating unemployment in the coming period: 1. The governor's role is to promote projects and work to establish them through his contacts, connections, and moral and political position. He should also arrange publicity and the necessary conferences for citizens and businessmen. 2. Participation should be limited to citizens of the region and the previously mentioned agencies. The Union of Egyptian Banks should play a promotional role with foreign and joint banks and thereby support these projects. 3. It is important that the necessary economic studies be done for these projects and that suitable personnel be selected to run them. Experienced technicians in the field of production of each project should be utilized. We should completely avoid political interference in the selection of the project, its site, or its workers in a way not in harmony with its economics. The managing boards of these companies should be formed from their founders and shareholders through free elections with the knowledge of the company's general meeting. 4. The following economically and socially important considerations should be especially taken into account with regard to these projects: a. Increasing production and raising productivity so as to ensure covering the need of the domestic market for the goods produced, with any surplus to be exported, thereby bringing in foreign revenues. b. The more employment in the project is restricted to citizens of the region, the more eager these citizens will be for the project's success and the more interested they will be in participating in it; and thus the more rapid will be the region's development. 5. The shares of these companies should be listed for trading on the stock exchange. This will invigorate the securities market and make it easier to create financial liquidity for shareholders. 6. The governor's success in his region is related to the number of joint stock companies established in the region and the success of these companies. He can be evaluated objectively on this basis.
