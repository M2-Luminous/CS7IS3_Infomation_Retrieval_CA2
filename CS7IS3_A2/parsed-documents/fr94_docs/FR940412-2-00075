Take notice that on March 30, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) filed a limited application pursuant to section 4 of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717c (1988), and the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) promulgated thereunder to recover gas supply realignment costs (GSR costs) related to the period October 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993. Tennessee proposes that the filing be made effective May 1, 1994. The tariff sheets to permit recovery of such costs are as follows: Third Revised Sheet No. 22 Third Revised Sheet No. 24 Sixth Revised Sheet No. 30 First Revised Sheet No. 398A Original Sheet No. 398A.01 Tennessee states that the purpose of the filing in this docket is to set forth the GSR costs and the related rates that will be charged by Tennessee pursuant to Order No. 636 and an ``Order Rejecting Tariff Sheets,'' issued on February 28, 1994 in Docket No. RP94&hyph;127&hyph;000, 66 FERC 61,248 (1994). The GSR costs sought to be recovered include costs associated with the reformation or termination of certain supply contracts as well as pricing differentials costs associated with continuing to perform under certain gas supply contracts, including the Great Plains Associates contract. Tennessee states that copies of this tariff filing were posted in conformance with ยง154.16 of the Commission's Regulations and in conformity therewith were mailed to all affected customers of Tennessee and interested state commissions. Take further notice that in compliance with the Commission's ``Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing,'' issued on February 28, 1994 in Docket Nos. RP93&hyph;151&hyph;004 et al., 66 FERC 61,246 (1994), Tennessee has filed tariff sheets to revise its mechanism for recovering GSR costs. The tariff sheet, which Tennessee proposes be made effective March 1, 1994, is as follows: Fifth Revised Sheet No. 30 Take further notice that Tennessee filed tariff sheets to reduce its currently-effective GSR surcharge filed in Docket No. RP94&hyph;39&hyph;000.

All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
