We call on the community of peoples to make it unmistakably clear to the Belgrade regime that it cannot keep the towns and villages that it conquered with brute force, and that the state borders must not be changed. The United Nations must no longer act as a neutral mediator, it must act and carry out air strikes against those who violate the UN resolutions. The Belgrade government must know that it can no longer attack UN protected areas unpunished and fetch its heavy weapons from UN depots at will to continue the genocide somewhere else -- in Brcko probably. I appeal to Chancellor Kohl to help us. Aggression must not be rewarded. It must not be allowed that somebody who attacks a home and kills the people living there can keep the house as a reward. We call on the international community to convene a large world peace conference. Those who do not help in Bosnia-Herzegovina are putting a fuse to a powder keg that may set Europe aflame. We want our civilization to survive where laws and moral principles should prevail and not murder and violence.
