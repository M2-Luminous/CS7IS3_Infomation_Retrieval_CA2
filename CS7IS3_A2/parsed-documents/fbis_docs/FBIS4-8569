In a 26-page report on small business and private entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic, CERGE associate professor Dr. Vladimir Benacek concludes that illegal business activity operating outside the taxman's reach is helping fire the Czech economy. "Every small businessman cheats," Benacek said. "The tax burden is levied on the honest; they have no incentive to do business. Those who are more clever cheat." Benacek said the Czech economy is fueled by hidden economic forces: a "black economy" including violent crime, drug dealing, smuggling and extortion, and a "shadow economy" of entrepreneurs who hide their business activities to avoid paying taxes. He bases his conclusion on a number of mysterious anomalies in Czech economic statistics. --Empty unemployment lines. Between January 1991 and April 1992, some 450,000 workers--representing at least 6 percent of the Czech labor force--either quit their jobs in state-owned companies or left school without registering for unemployment benefits or reporting themselves as employed. "It is assumed that these people to a large extent `disappeared' into the black and shadow economies," Benacek writes. "Without doubt, this trend continued during 1993." Benacek suggests that some of these workers may have disappeared into fringe areas of the economy such as part-time and temporary labor. In addition, he says, the privatization scheme allows for more hidden employment, since company managers "have used the environment of weak ownership control to find for themselves a safe niche allowing them to exercise their own shadow entrepreneurial activities." Sources in the business community back up Benacek's assertions. Milan Mercl, project director of the management consulting firm Mercl Consulting, said that in his research he often comes across employees who conduct their own private, unregistered business on company time. In addition, some firms will transfer funds to a sister company; the transferred funds are then recorded as profit. "There's a higher profit recorded on paper and you're able to pay management more--even though it's not justified," Mercl said. --Unfilled vacancies. Benacek calculates that 30 to 60 percent of the people who have registered for unemployment since 1990 may actually be working. He bases his conclusion on the fact that some businesses are unable to fill vacancies even in areas where official unemployment figures are high. In Bohemia, for instance, officially unemployed workers outnumber job vacancies by nearly 2-1, and in Moravia by more than 7-1. If all these people are unemployed, Benacek asks, why aren't they filling the vacancies? --Undeclared commuters. At the end of 1992, some 76,000 Czechs were registered as workers who commuted abroad (to border countries such as Germany and Austria) for their jobs. Unofficial estimates, however, put that figure as high as 100,000. The Bavarian Chamber of Commerce estimates that Czech commuters can earn as much as 300 million DM per year, or $180 million, from Bavaria alone. --Hidden productivity. Between 1990 and 1993, the Czech gross domestic product (GDP) reportedly fell 26 percent. In a Western economy, a plummeting GDP would normally mean a deep depression, massive layoffs, strikes and poverty. Yet Czechs remain optimistic about their economy, unemployment is near zero in Prague and expats continue to find gainful employment. How is this possible? Benacek suggests that as much as 30 percent of the country's GDP is hidden or undeclared to avoid taxes. As proof, he notes that 15,541 of the Czech Republic's limited liability companies, which have stringent reporting procedures, generated 84 percent of the country's official GDP, while the country's 670,000 entrepreneurs contributed just 16 percent. He suggests that those figures hint at under-reporting by the entrepreneurs. --Tax evasion. In 1993, tax fraud amounted to at least 5 billion Kc from petroleum sales, 1 billion to 1.5 billion Kc from tobacco excise tax evasion, 1.3 billion Kc from evading taxes on smuggled clothing and 2 billion Kc from evading taxes on antiques and art objects smuggled abroad. Miroslav Tera, the deputy for taxes for the Ministry of Finance, refused to discuss the issue. The government is unaware of any unregistered business activity, he said, and if it was aware of it, would put a stop to it. "Why are you calling us? You should call the companies that aren't paying their taxes," Tera said. When asked about tax evasion, consultant Mercl laughed. Of course many business-people regularly cheat on their taxes, he said, because the tax rates are too high. According to Benacek, business conditions are such that it's nearly impossible for an honest entrepreneur to survive and prosper. Corporate income taxes amount to 45 percent of profits, while social and health insurance taxes total 36 percent of gross payroll. That is in addition to the money spent on corporate licenses, loans and real estate. To navigate this business minefield, entrepreneurs often have no choice but to pay bribes and pocket what they can along the way, Benacek said. The strong Czech tradition of entrepreneurship, having been stirred after 40 years of totalitarianism, allows little guilt over bucking the system. The results are mixed: Most untaxed income is poured back into the economy and stimulates further business activity, Benacek said. But at the same time, decreased government revenues mean "long-run damage" to the public goods sector. Infrastructure, education and the soon-to-be-privatized health-care system all suffer. Not everyone agrees about the size of the problem, however. David Roach, senior tax partner at Price Waterhouse, said it is "extraordinarily difficult" to assess the impact of unregistered business activity. "Yes, there's a thriving black market. But the question is how big it is," Roach said. Bribery of state employees is "not totally endemic, but is more commonplace than jurisdictions in other countries west of here." Steven Kelly, a partner at KNO Worldwide management consultants, countered that illegal business activity must be limited, because complex documentation is necessary to make any monetary transactions. But bribing government officials to speed up slow service, especially for telephone and utility installation, is "rampant," he said. "There's money that official types are getting. That's definitely going on and not being declared."
