General Principles Article 1. Examination of cases of discipline violation within the CPC is an important task of the discipline inspection organs of the CPC and is the central link for strictly enforcing party discipline. With a view to standardizing and institutionalizing the examination of cases and improving quality and efficiency in handling cases, these regulations are formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the CPC's Constitution and in conjunction with practice in examining cases. Article 2. The guiding principles for the work of examining cases are, through the enforcement of discipline and the handling of cases, safeguarding the party's constitution and other party laws and regulations, strengthening party discipline, improving the party's work style, encouraging honesty, protecting reform and opening to the outside world, promoting economic development, and ensuring the smooth implementation of the party's basic line. Article 3. Discipline inspection organs exercise their right to examine cases in accordance with the party constitution and these regulations free from interference from state organs, social organizations, and individuals. Article 4. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs must uphold the principle of seeking truth from facts, and on the basis of facts and with party discipline as the criterion, they must see to it that the facts are clear, the evidence is indisputable, the nature of the offense is accurately described, the handling is appropriate, and the procedures are complete. Article 5. In examining cases, the principle that all are equal before party discipline must be adhered to, and any party member and party organization must be examined according to these regulations if they violate party discipline. Article 6. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs shall rely on party organizations at all levels, take the mass line, and improve coordination between themselves and other relevant departments. Article 7. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs shall implement the principle of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient in order to achieve the dual purposes of maintaining strict party discipline and educating the offender as well as other party members. Article 8. In the course of examining a case, a discipline inspection organ shall effectively ensure that party members, including those who are being examined, exercise their rights bestowed on them by the party constitution. Article 9. The examination of cases shall be conducted at different levels, with each level assuming its responsibilities. Chapter II. Acceptance and Hearing of a Case and Initial Verification Article 10. Discipline inspection organs shall accept and hear the following listed cases of violation of discipline reported, filed, or discovered: (1) Violations of discipline by a member of the party committee or discipline inspection commission of the same level; (2) Violations of discipline by a party member cadre who is working in a locality or a department but is under the administration of a party committee at a higher level; (3) Violations of discipline by a party member cadre under the administration of a party committee of the same level; (4) Violations of discipline by a party organization at a lower level; (5) Cases of violations of discipline in connection with other party members and party organizations assigned by the leadership of a higher level. When necessary, discipline inspection organs may accept and hear a case of violations of discipline of a serious and typical nature involving a party member and party organization under the jurisdiction of a party committee at a lower level. Article 11. After accepting a case of discipline violation involving a party member or a party organization, a discipline inspection organ shall, in line with the circumstances, decide whether initial verification is necessary. If initial verification is necessary, it shall promptly send personnel to do the job; when necessary, it may entrust a discipline inspection organ at a lower level to obtain the initial verification. Article 12. The purpose of obtaining initial verification is to find out whether the main complaints exist and whether there is evidence for prosecuting the case. Article 13. In obtaining initial verification, the methods contained in (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (8) of Article 28 of these regulations may be adopted to collect evidence. Article 14. Personnel participating in the initial verification shall write reports about their findings upon completing the initial verification, and discipline inspection organs shall handle relevant cases according to the situation: (1) Where an issue has not been truthfully reflected, the unit and party organization to which the person involved belongs shall be briefed about the situation, and when necessary, the person involved will also be briefed and to a certain extent, given explanations to clarify things; (2) Where facts point to a violation of discipline of a less serious nature which does not require an investigation to affix responsibility for party discipline, suggestions shall be made to the relevant party organizations to handle the case properly; and (3) Where facts actually point to a violation of discipline which then requires an investigation to affix responsibility for party discipline, the case shall be placed on file for investigation and prosecution. Article 15. The time limit for conducting an initial verification is two months, and this can be extended another month if necessary. If initial verification cannot be completed within the extended period due to the seriousness and complexity of the case, the time limit can be suitably extended again upon approval. Chapter III. Placing a Case on File for Investigation and Prosecution Article 16. A party member or party organization which has been reported to the authorities, which faces accusation, and which has been revealed for violating discipline, and whose actions merit investigation to affix responsibility for party discipline after it has been proved, through initial verification, that discipline is violated will go through the formalities -- conducted within the limits of authority -- of having its case placed on file for investigation and prosecution. Article 17. Cases of discipline violations by party members will be placed on separate files for investigation and prosecution according to the ranks of party members. (1) The Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall seek approval from the party Central Committee to place on file for investigation and prosecution cases involving party discipline violations by party Central Committee members or members of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. (2) Cases involving party discipline violations by standing committee members of party committees and discipline inspection commissions at all levels below the party Central Committee (secretaries and deputy secretaries in grass-roots party committees and discipline inspection commissions), and by party committee members who hold positions equivalent to party committee standing committee members, shall be placed on file for investigation and prosecution if so decided by discipline inspection commissions immediately above the levels of the relevant committees or commissions. These discipline inspection commissions shall seek the opinions of party committees at corresponding levels before making any decisions to place the cases on file for investigation and prosecution. Party discipline violations by other committee and commission members shall be reported by discipline inspection commissions of the same levels to party committees of equivalent levels, which will give approval to place the cases on file for investigation and prosecution. (3) Other party members who are cadres and who violate party discipline will be handled according to the limits of authority over the management of cadres. Corresponding discipline inspection commissions, or discipline inspection work committees or organs, shall decide whether or not to place the cases on file for investigation and prosecution, and they shall solicit opinions from party committees, or party work committees or organs, of the same levels before making their decisions. In the absence of discipline inspection commissions, or discipline inspection work committees or organs, corresponding party committees, or party work committees or organs, shall decide on whether or not to put the cases on file for investigation and prosecution. (4) Grass-roots discipline inspection commissions shall decide whether or not to place on file for investigation and prosecution cases involving party discipline violation by party members who are not cadres. Article 18. Unless stipulated otherwise, local discipline inspection organs shall, in general, decide whether or not to place on file for investigation and prosecution any cases of party discipline violation by party members who are cadres at competent departments and who fall under the party's limits of authority for appointments and removals of local personnel and cadres. If local discipline inspection organizations believe that it is more appropriate for discipline inspection organs of competent departments to place a case on file for investigation and prosecution, the former may let the latter do so after consulting with them. Discipline violation cases which, according to stipulations, shall be handled by discipline inspection organs of competent departments may also be placed on file for investigation and prosecution by local discipline inspection organizations after consultations. Article 19. Serious party discipline violations by party organizations of certain levels shall be reported by discipline inspection organizations immediately above the relevant levels of the party organizations to party committees at levels equivalent to the discipline inspection organizations', and permission shall be sought from the party committees to place the case on file for inspection and prosecution. Discipline inspection commissions at levels immediately above the aforementioned discipline inspection organizations' may also directly make decisions to place the case on file for investigation and prosecution after soliciting opinions from party committees of equivalent levels. Article 20. When necessary, discipline inspection organs of higher levels may make direct decisions to place major discipline violation cases on file for investigation and prosecution, even when these cases should be filed by discipline inspection organs of lower levels. Article 21. Discipline inspection organs of higher levels may instruct discipline inspection organs of lower levels to place discipline violation cases on file for investigation and prosecution if they discover that the latter are responsible for putting these cases on file. Article 22. When a case has to be put on file for investigation and prosecution, reports seeking approval for filing shall be written, with materials from relevant accusations and reports about the initial verification appended to them. The reports shall be submitted for examination and approved in line with the limits of authority for approving the filing. The time limit for examining a report asking for permission to put a case on file for investigation and prosecution shall not exceed one month. Discipline inspection organizations shall inform organization departments of party committees at the same levels about cases which have been approved for filing. Chapter IV. Investigation Article 23. The organ that places a case on file for further action shall organize an investigation team according to the circumstances surrounding that case. Article 24. The investigation team should familiarize itself with the circumstances surrounding that case, find out about policies and provisions related to it, draw up an investigation plan based on its study, and convey the decision to pursue the case to the party organization of the unit to which the person under investigation belongs. The party organization in the unit to which the person being investigated belongs should actively support the handling of the case and strengthen the education of the investigated person as well as people in the know. It must not, without the prior consent of the organ pursuing the case or the investigation team, give the person being investigated approval to leave our territory, go abroad, or go on a business trip, and not transfer, promote, or give awards to the investigated person. Article 25. Under normal circumstances, the investigation team shall begin its investigation with a talk with the person being investigated that is held jointly with the party organization in the unit to which the person being investigated belongs. At the talk, the person being investigated shall be told the decision to place the case on file for further action and the discipline to be taken, and the person should be requested to take a correct attitude toward the organized investigation. During the investigation, the investigation team shall listen earnestly to the investigated person's representations and opinions and conduct proper ideological work and education. Article 26. Where the investigation team believes that a cadre with party membership under investigation has committed serious mistakes, is no longer fit for his or her current position, or will hinder the investigation, it may propose suspending the investigated person from office for examination. A decision to suspend the investigated person from party office for examination shall be made by a party committee that has earlier approved the filing of the case for further action, or be made, after consultations with the party committee at the same level, by a discipline inspection organ that has filed the case directly. Article 27. All facts proving the authenticity of the case shall be deemed to be evidence. Evidence shall include material evidence, documentary evidence, witnesses' testimony, injured parties' representations, the investigated person's representations, audio and video material, spot notes, conclusions of appraisals, and notes on surveys and examinations. Evidence shall be verified as genuine before it can be used as a basis for reaching conclusion on the case. Article 28. All organizations and individuals with knowledge about circumstances concerning the case are obliged to provide evidence. The investigation team has the right to take the following measures in accordance with stipulated procedures to carry out an investigation and to gather evidence; the organizations and individuals concerned must provide evidence accurately and not decline to do so or create obstructions. (1) To look up and duplicate documents, information, account books, bills, minutes of meetings, work notes, and other documentary matters; (2) To demand that the organizations concerned provide documents, information, and other paper documents, and give other essential illustrations; (3) To demand that the personnel concerned give explanations at a stipulated time and place on issues related to the case; (4) To make audio or video recordings or take photographs of personnel and matters related to the case where necessary; (5) To request that relevant specialized organizations or personnel appraise specialized issues related to the case and draw conclusions; (6) To, upon approval by the responsible person of a discipline inspection organ at or above the county level, hold in temporary custody or seal up documents, information, account books, bills, articles, and illegal incomes that could serve to prove an act of discipline violation; (7) To, upon approval by the responsible person of a discipline inspection organ at or above the county level, check the investigated party's deposits in banks or other financial institutions and notify the banks or financial institutions concerned to suspend payment from the accounts in question; (8) To gather all other evidence that could serve to prove the authenticity of the case. Article 29. In investigations and in collecting evidence, it is necessary to ensure the following points: (1) In collecting material and written evidence, every effort should be made to get the actual items or the originals; if it is impossible to get the actual items or the originals, photographs or copies may be used, but their custodians or their origin should be indicated; and written evidence should bear the custodian's signature or stamp; (2) Witnesses should be told about their responsibility, and one witness should produce one copy of testimony, which may either be written by the witness himself or written by the investigator and confirmed by the witness; all testimonies should contain information on the witness's identity and the time of testifying and bear the witness's signature or stamp; if the witness wants to change a part of or the entire testimony, he may produce a new testimony, but he must indicate the reason for the change, and the original testimony shall not be returned to him; a witness shall be interviewed by at least two investigators at the same time; the provisions of this item are applicable to the collection of statements by victims and statements by those being investigated; and (3) Any investigation materials transferred from relevant organs must be seriously examined, and they may not be used as evidence before they are reaffirmed by investigators. Article 30. Public security, judicial, and other law-enforcement departments should actively cooperate if they are required to provide relevant materials for the investigation of discipline violation cases. Article 31. It is necessary to seriously verify the evidence and strictly prevent falsified and wrong evidence. If evidence is dubious, new and additional evidence should be collected. Article 32. An act of wrongdoing must not be confirmed without sufficient, accurate evidence. It shall not be confirmed with only the statements of those being investigated. An act of wrongdoing may be confirmed with sufficient evidence, even if the person being investigated refuses to admit it. Article 33. The investigating team should prepare written materials on a confirmed act of wrongdoing and check with the person being investigated. Reasonable opinions of the person being investigated should be accepted, and a supplementary investigation should be carried out if necessary. A written refutation should be prepared to deal with unreasonable arguments. The person being investigated should make written comments on the written wrongdoing materials. If the person being investigated refuses to make comments, this should be so indicated on the wrongdoing materials by the investigating team. Article 34. After basically completing the investigation and collection of evidence, the investigating team should prepare an investigation report after collective discussion. The basic contents of the investigation report should include the basis for placing the case on file, major facts and the nature of the wrongdoing, the responsibility of the persons involved, the investigated person's attitude toward the investigation, and recommended actions. During the investigation, any negation of questions should be clearly explained. Questions which are hard to confirm should be reported according to the facts. The investigation report shall be signed by all members of the investigating team. If members of the investigating team have a relatively big difference over the nature of the wrongdoing, the responsibility of the persons involved, and the recommended actions, and if they cannot reach a consensus after discussion, the investigation report should be written according to the opinion of the head of the investigating team, and the difference should be properly reflected in the report or in a separate report. The investigating team should keep the party organization of the investigated person's unit informed of the main contents of the investigation report and seek its comments. Article 35. An informant or witness should be investigated and blamed for creating trumped-up charges or false testimony or other actions which obstruct the investigation of a case. Article 36. The case investigators and handlers, informants, and witnesses should be protected. Whoever creates trumped-up charges or retaliates against them should be punished. Article 37. During the investigation, if a party member who violated discipline is found to have committed a crime, his case should be promptly transferred to the judicial organs for handling. Article 38. After completing an investigation, the investigating team should sum up its work and help the party organization of the unit where the discipline violation took place in summing up the experience and lessons. Article 39. The investigation of a case should be completed in three months, and the period may be extended for one month if necessary. If a case is too complex and the investigation cannot be completed within the extended period, the length of the investigation may be further extended with the approval of the organ which places the case on file for investigation. Chapter V. Handing Over a Case for Inquisition Article 40. All cases placed on file for further investigation into the party disciplinary responsibility shall be handed over to the organ concerned for inquisition after the investigation is completed.

The party organization of the unit to which the investigated person belongs shall decide within a month on the way to deal with the case and shall submit the decision for examination and approval by a higher authority with the required jurisdiction to approve the disciplinary action it has decided on. Under special circumstances, a discipline inspection organ above the county level shall consult with the party organization of the unit to which the investigated person belongs before it directly decides on the disciplinary action. Article 43. In the course of an inquisition, supplementary evidence shall be produced if there should be insufficient evidence, and a supplementary investigation shall be carried out should there be unclear facts about the case. Article 44. Discipline inspection organs shall carry out a direct inquisition on cases already handled by the public security and judicial organs that involve party members who are subject to party disciplinary actions. If a case of this nature should need further investigation, discipline inspection organs shall go through the formalities for filing the case for further action. Chapter VI.
