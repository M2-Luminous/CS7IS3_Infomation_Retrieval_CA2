I Do Not Know....'"] [Text] "What I am doing now does not have much to do with rationality, but really has more to do with Don Quixote," is how Ruth Marti, chairman of the Party of East German Unity (OPDE), speaking in Berlin yesterday, described the attempt by over 2,400 members to mobilize non-voters and potential right-wing voters before the land elections in the former GDR "to assume political responsibility for shaping the new German state." In its document on general policy guidelines, the OPDE presents itself as a "social-liberal alternative" for representing the interests of east Germans -- and is evidently also an alternative to the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. "Still a leftist -- I do not know," said Ruth Martin, pre-empting a question from journalists, as she explained the OPDE policy guidelines. What is obvious is that many of the party stances and demands could just as easily appear in a PDS (election) program and in Gysi's "Ingolstadt manifesto," where they have to some extent been formulated in both a more detailed as well as a more intelligible manner. Thus, the lawyer described the inevitable question about what separates the party from the PDS as being among "those that I hate most." Nevertheless, her answer seemed plausible: Among the potential non-voters in the east -- and she estimates that they could account for as much as 40 percent of the electorate there -- are many people who would never vote for the PDS and would rather vote for the right. "We do not want to take away concerned voters from anyone," she said, but added self-confidently that the establishment of the OPDE to represent eastern interests has already led to "a review within the PDS." At the same time, the OPDE does not have any illusions about something similar occurring in the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], and FDP [Free Democratic Party]. "The old parties do not represent the interests of the Germans in the east," is the first sentence in the policy guidelines. However, their members, says Dan Mechtel, a 22-year-old law student at Humboldt University, include social democrats, Christians, and liberals. That is why he also sees no grounds for concern. Ruth Martin stated clearly what does concern the OPDE: "Well over 2 million citizens are unemployed in the east.... Thousands of scientists have been fired, artists do not receive work, and research capacity has been extensively reduced. People have not only lost their jobs, but have also lost their social ties." This is something that the party does not want to counter with nostalgia for the GDR, but by citing the constitution, "which we want to develop and defend." Equality before the law, but with certain special rights for the disadvantaged east Germans, is the main thread running through the policy guidelines that culminate in the slogan "one people, one law, one state," which does, of course, trigger negative associations among journalists. The party explicitly states that it supports a "social free market economy," but stresses the word social. She demands that "industrial core areas" should not only be preserved, but with an eye to the markets in the east -- Ruth Martin said: "I want to take the train to Beijing" -- new ones should also be developed. At the same time, the party also wants to protect manufacturers and traders from the excessive might of western concerns and demands conditions that would enable an east German middle class to emerge. The OPDE calls itself the party of "human dignity and social justice." One of the ways in which this goal is to be achieved is through the "partial recognition of GDR laws on land ownership," which affects 50 percent of families in the east. "The fundamental human right to housing" should be secured through genuinely social housing construction projects and should not be linked to "the possibility that those on higher incomes have of living well." Demands "that our country should once more be favorably disposed toward families and children" occupy a central place in the guidelines. The abortion law should be removed from the criminal code, says Dan Mechtel, and protecting the lives of children should be made a part of family law and "a duty for both parents." Ruth Martin wants, above all, to motivate women into being participants in the life of society once again. "They must enter politics and achieve equality that way," states the document. Further on, the party demands "rights for the younger generation that would enable it to represent itself," apprenticeships and jobs for all young people, and "scholarships, irrespective of parents' earnings, that amount to at least as much as social assistance payments." Apart from the work involved, the OPDE chairman said that the greatest handicap to crossing the 5-percent hurdle is to find partners -- "It is a grueling job; I have never worked so hard." Does that mean that she will now give up participating in the Bundestag elections? The established parties do not think much of the modified OPDE demand that 5 percent of the votes in one of the laender should suffice to be represented in the Bundestag. That is why the party will concentrate on elections at the land level, beginning with the forthcoming elections in Saxony-Anhalt.
