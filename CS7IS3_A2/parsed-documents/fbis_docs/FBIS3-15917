TRUD has frequently given your opponents the chance to have their say. Today the floor is yours. Why are you setting up your own party, Yegor Timurovich? Do you intend to use it to become president or to take charge of the Cabinet of Ministers in two years' time, or are your plans more modest? [Gaydar] Our goals are highly serious, but they are not linked with who specifically tries to become president or premier. The essence of the political choice and the cataclysms of 1994, defining it as simply as possible, is that, in my opinion, the present government is unable to make a firm decision about what it wants to do in the economy. Decisiveness presupposes a firm choice between one of two consistent and intelligible strategies. The first possible strategy is as follows. The government, faced with the present difficulties and unable to make up its mind to go forward, firmly pursues the course of establishing a directive-based, command economy with its plans, funds, quotas, distribution shortfalls, suppressed inflation, "backdoor dealings," speculation, unconvertible currency, guaranteed employment, and so forth. And then everything is understood -- what to do today, tomorrow, and the day after that, what problems to resolve, what threats arise, and whom to fight. Then there is the second strategy. The government understands that it is possible to get out of the current intermediate position by another route. It decides quickly and consistently to form market mechanisms, remove excessive state pressure on the economy, reform the legal system, guarantee the right to property, stabilize the national currency, gradually reduce taxes, and create incentives for private savings and investments. And to carry out reforms on this basis. Then it is also clear what to do in the first, second, and third stage. But the most difficult problem arises when neither the first nor the second decision is made. Then hesitations inevitably begin. We saw this policy in 1989-1991, when the Union leadership could not make up its mind. Now we are again in a similar intermediate position, from which there are the two possible escape routes of which I have already spoken. Moreover, the first of them is backed by fairly clear forces, and, against the background of the inevitable strains posed by the intermediate position, the possibility exists that they will manage to convince people that this solution is the simplest, the most tried and tested, and the most reliable. Despite the complete futility of this solution, the danger of its being chosen is real. A highly structured organization with a long tradition is working toward this end -- the Communist Party. Before 1992, when the wind seemed to be filling the sails of democratic transformations, the democrats could afford not to counterpose to the first alternative a highly structured organization in the form of a party. "Democratic Russia" was not a powerful organization either in 1989 or in 1990. It went from victory to victory on the wave of disillusion with the old system, the old ideology, and the old bosses. That wave has now subsided. In order to uphold the second alternative, which, in my view, is the absolutely essential condition and prerequisite for the creation of a civilized society in our country, serious systematic efforts are necessary. The formation of our party is just such an effort to form a force which will champion the second, democratic, civilized alternative in Russia. So that the small shoots of our civil society which have managed to grow within this period are not once again flattened by an armor-plated roller. So that they are not destroyed. [TRUD] But you, Yegor Timurovich -- indeed, "Choice" as well -- have the reputation in the eyes of a significant section of society of being "reformist wreckers." How do you intend to change this opinion? [Gaydar] We will direct our main efforts at explaining the simple truth. It is our duty to explain who, in point of fact, wrecked the economy, who robbed our gold and currency reserves, what really could be done, what we did, and, of course, what needs to be done today to extricate the country from its difficult position. It should be borne in mind that we were really forced to assume the huge burden of responsibility for the reforms. Ruslan Imranovich [Khasbulatov] artlessly believed that 10 days after the beginning of the reforms it was already time to dismiss the government which had done the donkeywork. He simply underestimated the fact that this donkeywork would take more than one month. We understood perfectly well how difficult and thankless this work was, and how easy it was for our opponents to explain how wonderfully they would have done everything if evil forces in the shape of Gaydar and "Russia's Choice" had not interfered. The benefits which the reforms brought people, despite their huge costs, were until now almost taken for granted: both the market, which is more or less stable, and the ruble -- though people grumble about it, it is on the whole convertible, and you no longer have to go from Tula to Moscow for sausage meat, or wait in line.... What was simply impossible to imagine two years ago had become almost customary. All this, it seemed, was guaranteed. But now people are beginning to understand that it is not all completely guaranteed. Today the question is not whether this could have been done more easily or more mildly than it was done by Gaydar, but whether or not it will endure. Or will everything be taken away again? Of course, it can be taken away. In 1925, as a result of the New Economic Policy, there was a fully developed market in Russia, but in 1928 they again introduced ration cards, and there came a famine and other choice delights. Will this be repeated? What we have on our side is clarity. Perhaps not very pleasant, but clarity all the same. It is absolutely clear what we stand for and what we will not allow while we are alive and able to do something. So much for our reputation. [TRUD] Right now many parties of every kind are being set up. Not one of them has yet done anything, hence they have nothing to answer for. But you already have the burden of responsibility for the past hanging round your neck.... [Gaydar] Thank God, we now have more opportunity to talk frankly than before. After all, it becomes both funny and sad when it suddenly turns out that, for everything that the government did without me in the spring of 1993 -- they kept the crazy state order for agricultural production, they kept preferential credits, they fixed crazy prices, they adopted a whole range of federal programs that were wholly unsupported, they introduced state subsidies for mixed feed and increased other subsidies -- for all this, it turns out, Gaydar is now to blame. Just as I am to blame for the fact that, when I came in, I started to abolish preferential credits and subsidies.... I am also blamed for the fact that Chernomyrdin cannot fulfill the promises he dished out in the spring. We all understand this. But before, shackled by government solidarity, we could not say so plainly, because quarrels of this kind are, in my view, appropriate either in cabinet sessions, or if you are no longer working in the government. But now I can talk frankly about it all. [TRUD] Your opponents say roughly the following: Gaydar delayed the payment of wages, so inflation was reduced, but now Chernomyrdin has paid the accumulated debts, and inflation has shot up. [Gaydar] What is the crux of this problem? Since last spring, from the time that the government issued a colossal number of impracticable promises, events have been operating, as it were, according to two sets of logic. One is the logic of current funding: Money, generally speaking, can be counted; some is given out, some is not. But another logic began to develop -- the economy of promises, which is always mixed with untruths. Because it is simply impossible to deliver such promises afterward. When we came into the government last fall, the essence of our actions was not delaying the payment of wages -- that was done before we came, in May, June, July, and August -- but trying to quickly reduce the volume of impracticable promises. To stop lying, to put it simply. And we at once launched an assault on the most expensive impracticable promises -- preferential credits. [TRUD] You supported the liberalization of bread prices and at the same time planned to win the elections? [Gaydar] Yes, I knew that that was politically disadvantageous, but it was honest. I was actually in favor of saying bluntly that we could not pay subsidies on mixed feed, and I revoked them. But the subsidies were restored the next day. That was last October. But after all, they are not being paid today. There is no money to do so. They represent a fantastic expense! You could stop funding higher and secondary education and science altogether -- you still would not be able to afford these subsidies. But instead of honestly saying to agricultural workers: You will not get this money, do not expect it -- they continue to promise it. I believe that the most terrible vice of the policy pursued in 1993 was that it was a policy of budget payment defaults, a policy of unaffordable promises. After all, if you really want the fascists to come to power in the elections, employ the simplest policy -- first promise, and then fail to deliver. Nothing could be simpler! [TRUD] To what extent, in your opinion, did the flaws and failures of the reformist course and the shock therapy help strengthen national radicalism? [Gaydar] All radical social transformations are a difficult and painful affair. Some people adapt very well, others with difficulty and badly. And society always reacts to this pain with an upsurge of aggression, an attempt to find someone to blame, to find simple explanations. It is this that lies at the heart of our desire to bring the time frames of economic and social transformations in Russia as close together as possible. And the fact that we did not manage to do this fully -- that the reforms began to skid -- in my view substantially increased the risk of the advent of radical national socialism. [TRUD] Our multiparty system has expressed itself in the form of an unthinkable number of lilliputian parties. What are you doing to ensure that your party is not the same sort of closet-cum-club organization? Do you have support in the regions? [Gaydar] We do indeed have very few real parties, and of them the most powerful and viable is the Communist Party. The democrats also have their own organizations, but they are very badly structured, without clear discipline or fixed membership. Our main task today is to create a sufficiently broad organization, taking whatever lies in the potential of democratic structures and is at the same time clear and definite. Anyway, it was the largest faction in the Duma, backed by dozens of deputies representing the democratic forces in the most diverse regions of Russia, which took the initiative to organize the party. A faction for which millions of Russians voted. Of course a party will be viable if it has support in the regions. We have such support, I believe. [TRUD] Do you not think that "Democratic Russia's" recent decision, in which it was mildly intimated that you cannot rely on "Democratic Russia's" support, will affect the formation of your party? [Gaydar] "Democratic Russia" is, of course, a large organization, in which there are many people with different viewpoints. I believe that we have a reasonable dialogue with them, and we by no means want to cram all "Democratic Russia's" activists into the new party. I consider their council's resolution that "`Democratic Russia's' regional organizations will determine independently the degree of their practical participation" in the formation of our party as a mild form of support. We hope to hold our constituent congress in late May. [TRUD] You will recall that when the formation of the "Russia's Choice" movement was just beginning, the first to propose setting up a party on the basis of the movement was Gennadiy Burbulis. Has he lost the initiative today, or have you seized it? [Gaydar] Gennadiy Eduardovich did indeed more than once express the idea of creating such a democratic party -- in 1992 and in early 1993. But the problems which then stood in the way could not be overcome. Today this is a decision of the faction to which he also belongs. I know that Burbulis has his own special approaches to the problems of party organization and the development of a party-based movement. I think that we should give him the chance to spell out his position. [TRUD] The name of your party is the "Liberal Conservative Party." However, "Russia's Choice" is known as more of a radical democratic movement. Does not the one exclude the other? [Gaydar] Indeed, today we are perhaps the biggest conservatives in Russia. Because if we have managed to grow something, however small, in the past two years, to get nearer to an open society, to the market, to freedom of speech, and to private ownership, our main task is to conserve that. In addition, we also support traditional conservative values -- stable legislation, support for order, and the fight against crime... [TRUD] Imagining a social cross-section of society, at what levels do you see the potential members of your party? [Gaydar] There are statistics about who voted for "Russia's Choice." They are people with above-average education and above-average qualifications, on average or slightly above-average incomes. That is to say a stratum which in civilized, developed market economies is called the middle class. In Russia this middle class consists of skilled workers of the free professions and small-time property owners. Only this class, I am profoundly convinced, can become the staunch mainstay of a stable society, of democracy and the market. [TRUD] It is also, of course, the most creatively active stratum of society. But it is not strong enough, it is not very united, and it is eclipsed by lumpenized but well-organized groups... [Gaydar] You are absolutely right. That is indeed the essence of the social, economic, and politic alternative with which we are faced today. It is the choice between the lumpen who has been told that the foreigner is his enemy and that if he crushes that enemy and breaks through to the Indian Ocean, he can have a pineapple in one hand and a banana in the other, and the rational section of society which understands that there are no free lunches.
