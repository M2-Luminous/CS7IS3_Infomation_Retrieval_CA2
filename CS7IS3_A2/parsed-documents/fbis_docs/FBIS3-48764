A concrete schedule, including the date and place, is "now under arrangement," and "I would like to attend if my schedule allows," Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting. Germany has reportedly proposed the G-7 meeting on February 26 in Frankfurt to discuss world economy and aid to Russia. Meanwhile, Fujii reiterated the timetable is yet not set for the adoption of a new economic stimulus package and the budget compilation, saying, "I don't have any fresh factors to comment on." But he also repeated the government wants to set the package and the third fiscal 1993 budget before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. "As I have been saying, we must create an environment" in which Hosokawa can explain Japan's economic policies "in view of international society," Fujii said. Asked about the economic impact from delayed stimulus measures, Fujii said the government will "certainly" take the measures as promised to the public and will also "certainly" form the third extra budget to finance the measures. He noted that a delay in the writing of the fiscal 1994 budget will undermine the economy "psychologically," but "in terms of real demand, the third budget is "more effective." Concerning U.S. hopes of Japan including an income tax cut as the key measure, he said, "I can't fully comment on that yet. Fujii said he would "carefully watch" the currency market, referring to the yen's appreciation to the 108 level against the dollar on speculation over U.S. pressure on Japan ahead of the summit. "But there are no rapid movements yet" in the dollar-yen rate, he said. Fujii brushed aside reports that a policy-making committee of the coalition parties is inclined to separate a consumption tax hike from the tax cut, and he stressed that a decision on the tax issue will be left to a joint economic forum of the government and coalition parties. The Finance Ministry is insisting that the tax cut and hike be included in a single program to ensure a financial source for cutting income taxes before hiking the consumption tax.
