The appointment formally made Hata prime minister of Japan. Hata was named prime minister in elections in both houses of the Diet on Monday. His appointment as prime minister was delayed, however, by political unrest sparked by the establishment of a large parliamentary coalition grouping that excluded the Social Democratic Party, which had been the biggest single party in the coalition. The SDP declared early Tuesday it had left the coalition. Hata, head of the coalition's core party, Shinseito, will form his cabinet later Thursday, the officials said.
