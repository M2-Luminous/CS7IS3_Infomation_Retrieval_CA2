FBIS3-13814 "drnes054_l_94006" FBIS-NES-94-054 Document Type:Daily Report 20 Mar 1994 ISRAEL Government Considering Accelerating Withdrawal TA2003194794 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew 1800 GMT 20 Mar 94 TA2003194794 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Text] It was learned tonight that Israel is prepared to discuss a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip even before the negotiations on that issue are completed. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told today's cabinet meeting that 'Arafat has in fact agreed to resume the talks even though he has not admitted it publicly. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen gives us the political picture: [Begin recording] [Rosen] I was surprised, Yitzhaq Rabin said, I did not realize how widespread the support for Barukh Goldstein's abhorrent act is among the settlers. The government did not make any new decisions today although such decisions are due to be made. Yesterday, we reported on the Norwegian compromise paper, which the foreign minister confirmed today. Mr. Peres said Israel is ready to agree to a Palestinian police force being deployed in Hebron. A senior political source said that the powers of the Palestinian police force will be wider than they had prior to the intifadah. A number of ministers, including Tourism Minister 'Uzi Bar'am, again raised the demand for a full or partial evacuation of Jews from Hebron. Police Minister Moshe Shahal expressed support for such a move. [Shahal] It is easier to defend the Jewish population if it is concentrated together. [Rosen] Inside the cabinet room, this demand led to a confrontation between ministers. [Environment Minister Yosi Sarid] The government will soon have to make very important decisions on the settlers' deployment inside Hebron, which is very dangerous and very problematic. [Industry and Trade Minister Mikha Harish] I fear a situation where some of the ministers, especially the Meretz ministers, raise new proposals which will persuade 'Arafat to continue to delay. [Rosen] Israel is nevertheless going to meet the PLO half way. What is on the agenda now is speeding up the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The area is already being evacuated. On the prime minister's desk is a proposal, which Rabin has not ruled out, that the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal take place concurrently with the negotiations and prior to the completion of the talks in order to meet 'Arafat's demand to show signs of withdrawal on 13 April. [Peres] Israel is ready to speed up the negotiations and the implementation of the agreement. [Rosen] The ongoing curfew and the closure disturb the ministers. Police Minister Shahal suggested continuing the closure until after Independence Day but urged compensating the residents. [Shahal] The amount must be reasonable. I suggest between 15 and 20 million shekels a month. [Rosen] The government forecasts tough talks in Tunis. Although the foreign minister told the cabinet today that 'Arafat has in fact already decided to return to the talks, he just has not said so publicly. [end recording]
