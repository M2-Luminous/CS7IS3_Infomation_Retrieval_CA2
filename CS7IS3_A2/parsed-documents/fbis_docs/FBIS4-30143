It provides the assessment that write offs of nonperforming assets reached historically high levels in fiscal year 1993 and comments, "Financial institutions have demonstrated the desire to aggressively dispose of bad assets," but that a further extension of sluggishness in commercial real estate is expected and complete disposition of such assets "will require considerably more time." Relative to the deterioration of balance sheets based on falling asset values, the white paper explains, "There are signs that worsening balance sheets may have reduced the capability to assume risks," and adds, "The impact (on the macroeconomy) should not be disregarded." In summary, the white paper indicates: 1. The recession in our nation which started in the spring of 1991 continued in fiscal year 1993. As a result, the recent recession has proven to be severe in comparison to past recessions, both in terms of length and scope. 2. Prices such as domestic wholesale prices moved on a weak basis throughout the fiscal year based on a strong yen and easing of the supply and demand ratio for manufactured goods while there was a considerable decline in the rate of increase of prices for services provided to businesses. Further, consumer prices stabilized increasingly because of steady labor costs and an increase in cheap imported products. In the area of current account balances, the effects of the strong yen caused a decreasing trend in the real trade surplus between the spring of last year to year end. However, the dollar-based trade surplus and current accounts surplus both rose sharply to new historical highs because of a strong yen and increase in overseas investment income. 3. The extended recession called for continuation of the relaxed monetary policies in fiscal year 1993. In September 1993, the BOJ reduced the official discount rate to the historically low level of 1.75 percent. 4. Loans issued by financial institutions declined throughout the year, while the money supply grew slightly over fiscal year 1992, at a low rate. That trend was based on a) sluggish demand for capital to invest in real assets amidst a prolonged recession; b) financial restructuring of businesses, and c) decline in capabilities of businesses to assume risks based on a drop in asset values. However, recent monetary easing has contributed to rising investments in housing and an underpinning for corporate profits based on lower interest rates. Further, monetary easing functioned to provide for an environment that enhanced the feasibility of restructuring of businesses and financial institutions, thus serving as a factor to sustain the economy. 5. The financial system reflects substantial write offs of bad loans during fiscal year 1993 over the prior year by banks throughout the nation, indicating that financial institutions took unprecedentedly aggressive action in the disposal of bad loans. It appears that such actions were made possible because of a favorable financial environment including the ability to procure capital at a stable low cost and firm stock prices and the favorable impact of revisions in systems for handling write offs and reserves for bad loans. Even among financial institutions, there seems to be a growing desire to enhance future competitiveness through the aggressive disposition of bad loans. However, extension of sluggish conditions in the commercial real estate market will require considerably more time before completion of bad loan disposal actions by financial institutions. 6. The persistence of the recent recession was caused by a concurrent adjustment process on three fronts to include a) cyclical stock adjustment; b) balance sheet adjustments required as a result of the collapse of the bubble, and c) pressure to adjust the industrial structure based on changes in international competitiveness emanating from a strong yen throughout 1993. 7. Fluctuations in asset values centered on real estate after the mid-1980's have caused major losses on the balance sheets of businesses and households which used debt to acquire assets during the period of rising asset values as well as the financial institutions that issued loans for such purchases, only to be followed by a decline in asset values. It is believed that the deterioration in balance sheets of such economic entities and decline in risk assumption capabilities had a restraining effect on overall economic expenditures. It is felt that as a minimum that these conditions have led to sluggish growth in loans by financial institutions and in the money supply despite a major decline in interest rates and the extended recession in capital investments in the small and medium businesses in the nonmanufacturing sector. However, it is difficult to quantify the impact of balance sheet adjustments on current economic trends. 8. World economic trends in recent years reflect spectacular economic growth in East Asian nations that have an abundant supply of low-cost labor. And in the United States, productivity has risen in the manufacturing industries, primarily in the computer and automotive sectors. Such developments have caused changes in the relatively superior status of Japanese industries. The economy of our nation is undergoing a long-term, structural change referred to as an adjustment in the industrial structure, in addition to restructuring in response to a cyclical change in revenues. In the manufacturing sector, a rapid expansion is taking place in imports of labor-intensive goods from East Asian nations. Further, mass production of medium-range high-tech goods, which Japan has comparative advantage, has been transferred not only to Europe and the United States but to East Asian nations via direct overseas investments. Such steps have led to an active shift to overseas production of existing products such as automobiles and electrical equipment. The changes have caused Japanese businesses to convert to production of technology intensive products. Even in the nonmanufacturing sector, lower overseas production costs associated with a strong yen and the effects of deregulation have caused a phenomenon called "price destruction." This development has functioned to reduce foreign and domestic price differentials through efficiencies installed in the distribution system and serves as an underpinning to bring about real improvements in household incomes. Elimination of foreign and domestic price differentials has worked to promote restructuring in the existing nonmanufacturing sector. 9. An increase in improving economic indicators has been experienced recently and the economy as a whole manifests signs of bottoming. As the economy improves in the future, there is a strong possibility that the impact of adjustments in balance sheets and industrial structures will have a moderating effect on the pace of the recovery. There is the possibility that the pattern of economic recovery will differ from the past when consideration is given to the varying progress made on stock adjustments and severity of balance sheet deteriorations in the respective economic sectors (with conditions being more favorable in household balance sheets as opposed to those for businesses) and the positive or negative effects of economic restructuring on the respective economic entities. 10. Structural adjustments in the industries of our nation are inevitable as a response to structural changes in the world economy. Revisions in government regulations will be of crucial significance in promoting such adjustments and to enhance the capability of Japan's economy to respond to worldwide changes. In other words, relaxation and repeal of regulations by Japan can contribute to: a) establishment of feasibility in forming an internationally efficient production pattern based on the construction of a horizontally arrayed division of labor with nations of the world, especially East Asian nations, in the area of trade; b) promotion of efficiency in non-trade goods sectors and enhancement of real purchasing power based on lower consumer prices, and c) development of new business sectors and expansion of new industries. 11. Methods for dealing with surpluses in the current account are also an issue for Japan. The cyclical portion of surpluses in the current account attributable to differentials in external and domestic growth rates should lessen as Japan moves toward economic recovery. On the other hand, other portions of the current account surpluses will be affected by Japan's basic savings and investment balances and are not expected to disappear on a short-term basis.
