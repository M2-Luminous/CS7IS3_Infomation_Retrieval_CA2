The president of the LPRP CC [Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee] said that the youth ought to have revolutionary ideals in life, and have the needs and energy to put into deeds their ideals for the benefits of the society. They ought to have knowledge, skills in addition to correct revolutionary moral and conducts in the execution of the public tasks in all sectors. The youths should be the leading task forces at all fronts including those involved in anticorruption, embezzlement, illegal transactions, tax collection, and other negative manifestations in the society. He said that the youth ought to translate their slogan "wherever there is difficulty, the youth will handle; wherever there is hardship, the youth will overcome; when the nation calls, the youth will be present" into deeds in their integrated endeavours for national construction from now till 2000. They must make optimal use of the natural resources of the country in a sustainable manner so that the people in the nation can benefit from the wealth of the nation, providing each and everyone clothes and food so that the people's living standard can be stabilised and improved. Mr. Khamtai Siphandon said that the issue of expanding membership of the LPRYU was an important task that the Lao youth organisation needed to give special attention to and together with the party organisation this issue needed to be handled. On the one hand, the organisation of the youth needed to be streamlined for work efficiency, and along with this, there ought to be a programme for educating the organisation's members and non-members alike so that they would understand and appreciate the party and state's policies and the state's laws.
