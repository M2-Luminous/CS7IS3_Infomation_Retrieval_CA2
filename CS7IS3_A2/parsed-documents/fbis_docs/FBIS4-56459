Figueroa made this statement after signing an agreement between the Chilean and Croatian Governments extending visa requirements for carriers of diplomatic, official, and special passports. The agreement was signed by Foreign Minister Figueroa and visiting Croatian Vice President Mate Granic within the framework of the latter's three-day official visit. Granic arrived in Santiago on 1 May from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Foreign Minister Figueroa explained that Chile will receive from Croatia training in the educational and technical professional fields. He added that there are discussions under way on the possibility of establishing "joint ventures" with Chilean companies in the area of shipyards. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Figueroa expressed his satisfaction that Croatia has achieved peace, which has enabled it to achieve political and economic stability. He explained that the remaining conflict in the area occupied by the Serbs will be resolved through negotiations. In addition, Croatian Vice President Mate Granic, who is also foreign minister, thanked the Chilean people for having been the first Latin American country to have recognized Croatia's independence, which was declared on 16 January 1992. He added that 25 percent of Croatian territory is still under the domain of the local Serbs, who are supported and encouraged by the regime in Belgrade, an area protected by the United Nations. Nevertheless, Croatia has been able to achieve its political stability. Granic said that his country seeks two basic objectives: first, to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the occupied territories and integrate them into the legal political system that is enforced today in Croatia; and second, to achieve an economic development integrated with the country's political system.
