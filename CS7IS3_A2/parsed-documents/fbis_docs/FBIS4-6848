An intracoalition standoff intensified a few hours after the Diet voted to sweep Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Hata, 58, to power as the replacement for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (Innovation)," comprises Shinseito, the Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two splinter groups that recently defected from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party -- the Liberal Party and Kaikaku no Kai. By incorporating former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, the parliamentary strength of the new camp shot up to 130. Yamaguchi himself is an LDP rebel. The group's strength has already dwarfed the SDP's strength of 74. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the SDP, blasted the sudden attempt to alter the coalition's makeup for betraying the SDP, which was the largest contingent in the ruling coalition. The SDP apparently perceives the sudden convergence of five political blocs as a move aimed at accomplishing a proposal by the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream to create a new unified party, political analysts said. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his Komeito counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa originally proposed such a convergence to defeat the LDP in an upcoming general election under the newly legislated electoral system, which has introduced a mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. The leaders of the coalition were originally scheduled to begin talks on the formation of a second coalition at 4 P.M. [0700 GMT] but the SDP's rage apparently delayed the start of the consultations for more than four hours until SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama went to the premier's official residence at 8:30 P.M. However, Murayama walked out of the meeting 18 minutes later to discuss his party's response at the SDP Headquarters. The move suddenly gathered momentum when DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi told DSP legislators the coalition parties should initiate such a parliamentary group to create a "firm support base" for the Hata administration. The DSP leader was earlier one of the chief critics of such a move. Kubo, the SDP's chief strategist, told reporters, however, "it is a universal rule to live by the etiquette based on mutual trust and obligations. It is outrageous for them to suddenly initiate this move on the very day of a cabinet formation despite the fact that the SDP has cooperated with other coalition partners in running the government until today," Kubo said. Ouchi later told a news conference, "the reason why we have to establish the parliamentary group to back up the new prime minister is to facilitate the implementation of the nine-point policy platform agreed upon by the coalition parties." The platform was created after two weeks of squabbles and standoffs since Hosokawa suddenly announced his resignation April 8. Ouchi also said, "We need to consolidate the parliamentary base to support the prime minister and we put together parties that could quickly agree to the convergence as it is hard to enlist all the parties immediately into the new group."
