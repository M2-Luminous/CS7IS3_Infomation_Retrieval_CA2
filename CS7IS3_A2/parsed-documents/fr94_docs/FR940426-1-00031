FR940426-1-00031 FR940426-1-00004 Question 6.13. Would this approach create the uncertainty that apparently existed prior to the adoption of these rules and served as their genesis? Question 6.14. Assuming that disclosure would be an essential element of this alternative, what disclosures would adequately inform investors that market prices may be or were being influenced by distribution participant activity? 132 132 In this regard, commenters may wish to consider United States v. Lewis, [1989] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶94,479 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). H. Simplifying the Current Rules The Trading Practices Rules are considered by many to be complex and difficult to apply. Some have suggested that the current construction of these rules could be simplified without sacrificing the core protections afforded by these rules. Question 6.15. Could the current structure of the Trading Practices Rules be simplified and, if so, how? Question 6.16. Rules 10b&hyph;6 and 10b&hyph;8 are structured in terms of a basic prohibition and exceptions thereto. Would it be possible to structure the prohibitions more narrowly to address specific types of potentially manipulative conduct in connection with distributions generally and rights offerings specifically? By the Commission. Dated: April 19, 1994. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
