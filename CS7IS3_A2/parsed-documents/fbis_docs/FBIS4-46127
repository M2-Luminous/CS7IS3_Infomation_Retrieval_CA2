Gen. Ehud Baraq, chief of staff, and Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, chief of the Intelligence Branch, with domestic correspondents at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv -- live] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A considerable number of weapons were found in the building [unspecified], including a loaded gun at Mustafa al-Dirani's bedside, which he had no time to use, just as others had no such opportunity as a result of the element of surprise. Numerous documents of all kinds -- not just written ones -- were found. [passage omitted] The objectives of the operation were fully attained. Al-Dirani is in our hands, and we believe his interrogation will contribute to shedding light on the situation with regard to Ron Arad's whereabouts and perhaps to understanding what must be done to deal with Ron Arad's case in the future. [passage omitted] Sagi: Mustafa al-Dirani is the head of the Believers Resistance, a splinter group of the Amal organization. He headed Amal's terrorist apparatus until 1988 and, as part of his duties, was responsible for a large number of attacks on IDF soldiers, from the time of the Peace for Galilee Operation and until he retired from Amal in 1988. He is the founder of the Believers Resistance, an independent faction which has now merged with Hizballah. While it was an independent body, however, it carried out numerous attacks against IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] soldiers in south Lebanon. His involvement in holding Ron Arad hostage has long been known, at least to the intelligence community. We possess reliable information -- which applied prior to the operation and has been largely confirmed with al-Dirani's transfer to Israel -- to the effect that Ron Arad was taken prisoner and held by Mustafa al-Dirani for a period of over two years and that he even conducted negotiations about him which may give us a lead as to the future and perhaps even the fate of Ron Arad. [passage omitted] Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's Alon Ben-David: Mr. Chief of Staff, the prime minister said a few minutes ago that al-Dirani's abduction was not meant to provide us with a bargaining chip for Ron Arad's release. Before we set out on this operation, did we have any information to the effect that this abduction will bring Ron Arad's return to Israel somewhat closer? Baraq: In my opinion, the main thing to be obtained is a better understanding on our part -- as a result of what will emerge from the investigation and of a thorough analysis of the papers and other documents we seized there -- as to what exactly happened to Ron Arad. It is the confirmed end of a thread leading to somebody who held him in his hands and apparently handed him over to the Iranians. Information and a better understanding may surface later as to how to act in the future in order to secure Ron Arad's return to Israel. Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel: Mr. Chief of Staff, could you be more specific about the method of operation in the village last night? Baraq: I think it would not be right to detail the methods of operation on television. I cannot swear to you that this will be the last time we will have to use these operational tools, which are very important and sensitive and contribute a great deal to the IDF's abilities. I cannot tell you that this is the last time we will use them. Therefore, the better we manage to conceal and cloud the details of the operation, the better it will be. [passage omitted]
