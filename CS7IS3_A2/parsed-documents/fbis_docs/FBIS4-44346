On Monday [27 June], there were calls for the question of Delors's succession to be presented to the EP. And why not? The view that the EP is not empowered to do so is correct. But no parliament has ever had powers just thrown into its lap. Power always has to be won, and this struggle never really stops. In the recent European elections, there were complaints about the low turnout and the huge gulf between the EP and the citizen. That does not have to stay that way. Next month, the EP will get a unique chance to prove itself and fight for its place in Europe. Well-informed sources do not rule out the possibility that the present EC President Jacques Delors will stay on half a year longer. Delors, according to these sources, is hesitating about presenting himself as a candidate for next year's French presidential elections. If he does not do so, then Delors would be available to lead the EC for another six months. However, this solution does not address the core of the matter: The member states will have to settle things in one way or another. Postponement will yield nothing. The stakes are high and in the first place do not concern Jean-Luc Dehaene, but Europe itself.
