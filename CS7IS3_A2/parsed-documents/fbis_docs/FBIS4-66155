"Before the summer, the month of July, we must know if we are moving ahead or marking time. If everyone continues to refuse every diplomatic breakthrough, particularly a ceasfire, we must go ahead with a thorough review of our policy," Juppe said on French radio. France has threatened to pull out all its 6,800 UN troops in former Yugoslavia, where they form the backbone of the UN Protection Force there. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, after a meeting here Thursday with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, also said Britian had no desire to maintain its troops indefinitely in Bosnia. Juppe said the "consequences must be weighed." "While we will not be able to say that we did not foresee the threats of a military escalation and a spread of the conflict, we cannot indefinitely stay where we are for several years." He said the deadlock in Bosnia must be broken in the framework of what is being proposed by an international contact group on Bosnia: "a ceasefire, an institutional and territorial arrangement within the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a reconstruction process." France hosted two-days of talks between the Contact Group -- the European Union, Russia and the United States -- and the three warring sides Wednesday and Thursday in the Alpine hideaway of Talloires, not far from Geneva. The session reached no apparent agreement, but another round was scheduled in the French resort town on June 6 and 7. The contact group negotiators tried in vain to get the factions to agree to a four-month ceasefire and to accept a European plan for partition that would give 51 percent of territory to the Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.
