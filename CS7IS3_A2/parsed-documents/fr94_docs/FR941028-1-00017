FR941028-1-00017 FR941028-1-00004 In ยง36.2(a)(4), the Commission is proposing to limit section 4(c) contract market transactions to those transactions which can ``reasonably be distinguished'' from futures or option contracts designated by the Commission for trading on a traditional contract market at the time of application to trade a section 4(c) contract market transaction. The distinguishing factors are described in relation to the contract's hedging function and/or pricing basis. The Commission will base determinations as to whether section 4(c) contract market transactions are ``reasonably distinguished'' from traditional designated futures and option contracts on the same considerations that it now applies in deciding whether proposed new futures and options contracts shall be treated as separate designation applications. Proposed ยง36.2(a)(4) is intended to address, among other things, the concerns expressed by some commenters regarding the problems of a two-tier marketplace. Although the CME and CBOT have indicated that they do not intend to trade the same contract on both a section 4(c) contract market and a traditional contract market, this provision would prevent a section 4(c) contract market transaction from trading if a traditional contract were already trading on any existing contract market. A section 4(c) contract market transaction could potentially be submitted for designation for traditional trading. If so, the full 5a(a)(12) process, including publication for comment, would be followed and further attention directed to whether delisting as a section 4(c) contract market transaction would be required. As a consequence, the concern of side-by-side trading of identical contracts subject to different trading regimes without further review is addressed by this proposal. General disclosure obligations nonetheless would require purveyors of section 4(c) contract market transactions to clarify that different rules are applicable to those transactions than for transactions traded pursuant to traditional requirements.
