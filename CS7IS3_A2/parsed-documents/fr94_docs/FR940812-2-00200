FR940812-2-00200 FR940812-2-00072 (1) A list indicating how many preferencing DDs are on the exchange and the issues in which they make markets. (2) The volume of preferenced trades and shares and the percentage of total CSE trade and share volume that preferenced activity represents. (3) The CSE's volume attributable to ITS commitments sent by other ITS participants and the percentage of such commitments in issues which have preferencing specialists. (4) The number of preferenced order effected against the National Securities Trading System (``NSTS'') limit order book. (5) The percentage of time that the CSE improves and/or matches the NBBO, and the percentage of time that the CSE achieves price improvement for customer orders when the spread is wider than 1/8 th point. 15 15 Although the BSE is not currently required to provide NBBO and price improvement data, the CSE is offering to provide this additional data because it believes that this would be helpful to the Commission in accurately assessing the contributions of preferencing to the national market system. The Commission, however, intends to generate the necessary data to facilitate adequate comparison of all NBBO data. (6) The CSE's share of Consolidated Tape trade reports, as compared to its share on the date of this extension. III. Discussion In its recent order approving the BSE's Competing Specialist proposal, the Commission articulated views and concerns regarding exchange proposals that modify traditional auction market priority rules in favor of certain members over others. The Commission is concerned about the implications of the preferencing feature and its effect on quote competition and the risk of market fragmentation through increased internalization of order flow. The Commission holds by its views in that order, and is approving the CSE proposal to extend the expiration date of the CSE perferencing program until May 18, 1995, the same date that the BSE's Competing Specialist pilot expires. During this time the CSE will monitor the pilot, collect data, and submit reports as outlined below. 16 16 The CSE is expected to monitor its pilot and provide the Commission with a report on its operation detailing how the proposal has affected the quality of CSE's market, including its effect on quote competition and market transparency. The Commission expects the CSE to demonstrate, through periodic reporting requirements outlined above and other data as the Exchange may wish to generate, that there are in fact beneficial competitive effects from the preferencing program. Specifically, the Commission expects the Exchange to analyze the effects of the program on the quality of market making by CSE DDs as a result of the enhancements/changes adopted herein. If, for any reason, the CSE cannot provide such an analysis, the Commission would have serious reservations about continuing the preferencing program. While the CSE amended the DD program following the BSE approval, the Commission continues to be concerned about changes in priority principles, Implicitly, the CSE argues that failure to provide time priority in a market place whose structure includes multiple market makers need not be inconsistent with the Act if two primary conditions are met. First, market makers protect customer limit orders consistent with the requirements and goals of the Act. This requires that the Exchange establish and enforce specific practices and standards for its members participating in the preferencing program to further the goals of investor protection. Second, the Exchange program contributes meaningfully to the national market system by narrowing the spread between the NBBO. While the CSE continues to alter its priority rules, it has taken other substantive steps to address the Division's concerns outlined in Study III of Market 2000 regarding minimum order handling principles to ensure that customers are treated fairly. The current proposal enhances customer protection by clarifying CSE Rules regarding best execution responsibilities, customer priority, and the mandatory crossing of customer orders whenever possible. Specifically, the CSE proposal not only requires as part of a members' ``best execution'' responsibilities the display of all or a representative portion of customer limit orders that are better than the ITS BBO, 17 but further requires the display of those same orders that are at the ITS BBO unless the customer expressly requests that the order not be exposed or unless the order is immediately executed. 18 The Division has stated its belief that this requirement will result in tighter spreads, provide a more accurate picture of trading interests, and contribute to improved price discovery. 19 17 When determining the amount of a limit order to expose, a broker, as part of its fiduciary duties, is charged with ensuring the best execution of a customer's order. 18 This proposed additional requirement also addresses concerns raised by various SROs in the context of the BSE Competing Specialist proposal that limit orders on the CSE are immediately executed at the ITS BBO without the opportunity for price improvement. The Commission wishes to clarify that as part of the CSE's customer priority rule 12.6, a member is obligated to execute a customer's limit order immediately upon a likepriced proprietary execution on any other market. Further, if a CSE market maker determines to route a customer limit order to another firm or exchange, the limit order will nevertheless be viewed as ``held'' by the market maker. Thus, the CSE market maker could not trade ahead of a customer limit order that it forwarded to another firm or exchange. 19 See Market 2000, Study IV, p. 6. The Exchange also has taken steps to encourage and protect customer limit orders by eliminating transaction charges on public agency limit orders and by clarifying that, under its customer priority rule, a member may hot buy or sell for its own account when it holds an unexecuted customer market or like-priced limit order in that security. Moreover, the commitment by CSE in requiring members to expose all of a representative portion of customer limit orders to the entire ITS market addresses commentator's allegations that CSE preferencing dealers do not place their limit orders on the CSE book, but rather hold the orders ``upstairs'' until the orders become marketable, and thus disadvantage their customer. Under the current proposal, even if a limit order is not placed on the CSE book, a member is required, unless instructed otherwise by a customer, to expose all or part of that limit order to the market thereby ensuring the customer order is exposed, eligible for price improvement, and adds to overall transparency of the marketplace. The CSE has represented that it will enforce specific practices and standards for its members participating in the preferencing program and the Commission expects quarterly data from the Exchange as well as a final report analyzing the effects of the program on the quality of market making by CSE DDs. Based on the above, the Commission believes it is appropriate to allow the CSE to extend, as amended, its preferencing pilot until May 18, 1995. In making this determination, the Commission has carefully considered the potential benefits from the proposed enhancements, such as better quotes, as well as the potential adverse effects of the proposal, such as the possibility of increased internalization of order flow. The Commission believes that the CSE has incorporated features in its proposal, consistent with the Division's recommendations in Market 2000, to allow it to implement on a temporary basis, an amended preferencing program. The Commission, nevertheless, believes that before the CSE proposal may be extended beyond May 18, 1995, or approved on a permanent basis, the CSE must demonstrate that its proposal resulted in added depth and liquidity to its market and improved quotations. 20 If this showing cannot be made, the Commission would not be inclined to extend the preferencing program. Accordingly, the Commission requests that the CSE provide the information it has agreed to furnish to the Commission, 21 on a quarterly basis. Further, we request the Exchange to submit a report to the Commission, discussing and analyzing the data outlined above, by January 18, 1995. 22 The report should discuss data in terms of the effects of the preferencing pilot on the quality of the CSE market with respect to depth, liquidity, and quote improvement. 23 20 The BSE will also be required to make such a showing. 21 See supra Section II. 22 The BSE report is also due by this date. 23 As noted in the BSE approval, should any other exchange attempt to implement a similar system that is acceptable to the Commission, the pilot period would be limited to the time period afforded the BSE. As a result all preferencing programs will expire May 18, 1995. At the end of this period, all systems will be subject to the same scrutiny regardless of how long they may have been in operation. IV. Conclusion The Commission finds that temporary approval of the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 24 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) because it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system. 24 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b) (1988). It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and it hereby is, approved for an additional period, ending May 18, 1995. By the Commission.
