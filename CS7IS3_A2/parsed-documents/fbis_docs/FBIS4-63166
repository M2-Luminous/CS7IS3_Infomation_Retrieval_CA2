Many national newspapers have been closely watching these changes for days. "Observers have no doubt that Chernomyrdin's position is now so firm that the president cannot afford any new appointments to the government without his consent," IZVESTIYA elaborates. As an example, the newspaper mentions the appointment of the Democratic Party leader, Nikolay Travkin, to the cabinet in order to strengthen contacts with the State Duma. "Shakhray's release from the post of the nationalities minister should hardly be construed to mean the weakening of the premier's positions. Inter-ethnic problems have traditionally been a prerogative of the president's staff, while the prime minister has been on the sidelines. Moreover, Shakhray's achievements were not over impressive for a struggle to ensue between the president and the premier around this figure," the newspaper muses. The newspaper calls "symptomatic" changes at the level of second persons in the ministries. On Chernomyrdin's initiative, the decisions on dismissing the deputy ministers of economics and finance, drafted by the government staff, have been shelved. On the contrary, economist Yakov Urinson, a former Gosplan (State Planning Committee) staffer known in the liberal-democratic circles as one of the first and few old-style staffers to actively support market reform ideas, has been given a status equal to that of minister by Chernomyrdin's decision. Sergey Aleksashenko, who has fortunately been rescued from the sacking, is "a young financier known as a first-class specialist with liberal views on the economy". The newspaper cites analysts who believe that the equilibrium in the government can be seriously tipped if Soskovets, Zaveryukha and co. prove to be stronger. "In this situation, the premier has to support the camp of pro-market liberals in his cabinet in order to safeguard the economy and his own political future". "The role of the prime minister has enhanced sharply in recent month," according to VEK, a newspaper of the business community. "The fragile centrist balance, which took shape after Viktor Chernomyrdin came to head the cabinet of ministers is being artificially broken down. It is possible that we will soon see another series of incomprehensible resignations and appointments, leading to the emergence of an absolutely new ruling elite structure," the newspaper warns. VEK surmises that "a question has been raised about creating a coalition government with the participation of the main opposition forces, which agreed to sign the national conciliation pact". It points to the appointment of Travkin as cabinet member and the premier's meeting with Zhirinovskiy, reportedly to discuss the possible bringing of an LDPR man into the government. The press, particularly the CIS publishing organ "THE BUSINESS WORLD", highlight the presidential press secretary's assertion that there is no crisis of confidence in relations between the president and the prime minister. "Political concord is in evidence. But in the course of their recent meeting, the president voiced a number of tough remarks about the cabinet relating to the shortfalls in conducting economic reform."
