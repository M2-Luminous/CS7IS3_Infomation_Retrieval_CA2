Camacho replied to charges made by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) that the government was preparing an imminent attack against EZLN positions and had bombed an area close to the southern city of Comitan, approximately 1,200 km from Mexico City. Camacho said he had sent a confidential communique to the EZLN on its main military concerns to clarify the current situation in the Chiapas conflict zone. The peace commissioner asserted that despite the tense situation in Chiapas over the past weeks, both the Mexican Army and the EZLN had respected the truce and had complied with the agreed upon cease-fire. The document signed by Manuel Camacho stated: "The dialogue and political negotiations halted the war and opened possibilities for an agreement, and this continues to be the only way to find a dignified peace in Chiapas." The murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), prompted a situation of political uncertainty regarding the peace process and presidential succession. The EZLN said the PRI candidate's murder was a cowardly act and announced that its forces would be on red alert to counter an imminent attack from government forces, which it accused of increasing their military presence and preparing a military offensive. The Zapatists accused the hard-line sectors and supporters of the military for the bloodshed in the country, Colosio's murder, and attempts to annul all peaceful efforts to democratize Mexico.
