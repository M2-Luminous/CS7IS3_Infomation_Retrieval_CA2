The Foreign Ministry revealed that the workers, 17 men and 13 women, were deported on Friday [14 January] for not having obtained work permits and for squatting in a flat in the Federal Capital. However, suspicion has since arisen that there may have been other motives in the decision to repatriate them since the government has given all illegal citizens until the end of this month to obtain the correct paperwork. Denying that the action was tantamount to state xenophobia, Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf told reporters that it was simply a legal matter and quashed speculation that the government, who announced earlier in the week that security services were being put on alert to monitor possible cases of social unrest, was participating in a "witch-hunt." Furthermore, deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said on Radio Mitre yesterday that the Peruvian Embassy was fully aware of the situation and that nothing untoward had occurred. He added that the policy was part of a bilateral agreement between the two countries which could lead to visas being required to enter the country in order to stem the tide of illegal workers from the Andean country. While the government has been attempting to play down its initial concern about the possibility of foreign and professional activists stirring up already latent frustration into violent protests, Buenos Aires Security Secretary Eduardo Pettigiani yesterday revealed that, despite assurances, the government is in a "constant state of concern." He added that the national intelligence agencies were "working overtime" in order to clamp down on any suspicious activities. In other related news yesterday ATE [Association of State Workers] State Workers' Union secretary-general Alba Luna del Castillo accused local government officials in Santiago del Estero of "sowing seeds of fear" into local residents who were contemplating taking part in Friday's protest march to commemorate last month's bloody riots. She claimed that there were almost 3000 workers in the march through the province's capital, although police estimate that there were only a third of that figure. However, she lamented what she felt was a state campaign to strike fear into local residents by raising the spectre of Sendero Luminoso involvement. In triumphant fashion Del Castillo told reporters that the march has again warned the national government of the intensity of the province's problems and that the people were demanding concrete action. One positive development yesterday was the announcement that the Santiago del Estero Provincial Bank will re-open tomorrow for the first time since December's riots. Its first task will be to distribute unpaid salaries dating back to October to many of the region's disgruntled workers.
