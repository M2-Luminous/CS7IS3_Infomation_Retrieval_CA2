The rest began the day praying. In general, people are insecure and poorly informed. Even some politicians very close to the government have said they know very little about the new economic plan. URV [Real Value Unit] is an acronym that means hope for some people and loss and injustice for others. There are various reactions to this still unclear acronym. Some people vow to incorporate it into routine life swiftly and with confidence, while others threaten to fight it with a general strike. There are many doubts about the plan. The salary deterioration issue is one of the first problems Brazilians would like to see clarified. Few people believe Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's promise that workers will not be harmed. The directors of the main Brazilian industries -- even though willing to support the change -- are concerned about the government possibly increasing the ICMS [goods and services distribution tax] and the possibility of costs being pressured by suppliers and manpower. Minister Cardoso's leading role in the plan's implementation, at the time of presidential elections, is another source of doubts. Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes: "I listened carefully to everything. The minister talked a lot but I could not understand anything. I am in the same situation as 150 million Brazilians who do not know anything. I am a good Brazilian and I want it to succeed. I will pray and ask God for the plan's success. Since I am close to the Lord of Bonfim, I will pray to him." Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban) President Alcides Tapias: "The financial sector will gradually adapt itself to the plan. Society needs to understand the URV, and the government has to control spending. The plan depends on credibility. It would be ideal to delay implementation of the new currency so society can see the government's transparent behavior. I am not concerned about strikes because the conversion of salaries is fair." General Workers Confederation [CGT] President Francisco Caninde Pegado: "The CGT has total distrust in the new government economic plan's measures. The proposal to convert salaries by an average value, disregarding February's inflation rate, leads to the conclusion that we will have major salary losses. There is no magic in this. Workers have not received an answer yet on the possible inflation rate in URV's. We cannot support a plan like that." Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Jair Meneguelli: "The plan does not have anything that can improve the economy or reduce inflation. It will produce salary deterioration, and its only merit is that it will institute a salary policy with daily adjustments. But what will happen if the inflation rate affects the URV? We will have no salary policy at all, and this could be chaos." Workers Party (PT) President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva: "Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan follows the IMF's guidance for stabilizing the currency and resolving the problems of Brazilian creditors. Even if conditions at this time are not ripe, the atmosphere for a general strike will surely develop, depending on the size of the loss that workers will suffer." Former Central Bank President Ibrahim Eris: "It is a plan that calls for moderate sacrifice from society, nothing dramatic. With the URV's adoption, difficulties will tend to disappear. Brazil's indexation is so sophisticated that only those without access to the financial sector will suffer inflation losses. That is why those people will be the main beneficiaries of the plan, of the economy's stabilization. Society will become accustomed to the new index in 60 days." Ricardo Yazbek, president of the Association of Sao Paulo Real Estate Enterprises (Secovi): "It is a plan without magic and with the conditions essential for success: The deficit was eliminated, there is a high level of reserves, and the minister has credibility." Ruy Altenfelder, director-treasurer of FIESP [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries]: "There is a consensus among entrepreneurs that the working class should not suffer salary deterioration. Anything in this regard will be negotiated." FIESP Department of Economy Director Mario Bernardini: "Everything leads to the conclusion that there will be inflationary pressure and if appropriate measures are not implemented, the inflation rate's drop will be temporary." Carlos Eduardo Uchoa Fagundes, president of the Brazilian Association of Lighting Equipment Manufacturers (Abilux): "We should not forget that it is a temporary plan. Only structural reforms, especially tax reform, can turn it into something stable." Jose Joao Locoselli, president of the Brazilian Association of Cleaning Product Manufacturers (Abipla): "If the public deficit does not disappear, we will be simply changing our currency and nothing else. An artificial plan will not resolve anything." Eduardo Capobianco, president of the Civil Construction Industry Association (Sinduscon): "Our contracts were frozen for one year because over this period the sector's index that reflects our cost variation will not be used. This can produce turbulence." Siemens President Herman Wever: "Conflicts in negotiations between enterprises will increase. But this is healthy. I have not yet reported the plan's details to our headquarters because I believe they will not understand anything." Olivetti President Enrico Misasi: "The government will have to make a great effort to implement the fiscal adjustment before replacing the real cruzeiro with another currency. Without this, I see no possibilities for controlling inflation." Ivan Botelho of the Cataguazes-Leopoldina enterprise: "The plan did not change anything and, summarizing, it is only a salary plan and a plan for controlling new contracts. There are no major changes for the population." Eduardo Eugenio Gouveia Vieira, director of the Federation of Rio de Janeiro Industries: "Article 34 of the provisional measure provides for some price control, and even seems to be a disguised freeze." Bradesco [Brazilian Discount Bank] President Lazaro de Mello Brandao: "The plan's good point is its strong budget balance. The salary policy already has been approved and the URV is being properly assimilated." Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] President Osires Silva: "I am optimistic. I believe it will work better than Argentina's Cavallo plan because in that country the measures were strongly orthodox. I believe the plan will benefit both enterprises and workers." Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) and the Paulista Bank: "The URV is simply a salary and contract index. Inflationary expectations -- which will continue -- will be embedded in the price of products." Edward Amadeo, Rio de Janeiro Catholic University economics professor: "The inflationary trend in real cruzeiros could speed up because prices are uncontrolled and some enterprises already have said they will not set prices in URV's. This would make any increase very obvious." Lawyer Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho: "The plan has been gradually discussed; it has been implemented without shocks and respecting all contracts. One of its major merits is that it is the plan that is causing the fewest number of jolts, especially in the transition period between enforcement of the URV and creation of the real." Reynaldo Goncalves, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) professor: "The government feels comfortable with its $33 billion reserve that supports the plan, but it is actually sitting on a powder keg." Celso Bastos, Sao Paulo Catholic University constitutional law professor: "In general terms, the plan is positive and more legal than all the others because it does not include conversion tables and confiscations, which were negative measures because of the distortions they caused. This plan does not imply great violence." Lawyer and taxation specialist Ives Gandra: "The bonus that the government has granted to state-run enterprises has once again created first- and second-class Brazilians. It is unethical and unjustified because the government preaches austerity." Guilherme Afif Domingos, president of the Brazilian Confederation of Commercial Associations: "The plan's success depends on the presence of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Oligopolies can manage to impose prices, but the others cannot. If businesses adjust prices by the highest rate, they will have to reduce prices in URV's after a drop in sales. My doubts refer to the plan's management because we are in a time of a presidential succession." General Motors do Brasil Vice President Andre Beer: "The plan was intelligently managed, without pressure or a freeze. There is an atmosphere of tranquillity and optimism. But we will have to see what happens with our suppliers and labor, and whether they will pressure costs. The point we feel most concerned about is the threat of the states, through the National Fiscal Policy Council (Confaz), increasing the ICMS." Sergio Reze, president of the National Federation of Vehicle Dealers (Fenabrave): "We suggested dollarization of car prices in January 1993 and we were criticized, even by the government. The URV is important because it will give consumers a reference for evaluating the real cost of products. Most car manufacturers are already adjusting prices on a daily basis, and the trend is to immediately adopt the URV." Luiz Adelar Scheuer, president of the National Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers (Anfavea): "Everybody tends to adopt the URV. What we should now is see the behavior of taxes, raw material prices, and salaries. If they are increased, this will be passed on in final prices. But I do not think there will be cost increases."
