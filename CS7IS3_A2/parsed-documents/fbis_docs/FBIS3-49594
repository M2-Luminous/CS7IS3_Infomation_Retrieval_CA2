This move was on the agenda of a cabinet meeting yesterday, but the minister withdrew his resignation after a long talk with the prime minister. Mr. Aleksandrov neither confirmed nor denied the press reports of a row between him and President Zhelev. According to the press, the delegation of extraordinary powers to the president's military office has provoked the scandal. The defence minister did not agree to the army being commanded by two authorities, 24 CHASA, says, commenting on the possible causes of Mr. Aleksandrov's resignation. According to observers, the pressure put on Valentin Aleksandrov was intended to wear down his resistance to the replacement of General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General Staff of the Army, 24 CHASA adds. "Zhelev Models Military Office in Royal Fashion," the Socialists' daily DUMA says in a frontpage headline. The daily also writes about differences between the defence minister and President Zhelev on the powers of president's military office.
