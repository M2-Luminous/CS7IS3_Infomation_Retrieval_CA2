Noting that the universal elimination of nuclear weapons must be realized at an early date for peace of mankind, the letter said: To this end, the United States, "a chief nuclear culprit" which was the first in the world to develop and use nuclear weapons and, at present, has the largest number of them, must eliminate its nuclear weapons first and, for the present, withdraw all its nuclear weapons from South Korea and Northeast Asia. The international reactionary forces including the United States must give up their dirty nuclear intrigue against the North, and the nuclear armament of South Korea and the Japanese authorities being promoted with their tacit approval must be stopped at once. The letter said Hanminjon will always merge its voice of justice with the Greenpeace in active response to its just initiative and appeal and make all efforts to expand the movement for their realization everywhere Hanminjon is present and to all the governments, political parties and organizations with which it has contact.
