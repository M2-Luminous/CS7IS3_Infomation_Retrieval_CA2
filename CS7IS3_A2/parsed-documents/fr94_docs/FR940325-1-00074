FR940325-1-00074 FR940325-1-00008 The proposed rule would clarify that all grazing permits and leases issued, including the transfer or renewal of permits and leases, would include terms and conditions addressing the national requirements and standards and guidelines proposed under subpart 4180, as well as terms and conditions establishing allowable levels, seasons and duration of use, and other terms and conditions that would assist in achieving management objectives, provide for proper range management, or assist in the orderly administration of the public rangelands. Terms and conditions reflecting the national requirements proposed under subpart 4180 would begin being incorporated in grazing permits and leases as permits and leases are issued, including transfer or renewal, upon the effective date of the rule. Standards and guidelines for grazing administration would be reflected in the terms and conditions of grazing permits and leases upon their completion or, in the absence of the completion of State or regional standards and guidelines, as the fallback standards and guidelines presented in section 4180.2 of this proposed rule become effective. A new paragraph has been added in addition to those presented in the advance notice to make clear the requirements for consultation with interested parties prior to the issuance or renewal of grazing permits and leases. The provision of the advance notice that would prevent the renewal of permits and leases when the permittees or lessees are found to be in repeated noncompliance with the terms and conditions of expiring grazing permits or leases has been removed from this section. Section 4110.1_Mandatory qualifications, would require that applicants for renewal must be determined to be in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of their grazing permit or lease. In assessing whether an applicant for renewal is in substantial compliance, the authorized officer would consider the number of prior incidents of noncompliance with the requirements of 43 CFR part 4100, as well as the nature and seriousness of any single incident of noncompliance. Therefore, a separate provision in this section is deemed to be unnecessary. The provision of the advance notice that applicants for renewal would be required to be found to not be in violation of the provisions of 43 CFR part 4100 has been removed. Section 4170.1&hyph;1_Penalty for violations, in the existing regulations provides for withholding issuance of permits and leases when applicants are in violation of the provisions of this part. The provision of the advance notice that would prohibit the offer or grant of permits and leases when the applicant refuses to accept the terms and conditions of the offered permit or lease has been amended to clarify that it would apply to applicants for renewal and new permits and leases. The proposed rule clarifies the application for and granting of conservation use and temporary nonuse. Conservation use would be established as one of the allowable uses a permittee or lessee may be granted. The existing regulations grant the authorized officer the discretion to place forage in nonuse for conservation purposes. The change from the term ``nonuse for conservation purposes'' to ``conservation use'' is intended to clarify that conservation use is allowable, when in conformance with applicable land use plans, activity plans and standards and guidelines, and will allow the Department to fulfill one of the requirements of the Taylor Grazing Act, which is to ``preserve land and its resources from destruction or unnecessary injury'' (43 U.S.C. 315a). Forage made available as a result of temporary nonuse may be authorized for temporary use by another operator. Forage used for conservation purposes would not be available to other livestock operators. The procedures guiding approval of nonuse are proposed in response to a recommendation from the March 19, 1986, Inspector General's review of the grazing management program.
