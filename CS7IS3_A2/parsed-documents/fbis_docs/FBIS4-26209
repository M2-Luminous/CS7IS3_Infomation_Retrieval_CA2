The circular says: In disregarding the relevant regulations of the CPCCC and the State Council, a small number of localities recently issued lottery tickets without the authorization of the State Council. The departments concerned are now dealing with this problem. To safeguard the overall state of the national economy, to ensure social stability, and to exercise strict control over lottery ticket markets, the General Office of the CPCCC and the State Council General Office, with the approval of the CPCCC and the State Council, hereby issue the following requirements: 1. The 1991 "Circular of the State Council Concerning the Strengthening the Management of Lottery Ticket Markets" and the 1993 "Circular of the State Council Concerning the Further Strengthening the Management of Lottery Ticket Markets" clearly stipulate that only the State Council has the authority to approve the issuance of lottery tickets, and that no other localities and departments have such authority. The handling of lottery tickets whose issuance has been approved should be carried out in accordance with the plans approved by the State Council. The number of such lottery tickets issued or the methods of their issue should not be changed without authorization. Lottery tickets whose numbers are freely chosen by purchasers (including "six-number combination lottery tickets," "four-number combination lottery tickets" and "lottery tickets with numbers from 1 to 10,000") shall not be issued. The issuance of lottery tickets that are jointly sponsored by Chinese and foreign enterprises on China's territory shall be stopped. Relevant agreements reached with foreign partners concerning the lottery tickets are null and void. The circular issued by the General Office of the CPCCC and the State Council General Office reiterates that all localities and departments should conscientiously carry out this circular. They should not violate it for any reason. 2. All localities should conduct a self-examination drive to consolidate local lottery ticket markets. Rectifying measures should be taken in a set period for any lottery tickets that were issued by localities and departments, including lottery tickets whose numbers could be freely chosen by purchasers and lottery tickets that were jointly sponsored by Chinese and foreign enterprises on China's territory. In addition, conscientious efforts should be made to handle the problems arising from the cancellation of these lottery tickets. If localities and units still ignore orders and prohibitions and continue to approve or issue lottery tickets or purposely postpone the self-examination drive to consolidate the lottery ticket markets, their responsible leaders should be dealt with severely. 3. Printing firms not possessing the authorization to print lottery tickets are not allowed to print them. Printing firms which are assigned to print lottery tickets should not print any lottery tickets without first getting authorization from the State Council or from the departments authorized by the State Council. People's governments in all localities should organize local public security bureaus, industrial and commercial administrations, people's banks, and other relevant departments to strengthen the supervision and inspection of printing firms so as to exercise strict control over them. 4. Relevant departments of the State Council should strengthen their supervision and management of lottery ticket markets. The People's Bank of China is an organ under the State Council that is in charge of matters relating to lottery tickets. The People's Bank of China, with help from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the State Physical Cultural and Sports Commission, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, should try to do a good job of managing lottery ticket markets.
