[Begin Vargas recording, in Spanish with passage-by-passage translation into Polish] We discussed all issues concerning military cooperation, and I think we can become partners in the European Union soon. [end recording] [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] This agreement sanctions the reality that has been a fact for some years now. Our close cooperation links have been in existence since 1990, with varying degrees of intensity. This agreement, unlike other standard bilateral agreements, does not contain any secret clauses. It simply constitutes a legal basis for making our cooperation more dynamic. When it comes to our plenary talks, I would like to emphasize with great satisfaction that Minister Vargas said in a very clear and decisive way not only on his own behalf but also on behalf of the Spanish Government that Spain will forcefully support our aspirations toward integration into the West European structures, the economic and defense structures.
