As the nation's economic potential increased the great leader President Kim Il-song took steps to systematically reduce the tax burdens upon the population and saw to it that the taxes including the agricultural tax in kind were abolished by degrees. And in March, 1974, he proclaimed to the whole world a decree on totally eliminating the tax system at the 3rd meeting of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly. Thus, the DPRK became the first tax-free country in human history. In his report, Hong Sok-hyong, alternate Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the state planning commission, said the total elimination of the taxes in Korea was a brilliant crystalization of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song's grand strategic plan to free the Korean people who had been freed from exploitation and oppression even from the fetters of leftovers of the old society and provide an independent and creative life for them, and another great feat performed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the course of carrying forward the revolutionary cause of chuche through to completion. He said the total elimination of taxes in Korea had a great inspiring effect on the working class and other labouring masses in capitalist countries who were molested by exploitation and oppression and weighed down under exacting taxation and, through a vivid reality, showed the peoples of different countries who set about the building of a new society, freed from the imperialist colonial yoke, and the revolutionary people fighting for the rebuilding of socialism that socialism was the only way of attaining development and prosperity of the country and bringing genuine happiness to the people. He pointed out that communist policies including the universal free medical care system, the free compulsory education system, the popular social insurance system and social security system and the food policy are in force in the DPRK now, enabling all the people to enjoy a dignified and happy life evenly in all domains of politics, the economy and culture. He stressed the need to cherish the great national pride and honour of living in the tax-free country and defend and further exalt the Korean-style socialism. "In order to step up the revolution and construction and defend and further glorify the socialism of our own style centred on the masses in sharp confrontation with the enemy, we must uphold the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with loyalty," the reporter said. The meeting was attended by Yi Chong-ok, member of the Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], WPK and vice-president, and other senior party and state officials and working people in the city.
