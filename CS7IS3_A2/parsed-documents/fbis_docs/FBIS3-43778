The president speaks here on the outcome of these two meetings, beginning with Air Afrique: [Begin Ousmane recording] The first phase of our deliberations centered on our multinational airline, Air Afrique, which, as you know, is in an extremely difficult situation. This is not very surprising because air transport has generally been facing serious difficulties over the past few years owing to a combination of several factors on the African continent and worldwide. [passage omitted] It was therefore necessary that this situation be reviewed and steps taken to ensure the airline's survival. This is what we did. What is worth noting is that steps were taken to recapitalize this company and draw up another rescue plan aimed at restoring its smooth operations. As you know, the chairman and managing director of the airline was reelected and a number of specific recommendations were made aimed at avoiding a relapse into the past situation. I must stress that our French partners played a key role by making a fairly substantial contribution to this rescue plan. The various states were also requested to make significant contributions in proportion to their financial standing. A contribution of 100 million CFA is not much compared to 18 billion CFA francs to be provided by the other side. However, in view of the hard times, it represents something all the same. On the whole, what we can say is that we got in step with the times, so to speak. [passage omitted] The second meeting involved examining the situation of member countries of the franc zone. We all know the outcome -- the devaluation of the CFA franc, which now moves from the previous exchange rate of 1 French franc [Fr] to 50 CFA francs to a rate of Fr1 to 100 CFA francs. Taking into account the present predicament of a number of countries, including Niger, this actually seems to be quite a high devaluation. If we examine the reevaluation rate of this currency in each country, we realize that the rates differ. As far as the Niger economy is concerned, this rate is relatively lower than that which has been adopted. But then, we are in a monetary zone. There is a certain degree of solidarity which must be maintained if we really want to enable the various countries to continue to enjoy the benefits that go with belonging to a single monetary zone and to forestall speculation. This is so because, since this currency is still overvalued, a devaluation at a relatively low rate would just encourage businessmen to speculate by saying to themselves: Well, this is a first devaluation and there must be others in the pipeline. Obviously that would not get us anywhere, because the investments which stopped will not resume. The flight of capital will not end and people will continue to wait. With this rate, which is quite significant, people will say: That's right. The devaluation has been done once and for all. We can now go ahead. Everyone is clear in their mind and knows that surely there will be no further devaluation. There is that advantage. There is also the considerable advantage of ensuring that with this operation a certain number of problems faced by our countries can begin to get resolved, namely, the competitiveness of our various economies and the competitiveness of the various products manufactured in our countries either for domestic consumption or for export. Also, such an operation enables us to cope with a number of problems, particularly the fact that for some time now in the various franc zone countries investments have ground to a halt. We cannot continue this way. The crisis has led our countries to attempt a number of adjustment programs and adopt internal measures. These measures have shown their limitations. We must envisage new measures which will enable the population to increase their production, settle down to work once more, and equally earn substantial income to be able to save and later invest. They should also offer foreign investors opportunities so that they bring in adequate capital to enable investments to restart. It is only through investments that we can secure economic growth and improve the living conditions of the people. This is very important, because we must not look at this devaluation solely from a negative angle. We must not. As I said a short while ago, this is not the first time a devaluation is being carried out in our African countries. For the franc zone, it is perhaps the first time because that last setting of parity rate between the French franc and the CFA franc dates as far back as 1948. That was a long time ago. Nowhere in the world can one find a similar situation. Our economies now are very competitive with each other, and the parity rates of the various currencies fluctuate permanently. It must be stated that the pegging of these rates and the time that this has lasted really constitute a record. What should be borne in mind here is that we must avoid panicking. Indeed, we must not panic. We must not embark on speculation cycles either. I have just learned that at our drugstores and some business houses, people have already begun to increase prices. Why should that be? That cannot be justified. There is absolutely no reason today, tomorrow, or the day after for a Niger businessman, or for that matter any businessman in the country, to increase prices. That cannot be justified. On what basis will it be? Devaluation ultimately has a certain propensity to push up prices, but we need to wait for the various mechanisms to come into play before this inflationist trend begins. A number of measures were adopted precisely to contain this trend. We must avoid speculation and ensure that each of us plays the game honestly by avoiding pointless speculation and fraud, because the goods in stock or on the shelves at the moment are not in any way affected by this change of parity taking effect today. Things must be clearly understood and our various business organizations should see in this operation an opportunity opening to them -- an opportunity to make a fresh start, generally speaking. This is what we can say about these summits. It was very tough; it was very difficult; but we must say, especially with regard to countries like Niger, that we came out positively. Among the backup measures, there were some which were very specific to our country. The agreements reached constitute a good thing and it is up to us to mobilize fully so that together we may tide over the crisis and set the national economy on the move once more. After the deliberations on the change of CFA-French franc parity, we also conferred among ourselves as UMOA members. As you are aware, a number of initiatives have been undertaken for some time now. There was the experts' meeting and that of the various ministers of finance, economy, planning, and commerce on all matters relating to our UMOA. It was felt that we no longer treat economic and monetary concerns separately. Nowadays the two concerns are intimately linked. We decided to ensure that all these issues are examined in the same manner. This is why all the various meetings I mentioned earlier produced a draft treaty instituting the West African Economic and Monetary Union [UEMOA]. This treaty marks the birth of a new union which, in a way, is an improvement over UMOA. It will have a high governing body which will be the heads of state and government, and a ministerial council. There will also be --and this is a novelty -- a commission composed of parliamentarians of the 16-member UEMOA, which will in a way serve as an executive organ of the union. This is also a decisive turning point in the process of integrating our economies as well as an action [words indistinct] with this decision to review the CFA-French franc exchange rate. In other words, the African integration process as a whole is on course and we hope that our businessmen will be dynamic enough to not only take part in the various actions enabling the recovery of our national economy, but also ensure our effective presence on the vast West African market which is unfolding.
