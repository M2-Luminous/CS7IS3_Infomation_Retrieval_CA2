Shortly before the trial opened, Iranian Information Minister 'Ali Fallahian asked the Federal Government to quash the proceedings dealing with the question of Iranian state-sponsored terrorism, Schmidbauer, coordinator of the German intelligence services in the Chancellor's Office, confirmed at the Mykonos trial at the Berlin Court of Appeal on Thursday [17 March]. Schmidbauer emphasized that he strictly declined to meet this wish expressed by the Iranian side, because the trial was exclusively a case for the independent German judicial authorities. Shortly after his meeting with Fallahian in October 1993, Schmidbauer answered with a clear no to a question raised in the Bundestag whether the Mykonos killings were discussed in his meeting with Fallahian. According to the investigations of the Federal Public Prosecutor, Fallahian may have ordered the attack in which four Iranian opposition leaders were assassinated in the Berlin "Mykonos" restaurant on 17 September 1992.
