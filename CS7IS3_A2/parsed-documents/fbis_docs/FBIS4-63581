It Is Russia which Needs `Partnership for Peace' Most of All, Scientists Believe"] [Text] Scientists from the Russian Center for Problems of National Security and International Relations headed by Professor, Doctor of Historical Sciences Sergey Rogov have prepared a 33-page report entitled "Partnership for Peace and Russia's Interests." In it they analyzed the political, military-economic, and military-technical aspects of the NATO program and made recommendations on the possible terms of our country's affiliation to this document. The independent scientists' main conclusion is this: Russia's long-term geopolitical interests demand the country's immediate entry into talks with the NATO countries for the purpose of affiliation to that program. In this regard "Partnership for Peace" must unfailingly take into account Russia's special status and role in Europe and the world and its broad potential for influencing the course of political processes and ensure the strict observance of its national interests. What arguments do the authors of the report present? They assert that the problem of Russia's participation in "Partnership for Peace" is primarily a question of defining our state's place in the new system of international relations which has developed since the end of the Cold War. Its present position can hardly be called satisfactory. We have no reliable allies and partners today. Russia has an urgent need for integration into the world market as a great power and not as a "poor relation" or a source of cheap raw materials and labor. Of course, the scientists say, to be on a par with the other centers of power in the world arena we must fully implement our reforms and realize the country's vast economic potential. Only then will people really take notice of us. Nor can we forget the foreign policy priorities. Russia, like any other state, has its own legitimate interests. They have nothing to do with imperial ambitions or superpower pretensions but the country's security, that is to say, its survival and development as a prosperous democratic state, demands that world political questions that affect us should not be resolved at the Russian Federation's expense. The logic of passively waiting for things to happen and of deliberate "nonintervention" must be alien to us, the scientists say. On the contrary, it is only Russia's active participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program which will offer it the opportunity of exerting practical influence on the architecture of the future system of European security and of playing a major role worthy of a great country in it on an equal footing. There is no alternative here, the scientists argue, and ambiguity cannot be allowed. Either the Russian and Western military and politicians cooperate or else a flawed system of suspicion and hostility will sooner or later prevail. We already know what that leads to. Undoubtedly if you analyze the documents forming the basis of "Partnership for Peace" you can say that it contains ideological postulates which are of a declarative nature. A precise mechanism for maintaining pan-European equilibrium has not been elaborated or approved yet but nevertheless the values which they proclaim do correspond to our country's long-term geopolitical interests. Furthermore, in the scientists' opinion, NATO's new strategic concept does not conflict with our country's interests. It is based on the principles of ensuring the strictly defensive character of that alliance by reducing the levels of those forces maintained in a high state of combat readiness and major groupings, and on focusing efforts on the prevention of war and on the settlement of crises by peaceful means. We are also pleased that NATO has embarked on the sharp reduction of military spending and the numerical strength of its armed forces. By 1997 their number in Central Europe will be down by 50 percent and their naval forces will be reduced by 10 percent. In the scientists' opinion, there is no real foundation to the current opinion that our participation in the program will place an intolerable burden on the Russian economy and will destroy its defense industry once and for all as a result of the "standardization of arms and military hardware" which is mentioned in the document. Within NATO itself such attempts have been made a number of times but have met with extremely modest success. Each state which has joined it has staunchly defended the interests of its own military industry. That is why the French are still flying Mirages, the Americans their F-15s and F-18s, the Italians their Tornadoes, and the Germans, among other things, the MiG-29. In addition, everyone understands that it is effectively impossible to resolve the rearmament problem in the foreseeable future -- it will cost too much money. But giving the various countries' armed forces the potential to operate jointly and creating a unified command and control system for them, including computerized command and control, is a different matter. At the technical level, this presupposes first of all the unification of certain radio frequencies and the upgrading of receiving and transmitting equipment and, at the level of organization and training, it means the elaboration of a broad program to teach personnel a common language and a single understanding of military commands and terms. All these things are already happening when joint peacemaking operations are carried out. The terms of "Partnership for Peace", the scientists believe, are in fact just the outer shell which still has to be filled with actual content. This may also depend on the joint work of specialists from Russia and the NATO countries. No initiative should be dismissed out of hand if we do not want to miss the boat which will leave for the future without us. What are the conditions and principles of affiliation to the "Partnership for Peace" program that the scientists of the Center for Problems of Russia's National Security consider acceptable for Russia? The first is that our country's entry into "Partnership for Peace" will mean the practical embodiment of the long-term Russian strategy aimed at moving from military-political confrontation with the West to strategic partnership with it in the military-political sphere. In this regard Russia must be guided by its own national interests without claiming any privileges but without waiving the legitimate right to equal security either. Russia's paramount, priority goal in this program is the prevention of a new split of Europe, the arms race, and military confrontation, this time on our western borders -- around Smolensk and Bryansk. It is only by being part of this program that Russia will be able to influence the creation of an all-European collective security system and prevent the rapid expansion of NATO by means of former Warsaw Pact members. At the same time, it is necessary to clearly determine what commitments Russia and the NATO countries will undertake toward one another. There can be no disagreements or ambiguities here. Our state is ready to accept the same degree of responsibility which the NATO members accept toward it. In the process it expects firm guarantees that if there is a threat to its national interests, Russia can count on the full support of its partners. "Partnership" will not hinder the development of close ties between our country and its Asian neighbors, first and foremost with China. Russia cannot accept the idea that the crucial questions of international security are resolved without its participation and especially at its expense. Consequently, NATO, of which it is not a member, must not try to assume the role of an arbiter of other people's destinies. It is absolutely clear that the present mechanism of decisionmaking in NATO is inadequate here. Different, more democratic and mutually acceptable forms are needed, within the CSCE framework, for instance. It is also necessary to define the specific forms of peacemaking cooperation within the "Partnership" framework. Russia is ready to take part in it under the auspices of the United Nations or the CSCE and also the CIS. But the kind of solution in which NATO is its initiator and we merely the mute executant does not befit to our country. Unilateral steps are unacceptable here. If all the members of the bloc and the other European states accept such an approach, world peace will be reliably ensured. One of the conditions which our scientists envisage for Russia's affiliation to the new NATO program is the harmonization of Western and Russian standards in the production of arms and combat hardware. Not only must access to the traditional markets of Central and Eastern Europe not be barred to our weapons makers but access to the internal markets of NATO and other countries must also be opened up. Only then will partnership be real and not merely rhetorical. The political games surrounding our country's affiliation to the the process of creating the new Europe, the unpredictable vacillation, and especially the delay in stating its firm position with regard to the "Partnership" program and the signing of the necessary documents, the scientists believe, could leave us in an impasse from which we will not be able to escape.
