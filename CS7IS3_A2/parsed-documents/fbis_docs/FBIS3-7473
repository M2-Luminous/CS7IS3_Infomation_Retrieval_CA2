This time we would like to talk about his sabotage activities while he was in Vietnam as well as what he is doing now in a foreign country, and the real objectives of these activities. When he was in Vietnam, Nguyen Xuan Chu told the police of the former southern province of Nghia Binh during an interrogation: I was born and grew up under the U.S. puppet regime, the political system full of dark [word indistinct]. As a result, I was influenced by the U.S. puppet's [word indistinct] allegations against the revolution. After the liberation of southern Vietnam in 1975, a number of people in the name of the leaders of the United Vietnam Buddhist Church; the An Quang faction; and a number of bad friends, including Huyen Quang in the Dharma Institute, who had hostile ideas and activities against the revolution, directly incited and guided me to act against the state and people. Huyen Quang, at his own free will, made use of his position at the time of the liberation, to initiate a policy with political undertones, not corresponding to the nature of a traditional appeal [words indistinct]. He compiled a document entitled: BUDDHISM IN THE NEW SITUATION, in which he advocated non-cooperation with the revolutionary administration. Huyen Quang made use of his prestige to cheat people and abuse the trust and enthusiasm of Buddhist followers as well as the obedience of the local Buddhist churches and followers to stir up hostile activities, pushing them onto a sinful road against the administration. I am one of these victims. However, since he arrived in Australia, particularly over the last few years, Nguyen Xuan Chu has acted against the Vietnamese people's revolutionary cause and the national renovation process. He has incited some MPs to use their influence on their government as well as on the governments of other countries to maintain the embargo against Vietnam and restrict their cooperative relations with Vietnam. He collected signatures of Vietnamese Buddhist followers and residents of Australia for a letter sent to the Australian Parliament, supporting hostile and opposition activities. He has coordinated with Vo Dai Ton,and reactionary groups in carrying out sabotage activities against Vietnam. Together with the group of Vo Van Ai, and Thich (Vien) Ly, he organized meetings, demonstrations, and hunger strikes and made use of the mass media to slander Buddhist affairs. It was reported by many people in Australia that Nguyen Xuan Chu is specializing in trading goods and furniture for Buddhist monks, nuns, and followers. He has been made bankrupt, and there are possibilities that his property will be confiscated by the Australian Court. Therefore, Nguyen Xuan Chu is trying to smear and slander the situation of Buddhism in Vietnam to raise funds among Vietnamese residents abroad, including reactionary organizations in exile, for the so called support for the struggle of Buddhists at home. But in fact he has put all the money in his own pocket. These activities of Nguyen Xuan Chu have been protested against by Buddhists in Australia, and exposed by the press there. However, the matter remains unknown to many Buddhists in Vietnam and many Vietnamese residents in France, Canada, and the United States. Nguyen Xuan Chu is one of those people who, for their own interests, are ready to carry out any activities, including those against their own nation, people, and friends.
