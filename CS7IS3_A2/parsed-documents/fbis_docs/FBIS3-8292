Monika Olejnik spoke to the professor, who is now working for the UN European Economic Commission in Geneva: [Begin Rosati recording] I would like to have a sufficient degree of autonomy and independence in managing economic affairs, which would ensure the effectiveness of the economic policy. To put it briefly, the aim would be that the government should speak with one voice on economic affairs. Second, I would like to have the approval of the prime minister and of those who will decide that it is I who should be looking after finances and economic affairs--an approval with respect to the general directions of economic policy--not just for three months but perhaps for a medium-term period. [end recording] The coalition partners will discuss Prof. Rosati's candidacy on 8 March. The president will decide whether to approve Prof. Rosati's nomination after his return to Poland, Andrzej Drzycimski, the president's spokesman, told PAP. Lech Walesa is returning to Poland tomorrow. Drzycimski said that the coalition should make decisions that are acceptable to the president. However, as to the question of whether the decision on Prof. Rosati's candidacy was acceptable to Walesa, Drzycimski only said: I do not know. Some time ago, the president said that he would not accept Rakowski [Poland's former communist prime minister].
