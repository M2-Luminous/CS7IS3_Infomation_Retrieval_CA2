This is a sign that the overall strength of China's rural economy has grown further. At present, there are 4,989 townships and towns each of which has more than 100 million yuan of rural output value. Of them, 72 exceed 1 billion yuan each and 434 exceed 500 million yuan each. The order of the first 10 townships and towns whose output value exceeds 100 million yuan each is: Caigongzhuang township of Jinghai county in Tianjin, Qianzhou town of Wuxi county and Shengze town of Wujiang city in Jiangsu, Beijiao town and Guizhou town of Shunde City in Guangdong, Ninghai town of Mouping county in Shandong, Xinzhaizi town in the Ganjingzi district of Dalian in Liaoning, Maqiao township of in the Minhang district of Shanghai, and Zhouzhuang town of Jiangyang city and the Luoshe town of Wuxi county in Jiangsu. The assessment was made by the China Rural Society Economic Assessment Center under the State Statistical Bureau in the light of the 1992 figures. Judging from the statistics of these nearly 5,000 townships and towns, we find the following characteristics: First, they have powerful economic strengths. Although the 100- million-yuan townships and towns only account for 10 percent of China's total townships and towns and only 20 percent of the rural population, yet they produce half of China's rural output value and 2/3 of the rural industrial output value. Second, they have a high degree of rural industrialization. The non-farming proportion of these townships and towns reaches as high as 88.2 percent, 24 percentage points higher than the national percentage. Third, their enterprises have an economy of scale. The output value of the enterprises of these townships and towns already accounts for 52.8 percent of the total output value of township and town enterprises in China, their enterprise scale is 73.8 percent higher than the national scale, their average labor [lao jun 0525 0971] output value is 62.6 percent, and they produce four times as much profits and taxes as the national average. Fourth, 100-million-yuan townships and towns are found everywhere in economically developed coastal areas. Jiangsu has 944 such townships and towns, which is the highest number and which accounts for nearly half of the province's total townships and towns, whereas Shandong has 892, Zhejiang 538, and Guangdong 425.
