The initiative by Moscow, which was itself customarily invited to take part in other states' ambitious projects, has drawn a reserved reaction. One that borders on suspicion. History knows various sorts of congresses that were summoned by the great of this world to take stock of the results of wars and revolutions. Recently, however, such multilateral summits have taken place mainly under the UN Security Council aegis. But this time Yeltsin has invited world leaders to transcend the cozy framework of the United Nations, to say nothing of NATO, in order to organize a great-power get-together. For the West, this initiative indeed is reminiscent of a frightening specter of a reversal in Russian policy, the renaissance of A. Gromyko's fancy idea that none of the world's political issues could be resolved without Moscow. In the past few years, the world seemed to have learned to do without Moscow, which is why the latter's claims to a role in the establishment of the world order, if read between lines, have been recognized as excessive. This is particularly surprising against the backdrop of behind-the-scenes promises that Russia will attend political debates of the Group of Seven on a permanent basis, if not become a full member of the elite world club. Apparently, it was still important that Russia was invited to acquire the status of a great power. This time around it seems as if Russia were inviting them. Dances to which ladies invite gentlemen are clearly not in vogue in the West. How is it that the Americans and their allies are trying to circumvent Russia's proposal without arousing much fuss? There are a number of options. First of all, the West would try to speed up the emerging rapprochement between the Muslims and the Croats, that is, between participants in the conflict on whom Russia has only a limited influence. Hence, the idea of a comprehensive conference that would resolve all the problems under a package deal will die a natural death. Also possible are "disappointing" incidents, such as yet another spy scandal, that bring progress in Russian-American relations to naught. Finally, the idea of such a conference, if adopted by NATO, would have forced the North Atlantic bloc drastically to adjust its previously adopted line of conduct based on strength. Apparently, this would have deprived the Western alliance of the freedom of balancing on the verge of a power solution. That is to say, a solution the specter of which has ensured the West's complete domination in the Balkans for a number of months. Measures based on the use of force, such as yesterday's downing of Serb aircraft, will entirely exclude Russia from the Balkan concert. On the contrary, a conference would only have fixed its place in the future system of security guarantees for the post- Yugoslav countries.
