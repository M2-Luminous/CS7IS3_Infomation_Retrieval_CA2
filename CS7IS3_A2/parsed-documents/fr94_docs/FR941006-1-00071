FR941006-1-00071 FR941006-1-00015 Questions have also arisen regarding the costs of ``positioning'' flights that are needed to bring the government aircraft from one stop where it dropped off the candidate and campaign staff to another stop where it will pick them up to continue the trip or return to the point of origin. New language in sections 9004.7(b)(5)(ii) and 9034.7(b)(5)(ii) would incorporate the Commission's policy that the committee should pay the costs noted above for one passenger plus fuel used and crew time. This approach recognizes that positioning flights are campaign-related, and therefore these costs are properly treated as qualified campaign expenses. Paragraphs (b)(5)(iii) in sections 9004.7 and 9034.7 would contain provisions regarding travel on government conveyances other than airplanes. For travel by helicopter or ground conveyance, the commercial rental rate should be paid for a comparable conveyance in terms of size, model and make. Additional guidance on this area can be found in Advisory Opinion 1992&hyph;34. Proposed sections 9004.7(b)(5)(iv) and 9034.7(b)(5)(iv) would continue to require payment for the use of accommodations paid for by a government entity. Under 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1)(iii)(B), the committee should use the usual and normal charge in the market from which it ordinarily would have purchased the accommodations. The term ``accommodations'' includes both lodging and meeting rooms. New paragraph (B)(8) of these sections would explicitly reflect Commission policy that travel on corporate conveyances is governed by 11 CFR 114.9(e). Finally, new language in paragraph (b)(2) of these sections would provide additional guidance as to when a stop will be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, making or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the nomination, election or defeat of any candidate. See, e.g., AOs 1994&hyph;15, 1992&hyph;6, and opinions cited therein. The Commission has also indicated that the absence of solicitations for contributions or express advocacy regarding candidates will not preclude a determination that an activity is ``campaign related.'' Id. Accordingly, the proposed rules would include other factors to be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related. The rules would also retain the current language indicating that incidental campaign-related contacts during an otherwise noncampaign-related stop would not cause the stop to be considered campaign-related. 5. Winding Down Costs; Gifts and Bonuses The current regulations at 11 CFR 9004.4(a)(4)(i) and 9034.4(a)(3)(i) permit candidates to receive contributions and matching funds, and make disbursements, for the purpose of defraying winding down costs over an extended period after the candidate's date of ineligibility [``DOI'']. These amounts are treated as qualified campaign expenses, and can result in additional audit fieldwork and preparation of addenda to audit reports to focus on these receipts and disbursements. The Commission is proposing several ways to streamline and shorten the audit process, discussed below. In addition, comments are welcome on whether the amount that a candidate may receive for winding down costs should be limited to no more than a flat dollar amount, or a set percentage of the candidate's total expenditures during the campaign, or a set percentage of total matching funds certified for the candidate. If so, what should the amount or percentage be? If campaigns receive a set dollar amount, but do not use the entire amount for winding down costs, should they be permitted to retain the unspent amount? Allowing them to keep the remainder would serve as an incentive to complete the winding down process promptly. However, there are public policy reasons for requiring the remaining funds to be returned to the U.S. Treasury. Placing a cap on winding down expenses would assist the Commission's goal of streamlining, but the amount chosen would have to be sufficient to meet reasonable expenses incurred in winding down the campaign. Another option would be to establish a cutoff date after which winding down expenses would not longer be considered qualified campaign expenses. Other suggestions that would simplify and shorten the required audit process are encouraged. The proposed rules do not include language regarding these proposals. The Commission seeks comments on new language in section 9034.4(A) incorporating the current practice of permitting publicly-funded primary committees to treat 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after the candidate's date of ineligibility (DOI) as exempt compliance expenses, beginning with the first full reporting period after DOI. See, Financial Control and Compliance Manual for Presidential Primary Candidates Receiving Public Financing, p. 25 (January, 1992). Please note that this approach does not apply to expenses incurred during the period between DOI and the date on which a candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to campaign. Similarly, for general election candidates, new language would be added to section 9004.4(a) to allow 100% of salary and overhead expenses incurred after the end of the expenditure report period to be paid from the legal and accounting compliance fund, provided these expenses are solely to ensure compliance with the FECA and the Fund Act. Finally, new language in sections 9004.4(a) and 9034.4(a) would permit campaign committees to use federal funds to defray the costs of gifts or monetary bonuses for committee staff and consultants, as long as the gifts do not exceed $150 per individual and as long as all gifts and bonuses (except bonuses provided for at the outset in employment and consulting contracts) are limited to $20,000. This approach is somewhat similar to a provision included in the public funding rules for convention committees at 11 CFR 9008.7(a)(4)(xii). See 59 FR 33618 (June 29, 1994). With regard to bonus arrangements provided for in advance in employment and consulting contracts, comments are sought on whether the amount of these bonuses should be restricted to a fixed percentage of the compensation paid as provided by the contract, or whether these bonuses should be subject to the overall $20,000 limit. Such an approach would be intended to ensure that committees do not give out sizable bonuses simply because they have surplus public funds at the end of the campaign.
