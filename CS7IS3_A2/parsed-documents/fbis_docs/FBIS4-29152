Russia is a large trading partner of Vietnam and the country is still regarded as the powerful nation in the eyes of a large number of people in the world. On this occasion, the Voice of Vietnam brings you a review of economic relations between Vietnam and Russia, and also between Russia and other countries. To broaden economic ties with the outside world is an obvious strategy for the current economic situation in Russia. Russia has been turning military friends into economic partners as well as traditional trading partners including Germany and other countries in Eastern Europe. Russia has entered the markets in some Western European countries and Asia, especially Northern Asia. Since 1990, relations between South Korea and Russia have developed favorably. Two-way trade reached $1.6 billion in 1993, doubling that of the previous year. China has become the second biggest trading partner of Russia after Germany. Being an heir of the former USSR, Russia has been integrating into economic cooperation in the region. The shuttled mission of Russian economic groups to the Asia-Pacific region demonstrates the country's interest in broadening economic ties in the region. Russia has been a traditional trading partner of Vietnam. Two-way trade value exceeded the target of $300 million, mainly in energy, oil and gas exploitation, industry, agriculture, trade, and transport. Together with the visit to Russia by Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and the visit to Vietnam by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yarov, the visit to Russia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will create new prospects for bilateral cooperation between the two countries.
