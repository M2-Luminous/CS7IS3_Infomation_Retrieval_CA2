The residents are to fill in special questionnaires and have their passports stamped. The move was made necessary by the refusal of the Russian military authorities to hand over the militia registration files. The registration is to concern the Russian military as well. The joint Estonian-Russian staff exercise concerned the evacuation of the nuclear fuel from Paldiski and also studied the "black scenario" connected with possible escape of radioactive material. The Estonian side has agreed that 200 additional Russian experts with equipment be allowed to arrive in case of emergency.
