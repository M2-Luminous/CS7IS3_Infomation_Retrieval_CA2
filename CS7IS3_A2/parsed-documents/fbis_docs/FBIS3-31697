Several hundred artillery shells have been fired, but the knights of the 201st Brigade would not be taken by surprise. They adamantly repelled the attack, although new waves of attacks continue." Civilian targets in the town and suburbs have also been exposed to intensive destruction by scores of tank and howitzer shells, as well as volley fire from mortar batteries.

"The enemy directed the fiercest mortar attacks yesterday and overnight at defenders' positions in the central part of the front and on the Kladje-Djukici line.
