This waste is stored in safe locations in the Mol area. However, 50 years from now, more locations will have to be found as it is expected that the quantity of such waste will grow to 150,000 cubic meters. The organization responsible for storing radioactive waste, the ONDRAF [National Office for Nuclear Waste], has set up a list with 100 zones spread over 50 communes where dumping sites for low radioactive waste could be located. The final decision will be made in 1997, but Greenpeace already has denounced the ONDRAF plan as "unreliable." Sabine Breulet reports: [Breulet] Low radioactive waste originates from nuclear plants, research institutes, and hospitals. It is estimated that its half-life is approximately 30 years. The ONDRAF project calls for building a concrete storage house on clay or schistous ground covering 30 hectares. The site should make it possible to store 100,000 cubic meters of processed waste. A total of 98 zones spread over Flanders and Wallonia meet the criteria required for this dumping site. Fifty communes are being considered for this site, but only one will be designated. The final choice should be made by 1997 and then be followed by the approval requests. Thus, the dumping site for this type of waste will not be built until the year 2000.
