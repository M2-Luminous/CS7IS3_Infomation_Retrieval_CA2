"It is hard to say anything about the trustworthiness of the Japanese publication," Panov told ITAR-TASS on Monday. He believes the situation could be cleared out by Japanese Foreign Ministry experts who are participating in the Russian-Japanese talks at the level of deputy foreign ministers in Moscow. "In any event, the report confirms the correctness of the Russian position that the time has long been ripe for the Russian and the Japanese military to meet, exchange information and discuss the existing problems," Panov said. Japanese Ambassador to Russia Kozo Watanabe who is also attending the talks said that he had not read the article carried by MAINICHI SHIMBUN and thus cannot comment on it. As for Japanese-American joint military manoeuvres, they are of a purely defensive nature and do not go beyond the concept of defence sufficiency, he said.
