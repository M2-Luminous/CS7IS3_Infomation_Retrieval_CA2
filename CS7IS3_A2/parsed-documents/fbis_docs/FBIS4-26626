Their successful stories, strategies to tackle the China market, practical ways of doing business, the difficulties and obstacles they encountered there and the cultural differences were shared among the meeting attendants. Most of the speakers agreed the chances were there, the challenges there, but the important thing now was how to get down to real business. The conference on business opportunities in China was held with participants of big name companies in the United States and some businesses from Asia-Pacific region. The two-day conference, organized by World Congress Inc. and sponsored by Nynex Company (New York telephone company) in New York, drew some 100 representatives from business companies, government agencies and research institutions. Well-known names such GM-Hughes Electronics, Export-Import Bank of the United States, Dupont Company, McDonnell Douglas and the National Committee of U.S.-China Relations were presented at the conference, which as the world congress said, was the first of a series on global market. At the conference entitled "Business Opportunities in the People's Republic of China", companies, which have been successful in their business there, such as GM Hughes, Dupont and McDonnell Douglas shared their experiences and exchanged ideas in the conference. Different from some other meetings on China, it not only dealt with macro topics such as building on China's past to move into the 21st century but also micro ones such as ways to overcome transportation obstacles in China. Arthur Wilson, director of the Nynex's China liaison, said that his company was very much interested in China market, especially the extensive telecommunication needs throughout China. According to him, Nynex, which will turn its expertise in northeastern America into international operation, was always willing to help China's telecommunication companies and organizations improve and promote the communication system there. In an interview with XINHUA, Charles P. collins, managing director of the International Business Network, which has operated a China business information program on its computer system, noted that there were great opportunities to do business in China and the interest was still growing. So to cope with the need of original information about China, his company established the China program on-line service to help foreign businessmen get first-hand information about China. Now that with interest in China becoming more and more specific, Vidar J. Jorgensen, managing director of the world congress, said that his congress was planning another conference next year. The conference is expected to cover finance, financial service and investment and actual operations, he said. People were now not only satisfied in talking about opportunities but also the real business.
