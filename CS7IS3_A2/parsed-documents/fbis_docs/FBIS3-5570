The abolishment of the Post Service Research Institute, which is contained in the ministry's reorganization plan, came amid renewed controversy over the role of the institute. The institute had run dozens of branch offices across the nation to conduct inspections of mail at the request of the intelligence agencies and police. Opposition lawmakers had demanded that the institute be abolished, branding the agency a legacy from previous authoritarian governments. The ministry has argued that mail inspection is part of the government's counterintelligence efforts. Government inspectors currently handle, 1,500 letters and other postal items a day, according to ministry figures. The total volume of post inspected decreased from 584,000 items in 1990 to 542,400 items in 1992. The ministry said the mail inspection is still needed for security purposes, but that the operation will be handed over to major post offices. The ministry's reorganization plan also featured a government effort to cope with the increasing trend in the international marketplace to tear down trade barriers between countries. A new Information and Telecommunications Cooperation Bureau will be charged with gathering and analyzing overseas market information and helping domestic firms sell more goods and promote joint projects overseas, a spokesman said.
