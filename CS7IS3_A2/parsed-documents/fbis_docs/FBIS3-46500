Moreover, Doan Duy Thanh added, the VCCI arranged, the visits of nearly 10,000 business delegations from 52 countries to Vietnam and those of 20 delegations consisting of about 1,000 Vietnamese businessmen abroad to study foreign outlets and inquire into the possibilities for trade and investment. Six major exhibition fairs were held within the country in addition to two others abroad under the auspices of the VCCI. VCCI has provided legal and bussiness consultancy for businessmen to help them work out business deals and investment projects as well as settle disputes in external and internal relations. Sixteen professional-training courses were opened for more than 1,200 businessmen from various VCCI members. More than 40,000 sets of certificates on origin of export commodities were granted to Vietnam's businesses, helped 1,600 labels to be registered, provided industrial protection to 27 industrial designs and 57 inventions. On VCCI's plans for 1994, Mr. Thanh said the chamber should pay more attention to membership expansion, especially to the small and medium-sized busimessmen in all ecomomic sectors. A centre would be set up by VCCI to assist small and medium-sized businesses in finance, management and marketting. Eight international exhibition fairs are expected to be held in Vietnam next year complete with four or five others in Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea, to introduce Vietnam's export goods and foreign investment-calling projects.
