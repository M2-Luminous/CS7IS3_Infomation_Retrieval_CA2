COB leader Juan de la Cruz and CSUTCB leader Felix Santos stated that members of the two organizations participated in the demonstrations but, in many cases, the sons of peasants who are doing their military service prevented road blocks. [Begin recording] [Santos] In Oruro the military (?cleared the road blocks) in (Virauna), and many peasants reported that the soldiers had their faces painted. The peasants recognized several of their sons among the painted faces. It is very bad for the peasants to see their children being used in such a cowardly manner by the government. It is a pity that things have gone so far. [De la Cruz] We have confirmed information that three groups of peasants totalling some 20,000 people are blocking roads in Santa Cruz. In Cochabamba, especially in (Parotani) district, along the Cochabamba-Oruro highway, and along the Santacruz-Cochabamba highway through the Chapare region, there are approximately 30,000 peasants blocking the roads. There are also peasant roadblocks along the Oruro-La Paz highway in Caracollo and Vila Vila, although the latter roadblock reportedly has been cleared, the peasants are still demonstrating along the highways. The same thing is happening in Potosi, Tarija and Santa Cruz. [Reporter] Meanwhile, workers have been demonstrating in various departmental capitals, but police and military forces prevented the demonstrators from reaching the downtown areas. This led to clashes between workers and policemen. Some people were injured and streets were destroyed. Social Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado criticized the vandals, adding that the demonstrations were politically motivated because they were staged to secure the reelection of certain COB leaders at the COB national congress scheduled to take place on 1 June. [Machicado] It appears that there is a power struggle within the COB which is getting ready for the elections at which the new members of the executive board will be chosen. There are several candidates and many people want to get elected to the COB executive board. It is obvious that those who fight the administration the most are likely to become the most acceptable candidates. I think that this is what is going on. I believe all this street violence and the strikes are part of a political campaign, not a labor struggle. [Reporter] The minister lamented that demonstrations staged by COB leaders to serve their own interests are harming everyone. [end recording]
