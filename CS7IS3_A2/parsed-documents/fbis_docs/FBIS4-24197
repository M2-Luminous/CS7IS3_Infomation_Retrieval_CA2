The fuel price bears no relation to what its market price should be. The reason the price of fuel is so high is because it is deliberately inflated by Government, in part to fill its own coffers, and in part because it is obligated towards protecting inefficient state subsidised industries, such as Mossgas [Mossel Bay Gas Project] and Sasol [South Africa Coal, Oil, and Gas Corporation]. Rather than preserving an array of indirect or "hidden" taxes -- such as reflected in the fuel price, amongst other prices -- government should make taxes as direct as possible. At least then the taxes would be more visible, and people would have a better idea of how much government costs them. People would no longer be temporarily confused and anguished by such contrivances as a sharp increase in the state determined fuel price. The state could then still use its direct tax revenues for chosen areas of investment. One of the mandarins of the old apartheid system, Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha, opposes real deregulation of the fuel price because he believes it will lead to job losses. This is, basically, an argument that economic inefficiency should be tolerated as long as some people make money and are employed as a result. It is a factor which must be borne in mind when approaching deregulation. But alone it is not convincing. After all, on this basis, any kind of activity may be justified, including digging earth works with teaspoons. Job creation must instead take place within a process of both wealth creation and development. Let the market function freely, whilst the state directs tax revenues into development. The fact is that Sasol and Mossgas are white elephants. They were strategic industries for an economically isolated apartheid state. They are no longer important in the way they were. Like other huge, inefficient, state-erected industries elsewhere in the world, they must now make the transition towards the market. In doing so they may well have a market edge in certain areas, and provide goods and services which consumers want, at cheaper prices than competitors. If so they will remain viable enterprises -- in these areas. But other functions probably deserve to be wound down. The funds released, as stated, could then be directed into productive avenues -- avenues which provide both jobs and economic growth we need. Concomitant fuel deregulation would mean consumers would no longer be subsidising organisations which should not be in business. The immediate effect would be a huge drop in our fuel bill.
