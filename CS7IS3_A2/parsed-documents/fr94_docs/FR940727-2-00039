If the independent chairman ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute chairman shall be appointed in the same manner as provided in Paragraph 3.c. of this Agreement. j. Except as required by law, and except to the extent that necessary information is exchanged in the course of evaluating the Acquisition, defending investigations or defending or prosecuting litigation, or negotiating agreements to divest assets, or complying with this Agreement or the Consent Order, respondent shall not receive or have access to, or use or continue to use, any material confidential information not in the public domain about the New Company or the activities of the New Company Board. Nor shall the New Company or the New Company Board receive or have access to, or use or continue to use, any material confidential information not in the public domain about respondent and relating to respondent's acute care hospitals in Utah. Respondent may receive on a regular basis aggregate financial information relating to the New Company necessary and essential to allow respondent to prepare United States consolidated financial reports, tax returns and personnel reports. Any such information that is obtained pursuant to this subparagraph shall be used only for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. (``Material confidential information,'' as used herein, means competitively sensitive or proprietary information not independently known to respondent from sources other than the New Company, and includes but is not limited to customer lists, price lists, marketing methods, patents, technologies, processes, or other trade secrets.) k. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the respondent's New Company Board members shall not in their capacity as New Company Board members, receive material confidential information and shall not disclose any such information received under this Agreement to respondent or use it to obtain any advantage for respondent. The respondent's New Company Board members shall enter a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential information. The respondent's New Company Board members shall participate in matters that come before the New Company Board only for the limited purposes of considering a capital investment or other transaction exceeding $250,000, approving any proposed budget and operating plans, and carrying out respondent's responsibilities under this Agreement and the Consent Order. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the respondent's New Company Board members shall not participate in any matter, or attempt to influence the votes of the other members of the New Company Board with respect to matters, that would involve a conflict of interest if respondent and the New Company were separate and independent entities. l. If necessary to assure compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Consent Agreement, or the Consent Order, respondent may, but is not required to, assign an individual to the New Company for the purpose of overseeing such compliance (``on-site person''). The on-site person shall have access to all officers and employees of the New Company and such records of the New Company as he deems necessary and reasonable to assure compliance. Such individual shall enter into a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential information. m. Any material transaction of the New Company that is out of the ordinary course of business must be approved by a majority vote of the New Company Board; provided that the New Company shall engage in no transaction, material or otherwise, that is precluded by this Agreement. n. All earnings and profits of the New Company shall be retained separately in the New Company. If necessary, respondent shall provide the New Company with sufficient working capital to operate at its current rate of operation, and to carry out any capital improvement plans for the New Company which have already been approved. o. During the period commencing on the date this Agreement is effective and terminating on the earlier of (i) six months after the date the Consent Order becomes final, or (ii) the date contemplated by subparagraph 2.a (the ``Initial Divestiture Period''), respondent shall make available for use by the New Company funds sufficient to perform all necessary routine maintenance to, and replacements of, the Schedule A Assets (``normal repair and replacement''). After termination of the Initial Divestiture Period and until the earlier of the date contemplated by either subparagraph 2.a or 2.b, respondent shall make available for use by the New Company each year an amount not less than that required for normal repair and replacement, plus $1,000,000 for capital improvements to the Schedule A Assets, unless a smaller amount is requested or required by the New Company, in its sole discretion, for capital expenditures. Provided, however, that in any event, respondent shall provide the New Company with such funds as are necessary to maintain the viability and competitiveness and marketability of the Schedule A Assets.
