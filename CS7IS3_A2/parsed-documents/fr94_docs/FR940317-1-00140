FR940317-1-00140 FR940317-1-00013 (c) Unless authority is withheld by the Commander, USARCS or the chief of a command claims service, the head of an area claims office may: (1) compromise up to $25,000 of the amount asserted on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $40,000 or less (see §536.229(b)). (2) Terminate collection action on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $25,000 or less when further collection efforts are not feasible (see paragraph 14&hyph;19c); or waive a medical care claim asserted for $25,000 or less when collection in any amount will result in undue hardship to the injured party (see §536.229(d)). (d) The head of an area claims office may delegate authority to a claims processing office to: (1) compromise up to $20,000 of the amount asserted on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $40,000 or less (see §536.229(d)). (2) Terminate collection action on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $20,000 or less when further collection efforts are not feasible (see paragraph 14&hyph;19c); or waive a medical care claim asserted for $20,000 or less when collection in any amount will result in undue hardship to the injured party (see §536.229(d)). (e) The head of an area claims office or a claims processing office, or the chief of a command claims service, may redelegate up to $20,000 of his or her authority to an RJA. (f) In determining whether a settlement authority has authority to compromise, terminate, or waive a claim, consider the medical costs for all parties injured in a single incident as a single assertion; and consider the total value of Government property damaged or destroyed in a single incident as a single assertion. (g) Only the Department of Justice (DOJ) may approve claims involving: (1) Compromise, termination, or waiver of a medical care or property damage claim asserted for more than $100,000. (2) Settlement actions previously referred to DOJ. (3) Settlement where a third party has filed suit against the United States or the injured party for the same incident which gave rise to the claim of the United States. (h) The commander, USARCS, or the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, in consultation with the Department of Justice, will approve all claims involving unusual circumstances, a new point of law which may serve as a precedent, or a question of policy. §536.217 Basic considerations. (a) The Federal Claims Collection Standards. The Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 103 and 104, reprinted in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M), prescribe standards for compromising and litigating property damage claims, and provide general guidance for compromising and litigating medical care claims. (b) Time limitations _(1) Property damage claims. Claims asserted under the Federal Claims Collection Act for damage to Government property are founded in tort and must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b). (2) Medical care claims asserted under the FMCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095. Claims asserted under the FMCRA or against an automobile liability insurer under 10 U.S.C. 1095 are also founded in tort and must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b). Although no court has ruled on this issue, claims asserted under 10 U.S.C. 1095 against a no-fault or PIP insurer are presumably founded in a contract ``implied in law''; if so, they must be brought within six years (28 U.S.C. 2415a). (3) Computing the statute of limitations. Normally, a medical care claim ``first accrues'' on the initial date of treatment, and a property damage claim accrues on the date that the property was damaged. However, in computing the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2416(c) excludes the period of time before a U.S. official charged with the responsibility to act in the circumstances knows or should know that there is a basis for a claim. See United States v. Hunter , 645 F.Supp 758, 760 (N.D.N.Y. 1986). For example, the three year statute of limitations would not begin to run on most medical care claims paid by CHAMPUS at least until the date on which CHAMPUS received the bill from the provider. (4) Medical care claims asserted under state law. Claims asserted against an insurer on a third party beneficiary theory or against a state workers' compensation fund must be brought within the applicable state statute of limitations which can range from one to six years. Normally, the statute of limitations would begin to run when the injury occurred, rather than the date of initial treatment. (c) Applicable law. Federal law does not define what constitutes a tort. Unless the RJA can properly apply the law of another jurisdiction under conflict of law rules, the RJA will apply the law of the state or country where an incident occurred in determining whether the Government has a cause of action founded in tort. (d) Concurrent claims. (1) Claims for damage to Army property and claims for medical care arising from the same incident will be processed under the section applicable to each. However, efforts should be made to include all medical care and property damage claims in a single demand against a third party or insurance company. Settlement agreements will be drafted so that settlement and release of one claim shall not prejudice settlement of the remaining claim.
