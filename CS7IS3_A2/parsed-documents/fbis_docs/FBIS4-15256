Who Will Shed A Tear?" -- from the "IZVESTIYA-TV" section] [Text] In January it became known that the Control Administration of the Russian president's administration had began an audit of "Ostankino's" financial and economic activity. The presumption of innocence (a sacred juridical principle) was crushed by rumors, malicious gossip, and verbal and printed extrapolation of the repeatedly surfacing individual criminal and semicriminal episodes in "Ostankino's" history. In its very first edition "IZVESTIYA-TV" -- although without specific names, with approximate figures, and anonymously (for which we were, perhaps fairly, censured) -- peppered the Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company ["Ostankino"] with accusations of virtually total corruption. Without the slightest hint of malice, we note that the rumors, the major premises of the article "`Ostankino': Everything for Sale," and the warnings of experts have proved to be not without basis. The high-quality and thorough audit has revealed violations and has unambiguously exposed financial machinations and "slip-ups" reflected in "Ostankino's" losses, which run into millions and billions of rubles [R]. Here are just a few figures and statistics from the extensive documentation on the results of the audit. In 1993 R441 million worth of unpaid advertising was broadcast by just five studios. Overall last year the company should have received -- according to expert assessments -- at least R60 billion from advertising, but received just R11.2 billion. "Ostankino" concluded contracts that were known to be unprofitable with the "Inmac" Joint-Stock Company and a number of Western firms (here Yu. Bandura, "Ostankino's" former deputy chairman, especially distinguished himself). Manipulations manifestly far from altruistic were exposed, involving advertising time in the "Aleskandr-shou" program, broadcast 16 January this year. "Ostankino's" leaders conducted business with excessive loyalty -- and clearly to the detriment of the company's own interests -- with the "Premyer SV" advertising agency, which will cost the company R12.3 billion. In 1993 the volume of broadcasting was reduced by almost one-third by comparison with 1991, but the number of studio personnel by only 17 percent. And this, while the quality of programs fell and in the midst of a financial crisis. Over the past two years "Ostankino" has lost many buildings and much equipment, and most importantly of all, the Television Technical Center. But perhaps the most terrible loss is its loss of prestige, its good reputation in the eyes of the public and millions of viewers. We do not know what administrative and juridical measures will be taken, but it will be very difficult to recoup the moral and professional losses suffered.
