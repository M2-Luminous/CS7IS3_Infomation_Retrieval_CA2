Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters, "I can never approve of that proposal" by SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo to allow the secretaries general of the coalition to hold substantial discussion on narrowing an intraparty gulf over key policies, such as defense and diplomacy. Kubo advanced the proposal as the chairman of get-togethers of the deputy chiefs of the coalition partners. Murayama's remark came a day after key coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the core coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal party], called for bridging intracoalition gaps over four key policy fields, including Japan's stand on the suspected North Korean nuclear weapons program. The other three fields are Japan's tax system reform, basic defense and foreign policies as well as administrative reform combined with deregulation. Murayama dismissed the rumors rift with Kubo, saying the SDP secretary general merely "advanced the proposal as the chairman of meetings of the secretaries general as a tentative step." "There are no differences between me and Mr. Kubo," Murayama said. Ozawa and Kubo respectively put forward calls for reconciling the intra-alliance gaps after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's seven-party alliance went through various crises and turbulence due to policy differences over the past eight months.
