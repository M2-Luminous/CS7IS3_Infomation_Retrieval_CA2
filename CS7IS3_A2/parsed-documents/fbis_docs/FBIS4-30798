The deputies concluded that by their consistent implementation, and through the confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, equal rights and survival of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina are being secured. Zdenko Vranjes has a report on other conclusions reached by the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna: [Begin Vranjes recording] In addition to its support for the Vienna negotiations, following a day-long discussion, the chamber of deputies instructed the deputies of this chamber who are to be present at the constitutive assembly session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation in Sarajevo on Monday [30 May], to vote only for the election of the president and the vice president of the federation in line with the Vienna Agreement, while other decisions on the agenda should be voted for only if they are in accordance with the adopted constitution of the federation. This conclusion was endorsed in order to postpone the adoption of a law on the federal government, because deputies who took part in the discussion said that the draft law was not completely coordinated with the adopted constitution. Therefore, the deputies were advised to discuss the draft law at the constitutive assembly session on Monday and return it to be further coordinated with the constitution. Even though the agenda of the constitutive assembly session on Monday does not include the decisionmaking on the final cantonal set-up of the federation, the chamber of deputies, in addition to its positive assessment of this part of the Vienna Agreement, instructed the deputies, when making a decision on this issue, to take into consideration all constructive proposals, opinions, and suggestions of the Croat people voiced at the session today. The chamber of deputies endorsed a stand of the leadership of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina that was presented in the discussion today that scope and opportunities still existed for making alterations to the agreed maps of cantons. All these conclusions, even though read out, were not formally endorsed because Mostar was left without electricity this evening and the session was wound up for that reason. Before that, the chamber of deputies positively assessed the work of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government so far, as it was said, given the conditions under which it has been working. The deputies decided that the Defense Ministry and the main HVO [Croatian Defense Council] headquarters should begin demobilization, advising the government to invest more effort into the reconstruction of the economy.
