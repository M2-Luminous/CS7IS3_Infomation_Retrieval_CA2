Kolodko said this to journalists after meeting today with Wilfried Thalwitz, World Bank vice president (Europe and Central Asia Regional Office). The bank supports the "Strategy for Poland" program, as well as new, joint projects, which will be financed from the bank's resources. They are connected with the development of infrastructure, a restructuring of the power industry and the welfare system, and development of the transport network. "Today we talked about the money, which is big," Kolodko said. Most of the World Bank funds are used, but we have some problems with utilizing some of these funds--for example, in the housing industry. The aim of the talks is to find the best solutions so that the World Bank can join in the implementation of tasks resulting from the Strategy for Poland program.
