ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent Ruslan Ignatyev asked Vladimir Shelikhov, deputy general director of the Russian Federation Federal Postal Communications Administration, to talk about its final results. Subscriptions for the first half of 1994 amounted to over 61.5 million copies of various publications. This represents 73.5 percent of the figure for the first half of 1993. In the opinion of Russian Communications Ministry specialists, the crisis of the press is over and it is not anticipated that subscriptions will fall to a low level in the future. The structure of the present subscription is interesting. Over half the present total circulation figure is accounted for by newspapers -- 43.6 million copies. As we expected, readers have shown great interest in local publications -- the latter account for 25.2 million copies. The circulation of central newspapers is 18.1 million. Local publications have virtually maintained their 1993 circulation. Central publications have lost one-third of their subscribers. The circulation of magazines continues to decline. The level of subscriptions there is 95.6 percent of the level for the second half of 1993. Now let us cite figures for subscriptions to the most popular publications (leaving aside PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, and some others for which figures will be provided later).
