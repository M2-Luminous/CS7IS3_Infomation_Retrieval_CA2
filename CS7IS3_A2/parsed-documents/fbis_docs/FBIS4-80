During the preceeding week 153,520 ID documents and 152,301 temporary voters' cards had been issued and the department would continue its efforts to sustain this trend. The department reminded the public that its regional and district offices would be open on Family Day (April 4) and Founders Day (April 6) enabling them to apply for the necessary documents. "Reports from various quarters indicate that the rush at the department's offices is diminishing." The department warned that the loss or theft of ID documents constituted a "very real" security risk.
