Provisional figures for the week ending November 28 show 174 people suffering from "flu-like illness" for every 100,000 members of the population -- a fall from 200 in the first week of November. Cases of influenza proper are put at 36 per 100,000, compared with 39 in the previous week. The epidemic started in Scotland and during October worked its way south. The figures for the second half of November show a similar pattern for its decline. Rates of flu-like illness have dropped in the north, from 229 per 100,000 in early November to 158 last week. They have reached a plateau in central and southern regions, at 200-245 per 100,000, and are now expected to fall. Researchers do not know what is causing the decline. Dr. John Watson, of the Public Health Laboratory Service, said the severity and tenacity of a flu virus was impossible to predict. "It is determined by the extent to which a population has recently come across a similar virus and retained some immunity," he said, adding that a resurgence of the epidemic this year is possible but not likely. In the week ending November 19, 42 deaths from influenza and influenzal pneumonia were recorded at the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, a rise from 28 the previous week and just two per week in early October. The number of deaths attributed to flu in any winter ranges from 1,000 to the estimated 25,000 of 1989. In a typical year it is between 3,000 and 4,000.
