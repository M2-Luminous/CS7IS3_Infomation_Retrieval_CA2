United States Price In calculating United States price (USP), the Department used purchase price (PP) or exporter's sales price (ESP), as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act, as appropriate. Due to the extremely large number of transactions that occurred during the POR and the resulting administrative burden involved in calculating individual margins for all of these transactions, we sampled sales to calculate USP, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act. When a firm made more than 2,000 ESP sales transactions to the United States for a particular class or kind of merchandise, we reviewed ESP sales which occurred during sample weeks. We selected one week from each two-month period in the review period, for a total of six weeks, and analyzed each transaction made in those six weeks. The sample weeks included May 31&hyph;June 6, 1992; July 26&hyph;August 1, 1992; October 18&hyph;24, 1992; November 22&hyph;28, 1992; February 14&hyph;20, 1993; and April 18&hyph;24, 1993. We reviewed all PP sales transactions during the POR because there were few PP sales. United States price was based on the packed f.o.b., c.i.f., or delivered price to unrelated purchasers in, or for exportation to, the United States. We made deductions, as appropriate, from PP and ESP for movement expenses, discounts and rebates. We made additional deductions from ESP for direct selling expenses, indirect selling expenses, and repacking in the United States. We made an addition to USP for value-added taxes (VAT) in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act. In making our adjustment for VAT, we followed the instructions of the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) in Federal Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT October 7, 1993). The Department added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department also adjusted the tax amount calculated for USP and the amount of tax included in foreign market value (FMV). We deducted the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax that are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and in the United States price used to calculate the USP tax. Because these expenses are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP, these adjustments are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax from creating dumping margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales. With respect to subject merchandise to which value was added in the United States, e.g., parts of bearings that were imported and further processed into finished bearings by U.S. affiliates of foreign exporters, prior to sale to unrelated U.S. customers, we deducted any increased value in accordance with section 772(e)(3) of the Tariff Act. Those bearings otherwise subject to the order that are incorporated into nonbearing products, which collectively comprise less than one percent of the value of the finished products sold to unrelated customers in the United States, are not subject to the assessment of antidumping duties. In Roller Chain, Other Than Bicycle, from Japan (48 FR 51801; November 14, 1983), roller chain, which was subject to an antidumping duty order, was imported by a related party and incorporated into finished motorcycles. The finished motorcycles were the first articles of commerce sold by the subject producer to unrelated purchasers in the United States. Because the roller chain did not constitute a significant percentage of the value of the completed product, the Department found that a USP could not reasonably be determined for the roller chain. The Department, therefore, did not assess dumping duties on these transactions. We have applied this same principle to these reviews. Foreign Market Value The home market was viable for all companies and all classes or kinds of merchandise. The Department used home market prices or constructed value (CV), as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, as appropriate, to calculate foreign market value (FMV). Due to the extremely large number of transactions that occurred during the POR and the resulting administrative burden involved in examining all of these transactions, we sampled sales to calculate FMV, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act. When a firm had more than 2,000 home market sales transactions for a particular class or kind of merchandise, we used sales from sample months that corresponded to the sample weeks selected for U.S. sales sampling plus one contemporaneous month prior to the POR and one following the POR. The sample months included March, June, July, October, and November of 1992, and February, April, and June of 1993.
