"Generally speaking, it is proper for a nation to arrange preparedness that would enable it to cope with any development," Hata said at a news conference. Hata was speaking about Japan's response to a possible contingency on the Korean peninsula amid heightened tension from the announcement Friday by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it can no longer verify if Pyongyang diverted plutonium for nuclear arms production. Hata earlier said Japan would join U.N.-led sanctions against North Korea if the Security Council voted to approve punitive steps, while making it clear that Japan would keep open the option of acting with the United States and South Korea in slapping sanctions even without such a U.N. decision. The U.N. nuclear watchdog said Friday the North Korean discharge of spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor has made it impossible to ascertain whether North Korea diverted plutonium from the reactor in the past. "I am monitoring how North Korea would respond to a statement by the president of U.N. Security Council that urged it to comply with the safeguards measures demanded by the IAEA," Hata said. "I want North Korea to accept international public opinion and open up their heart (to the inspection demand)," he said.
