Since 1985 New Zealand has been excluded from the Anzus (Australia, New Zealand and US) defence pact because of its anti-nuclear policies. Although the current government is committed to retaining the anti-nuclear laws, it has also said it wants to renew defence ties with the US. Graham said it was now unlikely the Anzus alliance could be restored and he pointed out that traditional alliances carried risks of dragging unwilling partners into conflicts anyway. "The issue we should be considering in 1994 is whether the world has moved on to such an extent that alliances of one sort or the other do more harm than good," he said. Conflicts like that in Yugoslavia and the Gulf could more or less be contained and were unlikely to erupt into global war. But traditional multilateral alliances could force unwilling partners into the conflict. New Zealand could not afford to defend itself alone against sophisticated modern weaponry. "I believe it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify diverting money from hospitals to hardware for defence forces designed to provide some self-sufficiency," Graham said. But it should look to the UN rather than traditional alliances. The decreasing threat of all-out nuclear conflict and the rise of the UN had made traditional alliances less appropriate. New Zealand faced three choices. It could try to equip its forces as best it could and hope that any conflict it was involved in was small and sophisticated weapons were not deployed, or it could throw its lot in with a country with sophisticated weaponry like the United States. "A third option is to recognise the futility in trying to keep up with technology and to rely more and more on the United Nations to protect our interests should they ever be threatened," he said. The UN, despite funding and bureaucratic problems was still the best global answer to conflict. "The UN, in its role as the world's police force, may find that its time has come at long last," he said.
