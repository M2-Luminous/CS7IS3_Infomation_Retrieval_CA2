A recombinant of PV1 was identified during the molecular epidemiological survey by using sequence analysis of the genomic PV1/2A junction region (residues 3296-3445). The PV1 isolates were tested at the beginning by Sabin 1-specific PCR and Dot hybridization and was excluded from vaccine-related PV1. Its sequencing data of the 150 nucleotides shared 97 percent homology to Sabin 1. Expanded sequencing of its 5'-side revealed many nucleotide substitutions identical to those of wild PV1 from residue 3262 upward, which indicates the recombination site at residues 3262/3263 junction. Fourteen of 57 PV1 isolates collected from 13 provinces or autonomous regions were found to be recombinant by a recombinant-specific PCR developed by us. The high sequence similarity among them suggests that these 14 PV1 isolates probably were the progeny of a recombinant produced by a patient dually infected by wild and Sabin 1. Studies of virulence, immunogenicity, transmissibility, etc. of this recombinant are going on.
