On 22 May KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent was among those who met their countrymen at Sheremetyevo-2 International Airport off the flight from Islamabad. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, Pakistani ambassador to Russia, was among the welcoming party. [passage omitted] All the parents of men captured in the Afghan War have been waiting for just such a moment. Unfortunately, there is still no accurate information on how many of our POW's are held in war-torn Afghanistan. Although the total number of MIA's, according to Russian Federation Defense Ministry figures, is 290. It is known from various sources that only 60 or 70 of them are alive. "The complex work to find Soviet POW's is being held up for a whole host of reasons," I was told by Russian delegation member Leonid Biryukov, the man from the CIS Heads of Government Council Committee for Internationalist Servicemen Affairs who is responsible for the search for MIA's. "First and foremost, because a fierce internecine power struggle is under way in Afghanistan. President Rabbani now has no time for our prisoners, although he has stated that he will do everything in his power to free them." In conversation with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent, Tatyana Samolis, press secretary to the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, stressed that the search for former Soviet soldiers is one of the areas for cooperation between Russian intelligence and similar departments in other states -- primarily those which can have a real influence on solving this problem. She noted that the release of Olenin and Stepanov was possible thanks to the close collaboration between two special services -- the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service and the Pakistani Defense Ministry's Inter Services Intelligence.
