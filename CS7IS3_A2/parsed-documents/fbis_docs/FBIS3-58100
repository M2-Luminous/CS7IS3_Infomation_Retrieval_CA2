He said he was opposed to making statements on a possible next coalition "at the wrong time." He said the FDP was seeking a double-digit result in the Bundestag elections. The proposals made by Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (CDU) on the issue of the "great bugging campaign" are for Kinkel the "opening up of a secondary theater of war." Kinkel told HANDELSBLATT in Stuttgart that Kanther's behavior was harming the coalition because it had been agreed that the topic should not be discussed any more in this legislative period. Kinkel also attacked CDU/CSU Bundestag floor leader Wolfgang Schaeuble. The FDP rejects Schaeuble's idea of making "the consideration of old values and virtues" a political program. Regarding the problem of the FDP's position on the presidential candidate, Kinkel said, addressing Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher: "We need you, we rely on you, and you can count on us." Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher, who was given a rapturous applause at the Epiphany meeting, had said the day before that she would maintain her candidacy for the office of federal president until election day. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt mentioned three problems that had to be solved economically -- the loss of the technological top position, the "excessive growth" of production costs, and the "over-regulation of society." In this respect, Rexrodt presented a 10-point plan: - Continuing the austerity and consolidation course; - Introducing a wage freeze in the public service sector; - Submitting the basic data of a tax reform; - Abolishing the monopoly of the Federal Employment Office; - Amending the law on working hours; - Further privatizing public holdings; - Deregulation through the abolition of the Law Governing Discounts and a reform of the Law Against Dishonest Competition; - Consistent environmental policy based on market economy principles; - Reform of subsidized housing construction through income-oriented promotional measures; - Implementation of the GATT agreement on free world trade.
