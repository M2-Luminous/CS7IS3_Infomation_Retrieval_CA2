Scognamiglio said that he was only following the rules laid down. He spoke to Anna La Rosa: [Begin recording] [La Rosa] Speaker, is it still possible to bring together the broken pieces of the ruling coalition? [Scognamiglio] If you are referring to the results of the elections for the chairmanships of the Senate committees, then the results were due to the numbers and an absence of agreement between the ruling coalition and the opposition parties. Therefore, these results could not have been avoided. It does not seem to me that there are broken pieces of crockery in the ruling coalition. The ruling coalition exists and it will have difficulties in the Senate and this is the logic of democracy, and of having respect for the rules. [La Rosa] Umberto Bossi has accused you of being in some way responsible for what happened, for having recognized this new grouping [Sinistra Democratica]? [Scognamiglio] I do not feel responsible, in fact, I am happy to be responsible for having applied the rules. [La Rosa] What can be done now? How will it be possible to govern? If you cannot govern the Senate, then how can you think of governing the country? [Scognamiglio] I think that if the ruling coalition produces laws that are consensual and that have a consensus, then I believe they will navigate the Senate without any problems. However, if the Senate shows a willingness to place obstacles in the way of the ruling coalition's right to govern the country, then the ruling coalition will have to draw its own conclusions.
