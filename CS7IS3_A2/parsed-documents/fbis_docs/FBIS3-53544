It is utterly sorrowful, regrettable, and disappointing to see all this taking place following the famous agreement which the Afghan leaders signed in the vicinity of the holy mosque [Mecca] and their undertaking at that time to adhere to what had been agreed upon at the holiest place on earth during the month of blessed Ramadan of last year. King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the two holy mosques, and His Excellency Sardar Faruq Ahmad Khan, while expressing their indignation at what matters in Afghanistan have led to -- and in a way that does not please God -- appeal to and demand from the Afghan leaders to fear God and arm themselves with wisdom and seek arbitration in the contents of the Holy Qur'an and the pure Sunnah of His Prophet -- may God's prayers and peace be upon him -- and would like at the same time to stress the necessity of an unconditional ceasefire and the halting of all attacks in all areas of Afghanistan according to the Agreement of Holy Mecca, which stipulates assigning an important role to the Islamic Conference Organization and its secretary general to supervise and follow-up; and to give the secretary general the opportunity to carry out this role and use his good offices to establish peace and security in Afghanistan and to ascertain that all sides genuinely abide by the Islamabad agreement signed by the Afghan leaders in the midst of Holy Mecca on 18th of Ramadan 1413, corresponding to 11 March 1993, and to abide by the stipulations of the recent Jalalabad agreement.
