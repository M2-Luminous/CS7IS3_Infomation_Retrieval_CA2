Amidst the new spate of Afghan fightings, the Geneva-based United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Tuesday announced that the recent whirlwind of clashes could beset the four neighbors of Afghanistan--especially Iran and Pakistan--with an influx of refugees. A point worthy of consideration meantime is that the present war in Afghanistan is neither ethnic nor religious nor national: It is merely a power struggle that pitifully has not only tarnished the 13-year-long struggle of the Afghan people but has also posed a serious peril to the prestige of the global Islamic movement. Developments in Afghanistan definitely bear close relationship with Iran's national security. Kabul's devastating and ruinous war will pose danger for Iran both in terms of its ideological objectives and national interests. Pitifully, however, the Iranian Foreign Ministry sluggishly carried out just one not-so-successful move of establishing a several-hour-long cease-fire in Kabul. Aptly, the Foreign Ministry could have launched an extensive diplomatic overture by contacting the involved sides, as well as Pakistan, some regional countries, and especially the Organization of the Islamic Conference (ICO) to preclude the spread and perpetuation of the Afghan genocide. This diplomatic sluggishness is in no way justifiable. Meantime, the self-restraint so far exercised by the Afghanistan Islamic Unity Party [Hezb-e Wahdat] in avoiding involvement in the recent fightings is laudable. Hopefully, this self-restraint will be kept up, and the said party will assume the role of mediator as the best stance that could be adopted. In principle, the former clashes that were flared by some groups with this party actually did not augur well for the future of Afghanistan, producing no positive results.
