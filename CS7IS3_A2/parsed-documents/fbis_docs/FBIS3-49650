Commenting on the latest NATO declaration in Brussels, Karadzic told SRNA that this document by the international community is designed to exert more pressure on the Serb side despite the fact that, according to Karadzic, "the Serbs are the most cooperative side when it comes not only to humanitarian issues but also to the peace agreement." "Only the Serbs have fulfilled everything that was expected from them," Karadzic added. "Instead of lifting the sanctions and exerting pressure on the Muslim side to accept peace, the international community continues to issue threats against the Serbs." These threats, to put it mildly, are counterproductive to the peace process, Karadzic said, adding that the Muslims did not feel obliged to sign the peace agreement for as long as the West continues to encourage them. Responding to accusations that the Serbs did not allow the peacekeeping troops in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica to be replaced, Karadzic said an agreement on replacement had been reached a long time ago, "but that the technical details of the agreement must be worked out with our generals." "As for the fighting around Sarajevo, even UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reports clearly indicate that the Muslims have been attacking the Serb positions. When it comes to Sarajevo airport, obviously it is not in our interest to shell the airport; we definitely have not been doing that," Karadzic said in reference to international accusations of the alleged Serb "strangulation" of Sarajevo. Karadzic said a peace agreement must be signed before the airport in Tuzla was opened, adding that airports in Tuzla, Banjaluka, and Mostar would be opened simultaneously on the day when a peace agreement, guaranteed by the international community, was signed. "Europe has allowed chaos to be created in it. Europe caused it, and it would be decent of Europe to contribute toward a peaceful solution for that chaos," Karadzic said. He added: "We have fulfilled all our obligations, and we expect that the peace agreement will be signed on 18 January. If the peace agreement is not signed, we will demand immediate suspension of sanctions against the Serb nation from the international community, and we still will be ready to negotiate for peace," SRNA reports.
