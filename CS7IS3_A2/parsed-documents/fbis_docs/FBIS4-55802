On 16-17 May, after the 1994 parliamentary elections, the Modus Economic and Social Marketing Advisory Inc. prepared a flash report on possible prime ministers. The survey was effected in four cities (Budapest, Miskolc, Gyor, and Szeged) on a sample of 520 people. The sample represented the full Hungarian population over the age of 18 according to gender, age, and education. Modus was trying to find out whom people would welcome as prime minister. All the questioned people were aware that parliamentary elections had taken place on 8 May. The party preferences of the sample basically corresponded to the results of the first round of elections. The small differences compared to the first round can be attributed to the fact that the survey did not extend to all types of settlements. In reply to the question "if the decision was up to you, to which politicians would you give the prime ministerial post," the following five names were mentioned in the first five places: Gyula Horn [Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] 33.1 percent, Gabor Kuncze [Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] 23.7 percent, Peter Boross [Hungarian Democratic Forum] 9.4 percent, Jozsef Torgyan [Independent Smallholders Party] 6.5 percent, and Viktor Orban [Federation of Young Democrats] 6.5 percent. It is interesting that, of the MSZP's voters, 84.9 percent would like to see Horn as prime minister, and 73.1 percent of the SZDSZ's voters would like Kuncze as prime minister.
