The Commission invites the views of interested parties about both problems cited above that are reported to arise under current law and the recommendations they would make to deal with these problems. The Commission would also welcome comparisons of the current treatment of these questions under the National Labor Relations Act and various forms of employment regulation (such as FLSA, OSHA, ERISA and civil rights law).
