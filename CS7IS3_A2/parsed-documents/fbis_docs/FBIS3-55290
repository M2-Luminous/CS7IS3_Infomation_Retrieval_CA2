What is more, the lawyer Genrikh Padva even read out a New Year message from Boris Yeltsin to his new comrade-in-arms Anatoliy Lukyanov, in which the president voiced hope for their mutual fruitful cooperation. The prosecution responded to the defense statement with a different explanation of the selfsame Article 98 of the Constitution. In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, it is not a question of universal, but only of limited [usechennyy] immunity, namely from detention, arrest, and searches. No more. And that is why interpretation of the contentious article is needed from the Constitutional Court, a body to which either the president himself, people's deputies, or members of government can appeal with queries. And since this is an extremely lengthy procedure, the prosecution asked the case of Lukyanov and Starodubtsev be be treated separately [vydelit delo Lukyanova i Starodubtseva v otdelnoye deloproizvodstvo]. However, after a long meeting the Supreme Court rejected both the lawyers' arguments and the prosecution's waverings. The trial of State Duma Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov and Federation Council member Vasiliy Starodubtsev will be continued after 10 January. The following question arises in this connection: Where is Lukyanov to go after Christmas -- to the Duma to "share responsibility with the president for the fate of Russia" or to the dock? And if he nonetheless prefers the Duma, what will the court do then? After all, under Article 98 he can no longer be taken there by force!
