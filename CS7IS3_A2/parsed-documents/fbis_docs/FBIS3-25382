This, therefore, means that the South African trade representative, Mr. Heath, becomes the first South African ambassador to Swaziland, and Mr. Sam Malinga becomes Swaziland's first ambassador to South Africa after presentation of letters of credence by both ambassadors. Formalities to this effect will be finalized on Thursday when the South African trade representative meets the minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Solomon Dlamini. Also to call on the foreign affairs minister on Thursday will be the United States ambassador designate to Swaziland, Dr. John Sprott.
