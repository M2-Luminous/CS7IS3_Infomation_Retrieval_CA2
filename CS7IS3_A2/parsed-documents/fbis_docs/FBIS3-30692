Commenting on Saturday's extraordinary session of the SDRP Supreme Council, SLD parliamentary spokesman Jerzy Szmajdzinski said that the party saw no reason to allow an escalation of the conflict, and that the SLD-PSL coalition, which took power to resolve the most pressing problems facing poland, could resolve the present dispute. He reported that sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy (SLD) had held a meeting with prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak on Saturday morning, and that the prime minister had stressed his wish to avoid further tensions. Szmajdzinski said that the SDRP Supreme Council accepted with regret the resignation of Marek Borowski, but hoped his competence and qualifications would be used to full advantage in the future. Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the SDRP and also of the SLD, said that he hoped a coalition meeting could be arranged within hours, and said that it would be very bad if the existence of the coalition were threatened. He stressed that the SDRP council was firmly convinced borowski was the best-qualified person to hold the post of finance minister. Despite the SDRP calls for an urgent coalition meeting, it seemed unlikely on Saturday evening that a meeting would be held over the weekend. At PSL headquarters in Warsaw city centre, there was no- one present on Saturday evening to comment on the SDRP request. Kwasniewski also stressed the need for transparency in the regulation of relations within the coalition, which would not disintegrate so long as the guide-lines were clear, and as long as both parties wished for agreement. For our part, that was our clear intention, he said, adding that the Saturday session of the SDRP Supreme Council repeated this once again, and that it was hoped that the PSL would make the same declaration. However, the SDRP leadership was at pains to stress that, were the coalition to fall, the result would be political instability. "We trust that Mr Pawlak and the leadership of the PSL are aware of all the consequences of a failure to agree," commented Szmajdzinski. He recalled once again the need on both sides to honour the coalition agreement, and noted that most of the demands which Marek Borowski had put forward as his terms for remaining as finance minister formed part of that agreement. Late on Saturday, PAP received a statement from the SDRP Supreme Council, which appealed to the leadership and the parliamentary group of the PSL for "a meeting as soon as possible between the leading elements in the coalition to examine the clauses of the coalition agreement, and to make such changes so that it would not be possible to breach its letter or its spirit." The SDRP statement concluded: "We unanimously expect the Government of the Republic of Poland to adopt a document defining precisely the competences of persons in high office, the range of their responsibilities, and their obligations towards their coalition partner."
