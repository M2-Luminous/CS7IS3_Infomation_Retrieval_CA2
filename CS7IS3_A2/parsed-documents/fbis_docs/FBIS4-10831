The proposals were made during the so-called Parliaments in the Workplace, a process involving approximately 80,000 assemblies in which more than 3 million workers participated between February and March in the country's workplaces. Workers made many proposals for attaining profitability and economic efficiency in their respective enterprises to solve existing problems at that level. Other ideas tied to national issues will be analyzed in the National Assembly of the People's Government during a special meeting on 1 May, a meeting aimed at drafting the general outlines on measures that need to be adopted to improve the Cuban economy. Cuba is going through a stage of economic difficulties following the disappearance of the European socialist bloc (between 1989-1991) and implementation of the Torricelli Law, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1992, to heighten the siege against Cuba. The continuation of these meetings will begin this month in selected enterprises and will extend to all Cuban workplaces during the second half of May. The idea is to help, among other aspects, eliminate certain severe economic problems, such as an excess in currency of approximately 11 billion pesos (equivalent to the dollar according to the official exchange) and a 4.2-billion peso budget deficit. During the May assemblies workers will analyze the application of the proposed measures to stimulate work productivity, methods of saving raw materials and fuels, as well as undertake new productions or services that are of social use. These meetings will substitute current production assemblies, according to a CTC report quoted by the National Information Agency.
