Sufyan Abu-Zayda, one of the delegation members and Fatah spokesman in the Gaza Strip, said that the delegation's main message was that the settlements constitute an obstacle to peace. Another delegation member, Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, said that the leadership in Gaza believes in the peace process and is committed to it. 'Abd-al-Raziq was jailed for 21 years for having participated in setting a booby- trapped car in Rishon Leziyyon. He said that he and his friends have now changed their positions in the wake of the peace process. The delegation members complained that after the Hebron massacre, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units entered narrow alleys in Gaza and engaged in unnecessary confrontations instead of restraining themselves in the face of the local residents' expressions of grief. According to the four PLO leaders, some of the clashes were with children, some of whom were fired upon from a distance of 200 meters. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0930 GMT on 15 March adds that Abu-Zayda "said that the delegation's meeting with the Labor members was approved by 'Arafat and that he will brief 'Arafat about it."] Eight Labor faction members participated in the meeting. Knesset Member [MK] Yosi Katz insisted that the Palestinians should not take advantage of the Hebron massacre to add demands to the Declaration of Principles. MK Ya'el Dayan agreed that settlements in densely populated areas of Gaza should be evacuated. MK Dalya Itzik said she regrets the fact that there is no peace camp in the Palestinian street similar to Peace Now in Israel. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Knesset speaker refused a request from the right-wing factions to prevent the PLO delegation members from entering the Knesset. National Religious Party MK Yitzhaq Levi complained to the House Committee about the fact that this delegation was allowed into the Knesset while the wives of the jailed Kakh members were barred from doing so yesterday. This afternoon, the Knesset House Committee will discuss complaints in this regard raised by MK Levi and other right-wing MK's.
