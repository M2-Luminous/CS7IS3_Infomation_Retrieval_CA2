FR940826-0-00013 FR940826-0-00006 There are approximately 1,000 producers of filberts/hazelnuts in the production area and approximately 25 handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of filberts/hazelnuts may be classified as small entities. The Board's recommendation and this rule are based on requirements specified in the order. This rule finalizes an interim final rule which established the amount of inshell filberts/hazelnuts that can be marketed in domestic markets. The domestic outlets for this commodity are characterized by limited demand, and interim final and final free and restricted percentages benefit the industry by promoting stronger marketing conditions and stabilizing prices and supplies, thus improving grower returns. The interim final rule was issued on February 18, 1994, and published in the Federal Register [59 FR 9068, February 25, 1994], with an effective date of February 25, 1994. That rule added ยง982.242 to the rules and regulations in effect under the order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended March 28, 1994. One comment was received, from the United States Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy (SBA). The SBA's comment alleged that the Department should have undertaken an analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and should have sought public comment prior to placing the interim rule in effect. The comment by SBA fails to consider the distinct characteristics of the filbert program. Under this marketing order, there are permanent regulations that authorize a market allocation program for filberts and that specify exactly how the free and restricted percentages should be established and revised. Those provisions were adopted after a formal rulemaking hearing, a process that allows for a full presentation of all economic and operational evidence not only in written form, but also through oral testimony under oath and subject to cross-examination. The process additionally permits further briefing and exceptions based on this record of exhibits and testimony. Hence, there has been extensive economic analysis and public participation in the rulemaking adopting the market allocation program and specifying the market allocation calculation procedures. Each year the marketing order Board meets and considers a marketing policy for the coming year, including the activation of the market allocation program and the projected trade demand (as calculated under the specifications in the permanent regulations). The Board represents the entire filbert industry and brings to its deliberations the highest level of experience and expertise. The Board conducts open meetings and receives input of an economic nature from all interested persons. The Secretary's representatives are in attendance at such meetings and freely interact to gather any necessary economic or operational information. In addition, the Board is continually gathering economic data from a number of sources for its deliberations and for submission to the Secretary. At several points during the season, the Board holds further open meetings to update or revise the market allocation program for the year. In view of this unique and comprehensive system, the Department believes it is sufficiently knowledgeable to make a Regulatory Flexibility Act certification without any further studies or reports. In addition, there has been ample opportunity for public participation both in the formal rulemaking process that created the detailed market allocation program formula being applied herein, as well as thereafter to assure the Secretary that there has been no misapplication. Finally, it should be noted that the specific action commented-on is an interim rule which relieved restrictions by releasing the full free percentage immediately on February 25 rather than waiting until late May as may be provided under the order. This relaxation was effectuated only 10 days after the last date for marketing policy revisions and seeking further prior public participation would have significantly temporally diluted the value of this relief to the industry. Hence, the alternative championed by SBA would have maintained for a longer time more restrictive trade controls on small handlers.
