Ossetian President for Normal Relations with Neighbors LD1903210594 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1331 GMT 19 Mar 94 LD1903210594 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] [Text] Vladikavkaz, 19 Mar -- "The parliamentary hearings at the Federal Assembly and the closed session of the Federation Council are yet another attempt to settle relations between North Ossetia and Ingushetia by peaceful means, North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov said today. Speaking at a republican government session, members of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet Presidium, and heads of local self-government bodies of Vladikavkaz and regions, he stressed that the Republic of North Ossetia was extremely interested in establishing normal relations with all its neighbors in North Caucasus and the Transcaucasus. However, the multi-ethnic people of the republic denounce the use of force in resolving these issues. The issue of refugee return to Prigorodnyy Rayon should not be forced either. This problem should be tackled by conciliatory commissions on the basis of the Kislovodsk Agreements. The North Ossetian president reiterated his readiness to meet Ingush President Ruslan Aushev to discuss the settlement of relations between the peoples of the two republics. Speaking about the position taken by the commission of deputies that worked in the state of emergency zone and who reported to the parliament on the results of its trip to North Caucasus, Akhsarbek Galazov said that it had gathered vast material but had made hasty and nonobjective conclusions which may cause the situation in the region to explode and may bring to naught all earlier peace-making efforts by the North Ossetian leadership and the interim administration. He added that at the proposal of Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko, a special commission would be set up to draw up objective solutions aimed at settling the situation in the conflict zone.
