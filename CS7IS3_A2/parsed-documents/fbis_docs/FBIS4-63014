But We Are Unable To Sell Them"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Nikitin] What is aircraft engine manufacturing doing to maintain the state's lofty status? [Chuyko] Aeroengine manufacturing is enabling us to make scientific developments. The developments used in a military engine are used five years later in a passenger aircraft and in another five years in gas-turbine engines, in nuclear power engineering, shipbuilding, gas pumping, etc. Aviation science gives rise to new areas of industry and agriculture. More precise calculations are used along with new methods of technological processing and new equipment. And all that provides work for metallurgists, instrument manufacturers.... We are currently manufacturing around 200,000 mini-tractors and cultivators for agriculture. [Nikitin] What do you consider the main conditions for the development of aircraft engine manufacturing? [Chuyko] The main thing for us today is to formulate a national aviation policy. We need to secure state backing for science and for aircraft production and operation, focus efforts on ensuring flight safety, and bear in mind all the features involved in the privatization of defense complex enterprises. We must make up our minds what we actually want.
