FR941026-1-00027 FR941026-1-00013 Section 1653.3(b) provides the address for the TSP recordkeeper to which court orders should be sent for processing. Receipt by the recordkeeper is deemed receipt by the Board. Section 1653.3(c) provides the general rule that the Board will ``freeze'' the account of a TSP participant for whom a document has been received that purports to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order. When an account is frozen, the participant may not withdraw the account or obtain a loan from the account. The freeze is intended to ensure that the participant may not defeat the purposes of a court order by removing the funds from the account while the Board is conducting its review of what may turn out to be a valid order. Both 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467 indicate that the Executive Director may not make payments to the participant after receiving a qualifying court order until the court order has been complied with. Section 1653.3(d) lists certain types of documents that the Board views as not even purporting to constitute qualifying retirement benefits court orders. Therefore, these documents will be rejected without substantive review and no freeze will be placed on the account. Section 1653.3(d)(1) provides that an order will be rejected if it fails to indicate on its face that it has been issued or approved by a court, unless an accompanying document plainly establishes that the order was approved or issued by a court. An unsigned order will be rejected under this provision. Section 1653.3(d)(2) provides that an order will be rejected where the account has been closed, which may have occurred either because the participant withdrew his or her account or because the entire account was paid pursuant to an earlier court order. Similarly, because FERSA was enacted on June 6, 1986, court orders entered before that date cannot ``expressly relate'' to a TSP account, since the court could not have contemplated the existence of a TSP account. Accordingly, under ยง1653.3(d)(3), such orders will be rejected without review. Court orders awarding funds in the TSP account only to the participant (ยง1653.3(d)(4)) and court orders failing to make any mention of any retirement benefits (ยง1653.3(d)(5)) will also be rejected without substantive review and without freezing the account. Sections 1653.3(e) and (f) require a court order to be either an original or copy of a complete court order. If a court order is not complete, the parties will be given 30 days to submit a complete document. If it is not received within 30 days, the account will be unfrozen and the order will not be reviewed further. However, if the incomplete order does not include a signature or other indication that it was properly issued or approved by a court, then it will be rejected under ยง1653.3(d)(1) without a 30-day period for resubmission.
