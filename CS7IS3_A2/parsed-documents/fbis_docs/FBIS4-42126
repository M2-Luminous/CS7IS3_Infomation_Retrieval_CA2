Venizelos made the above statement when he was asked by the MACEDONIAN NEWS AGENCY to comment on the new barrage of Turkish press reports and the statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman on this issue. Venizelos said that the Turkish claims are an attempt to export Turkey's domestic problems. Contrary to Turkey, he said, Greece is absolutely open and accessible to everyone, so that at any moment anyone can check on the validity of the provocative Turkish claims about the existence of so-called PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] military camps in Greece. Asked whether there is any link between the provocative statement by Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman and similar remarks by Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi yesterday in Paris, Venizelos said that Greece is following all these developments and trying to analyze various points; it does not underestimate any version and factor. The spokesman concluded that Greece is firmly and persistently trying to be a factor of peace, security and stability in the Balkans. In addition, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas described the Turkish charges against our country as devoid of truth and totally unfounded. Bikas said that Turkey is going through a deep crisis in all sectors; it should search for the reasons for this and solve its problems with its domestic situation, socioeconomic shortcomings, and human rights violations. Greece wants to normalize its relations with Turkey, he concluded, but this depends on its stance on the Cyprus issue, absolute respect for sovereign rights in the Aegean and, of course, the suspension of the slanderous campaign against our country.
