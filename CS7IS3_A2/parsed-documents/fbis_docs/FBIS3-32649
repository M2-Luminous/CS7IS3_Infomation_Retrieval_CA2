The members of the new office, presided over by Senator Bernard Sansaricq, took possession of the administration of the Senate. The operation was possible with the help of a justice of the peace. Upon his return from Washington, Firmin Jean-Louis, who had obtained U.S. support, will find his office taken over by Bernard Sansaricq. Edner Jean, who followed the case, filed a report: [Begin recording] The operation took place on the afternoon of 9 February, a few minutes after the news conference by Sen. Sansaricq. This time, unlike the earlier, unsuccessful attempt on 7 February, journalists were not invited to cover the event, the second takeover of the office of the Senate of the Republic. The only witness to the operation remains the justice of the peace from the Department of the North who was executing an order from the deputy public prosecutor. To enforce their power in the Senate, the members of the Action Group for the Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty [GARD] [vernacular not currently available] were not moderate in their methodology. They simply broke down the doors to the offices of the president of the National Assembly and the quaestor. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, 9 February, they installed a second president in the Senate of the Republic. Today, 10 February, it is with a huge smile that Sen. Dupiton relates the facts. [passage omitted] Now that the contested 18 January elected took effective or fictitious control of the administration of the Senate of the Republic, the solution to the crisis is only days away, if one would believe Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, who could care less about the position of the international community or of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, spokesman for GARD, told Radio Metropole that their decision will be imposed on the nation. [passage omitted] While serious questions are being raised on the legality of the actions taken by the office of Sen. Sansaricq, a deputy from the Constitutionalist bloc, Samuel Madistin, revealed that Sen. Ebrane Cadet told him that the Army was behind this movement. [passage omitted] All things considered, with this new split within the Senate of the Republic, it is the very survival of the parliament itself that is being questioned. [end recording]
