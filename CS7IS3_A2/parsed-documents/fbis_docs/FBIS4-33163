In an extensive interview published today by the daily JORNAL DE ANGOLA, which has the greatest circulation here, Da Silva said his government is opposed to the embargo Washington has enforced on Havana for more than 30 years. The diplomat also referred to the current relations between this African state and the Latin American state, and he described them as very positive. He pointed out that following the political and economic changes that have taken place in the world in recent years, ties between the two countries had to be adjusted to the new situation. Nevertheless, he advocated conserving the traditional friendship between both peoples and governments. The ambassador pointed out that mutual cooperation includes a number of fields such as education and health, as well as others. He added that this cooperation will tend to increase to the degree Angola and Cuba emerge from their respective difficult situations. On the other hand, he described Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's visit to Luanda earlier this year as very constructive. To this effect, he announced that Angolan Foreign Minister Venacio Da Moura will soon be travelling to Cuba to reciprocate Robaina's visit.
