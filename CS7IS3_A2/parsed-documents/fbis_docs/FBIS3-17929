In this connection Aleksandr Kovalev, head of the oblast administration, has signed several decrees instructing the financial administration to regulate the rayon and city budgets and thus, it is planned, even out the oblast budget deficit. During the state of emergency period health care, education, social security, culture, and managerial structures will be on starvation rations -- they will be given the minimum funds needed to survive. Proposals aimed at cutting spending in these spheres are being given all kinds of backing. The state tax inspectorate and the tax police have been given total carte-blanche. They have been ordered to step up checks to ensure that the oblast and local budgets receive full and timely revenue payments. In effect Voronezh Oblast has decided to strengthen financial discipline by administrative means, tightening the screws in the loose reform mechanisms. On the other hand, evening out the budget deficit may be seen as a move toward retreat. I remember that censored military reports used to refer to a retreat as evening out the front line.
