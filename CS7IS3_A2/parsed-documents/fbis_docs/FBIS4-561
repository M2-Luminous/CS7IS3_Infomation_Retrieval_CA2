The president, who was addressing a special session of the NRC in Kampala today, told both winners and losers that the overall winner of the elections is the country, because of the peaceful and open manner in which they were held. He advised those who support the continuation of the Movement type of government not to shut out support, but to accommodate any Ugandan who says he is for the Movement system, regardless of his past and present performance or connections. He also advised those who support the reintroduction of the multiparty system now to ensure what they say is responsible and appealed to them not to incite hatred among the people. Earlier, the president called for a minute's silence in memory of Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprien Ntaryamira, who died in a plane crash on Wednesday [6 April] night. He described their death as a tragic event. Commenting on the problems in Rwanda and Burundi, Mr. Museveni lamented the overinternationalization of African problems, which tends to make people concentrate on winning the ear of the outsiders instead of listening to their compatriots. Citing Uganda as an example, he said the people must be left alone to solve their problems themselves, adding that he advocates African solutions to African problems, regional solutions to regional issues, and national solutions to national problems.
