The meeting pointed out that we must firmly adhere to the basic guideline -- namely, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- focus on economic construction, obey and serve the general requirements set for the whole party, and carry out all assignments for the propaganda and ideological front so as to provide powerful ideological support and a good environment needed to speed the establishment of a socialist market economic system; achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development; maintain political stability; and accelerate progress in all sectors of society. Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and head of its Propaganda Department, addressed today's session, which was chaired by Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and state councillor. In his speech, Ding Guangen pointed out: The conference on propaganda and ideological work held at this crucial period has a significant bearing on the overall situation. It is a meeting held at a time when the Central Committee, following the principle of being firm in attending to ideological and political work while proceeding with economic construction, is mobilizing the whole party and all propaganda and ideological workers to emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, intensify and improve propaganda and ideological work, and do an even better job in expediting socialist material and spiritual construction. This meeting has helped us to understand the situation more clearly, heighten our awareness, achieve a consensus of views, understand our assignments, and increase our confidence. We believe that this meeting will have a positive and significant impact on improving our propaganda and ideological work, creating a new situation, and accomplishing the Central Committee's assignments more effectively. Ding Guangen said: The basic guidelines, basic principles, concept of work, major tasks, and plans for propaganda and ideological work today and in the time to come are clear. The key requirement now is to make earnest efforts to comprehend and implement the guidelines in the important speeches given by leading comrades of the Central Committee, work earnestly, and firmly accomplish all assignments. Ding Guangen said: At this conference General Secretary Jiang Zemin has further expounded the main assignments for propaganda and ideological work. He pointed out that comrades on the propaganda and ideological front must firmly adhere to the basic guideline -- building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- and underscore work in four areas: theory, the media, ideological education, and the main theme [zhu xuan lu 0031 2467 1774], namely the work of "arming the people with scientific theories, guiding them with correct public opinion, moulding them with lofty spirit, and inspiring them with outstanding works." He said: The concept of "one basic guideline and work in four respects" which Comrade Jiang Zemin presented is the general plan and strategic thinking for intensifying propaganda and ideological work while building a new socialist market economic system. This concept embodies the past and present experiences China has gained from doing propaganda and ideological work during the period of socialist construction, it expounds the objective requirements which the law for socialist modernization has set for propaganda and ideological work, and it firmly grasps major propaganda and ideological issues having a close bearing on the overall situation. As far as the propaganda and ideological front is concerned, the basic guideline is the soul that sets the course of all our work, and the work in four areas is characterized by the four major construction projects embodying the basic guideline and projects that enable this guideline to succeed. When they uphold this basic guideline and accomplish the four major construction projects, departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work can accomplish their important missions more effectively; correctly publicize the party's theory, lines, principles, and polices; vividly reflect the people's great accomplishments; and unite all forces that can be united to fight and achieve the magnificient objective of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Ding Guangen noted: To accomplish the assignments of the propaganda and ideological front and upgrade our work, we must continue to emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, and follow the course of reform and opening up. The reform of propaganda and ideological work should be compatible with the requirements for developing the socialist market economy and socialist modernization, and it should be in line with socialist spiritual construction and the law of the development of propaganda and cultural undertakings themselves. Many things should be done in reforming propaganda and ideological work. In light of the current situation, it is urgent that we work hard in the following areas: First, we must uphold the principle that, in spiritual construction, we must place emphasis on construction instead of "launching movements" and carrying out "mass criticism" as in the past. Second, we must implement the principle of doing our work democratically and providing guidance. This means that we must respect people, understand them, and care about them so that we can arouse their initiative. Third, we must fully count on social forces and take advantage of the modern mass media. Fourth, we must intensify macroscopic control of propaganda and cultural undertakings, paying attention to guidance, total supply and demand [zong liang 4920 6852], mix of undertakings, and results, so that propaganda and cultural undertakings can be even more compatible with the needs of society. Fifth, we must make positive efforts to develop a socialist cultural market and make sure that it will develop healthily and thrive. Sixth, we must pay attention to research, and we must learn from foreign countries' outstanding cultures, achievements, and experiences in managing their cultural undertakings. Seventh, we must reform the management of our propaganda and cultural undertakings. Eighth, we must be more management conscious and speed the institutionalization and standardization of propaganda and cultural work so that there are regulations to follow. In short, the reform of propaganda and cultural undertakings must be conducted in a manner that enables the party to strengthen and improve its leadership over propaganda and culture, enables propaganda and cultural workers to bring their initiative and creativity into play, that furthers the prosperity of propaganda and cultural undertakings, and that furthers material and spiritual construction. To implement effectively the guidelines laid down by the conference, Ding Guangen stressed: We should assist propaganda and ideological work and not create trouble for it, sing the main theme and not create "noise," pay attention to social results and not to gains at the expense of integrity, abide by propaganda discipline and not do things our own way, centralize, not decentralize, our efforts, and do solid, not superficial, work. Ding Guangen pointed out: To carry out all assignments put forth by the party Central Committee, the propaganda and ideological front must have a contingent of good cadres. To be qualified propaganda and ideological cadres, we must have strong enterprising spirit and a high sense of responsibility. We must keep firmly in mind the need to consider Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the basic guideline, uphold the party's basic line without wavering, and maintain unity with the party Central Committee politically and ideologically as well as in action. We must consider the interests of the masses and serve the people wholeheartedly. We must be politically sharp, sober-minded, and take clear-cut stands. We must uphold dialectical materialism and guard against one-sidedness. We must be involved in discussing and handling important matters and keep the overall situation in mind. We must be broad-minded and able to promote unity. We must conduct in-depth investigation and be good at summing up experiences. When we work, we must make sure that actual results will be achieved. We must be strict with ourselves and perform our duties honestly. We must study hard and think diligently. Ding Guangen stressed: Comrades working on the propaganda and ideological front must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, persist in regarding Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the basic guideline, uphold the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering, strive to achieve unity and stability, exert great efforts, and do our work pragmatically. We must have a clear idea of general requirements, seize opportunity, boost morale, and proceed with an exploratory spirit. We must emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, be down to earth, and work hard so that our propaganda and ideological work can reach a new level and can can create a new situation and make fresh contributions. When the conference was in session, those in attendence studied the important speeches of Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji, studied Deng Xiaoping's expositions on socialist spiritual construction, and discussed propaganda and ideological projects for 1994. Li Lanqing, Wei Jianxing, and other leading comrades attended today's session.
