[Starchenko] In the past two to three years, the presence of our army here has been used for various political reasons. The same is occurring in Russia. But we are totally apolitical. Attempts are being made to convince the Latvians that we are aggressors. That is not our disposition. A situation of conflict occurred with Rucs and our detained generals, and our divisions had to be in combat readiness. But this is natural -- it is the law. Of course, everyone was thinking the same thing -- let it all end peacefully, let there be no blood shed. I am not a believer, but I would like to say -- thank God that everything turned out all right. Every soldier and every officer was happy about that. [Krasnov] This only demonstrated that our army can be regulated. But your military units act without thinking, the way we used to say -- "according to the revolutionary conscience". All right, so Rucs told them what to do. And then what? Didn't they themselves understand what could happen? [Starchenko] And also -- the fight against crime. Your military units have now been given unrestricted rights. I have my doubts about their loyalty when it comes to the Russian army. If we are being checked under the barrel of a gun, if we are threatened --this could very easily create another situation of conflict. Who is interested in causing this? Who has the right to search through my car and my pockets? Our foreign passports are considered illegal in Latvia. They are valid in all other countries, but for us to remain here, we are issued these little pieces of paper, real "walking papers". And this applies not only to us, but also to our wives and children! Written on these is -- valid until December 31, 1993. A new year has started, and we are told -- we are here illegally. We have to paste a red star in our car window, and we are even told where to paste it --at the spot where the most senior person sits. This looks like target practice -- if this is where they will aim, I will certainly get hit. Mr. Upmalis decides how many and what sort of vehicles we are allowed to use! I tell him -- I need fifty to supply my section, and he answers -- you will make do with ten. He knows better than I do! He, himself, is a high ranking Soviet officer. But now, he looks at a person in a Russian military uniform with the same amount of animosity as he looks at a Russian with no uniform. [Kocane] Speaking about the detained generals, you said that our military units do not consider what they are doing. Would you follow orders that were irrational? [Krasnov] We learned in 1991. In such cases, we will only obey written orders. These cannot be turned around later on. The incident with Rucs -- this once again confirms what patient people the Russians are. The Americans in our situation would have immediately taken action. Remember Panama! [Kocane] Overall, how would you evaluate Russia's attitude towards Latvia, the Baltics and other former Soviet republics? [Krasnov] Russia is the richest nation in Europe, but as you can see, we are still engaging in talks with you -- as one equal with another. Naturally, we don't have to be doing that. [Starchenko] Of course, during the Soviet era, life in Latvia and the other republics was better than in Russia. Have you thought about this? [Krasnov] And if you also consider how rich Latvia is in natural resources and how many valuable mining products it has... [Starchenko] It would be interesting to see your state's reaction if suddenly Russia were to say: all Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians -- march, back to your countries. We will no longer allow you to live here! [Kocane] At present, what are the most difficult to resolve problems for your family members? [Starchenko] Our wives are losing their jobs. All right, I understand that this is supposedly being done because they don't know the language. But there are cases where someone is not being let go, although he doesn't know a word of Latvian. This happens when you have a shortage of this type of specialist. We have specific examples. It would be interesting to know why the language law isn't being imposed in this case? [Krasnov] The Latvian educational system spans 12 years, the Russian -- 11. My daughter is graduating from the eleventh grade, but if we move to Russia, she will have to repeat the eleventh grade. We asked permission for our children to be taught according to the Russia curriculum, at least in one school. We were not allowed. The Latvian language is now considered as the standard. However, its level of teaching is extremely low. [Starchenko] I am an officer, and my family has been in Latvia for two years. Before this, we lived in Armenia. Now, I will probably end up in Estonia or Georgia. Will my children really be required to master all of these languages? My daughter is eleven years old. She goes to a store where they only speak Latvian to her. The child is unable to converse in Latvian, and she returns home without having bought anything. Animosity has been created between Latvian and Russian children. Has anyone considered how this has happened? [Kocane] You said that your new place of relocation is Strugy Krasniye, which is located 60 kilometers from Pskov. What awaits you there? [Starchenko] An empty field. A small village is located about 7 kilometers away. Maybe some will be able to rent rooms for their families. But at least 400 families from here are going. I have three children. If someone were to promise me a two room apartment, I would be very thankful. We are leaving behind here two apartments. Doesn't the Latvian government feel obligated to build something for us in their place? I am not asking for barracks, or garages, but only a place in which to put our families. Maybe also a small clinic, a little schoolhouse, and a bath house. What should we do? Live in tents with our children? Send our families to live with relatives? Many don't have any, others have relatives who live in hot spots -- as for example, north Caucasus. Still others just don't have that much living space. Our children will have no place to study -- the village has a school, but it is overfilled. There is no kindergarten. And it is self-evident -- there is no work for our wives. What are our families guilty of? [Krasnov] The Russian people did not suffer any less than other peoples during the Stalinist and stagnation years. [Kocane] If you are the only providers for your families, are you able to support them on your salaries? [Starchenko] Yes. [Krasnov] We receive our salaries in Russian rubles and in lats -the same as everywhere abroad. [Starchenko] But, believe me, your lats will not maintain its level for long. The stability of the lats is only an illusion. [Krasnov] We can support our families, but we are unable to buy apartments in Russia. [Kocane] How many empty apartments are there in Dobele-1 and Dobele-2 right now, and what is happening with them? [Krasnov] About 40% of the apartments are empty right now. We are not allowed to sell them. If a person comes and says -- I have no place to live, our commander gives him an apartment. [Starchenko] We could say -- I won't give it to you -- you are a Latvian -- why do you speak Russian with an accent? [Krasnov] Of course, the city board is not registering these people. Why is this so? Apparently the board is planning to hold an auction and then rip off these people three-fold. [Kocane] What are your thoughts about the future of the Skrunda radar detection facility? [Krasnov] This facility is necessary for the safety of Europe. I will say frankly -- from there we can tell where a rocket or an atomic bomb has been fired. America has the same type of facility in Denmark. If the Skrunda facility is dismantled, half of Europe will remain without surveillance. We should think about security in general! Skrunda is better insurance for Latvia's security than all of your armed forces. Do you have such a large army? If you consider Russia to be your major enemy, then, even if all of Latvia's inhabitants are armed, you will not be able to stand up against our army! [Starchenko] Skrunda is also needed by Latvia, but for your government, the principle is more important. [Krasnov] The same thing happened at the end of the nineteen eighties, when many enterprises were closed, supposedly because of ecological reasons. It is now known that this was purely a political move. And Skrunda is also a political move. You shouldn't be afraid of it. Intelligent and rational people are employed there. You certainly don't have any such specialists to operate this radar facility. Dismantle it? With what funds? You already have a budget deficit. I think that -- what is needed here is, for instance, NATO as an impartial party to decide -- whether to leave the Skrunda radar facility or not. Otherwise, I doubt whether both of our sides will be able to come to an agreement. [Kocane] What is your opinion of the election results in Russia? [Krasnov] You are probably asking about Zhirinovsky. Luckily, there were his latest comments -- about the Japanese blockade and changing presidents in Bulgaria, and so forth. No one takes him seriously anymore. This is just a comedy. Naturally, we should realize that there will be more of these Zhirinovsky-types. In the present situation, we are creating them ourselves. However, it should be mentioned that the people don't trust Gaidar, either. People are sinking in poverty. I can speak highly of the government only after I have eaten. And also, a statesman's outward appearance it also important. Look at how the American President looks. What a stance he has! No matter what -- we only want one thing. That is for our army to be kept out of any involvements. We only want peace.
