The unit is 1,000 feet in length and XXXX ( XXXX ) feet in width (to be measured XXXX ( XXXX ) feet on one side of pole line or centerline of structures) of actual clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps which shall not exceed XXXX in height, shall be clear from the ground up on one side of the line of poles carrying conductors. (See Detail A, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A.) The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or centerline of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line. (See Detail B, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A.) All trees and underbrush across the width of the right-of-way shall be considered to be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing. (See Detail C, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A.) Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted from the total measurement. All length thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000 shall give the number of 1,000-foot TM&hyph;12 units of clearing. The Bidder shall not remove or trim shade, fruit, or ornamental trees unless so directed by the Engineer in writing. TM&hyph;12 (1). This unit is identical with TM&hyph;12, except the full width of the right-of-way to be cleared shall be XXXX ( XXXX ) feet wide (to be measured XXXX ( XXXX ) feet on each side of the pole line or centerline of structures). (See Detail D, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A.) TMC&hyph;12, TMC&hyph;12 (1). These units are identical to the respective TM units except that chemical treatment of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming. TM&hyph;13. The unit, for purpose of quoting, is 1,000 feet in length of clearing off the right-of-way. The Engineer will select those trees off the right-of-way that he deems to be a hazard to the line and will designate them to the Bidder in writing as danger trees. When so designated, the Bidder shall remove or top such trees at his option except that the Bidder shall trim and not remove shade, fruit, or ornamental trees unless otherwise directed by the Engineer in writing. (See Drawings TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A and TM&hyph;13 for examples of danger trees.)
