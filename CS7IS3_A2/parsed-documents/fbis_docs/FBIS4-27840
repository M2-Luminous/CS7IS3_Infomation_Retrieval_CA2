"We are currently considering the convening of Japan-South Korea foreign ministerial talks," the top government spokesman said at a news conference. But Kumagai hastened to add that the schedule has yet to be fixed and the planned session does not necessarily aim to discuss the two countries' response to North Korea's alleged push for nuclear arms. It will be meaningful to exchange views at a high-level, he noted. Kumagai said he will discuss the planned talks with South Korea when he meets with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Kakizawa later Monday. Hata, Kakizawa and Kumagai meet on Monday night to listen to a report from Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who represented Japan at trilateral talks with the United States and South Korea last week. At that time, the three countries adopted a united front and urged the U.N. Security Council to take prompt action against North Korea, including the consideration of economic sanctions. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference that Japan wants to hold the foreign ministerial meeting as early as possible considering the situation surrounding North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons. But he said the meeting has not yet been set because of Diet schedules. Saito said Kakizawa and South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung- chu will discuss a wide range of issues since it is a regular foreign ministerial meeting. The previous meeting was held in September when Han visited Japan. The Foreign Ministry is also preparing to dispatch Kakizawa to China, which opposes sanctions against North Korea, for talks with his counterpart Qian Qichen next Sunday, the sources said. Kakizawa is expected to urge China to exert influence on Pyongyang, its traditional ally, to accept full inspections of its nuclear facilities. However, Kakizawa's trip might have to be postponed in connection with developments during the ongoing Diet session, they said.
