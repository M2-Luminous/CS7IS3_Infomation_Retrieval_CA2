There Are Problems, But Even They Are Surmountable. Summer Training Period in Russian Armed Forces Began 1 June"] [Text] The winter combat training period was more difficult than ever before. Judge for yourselves: Reform of the Armed Forces continues, troop groupings and infrastructures are being set up on Russian Federation territory, the withdrawal of troops to Russian territory is being completed, and mobile forces are being created.... And all this is going on when funding for military programs is clearly inadequate, there is a huge personnel shortage, and the social problems dogging servicemen are in practice insuperable today. Nevertheless, due credit has to be given to the Army and Navy: Despite all these difficulties, they demonstrated during the winter period that they remain wholly battleworthy and controlled. On the whole, they fulfilled the training plans. And, a particularly important point, they proved their mettle quite well in command-staff training drills at both the strategic and the operational-strategic levels, and also in the "Baykal" and "Northwest" command staff exercises and in exercises for collective peacemaking forces and Border Troops on the Tajik-Afghan border and others. Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev noted that the weightiest successes were attained by the Strategic Missile Troops, Moscow and Leningrad Military Districts, the Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus, and the Leningrad Naval Base. Matters fared worse in the Pacific Fleet. So what were the specific results with which the troops and naval forces arrived at the halfway mark? What will the emphasis be on in the summer combat training period? Strategic Missile Troops As Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Dolinin, our permanent correspondent for the Strategic Missile Troops, reports, during the winter half of the year the troops resolved a triple task, as it were. New regiments equipped with "Topol" missiles were brought into the effective combat strength, old missile complexes which had served double their recommended lifetime were removed from alert duty, and the testing of the new "Topol M" missile progressed vigorously at the test range in Mirnyy. However, alert duty did not cease even for a minute against the backdrop of this extensive and complex work. Planned combat training is also progressing smoothly. Russian Federation Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev, Ivan Rybkin, and Vladimir Shumeyko, who visited the Strategic Missile Troops this year, made a high assessment of the missilemen's combat readiness. When it comes to the plans and tasks for the summer training period, Lieutenant General Viktor Yesin, chief of the Strategic Missile Troops Main Staff Operations Directorate, stressed, then the triple task which was being resolved in the winter training period remains for the summer too. Ground Troops The tasks for the winter period were on the whole fulfilled by the Ground Troops. Although only 70 percent of the planned number of exercises were conducted during the winter training period. The problems of maintaining combat readiness, improving the combat skill of troops, and bolstering discipline and law and order are now being tackled. Questions of manning units and combined units remain acute. At present primary officer posts are just over 60 percent filled, and the shortfall in the numbers of soldiers and sergeants is even greater. So it is planned to hire 90,000 men on a contract basis this year. Air Forces An effective summary of the results of the winter training period, Colonel Gennadiy Lisenkov, press center chief, reports, was the "West-94" command-staff exercise conducted under the leadership of Air Force Commander-in-Chief Colonel General of Aviation Petr Deynekin. This exercise involved strategic bombers, fighters, frontal aviation, and practically all Air Force communications centers, and combat engineer service subunits and rear services subunits. The crews performing alert duty proved to be up to the mark. The large strategic formations commanded by General V. Kozlov and General A. Vasilyev were commended. But the airmen also have plenty of problems. The improvement of existing aviation formations, which are left with only "fourth generation" combat equipment, has been set for the summer training period and the period through the year 2000. New hardware has to be mastered quickly. However, there are shortages at every step here. The dearth of aviation fuel, spare parts, and specialist equipment used at airfields is being felt keenly.... Navy The substantial changes in the foreign and domestic situation required that the entire system of views on the organizational development and utilization of naval forces be radically revised. A fitting concept was elaborated. By the end of the winter training period substantial measures to reform the Navy and give it qualities consonant with present conditions were completed. Combat service and alert duty remained the most important indicators of the real status and activity of the Navy. These were implemented according to plan by the forces of all fleets in the light of the actual situation and operational need. Daily combat service at sea and alert duty at bases was performed by several dozen ships, and almost one half of these were submarines. According to the plans, in the summer training period ships will continue to resolve tasks at sea, including in the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and also the Barents and Okhotsk Seas, and in the Atlantic Ocean. Air Defense Troops During the last training year the only regiment in Russia's Armed Forces to be deemed excellent was the Air Defense regiment under the command of Colonel Anatoliy Akulinin. It is too early to say what the situation will be this year, but the fact that the leaders inspired others in their wake is indisputable. As Commander-in-Chief Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov stressed, though numbers were cut, the quality and reliability of the Air Defense Troops were maintained. The "Northwest" and "Repulse-94" command staff exercises tested and rehearsed the principles of the organization and control of various types of Troops and air defense systems. During the training period 31 exercises were carried out, and five surface-to-air missile units and seven aviation regiments conducted live fire. Those serving under Lieutenant General Anatoliy Bochkov were deemed to be the best. Particular attention will be paid during summer combat training to the system for monitoring Russia's airspace and to improving the missile early warning system. The principle for structuring the air defense system is also to change. It will become territorial. The main efforts will be channeled into developing teamwork and coordination and training crews and subunits for action in a complex, rapidly changing situation, making maximum use of the combat potential of hardware and arms. Exercises will be conducted jointly with units from other branches of the Armed Forces. But, our permanent correspondent for the Air Defense Troops Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Ivanov reports, unless it proves possible soon to rectify the situation regarding the provision of units with resources making it possible to carry out combat training systematically, combat readiness may decline. As we can see, it has not yet proved possible in all branches of the Armed Forces to organize the training process the way it should ideally be. The country and the Army are going through only too difficult a time. So all the more respect is warranted by those military districts, combined units, and units where, in the face of objective difficulties, people are finding a way of retaining a planned and systematic approach and carrying out the necessary drills with command personnel and training exercises. The combat readiness of the Army and Navy is based on such military formations, and they primarily determine the face of Russia's present Armed Forces.
