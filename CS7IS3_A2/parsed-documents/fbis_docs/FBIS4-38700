"There should be no haste in signing the `Partnership for Peace'. The Russian (military) might is comparable to that of NATO. We have first to understand what partnership we are being offered. It is inappropriate to commit ourselves to putting the signature by a fixed date because the talk is about a very important issue," he told TASS on Wednesday adding that "when time comes" the document should be signed by the Russian president. Lobov stressed that the issue also depends on the NATO leadership, which has received Russian proposals on joining the organisation. "NATO has to voice its attitude towards them", he said. "Russia has expressed its principled position -- it is for partnership. As far as concrete questions are concerned, such as armaments, the creation of corresponding structures and so on, their consideration needs time", Lobov said, and added that the Russian Security Council will discuss the results of the consideration. The top Russian security body has not yet voiced its point of view as the decision is currently being drafted, he explained. He denied mass media allegations that the Security Council is not engaged in discussing the prospects of Russia's joining the "Partnership for Peace" plan. Lobov recalled that the Council includes the president, the defence, foreign and interior ministers, i.e. people who design the policy in this aspect. Lobov is not confused by the fact that those people often voice different opinions on the question. "Each of them can have his own approach to the problem at the initial stage. Nuances in viewpoints of Security Council members should not be assessed as contradictions", he said, adding that the Security Council is a body where various opinions are discussed in order to arrive to the final conclusion.
