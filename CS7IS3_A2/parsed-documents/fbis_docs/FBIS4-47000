Yusin: "Moscow and Tallinn Seek Measures To Influence Each Other"] [Text] Russia probably has not had such strained relations developing with any other republic of the former USSR as with Estonia. The brief visit by Andrey Kozyrev to Tallinn confirmed that there is still very far to go to a true partnership and good neighborliness. "Kozyrev = Goebbels"--this sign in the hands of an Estonian girl greeted the Russian minister in Tallinn. Kozyrev, however, did not leave that unanswered. "We shall not withdraw troops from Estonia until questions connected with military pensioners are settled," he declared at Vnukovo Airport a few minutes before departing for the Estonian capital. While the next day, appearing before Russian- speaking residents of Tallinn, the head of Russian diplomacy was even more frank: "We shall apply every measure of economic, political, and sociological pressure so that Estonian authorities will observe the rights of national minorities." Russian-Estonian relations are clouded by three main problems. First of all by the presence of Russian troops, the withdrawal of which Tallinn has been demanding without success for some three years. Today Estonia remains the only Baltic country that has not settled that issue with Russia. In Lithuania, as commonly known, there are no more Russian soldiers, while they will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August 1994, in accordance with the recently signed agreements. Russian military presence in Estonia is not all that significant--there are around 2,000 soldiers and officers in the republic. It would seem there should be no serious difficulties with their withdrawal, all the more since as long ago as last year Russia promised to complete the evacuation of troops by the fall of 1994. The situation, however, underwent a change. The flare-up of nationalist moods in Russia could not help but be reflected in the attitude toward Baltic countries. Among the Russian political elite it became fashionable to prove one's patriotism with hard-line declarations directed at Latvia and Estonia. The authorities of these two republics in turn promoted the aggravation of relations with the Kremlin by passing a series of laws which Moscow viewed as discriminatory toward the Russian-speaking population. The result was quick in coming--Russia withdrew its promise to move out the troops by 31 August. That step certainly did not improve our reputation in the world. Western leaders did not conceal their negative attitude toward preservation of the military presence of Moscow on the territory of sovereign states contrary to the will of their governments. Judging by everything, Russian authorities themselves felt uncomfortable: having "intimidated" Latvia and Estonia, they simultaneously initiated negotiations with them, letting it be understood that in exchange for certain concessions they were prepared to withdraw their forces by the deadline. With Latvia that tactic worked, but the Estonians displayed much more stubbornness, and primarily, with regard to the question concerning the status of military pensioners. Moscow demands that these people (of whom there are 10,500 in the republic, and with family members--over 40,000) be given residence permits. Tallinn refuses to do that, considering that the retired military constitute a threat to state security. The Kremlin took a rigid position--if the Estonians do not comply with Russian demands, the troops will not be withdrawn by 31 August. At the same they understand both in Moscow and in Tallinn that this is no more than a delay, sooner or later the troops will leave anyway. Otherwise it will be difficult to understand the behavior of Russia other than as an occupier--with all of the resulting consequences to relations between Moscow and the West. It is hardly likely that President Yeltsin will go for that. It is more likely that those measures of political and economic pressure, which were mentioned by Kozyrev, will be applied against Tallinn. It is not precluded that with time Moscow will decide to introduce sanctions, even though at the present time members of the Russian delegation insisted that this question is not being considered. As far as political pressure is concerned, there is no denying that the Russian minister of foreign affairs is persistent. Over the past several months there has not been a single European forum at which he did not raise the issue of discrimination against Russians in Estonia. The Tallinn Baltic countries foreign ministers' conference was no exception. Initially Kozyrev had no plans to travel to the Estonian capital. The doubts disappeared after Moscow received assurances that the Baltic Council will establish the post of a special commissioner for human rights, following the example of the CSCE. Kozyrev decided to abandon his boycott of the conference and express his attitude toward the policy of Estonian authorities in another way. The conference had barely opened when the Russian minister delivered a surprise, making public a letter recently received by the Russian Embassy. The war veterans complained about Estonian bureaucracy requiring countless certificates in order to obtain a residence permit, including results of tests for AIDS and syphilis (which Kozyrev emphasized in particular). A third painful problem in Russian-Estonian relations--territorial claims of Tallinn against Moscow, also surfaced in the course of the visit. Estonians are demanding the return of lands seized by Stalin shortly after Soviet occupation. Russia refuses even to discuss that matter. Estonian claims produce ill concealed irritation in Moscow, and in most of the European capitals--skeptical smiles. At the final press conference a squabble developed between Kozyrev and his Estonian colleague Juri Luik. Luik stated that he will be raising the territorial issue at the Paris conference on stability in Europe, where both ministers were to fly directly after the Baltic conference. Kozyrev promised that in France that issue will not even be studied. "As you see, I have kept my word," the Russian minister declared with satisfaction, two days after the Paris forum ended. "Not a word was said about the territorial claims of Estonia." Russian diplomats pin their main hope for overcoming the crisis in bilateral relations on Estonian President Lennart Meri. Recently he has spoken from very moderate positions, thereby invoking the anger of supporters of a rigid policy. Negotiations between Kozyrev and Meri continued for two hours instead of the scheduled 30 minutes. It was decided to renew negotiations discontinued in April in the immediate future. On Smolensk Square they are hoping that Tallinn will still agree to a compromise on the issue of pensioners. An impression is forming that Meri is gravitating toward the same decision, however, he will find it difficult to overcome the opposition of Luik and that of Prime Minister Mart Laar who hold a more radical view. "Let us look truth in the eye. The world does not understand our concern about the military pensioners. We must realize that, no matter what, we will not be able to get rid of most of the Russian retired officers," Toivo Klaar, director of the Political Department of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, declared. His article was published on the day of Kozyrev's arrival. According to Klaar, Estonia has no intention of deporting "70-year-old war veterans." Questions arise in connection with the 35-40-year old KGB and GRU officers who retired following the August putsch. In the view of Estonian authorities, it is specifically these people who pose the principal threat to the security of the nation. Up to now, however, Russia is not agreeing to the separation of pensioners into those who are seventy and those who are younger. It is possible to assume that at the forthcoming negotiations this issue will become a stumbling block and Moscow, despite everything, will have to take into account the concern of Estonians and manifest some flexibility.
