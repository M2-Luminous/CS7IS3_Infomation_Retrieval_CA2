G. Krasilenko, T. B. Martynyuk, N. I. Zabolotnaya, V. N. Dubchak; UDC 681.325.2+681.327.68:778.38] [Abstract] A feasibility of developing a digital optoelectronic processor of multi-level images employing an algebraic addition of sign changing matrices is examined. This study is based on a stack coding concept. With stack coding the number is being coded by a stack in K plane image matrices, while the least significant bit is fixed in the first matrix, the next significant bit in the second matrix, etc. Thus, all the initial numbers, as well as the results of processing can be represented by K digits, i.e. by K representations with dimensions NxM, each containing digit shears NxM of binary numbers. A space-continuous arithmetic-logic device is developed for synthesis of algebraic additions of sign-changing matrices. The multi-input arithmetic- logic device for processing binary images is a fundamental operating unit for expanding the functional capacity and speed of processing.
