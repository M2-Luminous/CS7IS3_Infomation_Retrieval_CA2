These conversations, encoded or not, are recorded and, if need be, decoded by the French intelligence services. It is a simple question of technique. Above the Mediterranean, an Atlantic-2 plane permanently monitors these military communications. Lower down, in international waters, is the patrol boat Le Berry, belonging to the General Directorate for External Security (DGSE). Equipped to intercept all telephone and satellite communications, Le Berry records messages from the Algerian military but mainly monitors civilian governmental communications. This is probably not enough to know everything that moves among our neighbors. In Algeria proper, the "big ears" of the military intelligence branch of the DGSE are also working. Thanks to perfected scanners, our intelligence operatives monitor the local communications of the special units and the gendarmery, which are the most deeply engaged in the fight. In June 1993, for instance, our newspaper had mentioned the interception of a radio conversation between a unit pursuing clandestine operatives in an Algiers neighborhood and an official from the former Military Security who explicitly gave the order to execute the wounded fundamentalists arrested in a sweep. This says much about the reason why Mitterrand, Balladur, Juppe, and Leotard should worry about Algeria. In their recent notes, the French services estimated the weekly balance sheet of this new war at 200 dead. Desertions and arms thefts occur. Clandestine operatives who do not hesitate to circulate in rural areas, show themselves to the people, attack barracks and set ambushes. This is no longer terrorism and repression. Finally, always according to the French services, young Algerian officers, from lieutenants to commandants, are not all faithful partisans of the present leaders. This pre-civil war situation troubles many of them. [passage omitted]
