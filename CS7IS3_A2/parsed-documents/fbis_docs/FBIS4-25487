At present, there are 240 wholly owned, joint venture, or partnership enterprises in Tibet. In the last eight years, contracts on 600 economic coordination projects have been signed involving an investment of 700 million yuan. In establishing lateral economic ties with the hinterland, Tibet has upheld the principle of combining giving play to superior local natural resources with the introduction of new techniques. The Lhasa Cement Plant succeeded in raising its cement quality to state standards and eliminated its long-standing losses by establishing a joint venture with the Sichuan Emei Cement Plant, which helped import an advanced production line. The Lhasa Farm Machinery Gypsum Plant overcame difficulties by introducing new techniques for producing gypsum from the Hunan Zhuzhou New Building Materials Factory and the Zhengzhou Design Institute. Last year Tibet approved 41 joint venture projects ranging from transportation to light industry, textiles, commerce, and trade. Tibet has also invested in other localities to make money. Since 1991, Tibet has set up 39 productive and operating enterprises in 18 provinces and autonomous regions in the hinterland involving an investment of 170 million yuan. Out of 39 projects, 25 are profitable, with annual earnings amounting to 46 million yuan, while certain enterprises recovered their investment in the same year they made the investment.
