Addressing the opening session of the Trilateral Commission, Hosokawa contended that his government has laid down the ground work for deregulation since it came to power last August. The commission is formed by 330 former political and business leaders from Japan, the United States and Europe to set forth proposals on problems of common interest. It is chaired by former U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. The current session, which opened at a Tokyo hotel on Saturday, is the commission's 25th general meeting. Hosokawa announced Friday he will step down to take responsibility for a stalemate in the Diet over his personal problems, including a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, the scandal-tainted trucking group. Referring to foreign criticism that Japan's markets are closed to imports, Hosokawa said Japan should take positive action to open its markets, regarding such criticism as an expression of hope for an economic transformation. He said promoting economic reform not only benefits the Japanese people but is also Japan's international obligation.
