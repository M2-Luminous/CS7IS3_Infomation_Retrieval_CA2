According to a military source, the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets staged a surprise strike exercise to invade the North in the midst of electronic jamming on 31 March. F-15 fighter bombers, FA-18 pursuit assault planes, EA-6 electronic jamming planes, which arrived from overseas bases, and fighter planes under the control of the U.S. Air Force occupying South Korea and the puppet Air Force were committed on a large scale. On the same day, electronic jamming planes, which hurled into the skies above Yongwol, Wonju, and Chunchon from a base in Japan, caused electronic jamming in this area. Also, strike air corps were called to frantically stage a surprise strike exercise on the targets. Thus, a violent warlike atmosphere was kicked up. This war exercise was a commotion of playing with fire aimed at enhancing the actual combat capabilities for a cooperative surprise strike to invade the North through the electronic jamming planes. In addition, the South Korean puppets were running amuck in gunfiring and helicopter operation exercises at the front line, right in front of our face. On 31 March the puppet Army's large-caliber artillery groups and heavily armed hooligans, who took firing positions throughout the area of Naedae-ri and (Kwanu)-ri, Cholwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and (Pangmok)-ri, Paju County, and Majon-ri and Tanjung-ri, Yongchon County, Kyonggi Province, kicked up a war frenzy by firing over 60 105mm shells and 1,000 large-caliber machine gun bullets near the Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line. On the same day, the South Korean puppets deployed scores of large-caliber guns around the area of Chupa-ri, Cholwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and dragged in some 500 armed hooligans into the area near Susan-ri, Inje County and (Kangnae)-ri, Yonchon County. Also on this day, some 10 armed helicopters and transport helicopters of the puppets were running amok after being mobilized in the skies over Yonchon, Pochon, and Cholwon, South Korean Kangwon Province, right in front of our face, in support of ground attacks and airlifting of war material. At a time when the U.S. imperialists are applying unreasonable pressure to implement nuclear inspections of our Republic and are deploying, on a large scale, up-to-date weapons to South Korea, what is becoming all the more serious is the fact that all of these frenzy commotions of playing with fire by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets are driving the situation of the Korean peninsula toward a dangerous phase.
