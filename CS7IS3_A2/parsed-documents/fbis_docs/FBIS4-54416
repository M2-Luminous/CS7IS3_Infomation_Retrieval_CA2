The movement was set up by leaders of the "Federation of Persecutees of Communism", the Hungarian National Front, and the World National Popular Rule Party: Gyorgy Ekrem Kemal, Istvan Gyorkos, and Albert Szabo, respectively. The three HM co-presidents said they identify at least partly with the ideas of Ferenc Szalasi's arrow-cross party. At the news conference, Szabo called Szalasi an ideal of Hungarian youth. (Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led the Hungarian arrow-cross party-Hungarist movement. Hitler helped him to power on October 15, 1944, and he introduced a reign of fascist terror in the country. The Hungarian people's court sentenced him to death as a war-criminal, in 1946.) According to Istvan Gyorkos, the Hungarist Movement had to be founded to counter strengthening left-wing influence, because the national parties have made a compromise and fail to represent the nation's interests. He said the court must acknowledge their movement if it registered the Zionist Federation and the Masonic Lodges. In response to questions from the press, Gyorkos insisted that Hungarism was not responsible for the Holocaust, because in 1944 the arrow-cross party controlled only a few counties in Transdanubia, and he claims it was the Hungarists who prevented Jews in the Budapest ghetto from being deported. The movement currently has about 500 members and many sympathizers, HM leaders informed the press.
