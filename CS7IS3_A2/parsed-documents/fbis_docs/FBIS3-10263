Camacho Solis reiterated his conformation with the commitments reached in the Zapatists' presence. The first phase of the peace and reconciliation talks in Chiapas resulted in 34 commitments. We will later describe the commitments reached, as well as the EZLN demands and Commissioner Manuel Camacho's responses during almost 10 days of this first phase. Peace has not been signed in Chiapas. The Zapatists are returning to their communities to report on the agreements reached. The commissioner, the Zapatists, and mediator Samuel Ruiz will meet again, probably by the end of this month, although the date has still not been set. After Camacho Solis departed, the EZLN delegates, accompanied by International Red Cross representatives, returned to their communities to explain the agreements. I repeat, they will return to San Cristobal de las Casa before the month is over.
