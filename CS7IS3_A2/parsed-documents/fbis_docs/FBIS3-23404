Prominent Lebanese religious leader, Allamah Sayyid Hasan Fadlallah, commenting on the incident, said here today that the massacre of the innocent people and students could not be justified under any excuse, political or religious. Lashing out at the international organizations and the United States for their deadly silence towards the latest Zionist crime, he said the U.S. and Europe which claim to be vanguards and advocates of human rights, did not even utter a word in condemnation of the savage shelling of al-Nabatiyah. Several innocent students were killed and wounded in the shelling of the Israeli Army. `This silence only proves that the U.S. is an accomplice in the killing of the people of South Lebanon,' he said. The secretary general of Hizballah, Sayyid Husayn Nasrallah also strongly criticized Washington's policies towards the Zionist regime's crimes, and said: `Washington's silence once again proved that the rights of the nations and human values in general are of the least importance for the U.S. and other arrogant powers, and that they only care for the Zionists and their children.' The Hizballah secretary general called on the Lebanese people to get united in the fight against the Israeli aggressions and reiterated his party's all-out support for the anti-Zionist struggle. Leader of the Islamic Amal Movement, Husayn al-Musawi called the U.S. `the gang leader of the world's terrorists' and said Washington was the enemy of the nations and universal peace. `The brand of peace that the United States is trying to impose on the countries of the region, is only a cover-up to serve its own illegitimate interests,' he added. Al-Musawi also strongly criticized the United Nations Security Council and said the organization was an executive of Washington's terroristic policies. Meanwhile, the association of Lebanese Muslim ulama in a statement issued here today, termed the U.S. `the great satan' and a government without any humanitarian intentions.
