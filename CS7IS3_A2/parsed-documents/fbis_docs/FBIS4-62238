Border Troops Commander Andrey Nikolayev: "`Keep Out'-- an Absolutely Incompetent Approach" -- place and date not given] [Excerpts] As he left the post of first deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff "to become a border guard," Nikolayev is said to have "coaxed" many of his former subordinates to follow him. There are about 40 of them, who are called "watermelons" because they are green as border guard shoulder boards on the outside, but inside they are as red as army shoulder boards. They have brought along lots of new things to the border troop service. Nikolayev has tested new methods of command and control of the border troops by setting up a "mini-general staff," particularly the central command post, something hitherto unheard of in the border troops. Coordination between the army and the border troops has been established on the Tajik border. The practice of publishing intelligence reports on the eve of mujahidin assaults helps maintain a more or less peaceful existence. Of all newspapers, the commander in chief of the Russian Border Troops has given MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS his first interview. [Kholodov] Andrey Ivanovich, one of these days marks precisely nine months since you were placed in command of the border troops. This is a period sufficient even to give birth to a baby. Have you managed to push through any changes in the border service? [Nikolayev] Even recently the Russian Border Troops have been merely a main service of the Security Ministry. It has been for four months now (from 1 December) that they turned into a federal service that, according to its status, is not simply a ministry, but an agency that shapes state policy in the area of border protection. Now the border is not merely a line where a border guard in uniform fulfills his service duties, but a frontier from which the state begins. [passage omitted] [Kholodov] Are you subordinate to the Federal Counterintelligence Service director? Can he, say, "summon" you? [Nikolayev] I report only to the president. [Kholodov] In addition, you have become a member of the Security Council and your agency has turned from a command into a main command... [Nikolayev] Not quite so. We are "the Federal Border Service -- the Main Command of the Border Troops." [passage omitted] [Kholodov] The length of the Russian state border is 60,932.8 km. Of them, 14,000 km (more than 80 percent of the land border) are new borders that have effectively not been formalized from the point of view of international law. In 1993, 43 million people crossed the Russian border, which amounts to a 21-fold increase against previous years. [Nikolayev] The very concept of border protection has also changed. The old "compression concept" said that Russia should draw back into its territory. It has a border and the border must be protected. But a question arose: Where do Russian interests lie? Where should its security be protected? We say: We must ensure Russia's security along its national borders and also along advanced lines within the Commonwealth. Why should we set up a new border with Kazakhstan that is over 6,500 km long? There is no infrastructure there. But everything we need is on the old border. Then why shouldn't we protect it jointly, defending Russian interests THERE? Internal borders within the CIS, however, should be made transparent. They tell us: You want to restore the borders of the USSR. But first of all we want to ensure Russia's national interests. The Russian state spent ages to reach those borders to throw them away overnight. [Kholodov] Then, a question. Why should borders be transparent only within the Commonwealth? For instance, wouldn't Azerbaijan like to have a transparent border with Turkey or Iran? [Nikolayev] Everyone says: We are sovereign. But Russia is also a sovereign state. We have presented Azerbaijan with a choice: Either it takes part in the joint border protection system that includes Russia, or we will close the Russian-Azerbaijani border, something we have actively been doing at present. They say: We want this border to remain transparent. Then ensure our interests on the "external" border, and we will not erect this one. We have already signed treaties with Armenia and Georgia. Russian border guards protect the border there and are financed on a shared basis -- 50:50 with Armenia and 60:40 with Georgia, including soldiers, officer personnel, and contractees. Moreover, in the Caucasus we had to build a border in an unconventional way -- in two lines. The first one is drawn along the former USSR border. But owing to civil wars the Caucasus is currently oversaturated with arms and drugs; because of an open border between Azerbaijan and Iran everyone may walk there whichever way he likes. This is why we are setting up the second line of border control in the North Caucasus. This is not a troop line -- there are no fences there, only border checkpoints and operational units, including troops, that ensure control in between these points. [Kholodov] Can you estimate how much money Russia will have to throw away on restoring the border? [Nikolayev] Finances are for the most part Azerbaijan's problem. We, too, can take part by providing technical assistance. We are interested in having the border patrolled by aviation. And, of course, the Caspian Sea. If we fail to draw a clear line there at this stage, say, Gasan-Kuli-Astafa, then there will be a free zone inside the sea and everyone will be able to set up rigs even outside Astrakhan. [Kholodov] And another "Putina" [anti-poaching operation launched this year in the Far East] will have to be launched? [Nikolayev] I do not think we will wait for a situation that has necessitated "Putina" in the Far East to come about. Starting the second half of May, or in June at the latest, we will start combating poaching in the Caspian, Black, Azov, and Barents Seas. [Kholodov] A global "Putina?" [Nikolayev] "Putina" is not at issue. For instance, in the Kaliningrad area there are contentious matters with regard to drawing our sea border with Lithuania. According to international law, it must be drawn perpendicularly to the coast. The Lithuanians interpret this provision in a different way. So, a divergence angle is emerging. There is oil and gas within the angle. Large deposits at that. Today we sent a joint note with the Foreign Ministry to notify the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry that our ships will carry out border protection there. They are protecting not only biological reserves -- fish or crabs, as "Putina" does -- but mineral resources as well. [Kholodov] As a matter of fact, the Baltic border has already become a legend. They say that Estonia ranks nearly first in the world in nonferrous metal exports that are taken out of Russia. Can't a stop be put to this? [Nikolayev] When a civilian says -- "Close the border" -- he should bear in mind that currently 1 km of it costs 1 billion rubles. As for the Baltics, we must have a tight border with them. [Kholodov] With dogs and a fence? [Nikolayev] I would not say so. The form will be different, but some sectors will be covered by artificial obstacles and radar equipment. The dogs will be there, too, because at present a dog virtually cannot be replaced with anything else. [Kholodov] But the Baltics, too, have once been a zone of Russian interests, haven't they? [Nikolayev] A zone of interests is not only where our troops are present on another state's territory. For instance, in Belarus we do not have our border guards at all. But there is an agreement whereby Belarus, represented by its border troops, undertook to ensure Russian interests on its western border. [passage omitted] [Kholodov] How do you see the future of the border troops? [Nikolayev] I see them as a civilian agency that will include a military structure. The military function will not be of key importance. The main thing will be cooperation -- in the protection of borders with neighbors, checkpoints, operational work, including the exposure of criminal groups. [Kholodov] Why shouldn't we set up a civilian agency at once? An agency that will include a customs service. After all, you are protecting the same thing -- the border -- aren't you? [Nikolayev] I think that in the long run, in 5-10 years or so, their convergence is possible. But this is not a mechanical process. This won't do -- you, you, and you will work together. In the customs service, they have a different area of expertise. Although -- in exceptional cases -- we sometimes do take over customs control. On the other hand, the struggle against smuggling. "Putina" -- the struggle against unauthorized fishing -- is a concern of the fisheries committee. But the committee does not have the money -- an entire fleet has to be deployed for this purpose. [Kholodov] Does it pay, I mean what you have already deployed there? [Nikolayev] It is even hard to estimate how much it pays. We are working for the long-term prospects -- to restore the reserves of salmon, crabs, and so forth. The border has to be protected anyway, whether they try to sneak in or not. But now we need to be economical -- we may well sell fishing licenses where the situation allows. I have told Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin -- people should see the results. We should earn money. It's no use striking an attitude of a dog in the manger -- neither eat ourselves nor let others eat.
