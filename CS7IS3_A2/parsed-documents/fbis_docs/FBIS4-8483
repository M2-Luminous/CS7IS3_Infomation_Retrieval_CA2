Talking to our correspondent at Otopeni International Airport, Dinu said that on that occasion he also held talks with Iraqi authorities regarding the payment of the debts owed by Iraq to Romania, which amount to $1.8 to 1.9 billion. The Iraqi party asserted that after the lifting of the [UN] embargo it will look for possible ways to pay its debts. Talks were also held to establish contacts between Romanian and Iraqi economic companies, while observing the UN Security Council resolutions. Dinu mentioned to our reporter that there are three other Romanian citizens held in Iraqi prisons, who were arrested for stealing. Diplomatic steps are being made to obtain the reduction of their prison terms, Dinu said, as Iraqi laws do not allow for the annulling of their punishment.
