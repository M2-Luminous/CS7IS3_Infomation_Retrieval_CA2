It will be conveying to the European Council Algeria's strong wish to build partnership relations that would bolster the existing cooperation between Algeria and the European Union [EU] and open several opportunities for exchanges awaiting the establishment of a free-trade zone, as is the case with Morocco and Tunisia. Here are more details from our reporter: [Correspondent] The delegation of European experts today ended its three-day tour in Algeria. The delegation held several working sessions with senior Algerian officials, the first of which took place yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where the delegation was received by Mohamed Salah Dembri, the minister of foreign affairs, and held a meeting with a delegation of Algerian experts led by the secretary general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Algerian delegation included representatives of vital sectors: industry, energy, trade, and agriculture. The meeting was aimed at reaching a partnership agreement between Algeria and the EU in various sectors prior to the establishment of a free-trade zone similar to those that the EU currently has with Algeria's neighbors, Tunisia and Morocco. These talks, which are considered exploratory in nature, were followed yesterday evening by meetings that included the finance minister, the minister of small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the governor of the Algerian Central Bank. The head of the delegation of European experts stressed that the EU gives Algeria all opportunities on an equal basis with its neighbors and the states of eastern Europe. He also said that the partnership agreement that the two sides are working on would allow for exchanges in various economic spheres. It is to be recalled that this round of talks will be followed by another round next autumn to finalize the partnership agreement that Algeria is seeking with the EU.
