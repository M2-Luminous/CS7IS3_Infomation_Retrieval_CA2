"Such statements are absurd," foreign intelligence spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis said. Dudayev said on Chechen television that following the failed attempt on his life, Russian secret services may stage a local nuclear blast. He also said that should this happen, they will then accuse the Chechen Republic, saying that it possesses a nuclear component.
