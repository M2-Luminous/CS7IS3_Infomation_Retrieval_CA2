I think it is necessary to determine where we are in agreement and where we are in disagreement. It is said that some want reform and others do not, and yet, when it comes time to talk about reform, everyone is in agreement. No one in the Sandinist Front disagrees with the internal reform of the Sandinist Front; if anyone does, let them say so, because no one has said anything about it so far. Who does not think there should be currents of opinion in the Sandinist Front? What happened in the true socialist countries? They forced party members to think in unison. You shouted in the town plaza, "National Directorate, give us your orders!" In other words, you had the same opinions as the National Directorate. Now you are beginning to doubt, to question, to agree; and this thing called doubt, questioning, and agreement is democracy, the real possibility for each of us to express our own views. The majority opinion should prevail, and that is what is called democracy. Therefore, we all agree on the need for political currents; that is another area of agreement. There is a framework for defining terms, and reference was made to it here. That framework is the program. The members of a party--and we are no exception--are members of the party to the extent that they agree on a program. Political Program What is our program? A framework of interpretations that has boundaries. We cannot go beyond the boundary if we want to be members of a party. Nevertheless, there are different shades of meaning and criteria in different subheadings that can only be reconciled by means of a political program. A draft revision of the program is now being discussed. It must be discussed, and once we approve it, it will be our guide. Those who agree with that program may be members of the Sandinist Front; those who do not, may not. This discussion should not be based on intrigue, invective, or even praise, but rather on political differences. What is contributing to these differences of opinion? People are promoting candidacies for elections to be held in the year 19-whatever, and the promotion of candidacies is causing individual alienation. Promoting candidacies at this juncture may be damaging, and in fact it has been. In large measure, the consequences of this individual alienation are reflected in what has happened in the last few days. This should be another point we can agree on. Candidacies for the National Directorate or the Sandinist Assembly should be promoted, not those for the presidency of Nicaragua or for deputy seats. Now, when we discuss who should be the candidate and how they should run, "we must think it over carefully." We are not going to nominate a candidate who will lose, but a candidate who will win. We must select the candidate who can assure us of victory at the time, but it must also be a candidate who shows respect for the revolutionary principles for which so much blood has been shed. Now, are there political contradictions within the Sandinist Front? Yes, there are. There always have been. They used to be resolved in the National Directorate. Sometimes we were not satisfied. There was a certain balance of power that favored some and hurt others; that was true, but differences were resolved within the National Directorate. If there are personal differences, we can resolve them through political discussion, and it will not be difficult to resolve personal differences. Are there ideological differences? Yes, there are. Is it legitimate or not that there are ideological differences? What is the framework of ideological differences within the Sandinist Front, and what are its parameters? Our ideological differences with the liberals, for example, are extremely clear. It is undoubtedly more difficult to delineate ideological differences within a party that claims to be revolutionary. There are revolutionary ideas and, apparently, ideas approximating social democracy. Sometimes, however, we succumb to subjective assessments and we call some people dogmatic and others social democratic. But where there is smoke, there is fire, and in this ideological reign there is smoke. If there are, perchance, social democratic tendencies in the Sandinist Front, we might ask, "What is social democracy?" Social democracy split off from revolutionary socialism in the last century, from the communist and socialist parties of the time. The social democrats said these parties were obsolete. They said we needed a profound reform, and we must also abandon political violence. We needed to give absolute priority to parliamentary debate. This contradiction between social democracy and revolution in the new conditions in the world leads us to ask, "Is social democracy moving toward revolutionary positions, or is social democracy moving toward liberalism?" Are there areas of agreement and disagreement between social democracy and revolution? Are there areas of agreement and disagreement between social democracy and liberalism? Where does social democracy fit on the ideological dial, on the left or on the right? [9 Feb p 11] [Text] It appears that there are center-left social democrats and center-right social democrats. Social democrats have a fascination with the semantics of the center; either they are center-left or center-right. If they are not left or right, we must conclude that they are in the center. So is the Sandinist Front social democratic or not? I would say that the Sandinist Front is not social democratic; the Sandinist Front is the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], with its own revolutionary ideas. But what happened, aside from stating that we are friends of social democrats, they have shown us solidarity and we are grateful to each and every party and to the Social Democratic International? I think that although we are friends, we are not social democrats. We have not been until now. But I say, what mistake did we make? We asked to join as full-fledged members of the Socialist International. The Socialist International is the organization that brings together all social democrats. Our rank and file did not like the idea. Nevertheless, we insisted on becoming full-fledged members of social democracy. In the end, and wisely, I think, the social democrats realized that we were not social democrats and did not accept our application for full membership; they left us as observers. They were wiser than we were. But what were the consequences of that? It led to confusion, and some sectors of the Sandinist Front felt encouraged to move closer ideologically to social democracy. Since 1979 this faction has always existed, and it never has had an opportunity to express itself. This situation has resulted, in my opinion, in a controversy that may lead us to make subjective judgments. Historically, social democracy was considered to be in the center. Social democracy has historically advocated moderation--they have called themselves moderates--and they have historically advocated the reform of dogmatic parties. They have called themselves reformers, regardless of the fact that we have all been in favor of reform in this party. Perhaps that is why they have claimed that label exclusively for themselves. Those who feel that they are reformers here do not think that others are. This situation must be discussed; we must ask our comrades to define their positions, because if they are social democrats or sympathize with social democracy, we are not going to expel them; they have a right to have their own ideas, just as others have the right to have other ideas. Reform and Controversy The prevailing ideas will be those of the Sandinist National Liberation Front. Within the context of these possible ideological differences, serious errors were made. The memory of fallen comrades was insulted, comrades who had always been respected in the ranks of the Sandinist Front. I am referring to Rogelio Ramirez, whom we knew personally, a comrade who shone with his own light, who served the Sandinist Front years before the social democrats became Sandinists. We must respect him, just as we must respect all comrades, and not just those who are dead but also those who are alive, but especially those who are dead. Sometimes the enemy makes up stories that we own businesses, motels, and this and that, and afterward everyone repeats the enemy's stories as if they were true, when they are made up to discredit the leaders of the revolution so that they will lose their authority. And if they lose their authority, the Sandinist Front deteriorates. It is legitimate, therefore, to have differences of opinion and to discuss them. We should not be afraid of differences. I am more afraid of homogeneity in opinions, because only sheep think the same way, perhaps because they do not think. And I was telling some comrades on the directorate, and I tell everyone, "What happens if I want to be the secretary general of the Sandinist Front and the congress says no? Will I go off and form another party?" What happens if I want to run for president of Nicaragua and the congress says no, and nominates someone else? Will I go off and form another party? Do I have the right to divide the Sandinist Front because my individual aspirations were not satisfied? And what is true for me is true for everyone. What do we want? To be deputies? To be political secretaries? To be secretary general, president of Nicaragua, or members of the FSLN? We cannot have the slightest doubt: We are members of the Sandinist National Liberation Front. No one can take that away from me, no sir, because we may not have the honor of being president--the person who is nominated for the presidency will have that honor--but the greatest honor for us is to be members of the Sandinist Front. And those who would leave the Sandinist Front because they are not chosen to run for the presidency or a high-ranking office, secretary general or deputy, let them leave. But they are turning their backs on the greatest honor we have as Nicaraguan revolutionaries: being members of the Sandinist National Liberation Front.
