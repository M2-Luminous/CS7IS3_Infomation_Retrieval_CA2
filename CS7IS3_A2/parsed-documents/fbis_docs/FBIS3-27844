Under the contract due to expire at the end of 1994, Toyota and Volkswagen have turned out Toyota's Hilux model and Volkswagen's Taro based on the Hilux at a Volkswagen factory in Hannover since 1989. Toyota said the extended contract will be valid until the currently produced models give way to new ones, but that it is not yet decided whether to extend it again after that time. The Hannover factory produced some 9,000 units last year and expects to keep production volume unchanged from last year's level in light of a weak European auto market.
