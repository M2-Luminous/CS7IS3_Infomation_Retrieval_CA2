According to Fujimori, the letter of intent to be signed with the IMF must contemplate the special emphasis the government will give to investment in the social area. He said: "Investment in the social area refers not only to investment in the fields of health and education, but also to improving the country's infrastructure, for example, by building highways." For this reason, we must hold discussions with the IMF, he said. He added: "I am sure the IMF will understand the government objectives because we have pointed them out very clearly." He said the first step was to implement an economic stabilization program, and the second step was to establish peace in the country. To implement these programs, however, "we also must seek social stabilization," as already has been explained to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus. Fujimori said the social program is supported by the IMF, cooperating countries, and international financial organizations. This is why we want these issues to be included in the letter of intent, he added. The Peruvian president made these comments on 16 March while visiting 1,400 members of the Ashaninka jungle tribe recently rescued from the Shining Path terrorist group at Satipo, in Peru's central jungle. Economy Minister Jorge Camet pointed out that the government plans to invest $450 million in the 1994 social support program. He added that the IMF fears this large amount of money may force the dollar rate down and reactivate inflation. A three-member IMF delegation arrived in Lima on 17 March to meet Fujimori and Camet. Spanish Jose Luis Ruiz, a member of the delegation who will stay in Peru for 15 days, said the delegation will analyze the structure of the expenditures to be made by the government in social programs.
