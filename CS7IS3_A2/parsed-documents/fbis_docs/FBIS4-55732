To remind you, this was the General Assembly which was convened to clarify the financial involvement of Sandor Hodi, the organization's deputy chairman, in the matter of receiving money from the Illyes Foundation, and where, at least seemingly, the wing led by [VMDK Chairman] Andras Agoston won the upper hand. According to a communique published in MAGYAR SZO of Ujvidek, the founding members of the new organization pledge to represent the real interests of Hungarians in Vojvodina. Their priority task is to unite the Hungarians in Vojvodina and to create the conditions for them to remain there. One of the participants in the founding session, Sandor Egresi, told the Ujvidek newspaper that there is a need for an interest protection organization which is not exclusive and which allows for different opinions. Among the members of the founding committee are hitherto VMDK leadership members and present and former parliamentary deputies such as Dr. Sandor Hodi, (Ferenc Csubela), and Dr. Zoltan Varga. They intend to hold the organization's founding session within a month.
