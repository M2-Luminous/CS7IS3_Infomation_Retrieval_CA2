Sechenov] [Abstract] Clinical trials were conducted with the polymeric adsorbent regenkur (previously designated tselosorb; weakly crosslinked cellulose ester) in the management of infected wounds. The patient cohort consisted of 60 men and women 20 to 80 years old with a variety of infected soft tissue wounds. Conventionally treated patients (42) with analogous lesions served as controls. The polymeric dressing was pretreated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and applied to wound surface in 2-3 mm thickness held in place by gauze. The number of changes per day varied from 3 to 14 for an average of 6.5. After 3 to 5 days (average 4.6 days) the experimental group showed significant reduction in bacterial wound contamination, followed by onset of granulation (4.3 days) and peripheral epithelialization (6.5 days). The duration of the hospital stay of the regenkur group was reduced by a third in comparison with the control patients. Thus, regenkur was shown to be an effective adsorbent promoting the removal of bacteria and exceeding the efficacy of the Swedish adsorbent debrizan [sic] (Pharmacia).
