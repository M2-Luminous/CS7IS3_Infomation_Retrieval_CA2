The very fact that the Serbs and the Romanians have never fought a war and that they have always had very good relations would be insufficient to describe the content of our wishes for the future, because what we expect from the development of our cooperation in the future, I hope will exceed by far our mutual very friendly and very good relations so far. The focus of our talks was, therefore, bilateral relations and I could say that there is literally not a single sphere of activity on which we did not agree regarding our future cooperation. In brief, our mutual relations could be described as very good, I would even say excellent, but we still expect them to continually and constantly improve. There are many mutual interests, as well as numerous reasons for that. A few minutes ago, President Iliescu mentioned some figures. These are our joint modest estimates of the possibilities for developing our cooperation. This is why it is absurd that presently we cannot realize much of that and improve the standard of living and our economies, because of the administrative measures and sanctions that represent an anachronism at the end of the 20th century, and which were unfortunately imposed by the countries that consider themselves to be more cultured and more civilized. However, I am convinced that life itself will bring down such an approach, which is not civilized and which runs counter to the basic laws of the modern world that is integrating and uniting itself, the world that is permeating itself. In other words, the world that is opposite to these processes will have to go where it belongs, into the inglorious past, and I hope, will do so very quickly. In any case, I am sure that regarding our country and friendly Romania, both sides will maximally contribute to this. There is no doubt, and this is something we jointly concluded today, that good mutual relations between our two countries represent an important factor of stability in this region. We rate our mutual cooperation very highly. We rate very highly the objective approach by Romania and President Iliescu to the problems of the Yugoslav crisis and believe that there is every reason for our cooperation in future to only improve and increase in the interest of both peoples and both countries, and in the interest of this part of Europe. We will leave Bucharest very satisfied with everything we heard and saw and we are convinced of the success of our mutual cooperation.

Mr. President, there are some speculations in the international press that the regular army of Yugoslavia is operating around Gorazde. Could you confirm these reports? [Milosevic] There are, of course, no Yugoslav army members outside the territory of Yugoslavia. The UN officials on the ground know that. However, the problem of Gorazde raises another question. We are undoubtedly talking about a fierce offensive by the Muslim forces from the so-called protected zone, which, according to the very definition of a protected zone, should be demilitarized. Therefore, one should raise a question of how this was possible at all, and whether it will finally become clear as to who is currently carrying out this offensive, and with what aim. Therefore, your question was well formulated when you said that there are some speculations. It is therefore correct that we are taking about speculations and not facts. [passage omitted] Regarding the question that was addressed to me, there is no doubt that the stands taken toward the Yugoslav crisis have seriously compromised the system of the United Nations and the international community, because the UN Charter itself obliges the United Nations to preserve the integrity of its member-states. In the case of Yugoslavia, and especially when it introduced the sanctions, the United Nations in fact acted in the opposite direction. It encouraged disintegration and secession, and punished and attacked those who wanted to preserve and save their country. The United Nations went even further than that. I think that one of the absurdities at the end of the 20th century will be the fact that a nation was accused of aggression on its own country. Therefore, one should not look for any logic, since there is no logic here. Everything that has been done was exclusively done according to the rule of the stronger. Peace will be established when the international community adopts the same, or at least an approximately equal stand toward all sides in the conflict, and when it at least modestly moves toward its main declared principle of non-partiality. As far as we are concerned, it would have been best if they had never gotten involved in it at all, because this involvement only harmed us. Regarding the direct question as to whether Romania is contributing to the improvement of this situation, my answer is affirmative. [Rodin, in Romanian with passage-by-passage translation into Serbo-Croatian] Michaela Rodin of AGENCE FRANCE-PRESS. Mr. Milosevic, were you prepared to support the agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, and would the Serbs join the federation? [Milosevic] A country's constitution and its setup are considered to be an expression of sovereignty of a nation in all countries. I personally do not believe much in the future of the creations nor constitutions that are imposed from outside. However, as far as I am personally concerned, I wish them all the luck. Regarding the Serbian people, they have gotten used to writing their own constitutions in the past and to decide on their own fate, and this will remain the case. We are a free people and this is the greatest value that we place before all other values.
