Izetbegovic spoke about the problem of lifting the arms embargo imposed on the legitimate Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. Being aware of the fact that it is really unlikely to expect the embargo to be lifted, Izetbegovic proposed to the U.S. senators that, instead of supplying the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government with arms, the Serb heavy weapons should be seized; this would represent the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 752. Senator Dole stressed that the condition for the United States to send its troops to Bosnia is attainment of a comprehensive peace solution. Dole also said that a fair peace in Bosnia must be restored, and therefore in his mind it is wrong to speak about the percentages of territory as the primary issue rather than about the principles of that peace. The U.S. senators brought to Sarajevo 750 kg of clothes, 3,000 pairs of children's shoes, and a larger quantity of toys, books, and medicines. The U.S. delegation has left Sarajevo for Normandy where it is to take part in the D-Day celebrations.
