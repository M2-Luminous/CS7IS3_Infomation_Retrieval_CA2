How would you explain this? [Ryurikov] Well you know, I can only say it was simply a matter of knowing how to negotiate, of using convincing arguments, finding the right tone at the right moment, and generally being well-skilled in the art of diplomacy. I think that for all these reasons our arguments were accepted this time. [Mikhailov] But there are still the Muslims and Croatians. What will they do now? [Ryurikov] We hope that they respond with goodwill gestures to the goodwill gesture. We also hope that our partners involved in the settlement of this conflict who work in close contact with them will ensure this in the same way as we did our work.
