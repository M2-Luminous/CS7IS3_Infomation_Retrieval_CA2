Deputy Benjamin Miguel of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) said today that Garcia Meza is quite "smart to do that ... to try to stain with his accusations many people who now appear to be democrats and respectful of the Constitution but who encouraged the military dictatorships." Garcia Meza, who was detained on 11 March by Brazilian police in Sao Paulo, said: "I am paying for the things others did and I will prove it." Deputy Miguel, who lived in exile during the Garcia Meza government, said, "the former dictator has nothing to lose" and he will try to get the greatest political advantage from his declarations before and after he is extradited to Bolivia. The La Paz morning daily HOY says in an editorial on 12 March that there is "fear of Garcia Meza," and that "this time the people are not the ones who are afraid of this character, but his old allies and Bolivian politicians who are about to get another bucket of water" from the former dictator. Juan del Granado, a lawyer in the civic lawsuit of the so-called "Trial of the Century" against Garcia Meza that lasted seven years, labeled the former dictator a "liar and forgetful." He said, however, that whatever Garcia Meza says will serve to open the case again against new people who were involved in the criminals acts committed by the former general. Miguel Urioste, leader of the Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) that is in the government coalition, said that "the two previous governments protected the former dictator" in reference to former President Victor Paz Estenssoro (1985-1989) and Jaime Paz Zamora (1989-1993). The first because it let him go and the second because it did not want to arrest him. Urioste added: "I hope Garcia Meza is man enough to accuse his accomplices, accessories, and protectors, and that the heads that must roll begin to roll." The MBL announced that it will propose in the next few days that the Constitution, Justice, and Judicial Police Committee of the Chamber of Deputies investigate the protection given to Garcia Meza by people linked to current Bolivian politics and diplomacy. Deputy Eduardo Paz of the opposition Conscience of the Fatherland (Condepa) said that all those who cooperated with the Garcia Meza government should be "unmasked." He supports any initiative to identify the former dictator's accessories during the five years he remained a fugitive from justice. According to a "confidential" report released by the local FIDES news agency, more than 100 people have covered up for Garcia Meza in Bolivia including soldiers, congressmen, close friends, relatives, and people who benefited in administrative and political positions during the de facto government from July 1980 to August 1981. The Bolivian Supreme Court sentenced Garcia Meza on 21 April 1993 to the stiffest sentence, 30 years in jail, for nine crimes of sedition, murder, malfeasance, and stealing government property.
