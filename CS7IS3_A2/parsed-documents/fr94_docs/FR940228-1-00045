Background The Medicare Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) program was established to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive medical care that meets professionally recognized standards. Section 1156 of the Social Security Act (the Act) sets forth specific statutory obligations imposed on practitioners and other persons to furnish necessary services meeting professionally recognized standards. The statute also authorizes the Secretary, based on a PRO's recommendation, to impose sanctions (exclusion from Medicare and any State health care program participation as defined under section 1128 of the Act or a monetary penalty) on those who fail to comply with the statutory obligations.
