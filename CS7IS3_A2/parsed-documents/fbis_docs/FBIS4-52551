The U.S. paper DEFENSE NEWS May 9, reporting this, said that this is designed to make a thrust without difficulty on the East Sea of Korea "in case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula. The Japan Defense Agency officials tried to find an excuse for this, saying that "part of the warships are being transferred because of a jam at Yokosuka Port", but military experts view that the transfer of the fleet was aimed at an easy access of the fleet of Japan to the East Sea waters of Korea in "the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula, the paper said. The paper disclosed that the Japanese Dietmen are expected to deliberate on an amendment to the "law on the Self-Defence Forces" allowing the deployment of Armed Forces on the Korean peninsula under the pretext of protecting the Japanese residents in South Korea in "the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula. The Japanese reactionaries are now steeped in the moves to stifle the DPRK in league with the United States over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, working hard to realise its design to stage a comeback to Korea.
