The main tasks of this session were to relay the guidelines of the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the standing committee meeting of the provincial party committee, to sum up and review the anticorruption work done in the previous stage, to study and arrange the 1994 anticorruption tasks, and to study ways for carrying out the anticorruption work in a sustained, profound, and effective manner. The session first relayed the guidelines of the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the standing committee meeting of the provincial party committee. On behalf of the standing committee of the provincial discipline inspection commission, Li Qinglin, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission, delivered the report work. In his report, Li Qinglin basically reviewed the province's anticorruption work done in 1993. He said: After the party Central Committee arranged the short-term anticorruption struggle last August, the party committees, governments, and discipline inspection and supervisory organs at various levels across the province adopted a resolute attitude toward the struggle against corruption, actively went into action, and made achievements in fulfilling the three tasks for opposing corruption. Some of the achievements were comparatively noticeable. The main indicators were as follows: Through self-investigations, the leading cadres corrected some existing problems. More than 24,000 cadres at or above the county and section level or 98.4 percent of the total cadres conducted self-investigation and self-correction in comparison with 13 prohibitions. As a result, more than 7,000 problems in 10 aspects were investigated, and more than 2,200 problems were corrected. A number of unlawful and undisciplined cases were investigated and handled. Last year, the discipline inspection and supervisory organs put 6,438 cases on file and investigated and concluded 6,343 cases or 98.5 percent. Of this, 13 cadres at the prefectural and department level and 305 county and section level were involved in these cases. Noticeable achievements were made in straightening out and correcting unhealthy trends. The province canceled more than 15,000 capital collection items and 40 abnormal touring parties that planned to go abroad, thus reducing more than 5 million yuan of expenses. Simultaneously, we also made better achievements in straightening out and correcting activities that party and government organs engaged in business and ran enterprises and the unhealthy trends within regions and trades. In regard to the 1994 anticorruption struggle tasks, Li Qinglin pointed out: In the first half of this year, we should grasp three tasks. First, by the end of May, the leading bodies at or above the county and section level should hold democratic activities with the main content of administrative honesty and self-discipline and make self-investigation and self-correction in comparison with the five new rules; and in June, they should report on and assess their democratic activities. Second, we should continue to solve the problems of wantonly collecting charges, going out of the country and the border to make trips with public funds, and party and government organs running enterprises and basically eliminate these problems by the end of June. Third, we should thoroughly investigate and know the real situation of leading cadres' sedan cars and private houses and party and government organs and their working personnel using enterprises' capital and being behind in repaying the money to enterprises. We should work out plans and relevant policies to eliminate the problems. In the latter half of the year, we should also grasp three tasks. We should make up the missed lessons for the leading bodies' democratic activities and assess the administrative honesty of key leading bodies. We should clear up leading cadres' sedan cars and private houses and the problems that leading cadres use enterprises' money and are behind in repaying money to enterprises and strive to make achievements by the end of this year. The key departments should set up, on a trial basis, the administrative honesty system. This year, we should attend to investigating and handling unlawful and undisciplined cases. Li Qinglin said: The 1994 anticorruption tasks are extremely arduous. We must further implement the responsibility system, strengthen the leadership over the struggle against corruption, expand the dynamics of the anticorruption work, exert efforts to deeply and effectively wage the struggle, strive to thoroughly eliminate corruption, pay attention to eliminating both root causes and symptoms of corruption, strengthen the media propaganda on the anticorruption work, and ensure a sustained, deep, and effective progress of the anticorruption struggle.
