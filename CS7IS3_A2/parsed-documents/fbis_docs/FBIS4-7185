[Kakizawa] I am Koji Kakizawa, and I was just appointed foreign minister. Although our cabinet is a minority coalition government, it embarks under difficult circumstances. I will work hard to fulfill my duties while maintaining teamwork and assisting Prime Minister Hata. The international situation is now undergoing profound changes, and there are many issues Japan is pressed to resolve. Japan has to repair soured relations with the United States and play a proper role in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan is also being asked to make broad-ranging contributions in various fields. I intend to work for Japan's aggressive role in maintaining world peace and promoting world prosperity. Breaking the deadlock over Japan-U.S. economic relations is one of the urgent issues. I also think Japan should fulfill its responsibility to clear up suspicions about North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and should cooperate with activities of the international community and the United Nations. Now that Japan's role in the international community is attracting world attention, I would like to make Japan a trustworthy and respectable country within the international community. At the same time, we should seek the people's understanding and should assist Prime Minister Hata. I would like to solicit your cooperation. [Unidentified correspondent] A major difference between Japan's foreign policy under the coalition government compared with that of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is that the coalition government candidly admitted Japan's responsibility for the past war. The coalition government has also apologized to South Korea for Japan's colonial rule. Minister Kakizawa, you served as parliamentary vice foreign minister under former Foreign Minister Watanabe. What do you think of the admittance and apology made by the coalition government? How are you going to deal with Japan's war history? [Kakizawa] In his policy speech to the Diet last August, former Prime Minister Hosokawa made a statement to that effect. With regard to Japan's acts of aggression against Asian nations and the pain the Koreans suffered under Japanese colonial rule, I share their pain and will do everything I can to address them, always keeping his statement in mind. [Unidentified correspondent] Kakizawa, you said on 18 April that you intended to back Michio Watanabe as prime minister. It has been said you quit the LDP in order to make Watanabe prime minister. What do you think of Watanabe now? It has been said you have been asked along with other LDP members to break away from the party on the promise you would be appointed foreign minister. Would you answer? [Kakizawa] Your question is totally groundless. I respect Watanabe as a politician in present political circles with profound perceptions and leadership. After Hosokawa announced his resignation as prime minister, I considered the need to rally politicians who share the same policies, forming a new cabinet that transcends the pro-LDP and anti-LDP framework. Forming such a cabinet will greatly serve to reconstruct politics and realign the political parties in Japan. With that belief in my mind, I have worked hard toward that end. Japan's second political reform and second realignment of the political parties is about to begin. I have formed the Liberal Party after concluding that I have to act now. From now on, together with my colleagues I will work toward realigning the political parties, not caring for the present framework of the political parties. [Unidentified correspondent] Minister, many people feel that the Hata cabinet is a minority coalition government and will be short-lived. What is your comment? [Kakizawa] As a minority coalition government, our cabinet will embark under difficult circumstances. Our cabinet has to handle the fiscal 1994 budget which is the backbone of our economic stimulus measures. It should do everything in its power to get the budget passed in the Diet. Both the ruling and opposition parties should cooperate with each other to pass the budget for the sake of the people. As foreign minister, I am not in charge of handling the budget, but as a member of the Hata cabinet I intend to work for the passage of the budget in the Diet while assisting the prime minister. [Unidentified correspondent] Minister, there is a view that it would be difficult to get the Diet to ratify an Uruguay Round accord on rice. What do you think? [Kakizawa] With regard to a set of accords hammered out at the Uruguay Round, former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata formally signed them in Marrakech. My understanding is that there will be domestic problems with putting those accords into effect. However, our cabinet will seek the people's understanding of Japan's commitment to fulfill its international promises while pursuing an agricultural policy that can open a bright future for farmers. I believe parliamentary ratification of the rice accord is a necessary process of building Japan into a nation that can live together with other nations. Our cabinet is ready to listen humbly to anyone's views.
