The United States shares with Pakistan the objective of nuclear nonproliferation in South Asian region. Talking to newsmen at Chaklala base before his departure for Europe, Mr. Talbott said Pakistan and the United States would pursue their approach toward nonproliferation in South Asian region and on a variety of subjects. He made it clear that the U.S. approach to nonproliferation was multidimensional. He said he has a great degree of optimism for achieving concrete results in the future that will serve the security and political interests of Pakistan. The foreign secretary, Mr. Najmuddin Sheikh, said there was no question of an agreement on nuclear nonproliferation, but discussions will continue in order to arrive at a mutually agreed approach. He said the two sides agreed that there should be capping, reduction, and elimination of nuclear weapons from South Asia as well as weapons of mass destruction. The foreign secretary said Pakistan explained its stand and position on the nuclear issue and Mr. Talbott certainly has a much clearer understanding of Pakistan's position.
