The EU Commission communicated this decision to the Federal Economics Ministry today, thus canceling previous rumors about a possible law suit for violating Article 95 of the European Coal and Steel Communities Treaty. On 18 May, the EU Commission had already informed the Economics Ministry that financial aid from the Eko-Stahl trustees would no longer be included in the restructuring concept controlled by the Italian Riva concern, which the EU Council of Ministers had approved last December. The Eko trustees are currently paying the steel plant 120 million German marks per month in order to preserve the plant's financial capability and prevent the interruption of investment projects hat have already started. At its 20 May meeting, the Eko-Stahl trustees council had pledged to continue the aid until at least 20 May. [passage omitted]
