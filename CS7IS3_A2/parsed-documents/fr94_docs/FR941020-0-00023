FR941020-0-00023 FR941020-0-00005 Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions [Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;001] Issued October 14, 1994. Hoecker, Commissioner, concurring in part and dissenting in part: I concur with the additional modifications and clarifications to the Commission's rules that are made in this order. However, for the reasons stated in my prior dissent in this proceeding, I believe retention of the reporting and records maintenance requirements for affiliated natural gas marketers is excessive and unnecessary, especially given the detailed standards of conduct to which they are subject. 1 1 III FERC Stats. and Regs. ¶30,997 (1994) at pp. 31,082&hyph;83. In particular, I previously expressed the concern I now see reflected in a number of the rehearing requests that elimination of a date to ``sunset'' these requirements ensures that they will continue in effect by sheer regulatory inertia. The original sunset date was a codification of a prior Commission's skepticism about the need for extensive regulation in this area. Elimination of that provision evinces a degree of comfort about the need to police affiliated gas marketers that I do not share. 2 2 The range of regulatory burdens retained in this docket appears doubly peculiar when compared to the less onerous reporting requirements the Commission has employed for the power marketing affiliates despite the absence of the kind of organizational separation or mandatory information-sharing requirements that we impose on gas pipeline marketing affiliates. See, e.g., Enron Power Marketing, Inc., 65 FERC ¶61,305 (1993), order on clarification and reh'g, 66 FERC ¶61,244 (1994), Heartland Energy Services, Inc., et al., 68 FERC ¶61,223 (1994) and Intercoast Power Marketing Company, 68 FERC ¶61,248 (1994). In addition, whereas power marketers are still in an early stage in their development where the potential for affiliate abuse is not generally understood, there have been few demonstrable problems with affiliated gas marketers over a significant period of time. I, therefore, continue to dissent in part. James J. Hoecker, Commissioner. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25994 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;P
