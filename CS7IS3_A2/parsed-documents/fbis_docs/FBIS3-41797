The figures issued by The Scottish Office show that no further deaths from the disease were reported during August, the cumulative total therefore remains at 284. In the UK the number of reported cases of AIDS has risen to 8001 - an increase of 159 over the July 1993 figures. The total number of deaths from the disease reached 5047 last month compared with 4893 in July. Of the 422 reported cases in Scotland 45 percent are related to sexual intercourse between men and 32 percent to injecting drug use. The comparable figures for the rest of the UK are 76 percent and three percent, respectively. Notes to News Editors 1. Details of the process of compiling this data and the categories used are available on request. 2. Epidemiological surveillance of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was begun at the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) in collaboration with the Communicable Diseases (Scotland) Unit (CD(S)U) in 1982. The figures announced today are the cumulative totals of cases reported. The case definitions of AIDS compiled by the US Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia are used for classifying and recording the UK case reports. 3. Because of the nature of the reporting system, the number of cases of AIDS reported each month does not accurately reflect the number of cases diagnosed during the period. 4. It should be noted however that in view of the long interval between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS, the trends of AIDS cases and deaths and their distribution between risk groups are not indicators of the current progress of spread of HIV infection. 5. News releases setting out the latest Scottish AIDS figures are issued by The Scottish Office Information Directorate at monthly intervals. Quarterly breakdowns of known HIV antibody positives are issued with the AIDS figures in the month which follows the quarter to which they refer.
