"The R.S.K. is ready for dialogue with the Croats on restoring the severed flow in the area of infrastructure," said R.S.K. foreign minister Slobodan Jarcevic in an interview to the Belgrade Daily POLITIKA on Friday. The Serbs proclaimed the R.S.K in 1991 in parts of Croatia in which they make up the majority population in response to Zagreb's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and attempts at reducing the status of the Serbs from a constituent people to one of a national minority. Croatia, which does not recognize the R.S.K., was trying by means of war to establish there its authority although the R.S.K was declared a U.N.-protected area in the spring of 1992. It was possible, for instance, to solve the question of water supply for the port city Zadar from the river Zrmanja, on the territory of the R.S.K., but the Croatian side should in return enable production of electrical power in the Obrovac power plant, explained Jarcevic. The R.S.K. authorities in his view, understood the problem of the Croats who were trying to restore traffic between the south and the north. This will be made possible, but in return most likely access to one of the Adriatic ports on the Croatian territory would be requested. "The Belgrade-Zagreb highway, the oil pipeline, the establishing of telephone links are in similar packages," said Jarvcevic. The R.S.K., he added understood the needs of the Croats, but at the same time set out that its own interests too were not to be overlooked. Jarcevic especially stressed that `no negotiations on the R.S.K. territory could be conducted apart from legitimate representatives of the R.S.K.' In view of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, the Geneva agreement between the F.R.Y. and Croatia did not prejudice the solution for the R.S.K. The Croatian Government decided Friday to restore in a few days telephone links with the F.R.Y. severed three years ago, it was announced in Zagreb. Normalization of telephone communication was possible within a period of two-three days, POLITIKA has learned at the Yugoslav postal services. The paper said linking of the electrical power lines between the F.R.Y. and Croatia could also be expected. These were severed in September 1991.
