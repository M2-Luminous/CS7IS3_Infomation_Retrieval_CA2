In this year's propaganda work, the CPC has particularly stressed the importance of stability, and this has been rare in recent years. Prior to these two sessions, the CPC held a "national propaganda and ideological work meeting," asking the localities to maintain unanimity with the Central Committee in propaganda work. Recently, it particularly urged the media to focus on "stability" when reporting on the two sessions, instead of providing news that might lead to social instability. The news to be banned from coverage includes: -- Inflation: Despite the CPC plan to control inflation below 10 percent this year, commodity prices in many big Chinese cities had increased by more than 20 percent in the first two months of this year. People are anticipating price increases, and many NPC and CPPCC deputies are concerned about price increases. With the principle of "stability overwhelming everything" in command, the CPC will not allow the media to report on inflation. -- Pay arrears: State-owned enterprises have suffered from losses for many consecutive years and many units have been unable to pay wages. Although the CPC has announced pay increases, many enterprises cannot even pay the pre-increase wages. In addition, some retired workers are earning small pensions, and their welfare and insurance have been abolished; this has caused resentment among medium- and low-wage earners. The CPC has instructed the media not discuss these problems, which might cause instability in society. -- Deterioration of social order: Social order is generally worsening in mainland cities and rural areas. Not long ago, looting of grain occurred in Hunan, and looting of oil happened in Shanghai. Social news is the favorite of the mainland media and the scale of coverage has increased. Therefore the CPC has restricted such coverage. -- New theoretical controversy: Last year, there was much controversy in mainland academic circles and among government officials over ownership rights and development rates. The CPC has urged the media not to discuss these unconcluded issues, and everything must proceed according to the decision of the 14th CPC National Congress. Moreover, the CPC also has instructed the media not to provide news on high consumption, waste and extravagance, or high educational fees, for fear of evoking resentment among low-wage earners. In addition, the CPC has urged the media to have confidence in the "combat against corruption" and to continue providing positive coverage. This year the CPC will introduce a number of reform measures that will involve the redistribution of major interests and may cause turbulence in society. Therefore in propaganda work the CPC will pay more attention to "stability" than the previous years, and will chant the slogan "stability must take precedence over everything."
