Approximately $350,000 is available in FY 1994 to support this project. It is expected that the award will be made on or about September 25, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a 5-year project period. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds. The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to assist, collaboratively with NAPWA, in strengthening effective HIV/AIDS prevention education programs at all levels throughout the United States and its territories; to prevent HIV transmission and effect, maintain, measure, and evaluate behavioral change among individuals whose behavior places them at risk of HIV infection; to increase access to prevention and early intervention services for HIV-infected persons in order to reduce risks of further transmission and to maintain the health of asymptomatic clients; and to increase collaboration and support among agencies, organizations, groups, and constituencies providing HIV prevention services. CDC will collaborate in providing consultation and technical assistance in planning, operating, and evaluating program activities. Specifically, CDC will work with NAPWA to: (1) Facilitate collaboration with State and local health departments and other national and community organizations to reach persons most at risk for HIV infection; (2) assist in the identification of HIV prevention education programs, policies, practices, and procedures that have been demonstrated to be effective; (3) facilitate efforts in the provision of technical assistance and training to organizations that are involved in HIV prevention community planning; (4) assist with the development of plans to evaluate all program activities and to interpret evaluation findings.
