The Czech Republic, which successfully sought to become a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, ought to prove that it is assuming its share of responsibility for the state of affairs in the world and that it is not ignoring any continent, Havel said. At the same time it is important to develop the widest possible friendly relations with India and Thailand, especially in the economic area in which many interesting prospect are coming into view, Havel said. He added that the foreign and finance ministers who would accompany him on his visit would also hold their "various talks." Havel mentioned his intent to stop over in Kuwait to meet the Kuwaiti Emir. Austria is known for its dislike of nuclear power but nuclear power is a world phenomenon and not a specific question of Temelin, Havel said, asked whether the Czech Republic has a moral right to complete the Temelin nuclear power plant in south Bohemia notwithstanding growing protests from Austria near whose border the plant is located. Havel said that he understood these protests. "Nonetheless they can hardly expect that the Czech Republic will stop completing Temelin given the current advanced state of construction," Havel said. He said that two things were important in this question -- first that the plant have the highest possible level of security and the second that a promise be fulfilled that after the station is put into operation the mining of brown coal in north Bohemia and the activity of thermal power stations, which have a devastating impact on the environment, are radically reduced. Regarding the assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party's invitation to Russian ultra nationalist and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic Havel said: "It is interesting that a party which presents itself as a very patriotic one is inviting a man who questions the Czech Republic's future existence." "Mr. Zhirinovskiy holds a diplomatic passport and he therefore can come to the Czech Republic anyway. Then it will be up to him what he will say here and whether or not our authorities will consider it appropriate to expel him eventually," Havel said. He said that the Foreign Ministry, having considered the situation, came to the conclusion: "If Zhirinovskiy comes let him come." Havel also directed his attention to the situation of non-profit organizations in democratic states. "There are very many non-profit organizations in democratic countries which are not and should not be fully state-owned but which are at the same time not of a commercial nature. And in the Czech Republic all this sphere has yet to be "covered with some umbrella law." He said that on Friday, when his broadcast was recorded he had an opportunity to touch on the topic in an informal talk with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. Havel said that organizations called partly-subsidized public organizations such as schools, hospitals, Czech Television, Czech Radio and others serve some public interest and the state thus is interested that they function and serve it. That is why the state is subsidizing them to a certain extent. "But these organizations should be separated from the state to a certain extent. They should have their own regulations of management and should not be bound with rigid ordinances," Havel said. However these organizations should not only comply with valid laws but also respect "the general will of the state." "Then there are other organizations -- cultural ones, such as theaters, museums, galleries... And also typically non-profit organizations such as various funds and foundations which are important because they ensure plurality in supporting public interests," Havel said, adding that tax relief is very important for the activity of these institutions. Havel said that according to the information he possessed two laws would probably be needed in this sphere. One would set down regulations for the activity of non-profit organizations and the other would define possibilities under which the current state-owned budget and subsidized organizations could be transferred into non-profit ones.
