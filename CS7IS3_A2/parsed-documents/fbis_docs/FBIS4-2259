Starting from this year, all salt producers and wholesale dealers are required to apply for licences, a State Council decision has said. This is aimed at checking shoddy and non-iodised salt on the market. An administrative department for the salt industry will be set up in the China Council of Light Industry to take charge of the work. In recent years, low-quality and non-iodised salt have emerged on the market, leading to a rise of Iodine Deficiency Diseases (IDD) in some areas of the country. The introduction of the system is expected to help the country realize its goal of eliminating IDD nationwide by the year 2000. China is one of the countries in the world with severe IDD prevalence.
