"Monetary policy must reflect that nation's economic conditions," Fujii told reporters and noted he had heard the U.S. rate hikes were "part of measures to prevent inflation." Citing Japan's yet-weak economy, Fujii said that he "believes the Bank of Japan will continue spreading (the effects) of low interest rates." The central bank has been guiding the key overnight call rate over past weeks to record lows through ample funding operations. The U.S. Federal Reserve board raised the official discount rate and its target federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage points Tuesday. The Fed in a statement said the hikes were "designed to maintain favorable trends in inflation and thereby sustain the economic expansion." Regarding currency rates, Fujii declined to comment on exchange levels, saying he is "quietly watching." The dollar remained lower despite the U.S. rate hike, with Tokyo dealers saying that the move was already factored in by the market. Speculation surfaced last week in exchange markets that the leading industrialized nations have made a secret accord to cooperate on credit policy in line with market interventions to boost the dollar. Germany's Bundesbank cut the key rate last week with other European central banks following suit, and the Bank of Japan continued sending short-term market rates lower. As expected, the U.S. Fed raised the key rate. Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other countries help the dollar rise.
