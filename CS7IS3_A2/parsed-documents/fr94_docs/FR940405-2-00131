FR940405-2-00131 FR940405-2-00048 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 32158 and Finance Docket No. 32305] Gateway Western Railway Company_Construction_St. Clair County, IL, et al.; Construction Exemption The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) hereby notifies all interested parties in this proceeding that SEA has prepared and made available a Supplemental Environmental Assessment (Supplemental EA) for the proceedings referenced above. The Gateway Western Railway Company (GWWR) and its subsidiary Gateway Eastern Railway Company (GWER) have petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission in separate pleadings for authority to construct and operate connecting tracks, among other related actions, in East St. Louis, St. Clair County, Illinois. If the proposed segments are constructed, (1) GWWR would have a direct and efficient route to the CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) interchange at Cone Yard in East St. Louis and (2) GWWR, in conjunction with GWER trackage rights, would have direct and efficient access to Consolidated Rail Corporation's (Conrail) Rose Lake Yard in East St. Louis. The construction and operation of these two new connections would eliminate GWWR's current circuitous routings to its CSXT and Conrail interchanges. The Supplemental EA will be available on April 5, 1994. There will be a 30-day comment period. Comments on the Supplemental EA are due May 5, 1994. To obtain copies of the Supplemental EA contact Ms. Judith Groves or Ms. Phillis Johnson-Ball, Interstate Commerce Commission, Section of Environmental Analysis, room 3219 Washington, DC 20423 at (202) 927&hyph;6245 or (202) 927&hyph;6213. By the Commission, Elaine K. Kaiser, Chief, Section of Environmental Analysis. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary.
