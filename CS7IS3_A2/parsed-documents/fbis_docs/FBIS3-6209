Thirty-two laws are related to deregulation in the economic field. They include the Foreign Trade Law, the Insurance Law and the Law on Farmland Ownership. Legislation Minister Pak Song-kyu reported to the weekly cabinet meeting yesterday that the Foreign Trade law will be revised to allow people to engage in international trade by simply reporting their business to the authorities.

He said his office has already handed in 15 bills to the National Assembly for consideration. It will seek the Assembly's approval for the other bills at the upcoming special or regular sessions.

The bill would form a fund for national health promotion using part of the profits from the sale of cigarettes, a government monopoly.
