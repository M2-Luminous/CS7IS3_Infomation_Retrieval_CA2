It essentially says that Russian and Ukrainian civil airliners are transporting arms from Syria to Armenia. The conclusion was drawn on the basis that Turkish Air Force technical devices have apparently registered the landing in Yerevan of airplanes which have not stopped over in Odessa and Sochi. But, as your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent was told at the Russian Federation Air Transportation Department, such flights are scarcely possible without the sanction of official aviation authorities. Admittedly, a lot of private air companies have appeared recently which do not come under the control of ministries or departments. Once they have licenses for international transportation, they practically cease to be supervised by state organs.
