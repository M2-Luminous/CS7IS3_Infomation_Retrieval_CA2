Sam Rangsi, in an interview with the CAMBODIA TIMES, said: "Contrary to common belief, it was not I who had initiated and implemented this system. It was already in place during the rule of the former State of Cambodia government. During that period, French experts had been based with the then government for almost three years to help them prepare the fundamentals of the French accounting system. It is not an entirely new system as many believe. The French accounting system to be implemented here is based on that devised in 1982, which is in conformity with many European accounting systems." [passage omitted] "The 1982 version is in uniformity with the accounting systems practised in Britain, Germany and Holland. It is just the presentation styles that are different. For example, in the British system, the cash balance is shown at the top of the accounting figures, while the fixed assets are at the bottom. In the French system, it is just the reverse. So there is no great difficulty in adapting or adopting this system," he pointed out. Several businessmen had criticised the adoption of the French accounting system as a disincentive to much needed foreign investment and an unnecessary administrative burden for the local companies. [passage omitted] The main difference between the French and Anglo-International system is the way assets and liabilities are classified and how depreciation is treated.
