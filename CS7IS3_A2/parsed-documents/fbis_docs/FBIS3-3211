On 3 March, representatives from northern and southern Korea resumed contacts between working representatives, and they sent special envoys to visit each other, which had been suspended for four months. The United States announced the resumption of the third round of high-level intergovernmental talks with the DPRK on 21 March and conditionally announced the suspension of this year's "Team Spirit" exercise. This series of dialogues and detente has thrown a new ray of hope on the tense and mutually confrontational Korean peninsula. The DPRK announced on 12 March 1993 that it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and decreed that the Korean people remained in a "state of semi-war." The United States and some Western countries then stated that they would impose sanctions on the DPRK. The DPRK, however, announced that international sanctions would mean a declaration of war against it. With the mediation of some countries, on 2 June, the DPRK and the United States held a high-level intergovernmental meeting, issued a joint declaration, and agreed on principles such as guaranteeing the non-use of nuclear weapons and of armed threats, establishing a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, that the DPRK and the United States should respect each other's sovereignty and not interfere in each other's internal affairs, and that the United States supports the reunification of Korea. This was the first document reached between the DPRK and the United States toward the normalization of relations since they stopped fighting 40 years ago. In view of the United States' promises, the DPRK announced that it would not withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty temporarily. In mid-July, the two sides held a second round of high-level intergovernmental talks where the United States promised to supply the DPRK with civilian nuclear technology in exchange for its acceptance of international nuclear inspections. Nevertheless, the two sides differed in opinion on the form and number of nuclear inspections with the result that the nuclear inspections could not proceed as scheduled. The two sides took opposing attitudes over this question and the situation became tense again. At working talks between DPRK and U.S. representatives in New York last October, the two sides discussed a "basket of proposals for the resolution of the nuclear issue." They included the question of official U.S. recognition of the DPRK and holding a third round of high-level intergovernmental talks. As planned, the third round of DPRK-U.S. intergovernmental talks should have begun in November or early December last year. But on 1 November, with the United States' insistence, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution demanding that the DPRK accept nuclear inspections. In mid-November, the ROK and the United States carried out joint military exercises. In the face of international pressure, the third round of DPRK-U.S. intergovernmental talks failed. In late December, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited the DPRK to mediate. On 29 December, the DPRK-U.S. working talks made progress. The United States stated that it would suspend South Korean-U.S. "Team Spirit" exercises in 1994 while the DPRK also agreed to accept "continuous" nuclear inspections. The two sides agreed to create conditions for a third round of DPRK-U.S. intergovernmental talks. In January, the United States sent nongovernmental personalities to visit the DPRK, and U.S. evangelist Billy Graham even passed a message from Clinton to Chairman Kim Il-song expressing willingness to make efforts to improve DPRK-U.S. relations. However, at the same time, the United States sent a team of intelligence experts to Seoul to step up monitoring of the DPRK. Moreover, it stated that it would deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK. On 25 February, an agreement issued by the DPRK and the United States announced that the two sides had reached an agreement. The United States announced that it had agreed to suspend "Team Spirit" exercises with the ROK, while the DPRK accepted continuous nuclear inspections intended to safeguard nuclear security. They also agreed to resume working contacts between northern and southern Korea, which is intended to facilitate the mutual dispatch of special envoys and holding a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks between high-ranking officials in Geneva on 21 March. We must see, however, that in announcing a date for a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and the suspension of the "Team Spirit" military exercises, the United States has attached conditions. These preconditions were absent from the original agreement reached between the DPRK and the United States. The United States also stated that if the international inspections were unsatisfactory, "Team Spirit" would be resumed. Observers maintain that in resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, they must have good faith or else agreements will become empty even if there are many more of them.
