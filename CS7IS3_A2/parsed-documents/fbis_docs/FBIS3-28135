"There are some differences," the official told KYODO news service, but declined to say whether progress was made. The official described the talks, which stuck to their 30-minute schedule, as "short and friendly." A finance ministry official, briefing reporters, described them as "serious." Kantor called the discussions "interesting" as he left the ministry, but declined further comment. The briefer said both sides agreed to instruct their negotiators to put more "efforts" into successfully concluding the bilateral trade framework talks before a February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. But he said Kantor made no demands for politicians to override the Japanese bureaucracy to forge an agreement. The briefer said both sides decided not to disclose further details of the talks. White house aide Bowman Cutter, who participated in the talks with Fujii, has publicly called for a decision on the thorny trade talks from someone with political responsibility. As Fujii greeted Kantor [words indistinct] early Thursday, Kantor responded, "We all welcome this as a step in the right direction." The U.S. Government has not had a chance to review all the details of the plan, he said, but added that Washington expects "continued steps" by Japan to boost domestic demand and promote global growth. Fujii said he expects the government will be able to formally announce its economic stimulus plan Thursday night, incorporating the tax plan, which links the cuts with a new 7 percent "national welfare tax" to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax. But the timing of the stimulus package appeared in doubt as the governing coalition's biggest member, the Social Democratic Party, has threatened to quit the coalition unless the tax plan is revised. Socialist officials said the party would decide whether to quit the coalition by the end of the day. Fujii laughingly noted to Kantor that the "political weather is bad" after Kantor mentioned Thursday's clear weather in Tokyo. Kantor responded that "the political weather is always difficult." During their meeting, the two did not discuss the Japanese political situation, the ministry briefer said.
