He said it was now important that nobody try with provocations to shatter a positive process which is the result of the initiative of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who already approved it three weeks ago. The essence of the initiative lies mainly in strengthening the security zone around Sarajevo but also in other Bosnian regions. Now this initiative crystalised in a clear and concrete form, Kozyrev said. He said that currently there existed the possibility for returning from unilateral to joint actions of the whole world community. He said Yeltsin was in direct contact with leading representatives of many states especially with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl with whom he had another detailed conversation today. Constant contacts are being preserved also with the foreign ministers, especially of Britain, the United States and Germany, Kozyrev said. He said that the possibility of joining some other countries is also being considered so that the chance offered by the Russian initiative is utilised. The process is not to be shattered by any provocations in the interests of strengthening it through far-reaching agreements on Sarajevo and on the whole of Bosnia. "At the beginning of the next week meetings of representatives of the foreign ministries or possibly foreign ministers themselves are being planned. Then it will be seen what to do next," Kozyrev said.
