At the conference, Premier Li Peng delivered a speech entitled: "Helping Poor Areas Through Development Is an Important Strategic Task." The conference, convened by the State Council, ended in Beijing today. Attending were Li Tieying, Zou Jiahua, Wen Jiabao, Li Guixian, Ismail Amat, Peng Peiyun, and Luo Gan. Also attending were leaders of democratic parties and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, including Li Peiyao, Feng Zhijun, Feng Kexu, Chen Xunli, Song Jinsheng, Lu Rongshu, Chen Mingshao, Cai Zimin, and Chen Jingxin. Today's conference was presided over by Chen Junsheng, head of the Leading Group for the Economic Development of Impoverished Areas under the State Council. At the conference, leaders of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities under the central government, including Yunnan, Xinjiang, Hebei, Shandong, Beijing, and Ningxia, made reports on their plans to implement the National Poverty Elimination Plan. In his speech, Jiang Zemin began by affirming the great historic achievements scored in assisting impoverished areas through promoting development since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. He said: The most important experience China has gained from its progress in poverty reduction is the establishment of a new aid-the-poor principle, shifting from merely relief aid to aiding poor areas by promoting social and economic development. Practice shows that aiding poor areas through social and economic development by heeding market demands, relying on the advancement of science and technology, exploiting local resources, and developing commodity production, will not only provide enough food and clothes for poverty-stricken people, but will also help them free themselves from poverty and become well-off. Thus, the principle of helping poor areas through social and economic development by combining state assistance to poor areas, and the self-reliant spirit and hard work of cadres and people in the impoverished areas, constitutes a fundamental change in this work; it is an important creation which must be continued for a long time to come. Jiang Zemin pointed out: We are still faced with arduous tasks in our effort to help poor areas. To solve the problem of providing sufficient food and clothes for 80 million people in the next seven years, the State Council has drawn up a national poverty elimination plan. This is a good plan. The key is that we must have the determination to tackle the problem and resolutely continue the work for a long time to come. Pointing out that it is necessary to further understand the importance of aiding poor areas through social and economic development, Jiang Zemin said: Elimination of poverty to realize common prosperity is required by the essence of socialism and is the embodiment of the superiority of socialism. In leading the people in making revolution and building socialism, the party aims at emancipating and developing productive forces to enable people to become prosperous. Since the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, we have allowed and encouraged some people and regions to become well-off first. The aim is that common prosperity can be achieved in a better way because people and regions which become well-off first will give an impetus to other people and other regions to strive for prosperity. In developing a socialist market economic structure, we should not only seek efficiency in resource allocation but also take into account the principle of fairness, that is, we should do better in adopting effective policies to assist impoverished areas. Jiang Zemin said: Elimination of poverty to realize common prosperity is required by reform and opening up to the outside world, and is also an important condition for maintaining stability. Development in various areas is uneven; some areas are developing fairly rapidly, while other are developing relatively slowly. This is unavoidable. However, in this process we must keep an eye on economic development in the impoverished areas and help them free themselves from poverty and become well- off, so as to achieve the goal of common prosperity. Pointing out that to resolutely carry out the work of assisting poor areas through development for a long time to come, party committees and governments at all levels must improve leadership over this work, Jiang Zemin said: Helping poor areas through development is not only an important economic task but also a political task concerning the masses -- which includes the building of material civilization as well as spiritual civilization. Party committees and governments at all levels should, as always, strengthen leadership over the work to aid poor areas. Jiang Zemin called on the principal leaders of party committees and governments at all levels to show concern for this work, attend to it, and regard it as an important means of caring for the masses' hardships and improving ties between the party and masses. He also called on them to make an overall plan, concentrate on tackling weaknesses, and make frequent visits to poor areas and nationality minority areas to help cadres and masses there solve practical problems. He said: Principal leaders should dispatch cadres, on a rotational basis, to poor areas to help with their work. Cadres should be selected from provincial, prefectural, and county organs, and sent to impoverished townships and villages to work there for a certain period of time. While there, they should publicize party policies among the masses, assist them in improving leading bodies, and help them find a way to free themselves from poverty and become well-off by bringing in professional personnel and technologies, and organizing them to develop explorative undertakings. Achievements in helping poor areas free themselves from poverty should be used as a criterion for evaluating and promoting county and township leading cadres. Jiang Zemin said: Party committees and governments should be good at mobilizing and organizing all sectors of society to bring about a new situation in the work of assisting poor areas. When conditions permit, state organs, the People' Liberation Army, the democratic parties, social organizations, and enterprises and institutions, should, as always, actively support and take part in the work of aiding poor areas to the best of their ability. In aiding poor areas, investment is necessary. Financial and other monetary departments should render their support by providing funds on preferential terms. They should also organize comparatively economically developed areas and underdeveloped areas to help one another in order to promote mutual benefit, common development, and common prosperity. Pointing out that it is necessary to give full play to the innovative spirit of self-reliance and hard work of cadres and masses in impoverished areas, Jiang Zemin said: It is absolutely necessary for the state to provide some assistance to impoverished areas and for all sectors of society to participate in helping these areas. However, in the final analysis, the poor areas should rely on themselves to solve the problem of food and clothing, and to free themselves from poverty and become well-off. This requires cadres and masses in impoverished areas combat adverse natural conditions and develop their economy by displaying the spirit of self-reliance and hard work. Difficulties can easily be overcome with a hard- working spirit. This spirit is our party's fine tradition and also constitutes our basic experience in helping poor areas become well- off. He stressed: While relying on our own efforts and working diligently, we should think of new ideas for helping poor areas through economic development. We should free ourselves from the fetters of traditional concepts and forces of habit, genuinely implement reform, open up to the outside world, and invigorate the economy. We should emancipate our minds and find the correct path. Many impoverished areas have suffered losses because they have not sufficiently emancipated their minds and have not sufficiently opened up ways to develop their economy. While their barren hills, slopes, and land still remain uncultivated, their surplus labor also remains idle. Excessive labor should be taken as an asset, not a burden. To do a good job in helping poor areas through development, it is necessary to exploit local resources. At the same time, labor should be exported in an organized and planned way. He said: Training professional people by adhering to the spirit of self- reliance and hard work is the key to success. It is necessary to transform this innovative spirit into a material force. Finally, it is necessary to rely on giving play to the wisdom and intelligence of laborers. Therefore, importance must be given to helping poor areas and developing intellectural resources by relying on science and education. At the same time, family planning must be carried out successfully. Jiang Zemin pointed out emphatically: Whether the innovative spirit of self-reliance and hard work can be carried forward depends, to a large extent, on how in touch leading bodies in poor areas are and how strong the basic organizations of these areas are. It is necessary to strengthen work in impoverished counties. In line with the needs of the work to assist impoverished areas through development, outstanding cadres who are capable, can endure hardships, and maintain close ties with the masses should be promoted to assume the posts of county party committee secretaries and county heads. Relative stability regarding these posts should be maintained. It is necessary to strengthen the organization of party branches in impoverished villages. A good experience has been learned from the work of assisting impoverished areas -- that is, "while providing relief in money and material, it is more important to build up a good party branch." Li Peng began his speech by stressing that it is the historical responsibility of the CPC and the government to assist poverty-stricken areas to change their undevelopment features through carrying out the plan to eliminate poverty by the year 2000. He pointed out: Solving the basic food and clothing problems of 80 million people in rural areas and assisting them to become comparatively well off during the next seven-year period are historical responsibilities which communists of this generation and people's governments at all levels must not evade. We must ensure the success of this major strategic plan, which has political as well as economic significance. Leading comrades of party committees and governments at all levels and persons in charge of all departments must consider this project as an important task, attend to it earnestly, and accomplish it according to schedule. Li Peng stressed: Implementing the plan to eliminate poverty by the year 2000 and assist poverty-stricken areas to develop their economy is a strategic measure for gradually reducing the differences between the eastern and western parts of China. He said: Over 80 percent of the nation's 80 million people -- for whom basic food and clothing problems have yet to be totally resolved -- live in central and western parts of China, with the majority living in southwest and northwest parts of China. In this sense, solving the basic food and clothing problems of people in impoverished areas and helping them shake off poverty and become comparatively well off is an issue of reducing the developmental differences between eastern and western parts of China. He said: Differences do exist objectively. While it is impossible to totally eliminate the differences within a short time owing to historical, natural, geographical, social, and economic factors, we must exert positive efforts to gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the differences. We uphold the policy of encouraging some people and some regions to become affluent ahead of others through honest labor and legitimate businesses and then guide and assist the less developed areas in development. This is for the purpose of achieving nationwide prosperity. If we all are poverty-stricken, then nobody is able to assist anybody. Only when some regions have developed first and have developed a stronger economic ability can they be in a position to assist the less developed areas. He said: We have accomplished a great deal of work in reducing differences and achieving common prosperity. From a vertical point of view, both developed areas and poverty-stricken areas are developing; and from a lateral point of view, the differences between poverty- stricken areas and developed areas are still widening. Thus, party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this problem and take effective measures to reduce the regional differences. The eight measures which Li Peng mentioned in his speech are: Encouraging the prosperous and developed coastal areas and the large and medium cities to guide and assist the poverty-stricken areas; the state will provide poverty-stricken areas with adequate financial and monetary support; the state will give poverty-stricken areas preferential treatment with regard to major construction projects; gradually rationalizing through reform the prices of raw and semi-finished materials and primary goods; improving the competence and scientific and technical proficiency of people in poverty-stricken areas; carrying out open, experimental aid-the-poor projects on the basis of carrying out developmental aid-the-poor programs; mobilizing people in all social quarters to support developmental and construction projects in poverty-stricken areas; and encouraging poverty-stricken areas to foster the spirit of self- reliance and arduous struggle. Li Peng stressed: To implement the plan to eliminate poverty by the year 2000, graduated responsibilities, especially responsibilities discharged by provincial governors, will be carried out under the centralized leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. This means that principal leading comrades of provincial party committees and provincial governments must be concerned with aid-the-poor programs and properly attend to these programs. One point must be clear: Provincial governors must take personal charge. Executing the plan for eliminating poverty and resolving the masses' basic food and clothing problems by the year 2000 is a systems engineering project involving economic activities of financial, banking, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, industrial, and commercial sectors as well as operations of departments in charge of culture, education, public health, and planned parenthood. Thus, the government must have an overall plan and make comprehensive arrangements. He pointed out: Whether this plan can be accomplished according to schedule so that the basic food and clothing problems in impoverished areas can be resolved is a specific target which leading cadres at various levels must meet to see whether or not they really do things which are in the interest of the people and whether or not they care for the plight of the people. When we judge the performance of a province, a region, or a city, we cannot simply look at its economic growth, we must also examine how good the results are, how fast the people's living conditions have been improved, and how the basic food and clothing problems in impoverished areas have been resolved. Leading comrades at various levels should not only pay attention to developed areas, but more importantly, we must show concern for the problems of the people in poverty-stricken areas. In accordance with the plan to eliminate poverty in poverty-stricken areas by the year 2000, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must draw up their individual plans. Moreover, they must check their progress and performance every year. By no means should efforts be slackened in the least. All government departments must continue to consider the fulfilment of aid-the-poor developmental programs as their own responsibility and draw up their respective aid-the-poor programs in accordance with the plan to eliminate poverty by the year 2000. Present at today's meeting were persons in charge of governments of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; and persons in charge of relevant central departments and committees.
