Rudyuk of the SibVO [Siberian Military District]: "The [Signal] Communications of an Artillery Battalion"] [Text] The specific nature of the combat tasks performed by a battalion of towed artillery has a significant impact on questions of organizing signal communications. I will consider how they should be organized today in optimal fashion, in my opinion, in order to provide for the reliable exchange of all types of information for the command and control of fire subunits in any situation. The command and control of batteries and platoons in a battalion, as a rule, is performed from tactical command posts [KNPs] (forward, lateral and fire-control point) by means of the issuance of oral combat orders, directives and commands. The latter are transmitted by radio and wireline communications channels, as well as with the aid of mobile and signals gear. Combat command and control vehicles (MBU) are deployed at all PUs [command posts] of a subunit to perform the tasks of communications: A 1V19 (battalion commander) at the adn [artillery battalion] KNP, a 1V111 (chief of staff) at the PUOD [battalion fire-control center], a 1V13 (battery commander) at the abatr [artillery battery] KNP, and a 1V110 (senior battery officer) at the abatr PUO [fire-control post]. An MBU has a radio set, cable, telephone gear, switchboards, data-transmission gear, devices for the automatic entry of data into a communications channel, a computer and other gear. The command and control squad of an adn also has a portable R-159 and several kilometers of P-274M, as well as more than ten TA-57s. Experience shows that reliable communications can be organized with the higher commander and staff, as well as with all elements of the order of battle of the battalion, using this hardware. Wireline Communications Wireline communications are widely employed in an artillery battalion in defense, at a staging area, and at firing positions occupied for the support of combined-arms subunits in an attack by them on the enemy's forward line. It should be kept in mind that wireline communications cannot be fully planned in the battalion and battery in the course of an offensive battle. In certain cases when the pace of the offensive is slowed and the firing positions (OP) are moved less often (when penetrating deeply echeloned enemy defenses, at lines of resistance, when repelling enemy counterstrikes and counterattacks, when forcing water obstacles etc.). However, this type of communications must also be established in the course of battle. It is important to recall here that wireline communications should be operating under any conditions between the fire-control post of an adn and the firing positions of an abatr. We will investigate one variation for the organization of such communications, proceeding from the assumption that the battalion has been attached to a motorized-rifle battalion that is operating in defense (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Diagram of wireline Communications employing wireline methods are established from the battalion KNP with the regimental KP [command post] (PAG [regimental artillery group]), the PUOD (adn staff), the KNPs of the batteries, the PNP [forward observation posts] (or BNP [lateral observation posts]) of the adn, and with the combined-arms subunit to which the battalion is attached or which it is supporting with fire. The communications with the commander and staff of the motorized-rifle regiment [msp], in accordance with the communications instructions of the msp staff, are planned and executed by the manpower and equipment of the regiment on a P-274M cable link. It runs from the US [communications center] of the msp KP to the US of the adn KNP. In certain cases, when the staff (PUOD) of the battalion is at the firing positions and when time and means are available, a separate link can be run from the US of the higher commander to the US of the fire-control post of the adn. A cable line laid from the US of the msp KP to the msb KNP is used as an alternative link of wireline communications with the higher commander or staff. Wireline communications are organized with elements of the battalion order of battle, with the heaquarters (PUOD) and PNP (BNP) of the adn and the KNP of the abatr by directive of the battalion staff, using the manpower and equipment of the command and control platoon on links run from the adn KNP US to the subunits by P-274M cable. If the line running to one of the batteries is damaged, the communications of the battalion commander with the subunit commander may be supported on the link between the msb KNP and the msr KNP that is maintained by the given abatr. The fire-control point of the adn also maintains communications with the firing positions of the batteries on links deployed using P-274M cable. This provides an opportunity for the battalion chief of staff [NSh] to have communications with the senior commanders of the abatr that are at the firing positions. The NSh can also maintain contact with the battery commanders through the adn KNP US or the firing batteries. The latter is accomplished using P-193M telephone switchboards in the MBU of the abatr senior commanders. The telephone gear of the adn commander must be linked through the P-193M switchboard with the communications lines running to the KNP of the batteries, which are in turn hooked up to the cable running to the firing positions, for centralized fire control. The transmission of commands directly to the abatr OP [firing positions] is possible here as well, by P-274M running between the KNP and the PUO of the battalion, and on lines going from the fire-control post to the POP [forward defensive positions] of the batteries. The circular connection of all operators (senior commanders of the abatr) with the battalion commander at the switchboard is executed for this purpose in the MBU of the chief of staff. The cable line from the KNP of a nearby battery with its firing position can also be used as a supplementary communications channel between the commander and the NSh of the adn. Wireline communications are established in a battery from its KNP with the firing positions, the fire-control post and the forward (or lateral) observation posts along P-274M cable links using the manpower and resources of the headquarters platoon of the battery. The communications line with the main OP is best laid with a back-up. P-274M must also be run to the parking location of the abatr prime movers from the POP. Wireline communications are provided by separate link using the manpower and resources of the artillerymen with the commanders of combined-arms subunits when their KNPs are placed apart. Radio Communications Recall that radio in the battalion remains the principal, and in some cases, the sole means of command and control of subunits of the adn and their fire and maneuver. The radio net is the most acceptable form of communications therein. Radio communications are employed in all types of battle. The stations, however, usually operate for receiving, and are turned on to transmit only when the wirelines are damaged. The operation of the radio without restrictions is permitted only with the start of preparation fire. When a battalion moves from a staging area to an OP, as well as when on the move in anticipation of battle, radio communications may be used to transmit brief signals on the passing of traffic-control lines or entry into a meeting engagement. One variation for the organization of a radio net in an adn composed in a manner that would permit stable fire control in the course of a battle without substantial changes in configuration is presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Diagram of radio The commander and staff of the battalion maintain communications with the commander and staff of the msp by shortwave radio net by periodically turning on their own sets in the net. Since the PUs of combined-arms and artillery commanders most often coincide, the radio net of the former may be used as alternative links. The communications of the adn commander with the regimental artillery chief is organized by USW radio net. The sets of the PUOD, commanders and senior commanders of the batteries, as well as the commanders of the mortar batteries of the regimental motorized-rifle battalions, can be included in it when there is centralized fire control. The adn commander, in a case where the battalion is part of a regimental artillery group, establishes communications with the PAG commander by including the R-123M in the radio net of the PAG commander. The adn NSh may also be tuned into it. The adn commander controls the battery commanders on his own USW radio net. It also includes the stations of the chief of staff (PUOD), battalion PNP (BNP) and abatr POP. The adn commander organizes communications with the chief of staff on a SW radio link. The chief of staff of an adn with an MBU provides for the direct fire control of the batteries. A special radio net for automatic data transmission using R-111 and R-123M sets is created for the transmission of data being processed with the aid of computer gear. Automatic receivers are established at the battery positions, and which receive commands from the MBU of the NSh, where there is a device for the automatic entry of information into the communications line. Communications with the artillery reconnaissance elements of the motorized-rifle division are accomplished by including the USW-band sets of the commander, NSh and PNP (BNP) of the battalion and the battery commanders in the corresponding radio net. Data from division artillery reconnaissance may be received right from a mobile command reconnaissance post or from a helicopter. A portable R-159 must be mounted in an Mi-2kr in the latter case. The command and control of adn reconnaissance elements is accomplished from the PRP-3 on the radio net of the battalion, using USW sets that are placed at the adn PNP or the abatr PNP (BNP). The communications of the commander of the motorized-rifle battalion and the artillery battalion are maintained by means of personal interchange when they have a joint KNP, or by the entry of the adn commander's R-123 into the radio net of the motorized-rifle battalion commander, as well as through an artillery officer who is at the motorized-rifle battalion KNP with his own set. The adn and tank subunits commanders interact using the radio net of the attached tanks. It may be composed of the sets of the commanders of the motorized-rifle battalion, the combat tanks and the battalion commander. Data on the weather situation is received on the radio nets of the senior commanders, by means of the inclusion in them of an R-326 and R-123M receiver at the PUOD and an R-123M at the battalion KNP. A USW radio net of the abatr commander is organized to control the fire of the battery and receive data from the PNP (BNP) on the results of the firing and fire correction by order of the adn staff. It is composed of the sets of the battery commander and the senior battery officer and the PNP (BNP). The radio net may in certain cases also include the gun commanders. The senior battery officer maintains contact with the commanders of the firing platoons on his USW radio net using R-147 radios. The R-147P receivers of the gun commanders are part of that as well. The discussions of the abatr commander and the motorized-rifle battalion are conducted, as a rule, through personal interchange. When they are not located together, radio communications between them are established through the commander of the headquarters platoon, who is located with a radio with the commander of the motorized-rifle company. The interaction of the commanders of the batteries and the tank subunit are best planned to be on the radio net of the abatr commander, through the PNP that is with the tank battle formations. Radio communications for interaction between the adn battery commanders are best accomplished on the radio net of the battalion commander, with the permission of the net control station or by mutual entry into the corresponding nets. Warning signals of enemy use of weapons of mass destruction are received on the radio net of the senior officer. Notification of subordinate subunits is provided on all operating radio nets and wireline communications lines, and is above all precedence. The command and control of the adn is performed by radio in the course of battle. The battalion commander moves in the MBU, the gear of which allows him to have solid communications with the senior commander and the battery commanders. He maintains communications with the higher headquarters, the commanders of the adn and abatr, the PNP (BNP) of the adn and the commander of the tank subunit attached to the motorized-rifle battalion. The battery commander's MBU moves at some distance from the motorized-rifle battalion commander's KNP in the dynamic of battle, and is in constant contact with him. If a company commander is moving in the foot formation, the abatr commander or headquarters platoon commander follows close behind him with the radio. I would note in conclusion that this article shows variations for radio and wireline communications, the utilization of which gives good results in practice in the command and control of an artillery battalion and the maintenance of continuous interaction with motorized-rifle and other subunits.
