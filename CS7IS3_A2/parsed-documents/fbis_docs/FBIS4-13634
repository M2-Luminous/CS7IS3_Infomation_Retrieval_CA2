The following is an excerpt of the news conference: [Begin recording] ['Arafat, in English] We are all doing our best to find a solution for this conflict. I don't want to say conflict, no, but it's a conflict between brothers. I am sure of that, especially with his excellency, Mr. Peres, with his goodwill, we can push forward the peace process. [Peres] So I think the unhappiness of Yugoslavia is different from the unhappiness in the Middle East, and furthermore, in Yugoslavia you have an aggressor and you have a victim. In the case of the Middle East you have two negotiators who are trying to put an end to the conflict. [end recording]
